hydrogeochemistry of the regions remains poorly understood mahdavi and mohseni saravi 2004 ardakanian 2004 the present investigation concerns the whole ardestan basin the main objectives are the identification of chemical processes that are responsible for the groundwater chemistry based on regional geology and water rock interaction 2 study area the ardestan basin with an area of approximately 4370 km2 is located in central iran fig 1 the basin is characterized by hills in the southern and northern parts slopping towards the central the highest elevation altitude in the hilly area is 1250 ms above mean sea level whereas the lowest altitude in the plains is 978 ms radfar 1999 the area has a hot temperate climate with mean maximum summer temperatures july of about 48 c and minimum winter temperatures january of 5 c and the climate of the study area is considered to be semi arid with the annual precipitation being approximately lower than 128 mm groundwater is an important water resource for drinking agricultural and industrial uses in the study area low precipitation and over exploitation of groundwater resources in recent years 2002 2013 have caused an extensive groundwater level decline 17 m in this plain prohibiting further development of the aquifer irimo 2017 in general the water level indicates a regime of groundwater flow towards the central part of the basin the water table is usually found within 79 m depths of the southern part in 23 m depths of the central part of the basin most of the study area is formed by quaternary alluvium that consists of gravel fans and terraces fig 1 the central part of the basin is commonly flat represented by salt evaporates of playa sediments pazand et al 2016 in the north and south of the area tertiary volcanic rocks including andesite rhyolite dacite tuff eocene age associated with limestone and conglomerate paleocene age are distributed volcanic rocks in the southern part of the basin were affected by granodiorite intrusions with post eocene age 3 materials and methods a total of 48 groundwater samples of spring 14 samples and wells 34 samples were collected during the period of june 2014 to july 2014 in the study area the geographical location of the sampling sites is shown in fig 1 the selected wells and springs are used for agricultural and domestic purposes the samples were collected and stored in 100 ml polyethylene bottles the bottles were rinsed several times with deionized water followed by three times with the groundwater to be sampled prior to their filling with groundwater samples to minimize the chance of any contamination the water samples of bore wells were collected after pumping out water for about 10 min to remove stagnant water from the well immediately after sampling ph eh dissolved oxygen concentration electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were measured in the field using a multi parameter portable meter hatch germany at each site the ph electrode was calibrated using two buffers merck germany that bracketed the measured ph and that was thermally equilibrated with the water sample the samples for the determination of metals were vacuum filtered through a 0 45 µm pore size membrane acidified to a final concentration of about 1 nitric acid titration techniques with hcl were used to analyze total alkalinity hco3 minor co3 2 chloride cl was determined by the standard agno3 titration method and sulfate so4 2 by spectrophotometric turbidimetry cations and other major and trace elements were measured by inductively coupled plasma and mass spectrometry icp ms in the filtered and acidified water samples within 2 weeks after sampling the analytical precision of the measurements of ions was determined by the ionic balances calculated as 100 cations anions cations anions which is generally within 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemical evaluation the chemical compositions of the groundwater sample were statistically analyzed and the results are given in table 1 results of chemical analyses show large variations in chemical compositions and also indicate high salinity of some groundwater samples the ph values in the study area ranges of 6 03 8 82 with a mean value of 7 44 and standard deviation of 0 51 indicating a weakly alkaline environment eh varies from 146 5 and 64 6 mv the relationship between eh and ph show that eh decreases with increasing ph this correlation probably indicates the progressive reduction of fe2 with deeper circulation associated with ph increase fig 2 the most soluble rocks such as limestone dolomite gypsum and halite are the principal source for ca2 mg2 na k co3 2 so4 2 and cl in the groundwater howsoever dispensation of major elements depends on the distance from the topography geology groundwater flow direction and other sources of contamination kim et al 2002 somay and gemici 2012 the ranges of na k ca2 and mg2 ions are wide 50 6 2428 0 21 29 27 7 77 1130 and 25 7988 mg l respectively among the anions the concentrations of cl ranged from 19 to 2631 8 mg l the so4 2 concentration varies from 1 to 2550 mg l while bicarbonate and carbonate values range of 4 382 2 and 1 4 151 5 mg l such wide ranges of solute concentrations suggest that multiple sources and or complex hydrochemical processes act to generate the chemical composition ahmed et al 2013 the concentrations of ca2 mg2 na and k represent on average 22 34 6 48 70 5 and 0 68 of all the cations respectively among the anions the concentrations of hco3 co3 2 cl and so4 2 represent on average 11 2 3 8 51 and 34 respectively thus the order for cation and anion abundance is na ca2 mg2 k and cl so4 2 hco3 co3 2 respectively the distribution of the minor ions is highly influenced by the geology silica constitutes the bulk of common rocks soils clays and sands and in water is in the form of its oxide silica sio2 or its hydrated form si oh 4 zhou et al 2013 the si has low concentration 0 02 29 5 mg l with a median value of 13 51 mg l in groundwater samples table 1 the mo se v and pb concentrations range from 0 8 to 17 5 0 1 35 5 1 48 7 and 1 90 µg l respectively the content of these metals is dependent on oxidation reduction condition of groundwater pazand 2014 the cu zn and cr concentrations are usually below the detection limits 0 1 µg l with maximum values 68 8 40 and 97 µg l respectively and concentrations of the as show variation between 0 5 296 6 µg l table 1 4 2 hydrochemical facies hydrochemical facies are a term used to describe the quantities of water differing with considering geochemical characteristics yang et al 2016 a convenient method to determine groundwater types is a ternary piper diagram which indicates the origin of groundwater and the source of their dissolved salts and explains the different processes affecting groundwater characters piper 1994 plotting the groundwater samples on the piper s diagram fig 3 shows that most of the hydrochemical facies in this area fall in the field of na cl type 36 samples 75 followed by ca mg cl 5 samples 10 5 ca mg so4 3 samples 6 2 and na hco3 cl 2 samples 4 1 the other two water types na hco3 and ca mg hco3 represent only 2 1 the distribution of samples concentrates on na and cl poles showing na cl type that is dominated in the most part of the studied area fig 4 4 3 source and processes identification a series of x y plots fig 5 has been attempted to assess relative abundances of major cationic and anionic species present in different water environments in the ardestan basin the na cl relationship has often been used to identify the mechanisms for acquiring salinity and saline intrusions in semi arid regions yang et al 2016 fig 5a shows the value of cl as a function of na in groundwater samples the na cl ratio is 1 in many samples indicating that weathering of silicate rocks such as granodiorite andesite rhyolite and tuff was the primary process responsible for the release of na into the groundwater meybeck 1987 most likely by feldspar weathering via a reaction such as 2naalsi3o4 9h2o 2h2co3 al2si3o5 oh 4 2na 2hco3 4h4sio4 in sample where na cl ratio is 1 the ion exchange and or evaporation were dominant process resulting in the addition of cl in the groundwater the chloro alkaline indices are suggested by schoeller 1977 which indicate the ion exchange between the groundwater and its host environment cai 1 cl na k cl cai 2 cl na k cl hco3 co3 2 no3 if ion exchanges with na and k in the groundwater and ca2 or mg2 occurs in the alluvium or rock both indices are positive he et al 2012 cai 1 was positive about all the groundwater samples fig 5b however cai 2 was negative in low salinity groundwater and positive in high salinity groundwater fig 4b indicating that cation exchanges often to happens to the high salinity groundwater na and k are relatively more abundant than alkaline earth ca2 mg2 among the major cations fig 5c reflecting the geochemical media the volcanic terrain weathering of these rocks results from the release of sodium and potassium from the k feldspars and plagioclase into the environment even though potassium has low mobility and remains associated with clay minerals silva filho et al 2009 the study of ca2 mg2 ratio also revealed that the dissolution of silicate minerals was one of the main processes that affect the chemical composition of the groundwater area fig 5d if the ratio ca2 mg2 1 dissolution of dolomite should occur whereas a higher ratio is indicative of the greater calcite contribution maya and loucks 1995 higher ca2 mg2 molar ratio 2 indicates an effect of silicate minerals on the groundwater chemistry which contribute calcium and magnesium to groundwater the groundwater samples have a ratio between 1 and 2 indicating dolomite dissolution chang and wang 2010 the plot of ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 will be close to the 1 1 line if the dissolutions of calcite dolomite and gypsum are the dominant reactions in a system the plot of ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 fig 5e shows that most of the data fall above and below the 1 1 trend line shows that in addition to silicate weathering basic dissolution of carbonate minerals may also participate to ca2 and mg2 enrichment in the waters kamtchueng et al 2016 the ca2 mg2 hco3 ratio is used to define the sources of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater fig 5f if ca2 mg2 and hco3 in waters are derived from carbonate minerals the ratio of ca2 mg2 hco3 should equal to 1 zhang et al 2015 fig 5f shows that most of the water samples clearly plot below the 1 1 line indicating has not same source and an excess of alkalinity in these waters is balanced by the alkalis na and k derived from silicate weathering to recognize the mechanisms for obtaining cation exchange and adsorption the ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 versus na cl ratio has often used if there is cation exchange and adsorption the point is close to the 1 1 line ca2 mg2 involvement in the process was corrected by subtracting hco3 so4 2 that would be derived from carbonate and silicate weathering na derived from aquifer matrix would be balanced by cl salt dissolution if these activities are eminent in the system slope should be 1 raju et al 2016 a high correlation was observed in fig 6 and slopes of the plot indicating that there are different degrees of cation exchange adsorption in ardestan basin gibbs plot gibbs 1970 represents anionic cl cl hco3 and cationic na na ca2 relations as a function of the tds that has the ability to provide information about the relative importance of the major natural mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry and is extensively used to assess the functional sources of dissolved chemical constituents such as precipitation dominance rock dominance and evaporation dominance fig 7 indicated that groundwater chemistry is mainly controlled by rock weathering and evaporation and precipitation 4 4 statistical approach of the groundwater chemistry the statistical relationships between dissolved elements through multivariate statistical techniques are used to explain the relationship between hydrochemical parameters classify the original data and geochemical data interpretation 4 4 1 factor analysis factor analysis is a useful statistical tool for the geochemical data interpretation by showing multivariate patterns and has been used to group data onto a simple structure to describe the relationship of geochemical variables liu et al 2003 silva filho et al 2009 pazand and pazand 2014 factor analysis was performed by the extraction method principal component analysis the rotation of the principal components was executed by the varimax method of kaiser normalization omo irabor et al 2008 three definite factors were obtained the communities for each variable variance percentage of each factor and the cumulative percent of variance are shown in table 2 the factors accounted for 98 35 of the total variance the factors indicate that different geochemical contributions are involved in the chemical characteristics of groundwater in the ardestan basin very strong factor loadings 0 70 are indicated with bold and underlined characters the strong ones between 0 70 and 0 50 in bold and the moderate factor loadings between 0 50 and 0 40 in italic and underlined characters table 2 the first factor which accounts for 82 12 of the total variance has very high loadings on the elements tds ec ca2 mg2 na and sr and moderate to high loadings of eh f bi co sn o2 and al this factor reveals that the ec and tds in the study area are mainly due to ca2 na and mg2 plays a substantial role in determining ec and tds it represents the weathering minerals from the underlying geology the higher contribution of na than ca2 is expected due to the influence of ion exchange with the clay redwan and abdel moenim 2015 it is evident that the role of ion exchanges with the development of salinization can lead to the release of na from clay minerals replacing ca2 that is present in groundwater redwan and abdel moenim 2015 the second factor explain 10 73 of total variance and includes with very high loading with cl and so4 2 and medium positive loadings the parameters of p and zn it represents the evaporation process and partially sulfates minerals dissolution factor 3 accounts for 5 5 of the total variance present significant and moderate positive loading with li ni se eh na cr cu pb sc and si whilst ph is included with the highest negative loading this factor accounts for a common source of these elements and the moderate positive loading of eh with negative factor loading with ph on these factors suggest utilization of anoxic condition on these element abandons into the system 4 5 water quality assessment groundwater quality assessment of the ardestan basin was carried out to determine its suitability in terms of domestic and agricultural purposes the analytical results of physical and chemical parameters of groundwater were compared with the standard guideline values as recommended by the world health organization 2011 for drinking and public health purposes 4 5 1 drinking water according to the who 2011 the range of desirable ph values of water prescribed for drinking purposes is 6 5 8 5 there are two samples of water with ph values outside of the optimal ranges these are samples 15 and 16 with ph values 6 21 and 6 03 respectively concerning the taste there is a relationship between the quality of the taste and the total amount of solids in solution very good 300 mg l good 300 600 mg l acceptable 600 900 mg l poor 900 1200 mg l and unacceptable 1200 mg l who 2011 only in 33 33 of samples tds concentration was acceptable fig 8 that are located in the southern part of the basin hardness of water depends mainly upon the amounts of divalent metallic cations of which ca2 and mg2 are the most abundant in groundwater hardness ht of groundwater was calculated using the following equation todd and mays 2005 ht 2 5ca2 4 1mg2 the degree of hardness in water is commonly based on the classification 0 75 soft 75 150 moderately hard 150 300 hard 300 very hard and hence groundwater of the study area is soft todd and mays 2005 groundwater exceeding the limit of 300 mg l caco3 is considered to be very hard sawyer et al 2003 the hardness values in water samples range of 46 9 3771 7 the average being 866 mg l in three of the samples 9 10 19 ht concentration was soft in two samples 48 and 47 was moderately hard and in others were hard and very hard fig 8 potassium concentration of groundwater ranges from 0 21 to 56 5 mg l all groundwater samples have lower k content than the acceptable limits 250 mg l for drinking water who 2011 according to the who 2011 the maximum acceptable level for so4 2 is 500 mg l that 15 samples no 23 21 47 1 14 7 26 8 18 15 4 6 45 34 and 24 has higher concentrations than it 2550 1800 1750 1700 1200 1060 980 960 900 590 580 560 550 530 and 510 mg l respectively the concentrations of ca2 in 10 samples no 26 15 20 33 28 32 39 38 40 and 45 are above the maximum acceptable levels 349 mg l for drinking water 1130 647 565 550 537 505 458 409 397 and 358 mg l respectively the maximum acceptable level for mg2 is 133 mg l and in 9 of samples no 40 26 43 11 45 35 20 38 and 32 concentration are above it 303 6 231 153 8 150 148 146 146 140 4 and 135 mg l respectively only in 3 samples no 26 20 and 18 have higher concentrations 2428 2046 and 1871 mg l of na than maximum acceptable level 3000 mg l fluoride concentrations in the samples ranged from 0 37 to 8 3 mg l and are above the who drinking water who 2011 guideline for f of 1 5 mg l only in 9 samples no 12 46 13 2 3 4 1 16 and 15 f concentration is below the guideline value concentration of cu 0 5 296 6 µg l in groundwater of the study area are above the who 2011 drinking water guideline for as of 10 µg l the very high as concentrations are observed in samples of 5 1 45 8 and 32 with as value 296 6 99 1 66 40 2 and 27 2 µg l respectively arsenic that form oxyanions are released from fe and mn oxides by desorption also as may release from the oxidation of organic matter by microorganisms during reduction of iron oxyhydroxides pazand and javanshir 2014 4 5 2 irrigation water sodium concentration is important when evaluating the assessing of groundwater for irrigation because it is a measure of alkali sodium hazard to agricultural products subramani et al 2005 high concentrations of na are distasteful to water because deflocculation damaging land and permeability of soils kumar et al 2007 in order to detect the suitability of groundwaters for irrigation uses the wilcox classification diagram 1955 in fig 9 has been used the sodium adsorption ratio sar which indicates the effect of relative cation concentration on na accumulation in the soil is used for evaluating the sodicity of irrigation water the sodicity hazard of water is generally described by the sar sar na ca mg 2 according to wilcox graph fig 9 water classes of water samples are mainly water classes of water samples are mainly c4 s3 31 c4 s4 25 c3 s3 17 c2 s1 15 c4 s2 4 c3 s1 1 c4 s1 1 c3 s2 1 and c3 s4 1 in c4 s3 class salinity is very high hence under normal circumstances is not suitable as irrigation water it can be used only on crops that are very salt tolerant and only if special practices are followed including provision for a high degree of harmful effects water may produce harmful levels of exchangeable sodium in most soils and will need special soil managements such as good drainage leaching and addition of organic matter sample of this class is located in central and eastern part of the study area in c2 s1 classes no 1 2 3 4 6 12 and 13 salinity is medium water can be used if a moderate amount of leaching occurs plants with moderate salt endurance can be grown the feature of another class of irrigation purposes is shown in table 3 5 conclusions the hydrogeochemical characteristics and the processes affecting the chemistry of groundwaters have been evaluated in ardestan basin central iran on the basis of major ion and trace element composition the results represent that the groundwater is weakly alkaline in nature with na and cl as the dominant cation and anion respectively the hydrochemical types na cl is the most dominant water type of the study area the overcoming factors controlling the water chemistry of the area are chemical weathering ion exchange and evaporation analysis of the distribution of factor scores shows that the groundwaters in the area were influenced by different geochemical processes gibbs plot suggest chemical weathering of rock forming minerals and evaporation are dominant factors controlling the groundwater chemistry factor 1 accounting for 82 12 of the total variance with a high positive loading of tds ec ca2 mg2 na and sr that indicated that the ec and tds in the study area are mainly due to ca2 na and mg2 plays a substantial role in determining ec and tds assessment of water samples according to exceeding the permissible limits prescribed by who for drinking purposes indicated that many of the groundwater in the study area is chemically unsuitable for drinking uses the groundwater of the area is affected by excess arsenic and fluoride content the salinity hazard is regarded as high with very high and special management for salinity control is required for groundwater samples these groundwaters cannot be used safely for irrigation

groundwater and the source of their dissolved salts and explains the different processes affecting groundwater characters piper 1994 plotting the groundwater samples on the piper s diagram fig 3 shows that most of the hydrochemical facies in this area fall in the field of na cl type 36 samples 75 followed by ca mg cl 5 samples 10 5 ca mg so4 3 samples 6 2 and na hco3 cl 2 samples 4 1 the other two water types na hco3 and ca mg hco3 represent only 2 1 the distribution of samples concentrates on na and cl poles showing na cl type that is dominated in the most part of the studied area fig 4 4 3 source and processes identification a series of x y plots fig 5 has been attempted to assess relative abundances of major cationic and anionic species present in different water environments in the ardestan basin the na cl relationship has often been used to identify the mechanisms for acquiring salinity and saline intrusions in semi arid regions yang et al 2016 fig 5a shows the value of cl as a function of na in groundwater samples the na cl ratio is 1 in many samples indicating that weathering of silicate rocks such as granodiorite andesite rhyolite and tuff was the primary process responsible for the release of na into the groundwater meybeck 1987 most likely by feldspar weathering via a reaction such as 2naalsi3o4 9h2o 2h2co3 al2si3o5 oh 4 2na 2hco3 4h4sio4 in sample where na cl ratio is 1 the ion exchange and or evaporation were dominant process resulting in the addition of cl in the groundwater the chloro alkaline indices are suggested by schoeller 1977 which indicate the ion exchange between the groundwater and its host environment cai 1 cl na k cl cai 2 cl na k cl hco3 co3 2 no3 if ion exchanges with na and k in the groundwater and ca2 or mg2 occurs in the alluvium or rock both indices are positive he et al 2012 cai 1 was positive about all the groundwater samples fig 5b however cai 2 was negative in low salinity groundwater and positive in high salinity groundwater fig 4b indicating that cation exchanges often to happens to the high salinity groundwater na and k are relatively more abundant than alkaline earth ca2 mg2 among the major cations fig 5c reflecting the geochemical media the volcanic terrain weathering of these rocks results from the release of sodium and potassium from the k feldspars and plagioclase into the environment even though potassium has low mobility and remains associated with clay minerals silva filho et al 2009 the study of ca2 mg2 ratio also revealed that the dissolution of silicate minerals was one of the main processes that affect the chemical composition of the groundwater area fig 5d if the ratio ca2 mg2 1 dissolution of dolomite should occur whereas a higher ratio is indicative of the greater calcite contribution maya and loucks 1995 higher ca2 mg2 molar ratio 2 indicates an effect of silicate minerals on the groundwater chemistry which contribute calcium and magnesium to groundwater the groundwater samples have a ratio between 1 and 2 indicating dolomite dissolution chang and wang 2010 the plot of ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 will be close to the 1 1 line if the dissolutions of calcite dolomite and gypsum are the dominant reactions in a system the plot of ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 fig 5e shows that most of the data fall above and below the 1 1 trend line shows that in addition to silicate weathering basic dissolution of carbonate minerals may also participate to ca2 and mg2 enrichment in the waters kamtchueng et al 2016 the ca2 mg2 hco3 ratio is used to define the sources of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater fig 5f if ca2 mg2 and hco3 in waters are derived from carbonate minerals the ratio of ca2 mg2 hco3 should equal to 1 zhang et al 2015 fig 5f shows that most of the water samples clearly plot below the 1 1 line indicating has not same source and an excess of alkalinity in these waters is balanced by the alkalis na and k derived from silicate weathering to recognize the mechanisms for obtaining cation exchange and adsorption the ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 versus na cl ratio has often used if there is cation exchange and adsorption the point is close to the 1 1 line ca2 mg2 involvement in the process was corrected by subtracting hco3 so4 2 that would be derived from carbonate and silicate weathering na derived from aquifer matrix would be balanced by cl salt dissolution if these activities are eminent in the system slope should be 1 raju et al 2016 a high correlation was observed in fig 6 and slopes of the plot indicating that there are different degrees of cation exchange adsorption in ardestan basin gibbs plot gibbs 1970 represents anionic cl cl hco3 and cationic na na ca2 relations as a function of the tds that has the ability to provide information about the relative importance of the major natural mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry and is extensively used to assess the functional sources of dissolved chemical constituents such as precipitation dominance rock dominance and evaporation dominance fig 7 indicated that groundwater chemistry is mainly controlled by rock weathering and evaporation and precipitation 4 4 statistical approach of the groundwater chemistry the statistical relationships between dissolved elements through multivariate statistical techniques are used to explain the relationship between hydrochemical parameters classify the original data and geochemical data interpretation 4 4 1 factor analysis factor analysis is a useful statistical tool for the geochemical data interpretation by showing multivariate patterns and has been used to group data onto a simple structure to describe the relationship of geochemical variables liu et al 2003 silva filho et al 2009 pazand and pazand 2014 factor analysis was performed by the extraction method principal component analysis the rotation of the principal components was executed by the varimax method of kaiser normalization omo irabor et al 2008 three definite factors were obtained the communities for each variable variance percentage of each factor and the cumulative percent of variance are shown in table 2 the factors accounted for 98 35 of the total variance the factors indicate that different geochemical contributions are involved in the chemical characteristics of groundwater in the ardestan basin very strong factor loadings 0 70 are indicated with bold and underlined characters the strong ones between 0 70 and 0 50 in bold and the moderate factor loadings between 0 50 and 0 40 in italic and underlined characters table 2 the first factor which accounts for 82 12 of the total variance has very high loadings on the elements tds ec ca2 mg2 na and sr and moderate to high loadings of eh f bi co sn o2 and al this factor reveals that the ec and tds in the study area are mainly due to ca2 na and mg2 plays a substantial role in determining ec and tds it represents the weathering minerals from the underlying geology the higher contribution of na than ca2 is expected due to the influence of ion exchange with the clay redwan and abdel moenim 2015 it is evident that the role of ion exchanges with the development of salinization can lead to the release of na from clay minerals replacing ca2 that is present in groundwater redwan and abdel moenim 2015 the second factor explain 10 73 of total variance and includes with very high loading with cl and so4 2 and medium positive loadings the parameters of p and zn it represents the evaporation process and partially sulfates minerals dissolution factor 3 accounts for 5 5 of the total variance present significant and moderate positive loading with li ni se eh na cr cu pb sc and si whilst ph is included with the highest negative loading this factor accounts for a common source of these elements and the moderate positive loading of eh with negative factor loading with ph on these factors suggest utilization of anoxic condition on these element abandons into the system 4 5 water quality assessment groundwater quality assessment of the ardestan basin was carried out to determine its suitability in terms of domestic and agricultural purposes the analytical results of physical and chemical parameters of groundwater were compared with the standard guideline values as recommended by the world health organization 2011 for drinking and public health purposes 4 5 1 drinking water according to the who 2011 the range of desirable ph values of water prescribed for drinking purposes is 6 5 8 5 there are two samples of water with ph values outside of the optimal ranges these are samples 15 and 16 with ph values 6 21 and 6 03 respectively concerning the taste there is a relationship between the quality of the taste and the total amount of solids in solution very good 300 mg l good 300 600 mg l acceptable 600 900 mg l poor 900 1200 mg l and unacceptable 1200 mg l who 2011 only in 33 33 of samples tds concentration was acceptable fig 8 that are located in the southern part of the basin hardness of water depends mainly upon the amounts of divalent metallic cations of which ca2 and mg2 are the most abundant in groundwater hardness ht of groundwater was calculated using the following equation todd and mays 2005 ht 2 5ca2 4 1mg2 the degree of hardness in water is commonly based on the classification 0 75 soft 75 150 moderately hard 150 300 hard 300 very hard and hence groundwater of the study area is soft todd and mays 2005 groundwater exceeding the limit of 300 mg l caco3 is considered to be very hard sawyer et al 2003 the hardness values in water samples range of 46 9 3771 7 the average being 866 mg l in three of the samples 9 10 19 ht concentration was soft in two samples 48 and 47 was moderately hard and in others were hard and very hard fig 8 potassium concentration of groundwater ranges from 0 21 to 56 5 mg l all groundwater samples have lower k content than the acceptable limits 250 mg l for drinking water who 2011 according to the who 2011 the maximum acceptable level for so4 2 is 500 mg l that 15 samples no 23 21 47 1 14 7 26 8 18 15 4 6 45 34 and 24 has higher concentrations than it 2550 1800 1750 1700 1200 1060 980 960 900 590 580 560 550 530 and 510 mg l respectively the concentrations of ca2 in 10 samples no 26 15 20 33 28 32 39 38 40 and 45 are above the maximum acceptable levels 349 mg l for drinking water 1130 647 565 550 537 505 458 409 397 and 358 mg l respectively the maximum acceptable level for mg2 is 133 mg l and in 9 of samples no 40 26 43 11 45 35 20 38 and 32 concentration are above it 303 6 231 153 8 150 148 146 146 140 4 and 135 mg l respectively only in 3 samples no 26 20 and 18 have higher concentrations 2428 2046 and 1871 mg l of na than maximum acceptable level 3000 mg l fluoride concentrations in the samples ranged from 0 37 to 8 3 mg l and are above the who drinking water who 2011 guideline for f of 1 5 mg l only in 9 samples no 12 46 13 2 3 4 1 16 and 15 f concentration is below the guideline value concentration of cu 0 5 296 6 µg l in groundwater of the study area are above the who 2011 drinking water guideline for as of 10 µg l the very high as concentrations are observed in samples of 5 1 45 8 and 32 with as value 296 6 99 1 66 40 2 and 27 2 µg l respectively arsenic that form oxyanions are released from fe and mn oxides by desorption also as may release from the oxidation of organic matter by microorganisms during reduction of iron oxyhydroxides pazand and javanshir 2014 4 5 2 irrigation water sodium concentration is important when evaluating the assessing of groundwater for irrigation because it is a measure of alkali sodium hazard to agricultural products subramani et al 2005 high concentrations of na are distasteful to water because deflocculation damaging land and permeability of soils kumar et al 2007 in order to detect the suitability of groundwaters for irrigation uses the wilcox classification diagram 1955 in fig 9 has been used the sodium adsorption ratio sar which indicates the effect of relative cation concentration on na accumulation in the soil is used for evaluating the sodicity of irrigation water the sodicity hazard of water is generally described by the sar sar na ca mg 2 according to wilcox graph fig 9 water classes of water samples are mainly water classes of water samples are mainly c4 s3 31 c4 s4 25 c3 s3 17 c2 s1 15 c4 s2 4 c3 s1 1 c4 s1 1 c3 s2 1 and c3 s4 1 in c4 s3 class salinity is very high hence under normal circumstances is not suitable as irrigation water it can be used only on crops that are very salt tolerant and only if special practices are followed including provision for a high degree of harmful effects water may produce harmful levels of exchangeable sodium in most soils and will need special soil managements such as good drainage leaching and addition of organic matter sample of this class is located in central and eastern part of the study area in c2 s1 classes no 1 2 3 4 6 12 and 13 salinity is medium water can be used if a moderate amount of leaching occurs plants with moderate salt endurance can be grown the feature of another class of irrigation purposes is shown in table 3 5 conclusions the hydrogeochemical characteristics and the processes affecting the chemistry of groundwaters have been evaluated in ardestan basin central iran on the basis of major ion and trace element composition the results represent that the groundwater is weakly alkaline in nature with na and cl as the dominant cation and anion respectively the hydrochemical types na cl is the most dominant water type of the study area the overcoming factors controlling the water chemistry of the area are chemical weathering ion exchange and evaporation analysis of the distribution of factor scores shows that the groundwaters in the area were influenced by different geochemical processes gibbs plot suggest chemical weathering of rock forming minerals and evaporation are dominant factors controlling the groundwater chemistry factor 1 accounting for 82 12 of the total variance with a high positive loading of tds ec ca2 mg2 na and sr that indicated that the ec and tds in the study area are mainly due to ca2 na and mg2 plays a substantial role in determining ec and tds assessment of water samples according to exceeding the permissible limits prescribed by who for drinking purposes indicated that many of the groundwater in the study area is chemically unsuitable for drinking uses the groundwater of the area is affected by excess arsenic and fluoride content the salinity hazard is regarded as high with very high and special management for salinity control is required for groundwater samples these groundwaters cannot be used safely for irrigation 
12391,in this work removal of methylene blue mb dye from aqueous solution by natural clay of agadir region was carried the parameters influencing the adsorption of mb such as contact time 20 120 min adsorbent dose 0 4 4 g l 1 initial dye concentration 100 900 mg l 1 temperature 22 60 c and ph of the solution 3 10 were studied the obtained results showed that the adsorption of mb onto clay is strongly dependent on the temperature the initial dye concentration and the ph of the solution the kinetic study indicated that the adsorption of mb on the clay was well adapted to the pseudo second order kinetic with a correlation coefficient r2 1 langmuir model described better the adsorption of mb with a maximum adsorption capacity of 322 58 mg g 1 the thermodynamic study suggested that the adsorption of cationic dye is physisorption spontaneous and endothermic desorption and regeneration studies showed that the studied support can be considered as an effective regenerable and reuse adsorption material graphical abstract fx1 keywords methylene blue clay cationic dye kinetic study adsorption isotherms 1 introduction synthetic dyes are used extensively in many industrial sectors such as food textile paper rubber plastics cosmetics and pharmaceutical ai et al 2011 moussavi and mahmoudi 2009 these industries discharged large quantities of wastewater into waterways no previous treatment these discharges constitute a very important source of pollution and lead to the deterioration human and environmental health tiwari et al 2013 the protection of environments and the improvement of water quality by the removal of colorants from industrial effluents have become more and more severe in recent years in this context several processes have been used for the purpose of water decontamination including adsorption coagulation flocculation advanced oxidation processes ozonation membrane filtration and biological treatment fatimah et al 2011 peng et al 2013 cottet et al 2014 these methods are effective but in most cases they are very onerous among them adsorption remains the most efficient methods used for water decontamination due to it is low cost not destructive flexibility simplicity ease of operation insensitivity to toxic substances lack of interaction with toxic substances and readily available tiwari et al 2013 rafatullah et al 2010 forgacs et al 2004 srinivasan and viraraghavan 2010 ahmad and kumar 2010 garg et al 2004 singh et al 2009 the use of activated carbon in the adsorption process is highly demanded because the activated carbon has a high adsorption capacity essentially due to a large specific surface but this process remains very expensive due to its high cost of manufacturing and regeneration which limits his use in many developing countries and onerous lin et al 2014 duman and ayranci 2010 it has also become necessary to have cheap and efficient alternative materials which are capable of simultaneously removing organic and inorganic pollutants clays could be interesting adsorbent materials for the adsorption of various pollutants for reason of their high surface area porosity thermal stability specific active sites high cation exchange capacity easy availability and attractive adsorptive properties laszlo 1987 tanabe and holderich 1999 varma 2002 in this work we chose methylene blue as a cationic dye model to test the adsorbent power of our natural clay fig 1 methylene blue also is known as methylthioninium chloride is very used in medicine pharmaceutics dye industry and analytical chemistry the molecular formula c16h18cln3s 3h2o a molar mass of 373 90 g mol 1 and a maximum absorbance is equal 661 nm scheme 1 this dye is toxic and causes shock cyanosis jaundice and tissue necrosis kumar and kumaran 2005 el ashtoukhy and fouad 2015 the objective of this work is to study all the parameters influencing in the removal of the methylene blue onto natural clay of the agadir region in the south of morocco also to valorize the studied material for use in wastewater treatment as an alternative low cost eco friendly adsorbent and re usable several times 2 material and methods 2 1 materials the natural clay was collected from agadir region south morocco and was crushed in two steps the jaw crusher which permits to obtain the fragments with a diameter 1 cm the tungsten mill which makes the fragments previously crushed by the jaw crusher in powder this powder was sieved to obtain fragments with a diameter 50 µm bentahar et al 2015 2 2 characterization our support has been characterized by xrd ftir bet sem and edxs the results obtained have been published in our previous works bentahar et al 2015 2016 the analysis of xrd shows the existence of two phases the dolomite majority phase and silica the minority phase compared with the dolomite the ftir spectrum indicates the presence of the characteristics bands of the silica the hydroxyl group oh and the deformation of h2o molecules adsorbed between the layers the sem images indicate that the morphology is uniform and consists of grains which are characterized by the presence of cavities and pores at the surface the local analysis by edxs is relatively in good agreement with the nominal composition of the clay phase obtained by x ray diffraction the specific surface area was determined by the brunauer emmet teller bet it is equal to 76 971 m2 g 1 2 3 batch studies the adsorption of methylene blue onto the natural clay was carried out in a batch system all the parameters influencing the removal of mb on the clay were studied such as adsorbent dose contact time initial dye concentration temperature and ph of the solution the adsorption was carried out in a thermostatic bath by adding 0 05 g of our support to 50 ml of a mb solution at different initial concentrations the mixture is stirred at a desired temperature and ph for varying periods ph is adjusted by adding a few drops of hcl 0 1 m and naoh 0 1 m after each experiment the solution is centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min the mb concentration is determined by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 661 nm λ max for mb by uv vis spectrophotometer techcomp uv2300 the adsorbed amount at equilibrium was calculated by the following eq 1 1 q e c 0 c eq m v where qe mg g 1 is the amount of the mb adsorbed on the absorbent c0 mg l 1 is the initial concentration of mb ce mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration of mb v l is the volume of the solution used and m g is the mass of absorbent used 2 4 data evaluation 2 4 1 adsorption kinetics in this study we focused on two kinetic models commonly used namely pseudo first order and pseudo second order these models are particularly easy and have good ability to describe the adsorption the pseudo first order model lagergren 1898 dai et al 2011 toor and jin 2012 is based on a linear relationship between the amounts of solute attached to the material surface over time several authors have used this irreversible kinetic model to describe the adsorption of organic and inorganic solutes on heterogeneous surfaces it is represented by eq 2 özcan et al 2009 2 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t the pseudo second order kinetics models dai et al 2011 mckay and ho 1999 ho and mckay 2000 behnamfard and salarirad 2009 rudzinski and plazinski 2009 have been developed to approximate as much as possible the real reaction mechanism it is expressed by eq 3 3 dq t dt k 2 q e q t 2 where qe and qt are the amounts of mb molecules adsorbed mg g 1 on the natural clay at equilibrium and at time t respectively and k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 are the pseudo first and pseudo second order rate constants respectively 2 4 2 adsorption isotherms several adsorption isotherm models have been developed by different researchers to predict validity of the experimental data the most commonly used are langmuir 1918 freundlich 1906 and temkin and pyzhev 1940 langmuir model assumes that the maximum adsorption corresponds to monolayer coverage of the adsorbent surface that the adsorption sites are homogeneous and also the adsorbed molecules do not exhibit interactions between them özcan et al 2009 saeed et al 2010 the linear form of the langmuir equation is given by the following eq 4 4 c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m where ce mg l 1 qe mg g 1 qm mg g 1 et kl l mg 1 are the equilibrium concentration of the dye the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium the maximum adsorption capacity and the langmuir constant the essential characteristics of the langmuir isotherm can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless separation factor rl hall et al 1996 parida and pradhan 2010 which is defined by eq 5 5 r l 1 1 k l c 0 freundlich isotherm admits the existence of an interaction between adsorbed molecules and that the adsorption of adsorbate has taken place on a heterogeneous surface with a non uniform distribution of the heat of adsorption özcan et al 2009 it is represented by the following eq 6 6 lnq e ln k f ln c e n where ce mg l 1 qe mg g 1 kf mg g 1 l mg 1 1 n and n represent the equilibrium concentration the amount adsorbed the freundlich isotherm constant related to adsorption intensity respectively wang et al 2011 the n value indicated the favorability of adsorption process the adsorption is favorable if the values of n 1 and it is unfavorable if n 1 treybal 1968 poots et al 1978 ho and mckay 1998 isa et al 2007 temkin isotherm assumes that the heat of adsorption of all molecules decreases linearly with coverage due to adsorbate adsorbent interactions temkin and pyzhev 1940 the temkin isotherm is represented by the following eq 7 7 q e b l n k t b l n c e where b is a constant related to the heat of adsorption j mol 1 and kt is the temkin isotherm constant l mg 1 2 4 3 thermodynamic study thermodynamic parameters such as change in free energy δg j mole 1 enthalpy δh j mole 1 and entropy δs j k 1 mole 1 were calculated to determine the nature of the adsorption of mb onto natural clay using the following eqs 8 10 salam 2013 yang and al duri 2005 kumar et al 2009 hameed and ahmad 2009 8 k d c ads c e 9 δ g 0 r t l n k d 10 δ g 0 δ h t δ s where ce mg g 1 cads mg l 1 kd r and t are the liquid phase concentration at equilibrium the solid phase concentration at equilibrium the distribution coefficient the gas constant and absolute temperature respectively the values of δh and δs were calculated from the slopes and intercepts of the plots of ln kd vs 1 t figure not shown 3 results and discussion 3 1 contact time effect the contact time required to reach the methylene blue adsorption equilibrium on the natural clay is determined by varying the contact time between 20 and 120 min with an adsorbent dose of 1 g l 1 an initial dye concentration of 100 mg l 1 at room temperature and initial ph of the dye solution the obtained results are illustrated in fig 2 the adsorbed amount of methylene blue increases rapidly in the first twenty minutes of contact to reach 96 38 mg g 1 fast step after it slowed until reaching equilibrium with a quantity of the order of 98 12 mg g 1 slow step this behavior can be explained by the presence at the beginning of a large number of vacant surface sites that are available for the adsorption of the dye molecules first step over time these sites become saturated which causes forces between the solute molecules on the surface of the solid aysan et al 2016 marrakchi et al 2016 3 2 adsorbent dose effect effect of the adsorbent dose on mb adsorption on clay is investigated by varying the dose from 0 4 to 4 g l 1 at room temperature with an initial dye concentration of 100 mg l 1 and for 60 min of stirring the ph is that of the initial solution fig 3 shows that the efficiency of adsorption increases from 89 05 to 98 17 with an increase in the adsorbent dose from 0 4 to 4 g l 1 and the optimal dose to achieve equilibrium is 1 g l 1 thus the increase of the adsorbent dose leads to an increase in the number of available adsorption sites which favors the increase of the adsorption capacity sheshmani et al 2014 3 3 effect of initial dye concentration and temperature the effect of initial mb concentration on the adsorbed amount at different temperatures was performed in the concentration range 100 900 mg l 1 and at 22 30 40 50 and 60 c with the initial dye solution ph the adsorbent dose and the contact time were fixed at 1 g l 1 and 60 min respectively fig 4 according to the fig 4 it is found that the initial dye concentration positively affects the adsorption of mb onto the natural clay as the initial dye concentration increased from 100 to 900 mg g 1 the adsorbed amount increased from 97 60 to 256 85 mg g 1 this is due to the fact that increase in concentration causes increases the interaction between the dye and adsorbent surface and providing a necessary driving force to overcome the resistance to mass transfer of dye ponnusami et al 2009 dotto and pinto 2012 in regards to the effect of temperature the adsorption capacity increases with the increasing temperature from 22 to 60 c this increase can be explained by the fact that the temperature has an effect on the solubility and mobility of the dyes molecules alkan and dogen 2003 kumar and ahmad 2011 almeida et al 2009 el sayed 2011 patil et al 2011 with a rise in temperature the dye becomes more soluble and the intensity of the interaction forces between the adsorbate and surface of adsorbent become important ahmad and rahman 2011 thereby promoting adsorption of the adsorbate molecules the temperature may also influence the kinetics and the adsorption capacity 3 4 ph effect the ph of the solution is a very important parameter to be taken into account in adsorption studies of methylene blue onto natural clay it affects the surface charge of the adsorbents as well as the degree of ionization of dye molecules wang et al 2010 the ph effect was studied in the ph range of 3 10 by adjusting the ph with hcl 0 1 n and naoh 0 1 n solutions the initial dye concentration and the adsorbent dose were maintained at 100 mg l 1 and 1 g l 1 respectively at room temperature for 60 min fig 5 fig 5 shows that the maximum adsorption capacity was observed at higher ph of the solution which can explain by the effect of the electrostatic attraction between the sites on the surface which are negatively charged and the positively charged mb at high ph gao et al 2016 whereas in the case of the acidic ph the concentration of h ions is very high and consequently the adsorption capacity is decreased because there is competition between the cationic dye molecules and the h protons to occupy the adsorption sites hameed et al 2008 şahin et al 2015 thus in acidic ph the clay is positively charged which leads to an electrostatic repulsion between the mb cations and the adsorbent surface gao et al 2015 3 5 adsorption kinetics the kinetics of adsorption of cationic dye on the natural clay was carried out in the contact time range 20 120 min the results obtained are illustrated in figs 6 and 7 the kinetic parameters of both models are summarized in table 1 as can be seen in table 1 the r2 values obtained for second order kinetics r2 1 is higher than that of pseudo first order r2 0 885 this suggests that the adsorption of mb on natural clay well fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic cottet et al 2014 gao et al 2016 2015 in addition the calculated value of qe qe 98 039 mg g 1 from the pseudo second order kinetic model matched well with the experimental data which indicates that the adsorption process could be best described by the pseudo second order 3 6 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms were realized in the concentration range 100 900 mg l 1 and at 22 30 40 50 and 60 c the results obtained are shown in figs 8 10 the isotherm parameters are summarized in table 2 the calculated values of the constants and the correlation coefficients r2 of the three isotherms were shown in table 2 according to the results obtained it is found that the correlation coefficient of the langmuir r2 0 99 is much higher than for other two models freundlich r2 0 97 and timken r2 0 92 indicating that the langmuir model exhibited the best fit to the experimental data and a monolayer adsorption taking place on the adsorbent surface cottet et al 2014 aysan et al 2016 gao et al 2015 chang et al 2016 moreover the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity qthe 322 58 mg g 1 is closer to the experimental data qexp furthermore the value 0 rl 1 proved that the adsorption of mb on natural clay is favorable maximum adsorption of methylene blue onto various clay based adsorbents was illustrated in table 3 it is easy to note the high performance of our support to adsorb the dye studied 3 7 thermodynamic study the thermodynamic values obtained are summarized in table 4 as can be seen in table 4 the values of δg at the temperatures of 22 c 30 c 40 c 50 c and 60 c are found to be negative which indicated that the adsorption of methylene blue onto the natural clay is feasible and spontaneous fan et al 2014 uyar et al 2016 thereby the values of change in gibb s free energy is between 0 950010048 and 2 665494208 is in the range of 20 to 0 kj mol 1 which implies that the physical adsorption uyar et al 2016 saka et al 2012 the positive value of δh confirms the endothermic nature of adsorption process cottet et al 2014 dawood and sen 2012 errais et al 2011 the positive values of δs suggest the increased randomness at the solid solution interface with the increasing of temperature gupta et al 2006 lian et al 2009 3 8 the probable adsorption mechanisms of mb onto natural clay adsorption tests carried out on the clay treated with hcl 5 m showed that mb is not adsorbed on the latter according to the x ray diffraction analysis of clay before bentahar et al 2015 and after treatment with hydrochloric acid 5 m fig 11 the absence of the dolomite phase after treatment is noted it is concluded that dolomite is responsible for mb adsorption on the other hand the value of the zero charge point for the studied material is 8 49 bentahar et al 2015 which means that the clay surface is positively charged below 8 6 and negatively above this value thus based on these results we proposed the mb adsorption mechanism on the surface of clay illustrated by the scheme shown in fig 12 for the two ph ranges we introduced both types of active sites on the surface of the clay cooh and coo in acidic medium the coo sites of the support are protonated and hence methylene blue is adsorbed on the surface clay through hydrogen bonds involving sulfur and or nitrogen atoms of mb not positively charged on the other hand in the basic medium methylene blue is fixed on the surface of the clay by the electrostatic interactions between the oxygen of the carboxylate group of the surface of the clay with the positively charged atoms of sulfur and or nitrogen dye 3 9 desorption and regeneration of natural clay after the adsorption of mb using 0 05 g of the natural clay initial mb concentration of 100 mg l 1 at room temperature and the initial dye solution ph the desorption was carried out by eluting the mb dye adsorbed natural clay with a hno3 solution 0 3 m the adsorption desorption process was repeated five times in order to examine the efficiency of re use of the adsorbent and to keep the process cost low the results obtained are illustrated in figs 13 and 14 fig 13 shows that desorption of mb is rapid for the first 40 min 88 68 and then increases slightly to reach saturation at 60 min 96 67 concerning to reuse of support fig 14 we found that the reduction of the percentage adsorption of methylene blue was only 7 6 after the fifth cycle this implies that our support can be considered as an effective and regenerable material for adsorption of methylene blue 4 conclusion the main objective of this study was the application of a clay from the agadir region for the elimination of methylene blue the parameters affecting the adsorption of mb are studied the results obtained show that the optimal adsorbent dose and the contact time to reach equilibrium are 1 g l 1 and 60 min also the adsorption is strongly influenced by the temperature and the initial concentration which have a positive effect on the mb elimination by the natural clay in addition the adsorption of mb is better at basic ph the kinetic study shows that the adsorption of mb is described by a pseudo second order equation with a correlation coefficient equal 1 langmuir model perfectly describes mb adsorption with a maximum adsorption capacity of 322 58 mg g 1 the thermodynamic study indicates that the adsorption is physisorption spontaneous and endothermic in nature thus this work confirms the possibility of using this natural clay as an effective economical ecological and regenerable adsorbent for the removal of cationic dyes from wastewater

strongly dependent on the temperature the initial dye concentration and the ph of the solution the kinetic study indicated that the adsorption of mb on the clay was well adapted to the pseudo second order kinetic with a correlation coefficient r2 1 langmuir model described better the adsorption of mb with a maximum adsorption capacity of 322 58 mg g 1 the thermodynamic study suggested that the adsorption of cationic dye is physisorption spontaneous and endothermic desorption and regeneration studies showed that the studied support can be considered as an effective regenerable and reuse adsorption material graphical abstract fx1 keywords methylene blue clay cationic dye kinetic study adsorption isotherms 1 introduction synthetic dyes are used extensively in many industrial sectors such as food textile paper rubber plastics cosmetics and pharmaceutical ai et al 2011 moussavi and mahmoudi 2009 these industries discharged large quantities of wastewater into waterways no previous treatment these discharges constitute a very important source of pollution and lead to the deterioration human and environmental health tiwari et al 2013 the protection of environments and the improvement of water quality by the removal of colorants from industrial effluents have become more and more severe in recent years in this context several processes have been used for the purpose of water decontamination including adsorption coagulation flocculation advanced oxidation processes ozonation membrane filtration and biological treatment fatimah et al 2011 peng et al 2013 cottet et al 2014 these methods are effective but in most cases they are very onerous among them adsorption remains the most efficient methods used for water decontamination due to it is low cost not destructive flexibility simplicity ease of operation insensitivity to toxic substances lack of interaction with toxic substances and readily available tiwari et al 2013 rafatullah et al 2010 forgacs et al 2004 srinivasan and viraraghavan 2010 ahmad and kumar 2010 garg et al 2004 singh et al 2009 the use of activated carbon in the adsorption process is highly demanded because the activated carbon has a high adsorption capacity essentially due to a large specific surface but this process remains very expensive due to its high cost of manufacturing and regeneration which limits his use in many developing countries and onerous lin et al 2014 duman and ayranci 2010 it has also become necessary to have cheap and efficient alternative materials which are capable of simultaneously removing organic and inorganic pollutants clays could be interesting adsorbent materials for the adsorption of various pollutants for reason of their high surface area porosity thermal stability specific active sites high cation exchange capacity easy availability and attractive adsorptive properties laszlo 1987 tanabe and holderich 1999 varma 2002 in this work we chose methylene blue as a cationic dye model to test the adsorbent power of our natural clay fig 1 methylene blue also is known as methylthioninium chloride is very used in medicine pharmaceutics dye industry and analytical chemistry the molecular formula c16h18cln3s 3h2o a molar mass of 373 90 g mol 1 and a maximum absorbance is equal 661 nm scheme 1 this dye is toxic and causes shock cyanosis jaundice and tissue necrosis kumar and kumaran 2005 el ashtoukhy and fouad 2015 the objective of this work is to study all the parameters influencing in the removal of the methylene blue onto natural clay of the agadir region in the south of morocco also to valorize the studied material for use in wastewater treatment as an alternative low cost eco friendly adsorbent and re usable several times 2 material and methods 2 1 materials the natural clay was collected from agadir region south morocco and was crushed in two steps the jaw crusher which permits to obtain the fragments with a diameter 1 cm the tungsten mill which makes the fragments previously crushed by the jaw crusher in powder this powder was sieved to obtain fragments with a diameter 50 µm bentahar et al 2015 2 2 characterization our support has been characterized by xrd ftir bet sem and edxs the results obtained have been published in our previous works bentahar et al 2015 2016 the analysis of xrd shows the existence of two phases the dolomite majority phase and silica the minority phase compared with the dolomite the ftir spectrum indicates the presence of the characteristics bands of the silica the hydroxyl group oh and the deformation of h2o molecules adsorbed between the layers the sem images indicate that the morphology is uniform and consists of grains which are characterized by the presence of cavities and pores at the surface the local analysis by edxs is relatively in good agreement with the nominal composition of the clay phase obtained by x ray diffraction the specific surface area was determined by the brunauer emmet teller bet it is equal to 76 971 m2 g 1 2 3 batch studies the adsorption of methylene blue onto the natural clay was carried out in a batch system all the parameters influencing the removal of mb on the clay were studied such as adsorbent dose contact time initial dye concentration temperature and ph of the solution the adsorption was carried out in a thermostatic bath by adding 0 05 g of our support to 50 ml of a mb solution at different initial concentrations the mixture is stirred at a desired temperature and ph for varying periods ph is adjusted by adding a few drops of hcl 0 1 m and naoh 0 1 m after each experiment the solution is centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min the mb concentration is determined by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 661 nm λ max for mb by uv vis spectrophotometer techcomp uv2300 the adsorbed amount at equilibrium was calculated by the following eq 1 1 q e c 0 c eq m v where qe mg g 1 is the amount of the mb adsorbed on the absorbent c0 mg l 1 is the initial concentration of mb ce mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration of mb v l is the volume of the solution used and m g is the mass of absorbent used 2 4 data evaluation 2 4 1 adsorption kinetics in this study we focused on two kinetic models commonly used namely pseudo first order and pseudo second order these models are particularly easy and have good ability to describe the adsorption the pseudo first order model lagergren 1898 dai et al 2011 toor and jin 2012 is based on a linear relationship between the amounts of solute attached to the material surface over time several authors have used this irreversible kinetic model to describe the adsorption of organic and inorganic solutes on heterogeneous surfaces it is represented by eq 2 özcan et al 2009 2 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t the pseudo second order kinetics models dai et al 2011 mckay and ho 1999 ho and mckay 2000 behnamfard and salarirad 2009 rudzinski and plazinski 2009 have been developed to approximate as much as possible the real reaction mechanism it is expressed by eq 3 3 dq t dt k 2 q e q t 2 where qe and qt are the amounts of mb molecules adsorbed mg g 1 on the natural clay at equilibrium and at time t respectively and k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 are the pseudo first and pseudo second order rate constants respectively 2 4 2 adsorption isotherms several adsorption isotherm models have been developed by different researchers to predict validity of the experimental data the most commonly used are langmuir 1918 freundlich 1906 and temkin and pyzhev 1940 langmuir model assumes that the maximum adsorption corresponds to monolayer coverage of the adsorbent surface that the adsorption sites are homogeneous and also the adsorbed molecules do not exhibit interactions between them özcan et al 2009 saeed et al 2010 the linear form of the langmuir equation is given by the following eq 4 4 c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m where ce mg l 1 qe mg g 1 qm mg g 1 et kl l mg 1 are the equilibrium concentration of the dye the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium the maximum adsorption capacity and the langmuir constant the essential characteristics of the langmuir isotherm can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless separation factor rl hall et al 1996 parida and pradhan 2010 which is defined by eq 5 5 r l 1 1 k l c 0 freundlich isotherm admits the existence of an interaction between adsorbed molecules and that the adsorption of adsorbate has taken place on a heterogeneous surface with a non uniform distribution of the heat of adsorption özcan et al 2009 it is represented by the following eq 6 6 lnq e ln k f ln c e n where ce mg l 1 qe mg g 1 kf mg g 1 l mg 1 1 n and n represent the equilibrium concentration the amount adsorbed the freundlich isotherm constant related to adsorption intensity respectively wang et al 2011 the n value indicated the favorability of adsorption process the adsorption is favorable if the values of n 1 and it is unfavorable if n 1 treybal 1968 poots et al 1978 ho and mckay 1998 isa et al 2007 temkin isotherm assumes that the heat of adsorption of all molecules decreases linearly with coverage due to adsorbate adsorbent interactions temkin and pyzhev 1940 the temkin isotherm is represented by the following eq 7 7 q e b l n k t b l n c e where b is a constant related to the heat of adsorption j mol 1 and kt is the temkin isotherm constant l mg 1 2 4 3 thermodynamic study thermodynamic parameters such as change in free energy δg j mole 1 enthalpy δh j mole 1 and entropy δs j k 1 mole 1 were calculated to determine the nature of the adsorption of mb onto natural clay using the following eqs 8 10 salam 2013 yang and al duri 2005 kumar et al 2009 hameed and ahmad 2009 8 k d c ads c e 9 δ g 0 r t l n k d 10 δ g 0 δ h t δ s where ce mg g 1 cads mg l 1 kd r and t are the liquid phase concentration at equilibrium the solid phase concentration at equilibrium the distribution coefficient the gas constant and absolute temperature respectively the values of δh and δs were calculated from the slopes and intercepts of the plots of ln kd vs 1 t figure not shown 3 results and discussion 3 1 contact time effect the contact time required to reach the methylene blue adsorption equilibrium on the natural clay is determined by varying the contact time between 20 and 120 min with an adsorbent dose of 1 g l 1 an initial dye concentration of 100 mg l 1 at room temperature and initial ph of the dye solution the obtained results are illustrated in fig 2 the adsorbed amount of methylene blue increases rapidly in the first twenty minutes of contact to reach 96 38 mg g 1 fast step after it slowed until reaching equilibrium with a quantity of the order of 98 12 mg g 1 slow step this behavior can be explained by the presence at the beginning of a large number of vacant surface sites that are available for the adsorption of the dye molecules first step over time these sites become saturated which causes forces between the solute molecules on the surface of the solid aysan et al 2016 marrakchi et al 2016 3 2 adsorbent dose effect effect of the adsorbent dose on mb adsorption on clay is investigated by varying the dose from 0 4 to 4 g l 1 at room temperature with an initial dye concentration of 100 mg l 1 and for 60 min of stirring the ph is that of the initial solution fig 3 shows that the efficiency of adsorption increases from 89 05 to 98 17 with an increase in the adsorbent dose from 0 4 to 4 g l 1 and the optimal dose to achieve equilibrium is 1 g l 1 thus the increase of the adsorbent dose leads to an increase in the number of available adsorption sites which favors the increase of the adsorption capacity sheshmani et al 2014 3 3 effect of initial dye concentration and temperature the effect of initial mb concentration on the adsorbed amount at different temperatures was performed in the concentration range 100 900 mg l 1 and at 22 30 40 50 and 60 c with the initial dye solution ph the adsorbent dose and the contact time were fixed at 1 g l 1 and 60 min respectively fig 4 according to the fig 4 it is found that the initial dye concentration positively affects the adsorption of mb onto the natural clay as the initial dye concentration increased from 100 to 900 mg g 1 the adsorbed amount increased from 97 60 to 256 85 mg g 1 this is due to the fact that increase in concentration causes increases the interaction between the dye and adsorbent surface and providing a necessary driving force to overcome the resistance to mass transfer of dye ponnusami et al 2009 dotto and pinto 2012 in regards to the effect of temperature the adsorption capacity increases with the increasing temperature from 22 to 60 c this increase can be explained by the fact that the temperature has an effect on the solubility and mobility of the dyes molecules alkan and dogen 2003 kumar and ahmad 2011 almeida et al 2009 el sayed 2011 patil et al 2011 with a rise in temperature the dye becomes more soluble and the intensity of the interaction forces between the adsorbate and surface of adsorbent become important ahmad and rahman 2011 thereby promoting adsorption of the adsorbate molecules the temperature may also influence the kinetics and the adsorption capacity 3 4 ph effect the ph of the solution is a very important parameter to be taken into account in adsorption studies of methylene blue onto natural clay it affects the surface charge of the adsorbents as well as the degree of ionization of dye molecules wang et al 2010 the ph effect was studied in the ph range of 3 10 by adjusting the ph with hcl 0 1 n and naoh 0 1 n solutions the initial dye concentration and the adsorbent dose were maintained at 100 mg l 1 and 1 g l 1 respectively at room temperature for 60 min fig 5 fig 5 shows that the maximum adsorption capacity was observed at higher ph of the solution which can explain by the effect of the electrostatic attraction between the sites on the surface which are negatively charged and the positively charged mb at high ph gao et al 2016 whereas in the case of the acidic ph the concentration of h ions is very high and consequently the adsorption capacity is decreased because there is competition between the cationic dye molecules and the h protons to occupy the adsorption sites hameed et al 2008 şahin et al 2015 thus in acidic ph the clay is positively charged which leads to an electrostatic repulsion between the mb cations and the adsorbent surface gao et al 2015 3 5 adsorption kinetics the kinetics of adsorption of cationic dye on the natural clay was carried out in the contact time range 20 120 min the results obtained are illustrated in figs 6 and 7 the kinetic parameters of both models are summarized in table 1 as can be seen in table 1 the r2 values obtained for second order kinetics r2 1 is higher than that of pseudo first order r2 0 885 this suggests that the adsorption of mb on natural clay well fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic cottet et al 2014 gao et al 2016 2015 in addition the calculated value of qe qe 98 039 mg g 1 from the pseudo second order kinetic model matched well with the experimental data which indicates that the adsorption process could be best described by the pseudo second order 3 6 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms were realized in the concentration range 100 900 mg l 1 and at 22 30 40 50 and 60 c the results obtained are shown in figs 8 10 the isotherm parameters are summarized in table 2 the calculated values of the constants and the correlation coefficients r2 of the three isotherms were shown in table 2 according to the results obtained it is found that the correlation coefficient of the langmuir r2 0 99 is much higher than for other two models freundlich r2 0 97 and timken r2 0 92 indicating that the langmuir model exhibited the best fit to the experimental data and a monolayer adsorption taking place on the adsorbent surface cottet et al 2014 aysan et al 2016 gao et al 2015 chang et al 2016 moreover the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity qthe 322 58 mg g 1 is closer to the experimental data qexp furthermore the value 0 rl 1 proved that the adsorption of mb on natural clay is favorable maximum adsorption of methylene blue onto various clay based adsorbents was illustrated in table 3 it is easy to note the high performance of our support to adsorb the dye studied 3 7 thermodynamic study the thermodynamic values obtained are summarized in table 4 as can be seen in table 4 the values of δg at the temperatures of 22 c 30 c 40 c 50 c and 60 c are found to be negative which indicated that the adsorption of methylene blue onto the natural clay is feasible and spontaneous fan et al 2014 uyar et al 2016 thereby the values of change in gibb s free energy is between 0 950010048 and 2 665494208 is in the range of 20 to 0 kj mol 1 which implies that the physical adsorption uyar et al 2016 saka et al 2012 the positive value of δh confirms the endothermic nature of adsorption process cottet et al 2014 dawood and sen 2012 errais et al 2011 the positive values of δs suggest the increased randomness at the solid solution interface with the increasing of temperature gupta et al 2006 lian et al 2009 3 8 the probable adsorption mechanisms of mb onto natural clay adsorption tests carried out on the clay treated with hcl 5 m showed that mb is not adsorbed on the latter according to the x ray diffraction analysis of clay before bentahar et al 2015 and after treatment with hydrochloric acid 5 m fig 11 the absence of the dolomite phase after treatment is noted it is concluded that dolomite is responsible for mb adsorption on the other hand the value of the zero charge point for the studied material is 8 49 bentahar et al 2015 which means that the clay surface is positively charged below 8 6 and negatively above this value thus based on these results we proposed the mb adsorption mechanism on the surface of clay illustrated by the scheme shown in fig 12 for the two ph ranges we introduced both types of active sites on the surface of the clay cooh and coo in acidic medium the coo sites of the support are protonated and hence methylene blue is adsorbed on the surface clay through hydrogen bonds involving sulfur and or nitrogen atoms of mb not positively charged on the other hand in the basic medium methylene blue is fixed on the surface of the clay by the electrostatic interactions between the oxygen of the carboxylate group of the surface of the clay with the positively charged atoms of sulfur and or nitrogen dye 3 9 desorption and regeneration of natural clay after the adsorption of mb using 0 05 g of the natural clay initial mb concentration of 100 mg l 1 at room temperature and the initial dye solution ph the desorption was carried out by eluting the mb dye adsorbed natural clay with a hno3 solution 0 3 m the adsorption desorption process was repeated five times in order to examine the efficiency of re use of the adsorbent and to keep the process cost low the results obtained are illustrated in figs 13 and 14 fig 13 shows that desorption of mb is rapid for the first 40 min 88 68 and then increases slightly to reach saturation at 60 min 96 67 concerning to reuse of support fig 14 we found that the reduction of the percentage adsorption of methylene blue was only 7 6 after the fifth cycle this implies that our support can be considered as an effective and regenerable material for adsorption of methylene blue 4 conclusion the main objective of this study was the application of a clay from the agadir region for the elimination of methylene blue the parameters affecting the adsorption of mb are studied the results obtained show that the optimal adsorbent dose and the contact time to reach equilibrium are 1 g l 1 and 60 min also the adsorption is strongly influenced by the temperature and the initial concentration which have a positive effect on the mb elimination by the natural clay in addition the adsorption of mb is better at basic ph the kinetic study shows that the adsorption of mb is described by a pseudo second order equation with a correlation coefficient equal 1 langmuir model perfectly describes mb adsorption with a maximum adsorption capacity of 322 58 mg g 1 the thermodynamic study indicates that the adsorption is physisorption spontaneous and endothermic in nature thus this work confirms the possibility of using this natural clay as an effective economical ecological and regenerable adsorbent for the removal of cationic dyes from wastewater 
12392,the investigation of the dynamic response of aquifer to rainfall with variation of the atmospheric conditions is a key issue for groundwater resource management a data driven dynamic recurrent

rainfall runoff processes kumar et al 2005 rezaeianzadeh et al 2010 from literature review of previous studies we have focused to predict groundwater levels on monthly basis nayak et al 2006 jalalkamali et al 2011 shirmohammadi et al 2013 in fact aquifer dynamics is related to 1 rainfall intensity 2 infiltration and percolation processes and 3 aquifer structural characteristics thus estimation along with impact of evapotranspiration and runoff is essential for predicting groundwater levels to rainfall potential in the aquifer in this context the choice of a model is important by data availability mechanism of calibration and validation the above literature studies point out that ann model is an acceptable tool for performing the water table prediction especially in areas where the scarcity of rainfall occurs or where the real time simulation is needed in the present study evapotranspiration and surface runoff is calculated by empirical equation as suggested by khosla s formulae to indian conditions on monthly climate data then the parameters evapotranspiration and surface runoff are considered for developing models including precipitation temperature as input and water table depth as output the purpose of this paper is to identify the complex dynamics of water table depth fluctuation due to the impact of evapotranspiration and surface runoff the rest of the

geographical coordinates are 21 38 0 north 84 3 0 east major soil type of rengali is red sandy and red loamy soils major water bearing formations are granite gneiss quartzites sandstone and arenaceous shales the region is a part of indian peninsula and is characterized by scanty rainfall the area is categorized by rippling plains with inaccessible high peaks the climate is rooted with dry tropical climate continuing from may to october the inter annual rainfall inconsistency is associated more with changes in the length of the rainy season average elevation of major parts of the district ranges from 100 to 300 m above mean sea level with isolated hill peaks having height up to 600 m above mean sea level south west monsoon causes rain in the district spanning over may to october with average annual rainfall in the order of 1088 mm relative humidity varies as high as 75 during rainy season mean wind velocity varies from 3 4 to 6 8 km h during torrential rain potential evapotranspiration

may fig 1 shows the geology of the study area the western plain where the aquifer is considered for study is entirely underlain by a non marine sedimentary deposit of 20 100 m thickness the area is opted for study because of high demand of ground water extraction during summer and fluctuation of groundwater resource potential in the near vicinity of the aquifer altogether 20 years 1988 2007 data

average humidity is used for model development during the period 1988 2007 later evapotranspiration and runoff data are calculated using khosla s empirical formulae and the data are used for model development to study the effect of runoff and evapotranspiration 3 artificial neural networks simple neuron model receives a vectorial input with components x i these input components are then multiplied by the appropriate weights w i and accumulated as w i x i this term is called weighted sum then the nonlinear mapping function defines the scalar output y w i x i after this transition a neuron model and the weights are to be adjusted data processing of a neuron is presented in fig 2 data input includes precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature humidity runoff and evapotranspiration loss propagation function is the activation of neuron from input with weights the reactions of the neurons to the input values depend on the activation state the activation state

recurrences known as multilayer perceptrons an elman network is an mlp multi layer perceptron with one context neuron per information processing neuron this means that there exists one context layer per information processing neuron layer with exactly the same number of context neurons every neuron has a weighted connection to exactly one context neuron while the context layer is completely linked towards its original layer 3 2 model performance to determine the performance results of the selected network models four different statistical parameters have been used i e mean square error

formulae in indian condition monthly average evapotranspiration losses are evaluated using khosla s equation an empirical one because of non availability of data the relationship for monthly runoff is rm p m l m where lm 0 48 tm for tm 4 5 c pm monthly precipitation in mm lm monthly evapotranspiration losses in mm tm mean monthly temperature of station in c then using khosla s formulae on indian infirmity the following data for runoff and evapotranspiration loss are epitomized in table 1 calculated losses due to evapotranspiration are comparatively less in the year 1991 1993 1995 2002 and 2007 and a trend is observed that during high precipitation there are low evapotranspiration losses except for the year 2002 for evapotranspiration to take place we require heat from the sun air movement to remove the evaporated moisture and a humidity gradient so that the air above the surface is not saturated actual evapotranspiration depends not only on atmospheric factors but on the amount of moisture and the nature of the vegetation at the surface a barren and totally dry ground surface will generate no actual evapotranspiration though its potential rate is high variation of evapotranspiration and runoff is shown in fig 4 a and b by calculating evapotranspiration from average temperature of rengali for the period 1988 2007 using khosla s empirical equation the data is necessary to study the impact of evapotranspiration and runoff to predict water table depth fig 4 a suggests that the evapotranspiration is more when temperature is higher likewise fig 4 b suggests more precipitation leads to more runoff 4 2 model evaluation for water table depth using rnn having variable transfer functions the monthly average water table depth may to october is considered as output 120 data sets are considered for training the network spanning over 1988 2007 for the model design at first the data sets are normalized to fall within the range 0 1 after being normalized the input data are trained using 70 of sequential data and tested using the 30 data here the networks are trained with different model architectures variation of hidden layers altering on trial basis with useful learning rate and momentum coefficient respectively as per requirements of the model development and design table 2 shows the best results of different scenarios using various transfer functions and architectures the statistical parameters that are used to determine the best results are mean square error mse root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and coefficient of

best statistical results are given in table 2 in this study five scenarios have been considered to determine water table depth and the best results for all the scenarios with their statistical parameters are shown in table 2 it has been observed from table 2 that all five model scenarios come within tolerance limit of error it is found from fig 5 that inclusion of evapotranspiration in scenario 5 improves the model efficiency where as inclusion of runoff in scenario3 and 4 improves the model efficiency as compared to scenario 1 and scenario 2 where neither runoff nor evapotranspiration is considered for model evaluations overall evaluation shows that purelin transfer function used for model development of scenario 1 2 and 3 converges faster as compared to other transfer functions tansiig and logsig inclusion of runoff with logsig function found to be better as compared to other transfer functions in scenario 4 in scenario 5 inclusion of evapotranspiration for model development with tansig function proves to be best 5 conclusion in this study three different transfer functions of dynamic recurrent neural networks are used for monthly average water level prediction in arid region with five scenarios a correlation analysis is used to find the associations among the inputs and the target water table depth one of the advantages of dynamic rnn is that it converges first to produce the target as compared to other neural network techniques this is related to its capacity of reproducing the physical phenomenon of the response of groundwater levels to rainfall and its abstracts for any aquifer in arid region therefore the proposed approach is an attempt for evaluating water table depth without a pre assumed model of infiltration through the vadose layer the model development and its practicability in arid region are most economic and may be applied to water supply planning and management system model results will help to search the optimum availability of water under different scenarios from the results evapotranspiration loss and run off are the influencing parameters which affect the depth to water table in ground water reservoir using dynamic recurrent neural networks and hence the key factors for predicting water capacity in the sub surface reservoir 
12392,the investigation of the dynamic response of aquifer to rainfall with variation of the atmospheric conditions is a key issue for groundwater resource management a data driven dynamic recurrent neural network approach based on multi objective optimization is used here to forecast groundwater levels as a function of rainfall temperature humidity runoff and evapotranspiration data recurrent neural network rnn with variable transfer functions like tangential sigmoidal purelin and logarithmic sigmoidal are used to compute the relative performance of the model the results demonstrate the

evaluation of groundwater level is a relevant topic for groundwater management especially in arid and semiarid regions where rainfall amount and distribution vary consistently across the years rushton 2003 the difficulty of modeling is the dynamics of hydro geological systems with their inherent complexity and nonlinear processes controlling their responses to external inputs kresic and mikszewski 2012 water levels are predicted through physically based or data driven models developing a physically based model for assessing water level fluctuations require proper characterization and synthesis of the aquifer parameters to describe spatial variability of the subsurface hydrogeology and soil characteristics taormina et al 2012 dadaser celik and cengiz 2013 ghose et al 2010 has predicted water table depth using bpnn and rbfn techniques empirical approaches have been widely used for water table depth modeling box and jenkins 1976 tankersley and graham 1994 hipel and mcleod 1994 van geer and

insufficient knowledge of the hydro geologic characteristics of the system and accuracy in prediction is more important for understanding the physical processes then black box type models are viable options nourani and mano 2007 artificial neural networks anns are among the black box type models that can be applied to capture nonlinear behavior of complex systems ann models have been used in rainfall runoff processes kumar et al 2005 rezaeianzadeh et al 2010 from literature review of previous studies we have focused to predict groundwater levels on monthly basis nayak et al 2006 jalalkamali et al 2011 shirmohammadi et al 2013 in fact aquifer dynamics is related to 1 rainfall intensity 2 infiltration and percolation processes and 3 aquifer structural characteristics thus estimation along with impact of evapotranspiration and runoff is essential for predicting groundwater levels to rainfall potential in the aquifer in this context the choice of a model is important by data availability mechanism of calibration and validation the above literature studies point out that ann model is an acceptable tool for performing the water table prediction especially in areas where the scarcity of rainfall occurs or where the real time simulation is needed in the present study evapotranspiration and surface runoff is calculated by empirical equation as suggested by khosla s formulae to indian conditions on monthly climate data then the parameters evapotranspiration and surface runoff are considered for developing models including precipitation temperature as input and water table depth as output the purpose of this paper is to identify the complex dynamics of water table depth fluctuation due to the impact of evapotranspiration and surface runoff the rest of the

geographical coordinates are 21 38 0 north 84 3 0 east major soil type of rengali is red sandy and red loamy soils major water bearing formations are granite gneiss quartzites sandstone and arenaceous shales the region is a part of indian peninsula and is characterized by scanty rainfall the area is categorized by rippling plains with inaccessible high peaks the climate is rooted with dry tropical climate continuing from may to october the inter annual rainfall inconsistency is associated more with changes in the length of the rainy season average elevation of major parts of the district ranges from 100 to 300 m above mean sea level with isolated hill peaks having height up to 600 m above mean sea level south west monsoon causes rain in the district spanning over may to october with average annual rainfall in the order of 1088 mm relative humidity varies as high as 75 during rainy season mean wind velocity varies from 3 4 to 6 8 km h during torrential rain potential evapotranspiration ranges from 4 41 to 32 32 cm during the month of may to october the mean daily average relative humidity is recorded to be 89 as maximum during the month of august and 21 as minimum for the month of may fig 1 shows the geology of the study area the western plain where the aquifer is considered for study is entirely underlain by a non marine sedimentary deposit of 20 100 m thickness the area is opted for study because of high demand of ground water extraction during summer and fluctuation of groundwater resource potential in the near vicinity of the aquifer altogether 20 years 1988 2007 data were collected from india meteorological department imd bhubaneswar groundwater survey and investigation gwsi sambalpur odisha groundwater level records were obtained from the observation well located at rengali depth of water table is measured over the period in a piezometric well at rengali odisha india fig 1 monthly average precipitation monthly average maximum and minimum temperature monthly average humidity is used for model development during the period 1988 2007 later evapotranspiration and runoff data are calculated using khosla s empirical formulae and the data are used for model development to study the effect of runoff and evapotranspiration 3 artificial neural networks simple neuron model receives a vectorial input with components x i these input components are then multiplied by the appropriate weights w i and accumulated as w i x i this term is called weighted sum then the nonlinear mapping function defines the scalar output y w i x i after this transition a neuron model and the weights are to be adjusted data processing of a neuron is presented in fig 2 data input includes precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature humidity runoff and evapotranspiration loss propagation function is the activation of neuron from input with weights the reactions of the neurons to the input values depend on the activation state the activation state indicates the extent of a neuron s activation and is referred to as activation common activation functions are i fermi function or logistic function f 1 1 e x which maps to the range of values of 0 1 called log sigmoid ii hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function f 1 e 2 x 1 e 2 x 3 1 elman recurrent neural network recurrent networks are networks that are capable of influencing themselves by means of recurrences known as multilayer perceptrons an elman network is an mlp multi layer perceptron with one context neuron per information processing neuron this means that there exists one context layer per information processing neuron layer with exactly the same number of context neurons every neuron has a weighted connection to exactly one context neuron while the context layer is completely linked towards its original layer 3 2 model performance to determine the performance results of the selected network models four different statistical parameters have been used i e mean square error

and scenario of models here five model scenarios have been taken into consideration scenario 1 is developed with precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature as input and water table depth as output scenario 2 is with precipitation average temperature which includes maximum temperature and minimum temperature and humidity as input and water table depth as output scenario 3 is developed with precipitation average temperature and runoff as input and water table depth as output scenario 4 is taken into consideration with precipitation average temperature runoff via evapotranspiration and humidity as input and water table depth as output scenario 5 is taken into consideration with precipitation average temperature evapotranspiration loss and humidity as input and water table depth as output five scenarios are represented in fig 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of evapotranspiration loss and runoff monthly surface runoff is calculated using khosla s formulae in indian condition monthly average evapotranspiration losses are evaluated using khosla s equation an empirical one because of non availability of data the relationship for monthly runoff is rm p m l m where lm 0 48 tm for tm 4 5 c pm monthly precipitation in mm lm monthly evapotranspiration losses in mm tm mean monthly temperature of station in c then using khosla s formulae on indian infirmity the following data for runoff and evapotranspiration loss are epitomized in table 1 calculated losses due to evapotranspiration are comparatively less in the year 1991 1993 1995 2002 and 2007 and a trend is observed that during high precipitation there are low evapotranspiration losses except for the year 2002 for evapotranspiration to take place we require heat from the sun air movement to remove the evaporated moisture and a humidity gradient so that the air above the surface is not saturated actual evapotranspiration depends not only on atmospheric factors but on the amount of moisture and the nature of the vegetation at the surface a barren and totally dry ground surface will generate no actual evapotranspiration though its potential rate is high variation of evapotranspiration and runoff is shown in fig 4 a and b by calculating evapotranspiration from average temperature of rengali for the period 1988 2007 using khosla s empirical equation the data is necessary to study the impact of evapotranspiration and runoff to predict water table depth fig 4 a suggests that the evapotranspiration is more when temperature is higher likewise fig 4 b suggests more precipitation leads to more runoff 4 2 model evaluation for water table depth using rnn having variable transfer functions the monthly average water table depth may to october is considered as

12393,membrane based technology is becoming an attractive option for primary treatment of municipal wastewater mw due to its superior organic retention capacity and footprint savings however limited understanding of fouling mechanisms still hampered its practical application this study aims to investigate the fouling characteristics in mpt and analyze anti fouling mechanisms of influent conditioning in the meantime the differences between microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf are also discussed dozens of filtration experiments with different membranes 0 1 μm and 100 kda mw conditioning methods coagulation and adsorption were conducted results indicated that a hallmark of mpt is the protective ability of particulate matters present in the raw mw the irreversible fouling rate was 2 4 times higher in the absence of particulates besides the main irreversible foulant types and the cake growth patterns differed with different pore sizes as for influent conditioning coagulation and adsorption collaborate effectively in regulating cake characteristics polymeric aluminum chloride reduces the tendency of binding between foulants and membrane while activated carbon increases the porosity of the cake layer graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords coagulation adsorption microfiltration ultrafiltration cake structure irreversible membrane fouling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction currently classic municipal wastewater mw treatment plants consist of a three stage treatment system centered on the biological nitrogen removal bnr process 1 in a conventional activated sludge cas or a membrane bioreactor mbr system organics and nitrogen are destructively removed assisted by intensive aeration and carbon source addition this means undesirable energy consumption 0 3 0 6 kwh m3 for cas 2 and 0 4 0 6 kwh m3 for mbr 3 and a waste of potential resources also in the concept of sustainable development cas brings potential greenhouse gas emissions as well as the waste of recyclable resources 4 there is an urgent need for structural revolution within wastewater treatment plants one popular idea is the separation of carbon and nitrogen in primary treatment which means redirect the organics to the solid phase while keep nitrogen within the aqueous phase 5 different from the dilute raw wastewater 500 mg l the organic rich sludge is more suitable for energy production process such as anaerobic digestion 6 meanwhile the effluent with low c n provides conditions for the desired autotrophic denitrification 7 or ammonia recovery 8 technology modified primary treatment technologies including a stage and chemically enhanced primary treatment cept are now contributing to environmental friendly mw treatment worldwide 8 one of successful implementation is the strass wastewater treatment plant wwtp in austria in which energy self sufficiency has been achieved 9 however the above mentioned gravity driven primary treatment technologies still face the inefficiency of solid liquid separation 10 11 membranes have been successfully applied in secondary and tertiary treatment mbr reduces footprint by replacing secondary sedimentation tanks with improved separation efficiency and ultrafiltration is contributing to the high quality effluent based on this it is reasonable to assume that membranes are also competitive in primary treatment during the last decade membrane based primary treatment mpt under different names coagulation adsorption enhanced membrane caem 12 membrane based preconcentration mpc 13 and so on has made some progress and feasibility has been initially verified the prime advantage of mpt is the high recovery rate of organic matter through microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf membranes mpt can achieve almost complete retention of particulate and colloidal organics when coupled with chemicals such as adsorbents dissolved organics can also be retained 14 15 it has been reported that as organic recovery rate increasing from 40 to 90 the accompanying energy self sufficiency increased from 66 2 to a maximum of 176 3 16 what s more the high quality permeate also make the mpt technology more attractive shortened secondary and tertiary treatment processes often incorporating membrane processes as well or even direct reuse for irrigation are becoming more possible 17 18 it should be noted that another popular idea for energization is anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr compared with which these features of mpt make it more competitive one is that after concentration in mpt the organic stream becomes volume compressed heating which is necessary for anaerobic reaction in most non tropical regions the concentrated stream is more economically feasible than heating the entire municipal wastewater 14 secondly mpt is designed to operate at low srts and thus the biological activity is suppressed which facilitates the controlling of bio related membrane fouling finally mpt provides a concentrated product that can be used as a substrate for various energy or resource recovery technologies including but not limited to anaerobic methanogenesis despite numerous advantages the practical application of mpt technology is hampered by severe membrane fouling benefiting from the valuable experience of membrane based technologies in secondary and tertiary treatment e g mbr and ultrafiltration of secondary effluents several antifouling methods have been introduced into mpt membrane modification 5 enhanced backwashing 19 module movement 20 and influent conditioning by chemicals 21 have demonstrated to be effective specifically our research group led the way in in situ coagulation and adsorption for fouling mitigation in mpt systems 22 it should be noted that the membrane exposure environment in the mpt is significantly different from that within secondary or tertiary systems the ideal mpt is a physico chemical separation process with short hydraulic residence time 14 under this circumstance large amounts of particulate and colloidal materials from the original mw can be effectively concentrated with a relatively low level of microorganisms and their products 23 the nature of this mixture differs from both the activated sludge and the slightly polluted secondary effluent however most studies have failed to appreciate the uniqueness of mpt lacking awareness of the mpt s uniqueness has also led to a delay in clarifying the following issues 1 the priority of antifouling strategies depends on the resistance distribution and fouling behavior in the mpt surface fouling and pore fouling require hydraulic cleaning from different angles while reversible and irreversible fouling dictate the necessity of chemicals a more specific example is when the main problem is pore collapse or difficult stripping the choice of cake layer adjustment method should be different 2 for the already proved effective methods mechanism clarifying within mpt is an important prerequisite for targeted optimization in our previous study the combination of pacl and pac was demonstrated to be effective meanwhile we also observed some phenomena with no obvious explanation such as the different effects of coagulation in systems with different membrane pore sizes and a synergistic effect of coagulation and adsorption in a recent pilot experiment 22 3 various mf and uf membranes have been used in different mpt configurations but were rarely studied simultaneously in the same research 24 different pore size as well as different working pressure and flux will inevitably affect the above mentioned issues 14 the discussion of the differences between mf and uf will provide a reference for membrane modules selection therefore this study aims to reveal the fouling characteristics of mpt and to elucidate the anti fouling mechanisms of coagulation and adsorption in both mf uf systems fouling types and resistance distribution were evaluated in dozens of filtration experiments with different conditions the properties of cake were evaluated in terms of morphology porosity and interfacial free energy through the separation of mw to different fractions the main contributors of irreversible resistance were pinpointed furthermore the role of coagulation and adsorption in adjusting resistance distribution regulating cake properties and capturing major fouling contributors were discussed throughout the study the distinction between mf and uf gained sustained attention this study is supposed to provide essential insights into membrane fouling and reference for the selection and optimization of anti fouling methods in mpt system 2 methods and materials 2 1 filtration experiments all the filtration experiments were conducted in a 50 ml stirring cell ufsc05001 millipore with dead end filtration mode 25 in a typical filtration process 40 ml of feed stream was loaded at once and then the cell was connected to a compressed n2 cylinder to start constant pressure filtration a filtration cycle is considered finished until the permeate production stops the water recovery is essentially 100 the mass of the permeate was recorded every second by an electronic balance xb3200c precisa which was used for membrane flux calculation fig 1 provides details of filtration experiments a four letter naming scheme was used here 1 the first code represents the filtration process m for mf pore size of 0 1 μm pvdf and 0 015 mpa and u for uf molecular weight cut off 100 kda pvdf and 0 075 mpa there are two reasons for using different pressures one is to maintain a suitable flux with different membrane resistance and the other is due to the common difference in operating pressures for mf and uf in practical applications in addition an extra set of experiments with different pressures was conducted to discuss the effect of pressure as detailed in section 3 2 2 the second code represents the pre treatment methods r for raw municipal wastewater c for coagulation with 50 mg l polymeric aluminum chloride pacl 200 rpm for 1 min and 40 rpm for 15 min and a for adsorption with 100 mg l activated carbon ac 40 rpm for one hour the concentration of pacl and pac mg l is defined relative to the volume of raw municipal wastewater specifically pacl 50 mg l means 1 ml of pacl solution with a mass concentration of 2 5 is added to 0 5 l raw wastewater to form a coagulation system pac is directly added in powder form 100 mg pac is added to 1 l wastewater for adsorption reaction the chemicals were all purchased from macklin co ltd the chemicals were all purchased from macklin co ltd 3 the third code represents the separation methods n for no separation c for centrifugal 3000 g for five minutes and s for sedimentation in refrigerator overnight 4 the last code represents the fraction w for whole s for supernatant and d for deposition specifically the deposition was resuspended to its original volume using ultra pure water for the sake of simplicity the combination of the last three letters was used to indicate the water samples used for the filtration experiment for example mrnw represents the mf process with raw mw without either pre treatment or separation and ccs means the centrifugal supernatant of the coagulated mixture the raw municipal wastewater with no pre treatment was directly obtained from a municipal wwtp in beijing the average suspended solids cod and soluble cod 0 45 μm concentration was about 150 200 mg l 200 250 mg l and 100 130 mg l respectively 2 2 filtration performance analysis the filtration process of different feed streams was fitted using four classical fouling models complete blocking intermediate

membranes was over 99 after acid soaking indicating the effectiveness of the fouling separation and extraction 2 3 cake property analysis the variation of cake porosity with time was estimated mainly based carman kozeny equation the procedure was following previous reports 28 29 and detailed information was provided in supplementary information text s2 briefly the porosity was calculated based on mass based specific resistance α m kg of cake the adhesion process is governed by the short range thermodynamic energies between two entities if total energy was 0 the two surfaces are considered to be repulsive and vice versa the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory provides a measure of these energies the total thermodynamic energy tot can be viewed as a sum of electrostatic interaction el van der waals interaction lw and acid base interaction ab in most cases electrostatic interaction could be ignored each energy item at the minimum separation distance h0 0 158 nm is expressed as g h 0 tot g h 0 lw and g h 0 ab the detailed calculation process is provided as supplementary information text s3 2 4 analytical procedures the characteristics of filtration media and permeate were analyzed respectively the turbidities were measured by turbidimeter 2100 u hach usa the total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan was used to analyze the total dissolved organic carbon toc fluorescence spectra were obtained using a luminescence spectrometer l 2700 hitachi limited japan the protein and polysaccharides were quantified according to the modified lowry approach and the phenol sulfuric acid approach 30 the size distributions and zeta potentials 0 45 μm filtered were measured with a zetasizer nano analyzer nanobrook omni usa the molecular size distributions were measured by series filtration in which samples were sequentially filtered through a series of membranes 0 45 μm 0 22 μm 100 kda 1 kda for toc measurements organic and inorganic foulants were extracted from membrane samples at different stages for analysis the fouled membranes were immersed and shaken for 24 h at 30 c in sodium hydroxide ph 12 and hydrochloric acid ph 2 to extract organic and inorganic foulants respectively 14 membrane samples were dried in a vacuum freeze dryer fdu 1110 eyela japan surface morphology was observed by field emission sem merlin compact zeiss germany at 15 kv after membrane samples were sputter coated with 10 nm of platinum 3 results and discussion 3 1 basic commonalities of mpt of mw to reveal the fouling characteristics of mpt the filtration experiments were firstly conducted with rnw rcs and rcd as fig 2 shows rr rinse and rr backwash accounted for 50 in both mrnw and urnw experiments obviously reversible resistance is a major part when raw mw is filtered directly this is consistence with our earlier observation in both lab and pilot scale demonstrations that pressure induced reversible adhesion of foulants was a main contributor to resistance accumulation 22 31 essentially this study identified two unique behaviors of particulates during mpt of mw firstly particulates played a protective role in the filtration process irreversible fouling was more severe in direct filtration of rcs than rnw fig 2 it was confirmed by eem fluorescence fig 3a and toc tests fig 4a that the concentration and type of organic matter in rcs and rnw showed no obvious difference however after surface rinsing more organics could be extracted from membranes of mrcs 10 9 0 54 mg l than mrnw 8 0 0 10 mg l eem fluorescence also showed that soluble microbial by product like substances with peaks at ex 250 280 nm em 380 nm were the most abundant in mrcs extract while protein like substances with peaks at ex 250 nm em 380 nm were less detected fig 3b 32 this quantitative relationship was consistent with water samples rnw and rcs fig 3a in mrnw extract soluble microbial by product like substances were much less fig 3b these results further confirmed the influence of particles in detail particles present in the raw water formed a protective layer during the filtration and captured part of soluble microbial by product like substances it can be inferred that these organics with high irreversible fouling potential were absorbed in the cake layer and could be easily removed by hydraulic backwashing ding et al also reported that a cake layer on the membrane surface could retain organics 33 this effectively relieves the irreversible fouling resistance besides with the filtration prolonged the pores of the cake layer were gradually filled and the resistance increased fig 2 shows that rr was larger in mrnw urnw than in mrcd urcd fig 5a shows that in mrcd experiment the porosity of the cake layer decreased at a much lower rate than mrnw the final porosity was around 0 48 and 0 28 respectively these basic observations suggest that in the new application scenario of mpt of mw it is reasonable not to remove particles before filtration as they can play a protective role of pre filtration two points require special attention when choosing anti fouling methods 1 in practical applications shear conditions will be less ideal and it is necessary to ensure that the rr is reversible as much as possible and 2 the ability of cake layer to capture foulants should be improved to alleviate pore collapse 3 2 the distinguish between uf and mf since the characteristics of membrane will also affect the filtration process the different performance of mf and uf in mpt was discussed in this section consequently 8 sets of filtration experiments with four samples rnw rcs rcd rss and 2 pvdf membranes mf 0 1 μm and uf 100 kda were investigated under the condition of constant pressure dead end filtration in this experiment the flux of mf is always greater than the flux of uf this can be inferred from fig 5a that the filtration of 40 ml feedstock lasted 10 min and over 35 min in mrnw and urnw experiments respectively specifically in the mrnw experiment the average fluxes for the filtration of initial and final 5 ml feedstock were 789 and 63 lmh respectively in the urnw experiment the corresponding values were 73 lmh and 29 lmh the difference in initial flux could be explained by pore size with the 0 1 μm channel allowing a greater flux through than the 100 kda gut off size the difference in flux dropping behavior on the other hand indicated different fouling types pore blockage was pronounced in mf while surface fouling layer formation was dominant in uf respectively fig 6a depicts the flux dropping behavior in mrnw and urnw experiments compared to uf the flux dropped faster in mf the flux in mrnw dropped to 20 within the first 4 min the flux in urnw experiment on the other hand dropped to about 40 of the initial flux and remained stable after 15 min according to the fitting results the flux variation of mrnw was between standard and cake model while urnw fitted well with cake model morphological observations also provide supportive evidence after surface rinsing foulants attached to the channel walls were observed in mrnw membrane while a complete fouling layer appeared in urnw fig 7a this is consistent with the observation in other filtration processes that some foulants were more likely to enter the channels and adhere to walls of mf membrane with larger pore size while organic matters tend to accumulate on the surface of uf with lower pore size 34 35 despite different fouling types the resistance was more reversible and easier to wash out in mf as illustrated in fig 2 reversible resistance accounted for over 85 of mrnw and was mostly removable through surface rinsing meanwhile only 60 of resistance was reversible in urnw among which 35 required backwash there are two possible explanations 1 the reversibility and cleaning difficulty of resistance were not necessarily related to the location 36 the fouling layer in urnw although concentrated on the surface was hardly shed under lateral shear forces and required bottom force provided by backwash 24 2 the different applied pressure imposed such effects uf 75 kpa and mf 15 kpa to make it clear different pressures 25 kpa 50 kpa and 75 kpa were then used in both mrnw and urnw the initial hypothesis was that higher pressure would have both a compaction effect and a backwash effect compaction effect means that higher pressure compacts the layer and exacerbates the difficulty of shedding foulants backwash effect means that higher pressure increases the wash out force and therefore reduces the residual irreversible resistance fig 8 showed that when a low pressure 25 kpa was applied mf and uf behaved similarly while differences occurred as pressure increased in uf the compaction effect was dominated since the reversible rate decreased and the absolute value of rr increased as the pressure increased in mf on the contrary changes in rr rinse were not obvious while a shift occurred in rir and rr rinse thus the backwash effect was more obvious gao et al also concluded that there is a close relationship between membrane pore size and the efficiency of back pulsing the more open the pore size the more internal fouling and higher backwash efficiency 37 the cake formation mechanism and the influence of pressure were different in mf and uf combining the cake formation theory in the literature and the observations of porosity in this study the cake growth mechanism during the mpt of mw could be explained as a two stage process firstly the membrane was quickly covered to form a base layer which was resistive to mass transfer and non compressible 38 secondly the cake started to thicken under the combination of the growth effect pressure effect and fill in effect the growth effect describes that the accumulation of particles becomes looser as the cake thickens resulting in an increase in porosity 28 the pressure effect means that the compressible cake would collapse under high filtration pressure 29 the fill in effect was used to describe the reduction in pore size caused by the capture of foulants by the cake as depicted in fig 5a and c porosity in mf experiments started at a high value decreased with the filtration process and was not sensitive to pressure it is indicated that the particles rejected by mf membrane in the first stage formed a loose base layer and the fill in effect was most obvious in the second stage in uf experiments due to the stronger rejection capacity of the bare membrane the base layer was denser and the initial porosity was lower fig 5b the observation that a more porous cake was formed in urcd confirmed this theory then in the second stage the growth effect was the most obvious and the porosity increased with the filtration volume what s more the growth effect was influenced by the pressure the higher the pressure was the slower the porosity increased fig 5d as for the formation of irreversible organic resistance in mf and uf the major contributors were different filtration experiments showed that the tendency of rir organic followed such rules mrcs mrnw mrss in mf and urcs urss urnw in uf fig 2 this indicated that organics remained in rss could pass through the mf membranes whereas organics in rcs tended to deposit on membranes when direct contact with uf membranes both of them caused the accumulation of resistance the separation methods caused the different characteristics of the feed sample short term 5 min and low strength 3000 rpm centrifugation was supposed to deposit particles and thus retain colloids in the supernatant which is a simulation of inadequate precipitation 39 ideal sedimentation was achieved in rss samples which referred to 20 of the supernatant carefully suctioned from the top after sedimentation overnight in the refrigerator there were no visible particles in rss samples the turbidity was 10 ntu and the proportion of dissolved cod was 85 fig 4a it is believed that most colloids were removed and dissolved organic matter was left in rss thus colloidal materials retained in the supernatant are the main contributor to irreversible organic resistance in mf dissolved organic matter together with colloidal materials contribute to uf fouling different size distribution of rcs and rss is the first reason fig 4a showed that more organics in the range of 100 kda 0 22 μm were observed in rcs the d50 0 45 μm was close to 100 nm fig 4b in rss sample there were fewer organics in the same range and the d50 was also smaller thermodynamics principles offered the second explanation tests based on xdlvo theory showed that g h 0 tot between samples and pvdf membranes was positive with rcs rss table 1 this indicated that smaller repulsive force existed between rcs and membrane surface leading to a stronger tendency to bond at the shortest contact distance 0 158 nm used in this study 40 accordingly the flux variation in mrcs and mrss experiments was closer to standard model instantaneous adsorption of foulant on the pore wall which urcs and urss fitted well with cake model uniform growth of a cake or gel layer on the surface fig 6b 41 thermodynamic differences played a more important role in mf passing through narrow membrane pores these observations also provided practical suggestions for the application of mpt on the one hand compared to uf mf is a better choice for mpt the stable flux is higher the resistance is more reversible and the cleaning difficulty is lower in addition mf is less sensitive to pressure making it susceptible to the compaction effect however high pressure may lead to further deterioration of uf which is more likely to enter a vicious cycle on the other hand sedimentation as a single pre treatment must be used prudently as discussed in 3 1 pre treatment seeking to remove particles could reduce reversible resistance to a certain extent but it will also waste their protective capacity for irreversible resistance in this section the only way to reduce rir was ideal sedimentation mf it should be noted that the ideal sedimentation of raw mw in this study was almost unrealistic therefore if the sedimentation performance was less ideal for example close to the centrifugal effect it will lead to the deterioration of mf performance 3 3 coagulation as an anti fouling method the cake layer formed after coagulation pre treatment had a denser structure but was easier to shed in mcnw experiments trace amounts of ultrapure water dripped along the sides suspended the cake resulting in smaller total resistance and r than mrnw with a complete cake layer fig 2 differently in uf experiments the cake was kept complete in both ucnw and urnw and r and rr were higher in ucnw to be specific in ucnw rr rinse increased with rr backwash decreased fig 2 experimenters also reported an intuitive experience of easier washout of cake in ucnw as depicted in fig 7c less gel layer was left on the surface of the membrane in ucnw experiment on the one hand the cake layer formed with cnw sample was denser more like a flat mass with limited pore structure in ucnw experiment fig 7b porosity calculation also confirmed that the porosity was slightly lower than that of raw sewage in both mf and uf fig 5a b electrostatic double layer compression caused by the increased ionic strength in coagulation might make the cake layer shrink and denser 42 the selection of coagulants might alleviate this problem it has been reported that the porosities of al based cake are smaller than those of fe based cake 43 on the other hand the fouling layer falls off more easily with the assistance of coagulants interface free energy calculation indicated that g h 0 tot increased from 16 mj m2 to 28 mj m2 representing greater repulsion force between the membrane surface and cake layer table 1 zhang et al also reported in an aerobic granular sludge mbr that the coagulation assist system had larger energy barrier values of the membrane foulant interactions 44 major irreversible fouling contributors in mf that existed in rcs were captured into particulates firmly by coagulation pacl while the contributors in uf retained in the rss were almost unaffected by coagulation figs 2 and 6c depict that the resistance accumulation and flux reduction of mccs were greatly alleviated compared with mrcs in the meantime the difference between mcss mccs and mrss was not obvious in uf experiments the filtration performance of uccs ucss and urss was similar and uccs showed a slight improvement over urcs figs 2 6d fig 4a shows that cnw has a lower organic content in the range of 100 kda 0 22 μm and the distribution of soluble organics was similar in rss ccs and css results indicated that organics in the range of 100 kda 0 22 μm were captured by coagulation which is the main difference between rcs and rss and led to the unique fouling behavior of mf and uf as discussed in section 3 2 as for the particle size distribution 1 μm the d50 of cnw ccs and css was 100 nm which was similar to rss and was significantly reduced compared to rnw and rcs fig 4b a reasonable explanation is that the particles in rcs larger than 100 nm were firmly bounded to the flocs during coagulation which did not present in ccs it has been repeatedly reported that coagulants have a superior ability to capture colloids via the combined effect of charge neutralization adsorption bridging and sweeping yang et al reported that small molecules 20 100 nm gathered into mesoscopic particles of 100 500 nm in a fevio4 2 humic acid system 45 hao et al observed in their coagulation systems treating landfill leachate dissolved organic matter 100 kda was almost completely captured while the capture efficiency of different coagulants for organic matter below 100 kda followed such rules al based fe based zr based 46 in our past mf based mpt system satisfying results using pacl as coagulants were also observed 17 these observations highlighted that coagulation can be an efficient anti fouling method in mpt of mw when directly added coagulant into submerged membrane system without pre separation coagulation can reduce the adhesion tendency of the cake thus reducing the demand for shear force strength it should be noted that the cake must be removed in time since the porosity of the cake was also reduced this requires an accurate and stable source of shear force once the shear strength is insufficient the coagulated cake will worsen the filtration besides the combination of coagulation and sedimentation is also feasible especially in mf coagulation could capture colloidal substances and thus alleviate membrane fouling when the sedimentation duration is insufficient for raw wastewater 3 4 adsorption as an anti fouling method adsorption increased porosity of cake layer and therefore reduced rr rinse fig 2 shows that compared with mrnw and urnw rr rinse reduced to 50 in manw and uanw the cake porosity in uanw and manw also increased fig 5a b adsorbents are thought to work in two ways 1 pac serves as the support and growth core of the flocs in the filtration process the incompressibility and porosity of the cake could be enhanced which was more pronounced in uf experiments in the first stage the porosity of base layer was significantly increased in uanw in the second stage although the porosity continued to decline as the filtration proceed the final stable value of porosity in uanw was still greater than urnw this phenomenon has been reported in several other membrane systems 47 48 2 the cake layer formed with pac has a stronger adsorption capacity when foulants pass through the pac cake layer they preferentially adhere to pac rather than loosely filling the pores of the cake experimental results supported this explanation the improvement in filtration of adsorbents on rnw was better than rcd and the rr rinse was similar in acd and anw fig 2 in addition in the mf experiment a homogeneous cake growth was observed in manw where the cake porosity did not decrease as in mrnw the latter phenomenon was most likely due to the fill in effect as discussed in section 3 1 the enhanced adsorption ability of the cake layer after adsorbents addition was also reported in other papers 31 pac captured dissolved organic matter as expected but it is questionable whether these substances were the main fouling contributors fig 3a depicts that dissolved organic most significant in soluble microbial by product like substances were decreased in anw and acs compared to rnw and rcs the accumulation of resistance and organic composition of membrane extract was further analyzed in uf experiments the overall reduction of toc by pac was effective since most organic can form fouling accordingly lower fluorescence intensity of membrane extracts and smaller rir organic were observed in uanw and uacs compared with urnw and urcs figs 2 3b in mf experiments no significant difference was observed between manw and mrnw while macs behaved better than mrcs figs 2 3b this indicated that the object of pac adsorption and cake pre filtration was consistent the effectiveness of pac as a foul sorbent is controversial when it is added directly to mf systems with mixed particulates soluble organics in our experiment adsorbents did not significantly remove protein like substances fig 3a which was more vital in fouling accumulation than soluble microbial by product like substances in mrnw experiment if the goal was to mitigate membrane fouling by directly removing irreversible fouling contributors more targeted adsorbents usually modified for specific scenarios were recommended 49 50 moreover it should be noted that a higher rir organic was observed in uass the reason was that there was non settleable pac in ass sample it adhered to uf membrane surface under high pressure when directly contacting fig 7c these powders could not be easily washed down until being soaked with naclo which increased the measured value of rir organic in conclusion pac mitigates membrane fouling in two ways 1 by serving as support and increasing adsorption capacity to increase the cake porosity 2 by directly adsorbing dissolved organic matters the latter pathway was more pronounced in uf when adsorption was applied in coupled with pre separation besides the irreversible adhesion of free pac on membranes requires special attention which might lead to the wear of the membrane and the accumulation of undesirable resistance 4 implications fig 9 illustrates the fouling behavior and anti fouling mechanism observed in this study first of all particles play a protective role by capturing colloids and soluble microbial by product like substances removing particles before filtration may decrease total resistence but induce more severe irreversible fouling accumulation as a result solely sedimentation is not recommended when no other anti fouling methods are adopted mf and uf deffers in terms of cake growth patterns and major irreversible fouling contributors the cake growth is in a two stage pattern the initial base layer is denser in uf and more porous in mf due to the differences in original membrane retention capacity in the second stage the porosity of mf and uf decreases and increases under the dominant fill in effect and growth effect respectively the growth in uf is more sensitive to pressure as for irreversible resistance accumulation colloidal material retained in the supernatant low intensity centrifugaled is the main contributor to mf fouling blocking the pathways of membrane pores in uf both soluble and colloldial fractions tend to deposit on membrane surface and cause irreversible fouling the influence of coagulation pacl and adsorption pac on mw samples and various filtration processes is also shown in fig 9 when no pre separation is applied pacl and pac act mainly by regulating the cake properties pacl reduces the adhesion tendency of the cake by adjusting surface properties resulting to an unshaped easily suspended cake in mf and reduced cleaning difficulty in uf however porosity of cakes is reduced due to electrostatic double layer compression pac on the contrary increases the porosity of the cake by acting as a support and weakening the fill in effect specifically in uf pac increases the porosity of initial layer by its adsorption capacity a concern when using pac alone is that in direct contact the pac will irreversibly adhere to the membrane causing undesirable resistance and membrane wear these observations provide theoretical support for the combination of coagulation and adsorption without pre separation as an effective anti fouling strategy the shed ability and porosity of the cake layer would both increase when using two chemicals simultaneously when anti fouling methods are used in combination of pre separation pacl and pac mainly enhanced the removal of colloids and soluble organics soluble microbial by product like substances respectively as a result coagulation sedimentation has an advantage in mf and adsorption sedimentation is more effective in uf it should be noted that pac targets mainly soluble microbial by product like substances the same as the particles while protein like substances are resistant to adsorption by either the original particles or pac 5 conclusions the fouling behavior and anti fouling mechanism in mpt of mw was investigated in this study and the differences between mf and uf were considered throughout the analysis the particles play a protective role of pre filtration during the mpt mf and uf differ in terms of cake growth patterns and major irreversible fouling contributors coagulation pacl and adsorption pac complement each other in fouling mitigation by regulating the characteristics of cake layer and capturing major foulants this study provides an inspiring guideline for future study especially in continuous flow and in pilot scale further validation of these findings will be practical in mpt applications such as

12393,membrane based technology is becoming an attractive option for primary treatment of municipal wastewater mw due to its superior organic retention capacity and footprint savings however limited understanding of fouling mechanisms still hampered its practical application this study aims to investigate the fouling characteristics in mpt and analyze anti fouling mechanisms of influent conditioning in the meantime the differences between microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf are also discussed dozens of filtration experiments with different membranes 0 1 μm and 100 kda mw conditioning methods coagulation and adsorption were conducted results indicated that a hallmark of mpt is the protective ability of particulate matters present in the raw mw the irreversible fouling rate was 2 4 times higher in the absence of particulates besides the main irreversible foulant types and the cake growth patterns differed with different pore sizes as for influent conditioning coagulation and adsorption collaborate effectively in regulating cake characteristics polymeric aluminum chloride reduces the tendency of binding between foulants and membrane while activated carbon increases the porosity of the cake layer graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords coagulation adsorption microfiltration ultrafiltration cake structure irreversible membrane fouling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction currently classic municipal wastewater mw treatment plants consist of a three stage treatment system centered on the biological nitrogen removal bnr process 1 in a conventional activated sludge cas or a membrane bioreactor mbr system organics and nitrogen are destructively removed assisted by intensive aeration and carbon source addition this means undesirable energy consumption 0 3 0 6 kwh m3 for cas 2 and 0 4 0 6 kwh m3 for mbr 3 and a waste of potential resources also in the concept of sustainable development cas brings potential greenhouse gas emissions as well as the waste of recyclable resources 4 there is an urgent need for structural revolution within wastewater treatment plants one popular idea is the separation of carbon and nitrogen in primary treatment which means redirect the organics to the solid phase while keep nitrogen within the aqueous phase 5 different from the dilute raw wastewater 500 mg l the organic rich sludge is more suitable for energy production process such as anaerobic digestion 6 meanwhile the effluent with low c n provides conditions for the desired autotrophic denitrification 7 or ammonia recovery 8 technology modified primary treatment technologies including a stage and chemically enhanced primary treatment cept are now contributing to environmental friendly mw treatment worldwide 8 one of successful implementation is the strass wastewater treatment plant wwtp in austria in which energy self sufficiency has been achieved 9 however the above mentioned gravity driven primary treatment technologies still face the inefficiency of solid liquid separation 10 11 membranes have been successfully applied in secondary and tertiary treatment mbr reduces footprint by replacing secondary sedimentation tanks with improved separation efficiency and ultrafiltration is contributing to the high quality effluent based on this it is reasonable to assume that membranes are also competitive in primary treatment during the last decade membrane based primary treatment mpt under different names coagulation adsorption enhanced membrane caem 12 membrane based preconcentration mpc 13 and so on has made some progress and feasibility has been initially verified the prime advantage of mpt is the high recovery rate of organic matter through microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf membranes mpt can achieve almost complete retention of particulate and colloidal organics when coupled with chemicals such as adsorbents dissolved organics can also be retained 14 15 it has been reported that as organic recovery rate increasing from 40 to 90 the accompanying energy self sufficiency increased from 66 2 to a maximum of 176 3 16 what s more the high quality permeate also make the mpt technology more attractive shortened secondary and tertiary treatment processes often incorporating membrane processes as well or even direct reuse for irrigation are becoming more possible 17 18 it should be noted that another popular idea for energization is anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr compared with which these features of mpt make it more competitive one is that after concentration in mpt the organic stream becomes volume compressed heating which is necessary for anaerobic reaction in most non tropical regions the concentrated stream is more economically feasible than heating the entire municipal wastewater 14 secondly mpt is designed to operate at low srts and thus the biological activity is suppressed which facilitates the controlling of bio related membrane fouling finally mpt provides a concentrated product that can be used as a substrate for various energy or resource recovery technologies including but not limited to anaerobic methanogenesis despite numerous advantages the practical application of mpt technology is hampered by severe membrane fouling benefiting from the valuable experience of membrane based technologies in secondary and tertiary treatment e g mbr and ultrafiltration of secondary effluents several antifouling methods have been introduced into mpt membrane modification 5 enhanced backwashing 19 module movement 20 and influent conditioning by chemicals 21 have demonstrated to be effective specifically our research group led the way in in situ coagulation and adsorption for fouling mitigation in mpt systems 22 it should be noted that the membrane exposure environment in the mpt is significantly different from that within secondary or tertiary systems the ideal mpt is a physico chemical separation process with short hydraulic residence time 14 under this circumstance large amounts of particulate and colloidal materials from the original mw can be effectively concentrated with a relatively low level of microorganisms and their products 23 the nature of this mixture differs from both the activated sludge and the slightly polluted secondary effluent however most studies have failed to appreciate the uniqueness of mpt lacking awareness of the mpt s uniqueness has also led to a delay in clarifying the following issues 1 the priority of antifouling strategies depends on the resistance distribution and fouling behavior in the mpt surface fouling and pore fouling require hydraulic cleaning from different angles while reversible and irreversible fouling dictate the necessity of chemicals a more specific example is when the main problem is pore collapse or difficult stripping the choice of cake layer adjustment method should be different 2 for the already proved effective methods mechanism clarifying within mpt is an important prerequisite for targeted optimization in our previous study the combination of pacl and pac was demonstrated to be effective meanwhile we also observed some phenomena with no obvious explanation such as the different effects of coagulation in systems with different membrane pore sizes and a synergistic effect of coagulation and adsorption in a recent pilot experiment 22 3 various mf and uf membranes have been used in different mpt configurations but were rarely studied simultaneously in the same research 24 different pore size as well as different working pressure and flux will inevitably affect the above mentioned issues 14 the discussion of the differences between mf and uf will provide a reference for membrane modules selection therefore this study aims to reveal the fouling characteristics of mpt and to elucidate the anti fouling mechanisms of coagulation and adsorption in both mf uf systems fouling types and resistance distribution were evaluated in dozens of filtration experiments with different conditions the properties of cake were evaluated in terms of morphology porosity and interfacial free energy through the separation of mw to different fractions the main contributors of irreversible resistance were pinpointed furthermore the role of coagulation and adsorption in adjusting resistance distribution regulating cake properties and capturing major fouling contributors were discussed throughout the study the distinction between mf and uf gained sustained attention this study is supposed to provide essential insights into membrane fouling and reference for the selection and optimization of anti fouling methods in mpt system 2 methods and materials 2 1 filtration experiments all the filtration experiments were conducted in a 50 ml stirring cell ufsc05001 millipore with dead end filtration mode 25 in a typical filtration process 40 ml of feed stream was loaded at once and then the cell was connected to a compressed n2 cylinder to start constant pressure filtration a filtration cycle is considered finished until the permeate production stops the water recovery is essentially 100 the mass of the permeate was recorded every second by an electronic balance xb3200c precisa which was used for membrane flux calculation fig 1 provides details of filtration experiments a four letter naming scheme was used here 1 the first code represents the filtration process m for mf pore size of 0 1 μm pvdf and 0 015 mpa and u for uf molecular weight cut off 100 kda pvdf and 0 075 mpa there are two reasons for using different pressures one is to maintain a suitable flux with different membrane resistance and the other is due to the common difference in operating pressures for mf and uf in practical applications in addition an extra set of experiments with different pressures was conducted to discuss the effect of pressure as detailed in section 3 2 2 the second code represents the pre treatment methods r for raw municipal wastewater c for coagulation with 50 mg l polymeric aluminum chloride pacl 200 rpm for 1 min and 40 rpm for 15 min and a for adsorption with 100 mg l activated carbon ac 40 rpm for one hour the concentration of pacl and pac mg l is defined relative to the volume of raw municipal wastewater specifically pacl 50 mg l means 1 ml of pacl solution with a mass concentration of 2 5 is added to 0 5 l raw wastewater to form a coagulation system pac is directly added in powder form 100 mg pac is added to 1 l wastewater for adsorption reaction the chemicals were all purchased from macklin co ltd the chemicals were all purchased from macklin co ltd 3 the third code represents the separation methods n for no separation c for centrifugal 3000 g for five minutes and s for sedimentation in refrigerator overnight 4 the last code represents the fraction w for whole s for supernatant and d for deposition specifically the deposition was resuspended to its original volume using ultra pure water for the sake of simplicity the combination of the last three letters was used to indicate the water samples used for the filtration experiment for example mrnw represents the mf process with raw mw without either pre treatment or separation and ccs means the centrifugal supernatant of the coagulated mixture the raw municipal wastewater with no pre treatment was directly obtained from a municipal wwtp in beijing the average suspended solids cod and soluble cod 0 45 μm concentration was about 150 200 mg l 200 250 mg l and 100 130 mg l respectively 2 2 filtration performance analysis the filtration process of different feed streams was fitted using four classical fouling models complete blocking intermediate

membranes was over 99 after acid soaking indicating the effectiveness of the fouling separation and extraction 2 3 cake property analysis the variation of cake porosity with time was estimated mainly based carman kozeny equation the procedure was following previous reports 28 29 and detailed information was provided in supplementary information text s2 briefly the porosity was calculated based on mass based specific resistance α m kg of cake the adhesion process is governed by the short range thermodynamic energies between two entities if total energy was 0 the two surfaces are considered to be repulsive and vice versa the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory provides a measure of these energies the total thermodynamic energy tot can be viewed as a sum of electrostatic interaction el van der waals interaction lw and acid base interaction ab in most cases electrostatic interaction could be ignored each energy item at the minimum separation distance h0 0 158 nm is expressed as g h 0 tot g h 0 lw and g h 0 ab the detailed calculation process is provided as supplementary information text s3 2 4 analytical procedures the characteristics of filtration media and permeate were analyzed respectively the turbidities were measured by turbidimeter 2100 u hach usa the total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan was used to analyze the total dissolved organic carbon toc fluorescence spectra were obtained using a luminescence spectrometer l 2700 hitachi limited japan the protein and polysaccharides were quantified according to the modified lowry approach and the phenol sulfuric acid approach 30 the size distributions and zeta potentials 0 45 μm filtered were measured with a zetasizer nano analyzer nanobrook omni usa the molecular size distributions were measured by series filtration in which samples were sequentially filtered through a series of membranes 0 45 μm 0 22 μm 100 kda 1 kda for toc measurements organic and inorganic foulants were extracted from membrane samples at different stages for analysis the fouled membranes were immersed and shaken for 24 h at 30 c in sodium hydroxide ph 12 and hydrochloric acid ph 2 to extract organic and inorganic foulants respectively 14 membrane samples were dried in a vacuum freeze dryer fdu 1110 eyela japan surface morphology was observed by field emission sem merlin compact zeiss germany at 15 kv after membrane samples were sputter coated with 10 nm of platinum 3 results and discussion 3 1 basic commonalities of mpt of mw to reveal the fouling characteristics of mpt the filtration experiments were firstly conducted with rnw rcs and rcd as fig 2 shows rr rinse and rr backwash accounted for 50 in both mrnw and urnw experiments obviously reversible resistance is a major part when raw mw is filtered directly this is consistence with our earlier observation in both lab and pilot scale demonstrations that pressure induced reversible adhesion of foulants was a main contributor to resistance accumulation 22 31 essentially this study identified two unique behaviors of particulates during mpt of mw firstly particulates played a protective role in the filtration process irreversible fouling was more severe in direct filtration of rcs than rnw fig 2 it was confirmed by eem fluorescence fig 3a and toc tests fig 4a that the concentration and type of organic matter in rcs and rnw showed no obvious difference however after surface rinsing more organics could be extracted from membranes of mrcs 10 9 0 54 mg l than mrnw 8 0 0 10 mg l eem fluorescence also showed that soluble microbial by product like substances with peaks at ex 250 280 nm em 380 nm were the most abundant in mrcs extract while protein like substances with peaks at ex 250 nm em 380 nm were less detected fig 3b 32 this quantitative relationship was consistent with water samples rnw and rcs fig 3a in mrnw extract soluble microbial by product like substances were much less fig 3b these results further confirmed the influence of particles in detail particles present in the raw water formed a protective layer during the filtration and captured part of soluble microbial by product like substances it can be inferred that these organics with high irreversible fouling potential were absorbed in the cake layer and could be easily removed by hydraulic backwashing ding et al also reported that a cake layer on the membrane surface could retain organics 33 this effectively relieves the irreversible fouling resistance besides with the filtration prolonged the pores of the cake layer were gradually filled and the resistance increased fig 2 shows that rr was larger in mrnw urnw than in mrcd urcd fig 5a shows that in mrcd experiment the porosity of the cake layer decreased at a much lower rate than mrnw the final porosity was around 0 48 and 0 28 respectively these basic observations suggest that in the new application scenario of mpt of mw it is reasonable not to remove particles before filtration as they can play a protective role of pre filtration two points require special attention when choosing anti fouling methods 1 in practical applications shear conditions will be less ideal and it is necessary to ensure that the rr is reversible as much as possible and 2 the ability of cake layer to capture foulants should be improved to alleviate pore collapse 3 2 the distinguish between uf and mf since the characteristics of membrane will also affect the filtration process the different performance of mf and uf in mpt was discussed in this section consequently 8 sets of filtration experiments with four samples rnw rcs rcd rss and 2 pvdf membranes mf 0 1 μm and uf 100 kda were investigated under the condition of constant pressure dead end filtration in this experiment the flux of mf is always greater than the flux of uf this can be inferred from fig 5a that the filtration of 40 ml feedstock lasted 10 min and over 35 min in mrnw and urnw experiments respectively specifically in the mrnw experiment the average fluxes for the filtration of initial and final 5 ml feedstock were 789 and 63 lmh respectively in the urnw experiment the corresponding values were 73 lmh and 29 lmh the difference in initial flux could be explained by pore size with the 0 1 μm channel allowing a greater flux through than the 100 kda gut off size the difference in flux dropping behavior on the other hand indicated different fouling types pore blockage was pronounced in mf while surface fouling layer formation was dominant in uf respectively fig 6a depicts the flux dropping behavior in mrnw and urnw experiments compared to uf the flux dropped faster in mf the flux in mrnw dropped to 20 within the first 4 min the flux in urnw experiment on the other hand dropped to about 40 of the initial flux and remained stable after 15 min according to the fitting results the flux variation of mrnw was between standard and cake model while urnw fitted well with cake model morphological observations also provide supportive evidence after surface rinsing foulants attached to the channel walls were observed in mrnw membrane while a complete fouling layer appeared in urnw fig 7a this is consistent with the observation in other filtration processes that some foulants were more likely to enter the channels and adhere to walls of mf membrane with larger pore size while organic matters tend to accumulate on the surface of uf with lower pore size 34 35 despite different fouling types the resistance was more reversible and easier to wash out in mf as illustrated in fig 2 reversible resistance accounted for over 85 of mrnw and was mostly removable through surface rinsing meanwhile only 60 of resistance was reversible in urnw among which 35 required backwash there are two possible explanations 1 the reversibility and cleaning difficulty of resistance were not necessarily related to the location 36 the fouling layer in urnw although concentrated on the surface was hardly shed under lateral shear forces and required bottom force provided by backwash 24 2 the different applied pressure imposed such effects uf 75 kpa and mf 15 kpa to make it clear different pressures 25 kpa 50 kpa and 75 kpa were then used in both mrnw and urnw the initial hypothesis was that higher pressure would have both a compaction effect and a backwash effect compaction effect means that higher pressure compacts the layer and exacerbates the difficulty of shedding foulants backwash effect means that higher pressure increases the wash out force and therefore reduces the residual irreversible resistance fig 8 showed that when a low pressure 25 kpa was applied mf and uf behaved similarly while differences occurred as pressure increased in uf the compaction effect was dominated since the reversible rate decreased and the absolute value of rr increased as the pressure increased in mf on the contrary changes in rr rinse were not obvious while a shift occurred in rir and rr rinse thus the backwash effect was more obvious gao et al also concluded that there is a close relationship between membrane pore size and the efficiency of back pulsing the more open the pore size the more internal fouling and higher backwash efficiency 37 the cake formation mechanism and the influence of pressure were different in mf and uf combining the cake formation theory in the literature and the observations of porosity in this study the cake growth mechanism during the mpt of mw could be explained as a two stage process firstly the membrane was quickly covered to form a base layer which was resistive to mass transfer and non compressible 38 secondly the cake started to thicken under the combination of the growth effect pressure effect and fill in effect the growth effect describes that the accumulation of particles becomes looser as the cake thickens resulting in an increase in porosity 28 the pressure effect means that the compressible cake would collapse under high filtration pressure 29 the fill in effect was used to describe the reduction in pore size caused by the capture of foulants by the cake as depicted in fig 5a and c porosity in mf experiments started at a high value decreased with the filtration process and was not sensitive to pressure it is indicated that the particles rejected by mf membrane in the first stage formed a loose base layer and the fill in effect was most obvious in the second stage in uf experiments due to the stronger rejection capacity of the bare membrane the base layer was denser and the initial porosity was lower fig 5b the observation that a more porous cake was formed in urcd confirmed this theory then in the second stage the growth effect was the most obvious and the porosity increased with the filtration volume what s more the growth effect was influenced by the pressure the higher the pressure was the slower the porosity increased fig 5d as for the formation of irreversible organic resistance in mf and uf the major contributors were different filtration experiments showed that the tendency of rir organic followed such rules mrcs mrnw mrss in mf and urcs urss urnw in uf fig 2 this indicated that organics remained in rss could pass through the mf membranes whereas organics in rcs tended to deposit on membranes when direct contact with uf membranes both of them caused the accumulation of resistance the separation methods caused the different characteristics of the feed sample short term 5 min and low strength 3000 rpm centrifugation was supposed to deposit particles and thus retain colloids in the supernatant which is a simulation of inadequate precipitation 39 ideal sedimentation was achieved in rss samples which referred to 20 of the supernatant carefully suctioned from the top after sedimentation overnight in the refrigerator there were no visible particles in rss samples the turbidity was 10 ntu and the proportion of dissolved cod was 85 fig 4a it is believed that most colloids were removed and dissolved organic matter was left in rss thus colloidal materials retained in the supernatant are the main contributor to irreversible organic resistance in mf dissolved organic matter together with colloidal materials contribute to uf fouling different size distribution of rcs and rss is the first reason fig 4a showed that more organics in the range of 100 kda 0 22 μm were observed in rcs the d50 0 45 μm was close to 100 nm fig 4b in rss sample there were fewer organics in the same range and the d50 was also smaller thermodynamics principles offered the second explanation tests based on xdlvo theory showed that g h 0 tot between samples and pvdf membranes was positive with rcs rss table 1 this indicated that smaller repulsive force existed between rcs and membrane surface leading to a stronger tendency to bond at the shortest contact distance 0 158 nm used in this study 40 accordingly the flux variation in mrcs and mrss experiments was closer to standard model instantaneous adsorption of foulant on the pore wall which urcs and urss fitted well with cake model uniform growth of a cake or gel layer on the surface fig 6b 41 thermodynamic differences played a more important role in mf passing through narrow membrane pores these observations also provided practical suggestions for the application of mpt on the one hand compared to uf mf is a better choice for mpt the stable flux is higher the resistance is more reversible and the cleaning difficulty is lower in addition mf is less sensitive to pressure making it susceptible to the compaction effect however high pressure may lead to further deterioration of uf which is more likely to enter a vicious cycle on the other hand sedimentation as a single pre treatment must be used prudently as discussed in 3 1 pre treatment seeking to remove particles could reduce reversible resistance to a certain extent but it will also waste their protective capacity for irreversible resistance in this section the only way to reduce rir was ideal sedimentation mf it should be noted that the ideal sedimentation of raw mw in this study was almost unrealistic therefore if the sedimentation performance was less ideal for example close to the centrifugal effect it will lead to the deterioration of mf performance 3 3 coagulation as an anti fouling method the cake layer formed after coagulation pre treatment had a denser structure but was easier to shed in mcnw experiments trace amounts of ultrapure water dripped along the sides suspended the cake resulting in smaller total resistance and r than mrnw with a complete cake layer fig 2 differently in uf experiments the cake was kept complete in both ucnw and urnw and r and rr were higher in ucnw to be specific in ucnw rr rinse increased with rr backwash decreased fig 2 experimenters also reported an intuitive experience of easier washout of cake in ucnw as depicted in fig 7c less gel layer was left on the surface of the membrane in ucnw experiment on the one hand the cake layer formed with cnw sample was denser more like a flat mass with limited pore structure in ucnw experiment fig 7b porosity calculation also confirmed that the porosity was slightly lower than that of raw sewage in both mf and uf fig 5a b electrostatic double layer compression caused by the increased ionic strength in coagulation might make the cake layer shrink and denser 42 the selection of coagulants might alleviate this problem it has been reported that the porosities of al based cake are smaller than those of fe based cake 43 on the other hand the fouling layer falls off more easily with the assistance of coagulants interface free energy calculation indicated that g h 0 tot increased from 16 mj m2 to 28 mj m2 representing greater repulsion force between the membrane surface and cake layer table 1 zhang et al also reported in an aerobic granular sludge mbr that the coagulation assist system had larger energy barrier values of the membrane foulant interactions 44 major irreversible fouling contributors in mf that existed in rcs were captured into particulates firmly by coagulation pacl while the contributors in uf retained in the rss were almost unaffected by coagulation figs 2 and 6c depict that the resistance accumulation and flux reduction of mccs were greatly alleviated compared with mrcs in the meantime the difference between mcss mccs and mrss was not obvious in uf experiments the filtration performance of uccs ucss and urss was similar and uccs showed a slight improvement over urcs figs 2 6d fig 4a shows that cnw has a lower organic content in the range of 100 kda 0 22 μm and the distribution of soluble organics was similar in rss ccs and css results indicated that organics in the range of 100 kda 0 22 μm were captured by coagulation which is the main difference between rcs and rss and led to the unique fouling behavior of mf and uf as discussed in section 3 2 as for the particle size distribution 1 μm the d50 of cnw ccs and css was 100 nm which was similar to rss and was significantly reduced compared to rnw and rcs fig 4b a reasonable explanation is that the particles in rcs larger than 100 nm were firmly bounded to the flocs during coagulation which did not present in ccs it has been repeatedly reported that coagulants have a superior ability to capture colloids via the combined effect of charge neutralization adsorption bridging and sweeping yang et al reported that small molecules 20 100 nm gathered into mesoscopic particles of 100 500 nm in a fevio4 2 humic acid system 45 hao et al observed in their coagulation systems treating landfill leachate dissolved organic matter 100 kda was almost completely captured while the capture efficiency of different coagulants for organic matter below 100 kda followed such rules al based fe based zr based 46 in our past mf based mpt system satisfying results using pacl as coagulants were also observed 17 these observations highlighted that coagulation can be an efficient anti fouling method in mpt of mw when directly added coagulant into submerged membrane system without pre separation coagulation can reduce the adhesion tendency of the cake thus reducing the demand for shear force strength it should be noted that the cake must be removed in time since the porosity of the cake was also reduced this requires an accurate and stable source of shear force once the shear strength is insufficient the coagulated cake will worsen the filtration besides the combination of coagulation and sedimentation is also feasible especially in mf coagulation could capture colloidal substances and thus alleviate membrane fouling when the sedimentation duration is insufficient for raw wastewater 3 4 adsorption as an anti fouling method adsorption increased porosity of cake layer and therefore reduced rr rinse fig 2 shows that compared with mrnw and urnw rr rinse reduced to 50 in manw and uanw the cake porosity in uanw and manw also increased fig 5a b adsorbents are thought to work in two ways 1 pac serves as the support and growth core of the flocs in the filtration process the incompressibility and porosity of the cake could be enhanced which was more pronounced in uf experiments in the first stage the porosity of base layer was significantly increased in uanw in the second stage although the porosity continued to decline as the filtration proceed the final stable value of porosity in uanw was still greater than urnw this phenomenon has been reported in several other membrane systems 47 48 2 the cake layer formed with pac has a stronger adsorption capacity when foulants pass through the pac cake layer they preferentially adhere to pac rather than loosely filling the pores of the cake experimental results supported this explanation the improvement in filtration of adsorbents on rnw was better than rcd and the rr rinse was similar in acd and anw fig 2 in addition in the mf experiment a homogeneous cake growth was observed in manw where the cake porosity did not decrease as in mrnw the latter phenomenon was most likely due to the fill in effect as discussed in section 3 1 the enhanced adsorption ability of the cake layer after adsorbents addition was also reported in other papers 31 pac captured dissolved organic matter as expected but it is questionable whether these substances were the main fouling contributors fig 3a depicts that dissolved organic most significant in soluble microbial by product like substances were decreased in anw and acs compared to rnw and rcs the accumulation of resistance and organic composition of membrane extract was further analyzed in uf experiments the overall reduction of toc by pac was effective since most organic can form fouling accordingly lower fluorescence intensity of membrane extracts and smaller rir organic were observed in uanw and uacs compared with urnw and urcs figs 2 3b in mf experiments no significant difference was observed between manw and mrnw while macs behaved better than mrcs figs 2 3b this indicated that the object of pac adsorption and cake pre filtration was consistent the effectiveness of pac as a foul sorbent is controversial when it is added directly to mf systems with mixed particulates soluble organics in our experiment adsorbents did not significantly remove protein like substances fig 3a which was more vital in fouling accumulation than soluble microbial by product like substances in mrnw experiment if the goal was to mitigate membrane fouling by directly removing irreversible fouling contributors more targeted adsorbents usually modified for specific scenarios were recommended 49 50 moreover it should be noted that a higher rir organic was observed in uass the reason was that there was non settleable pac in ass sample it adhered to uf membrane surface under high pressure when directly contacting fig 7c these powders could not be easily washed down until being soaked with naclo which increased the measured value of rir organic in conclusion pac mitigates membrane fouling in two ways 1 by serving as support and increasing adsorption capacity to increase the cake porosity 2 by directly adsorbing dissolved organic matters the latter pathway was more pronounced in uf when adsorption was applied in coupled with pre separation besides the irreversible adhesion of free pac on membranes requires special attention which might lead to the wear of the membrane and the accumulation of undesirable resistance 4 implications fig 9 illustrates the fouling behavior and anti fouling mechanism observed in this study first of all particles play a protective role by capturing colloids and soluble microbial by product like substances removing particles before filtration may decrease total resistence but induce more severe irreversible fouling accumulation as a result solely sedimentation is not recommended when no other anti fouling methods are adopted mf and uf deffers in terms of cake growth patterns and major irreversible fouling contributors the cake growth is in a two stage pattern the initial base layer is denser in uf and more porous in mf due to the differences in original membrane retention capacity in the second stage the porosity of mf and uf decreases and increases under the dominant fill in effect and growth effect respectively the growth in uf is more sensitive to pressure as for irreversible resistance accumulation colloidal material retained in the supernatant low intensity centrifugaled is the main contributor to mf fouling blocking the pathways of membrane pores in uf both soluble and colloldial fractions tend to deposit on membrane surface and cause irreversible fouling the influence of coagulation pacl and adsorption pac on mw samples and various filtration processes is also shown in fig 9 when no pre separation is applied pacl and pac act mainly by regulating the cake properties pacl reduces the adhesion tendency of the cake by adjusting surface properties resulting to an unshaped easily suspended cake in mf and reduced cleaning difficulty in uf however porosity of cakes is reduced due to electrostatic double layer compression pac on the contrary increases the porosity of the cake by acting as a support and weakening the fill in effect specifically in uf pac increases the porosity of initial layer by its adsorption capacity a concern when using pac alone is that in direct contact the pac will irreversibly adhere to the membrane causing undesirable resistance and membrane wear these observations provide theoretical support for the combination of coagulation and adsorption without pre separation as an effective anti fouling strategy the shed ability and porosity of the cake layer would both increase when using two chemicals simultaneously when anti fouling methods are used in combination of pre separation pacl and pac mainly enhanced the removal of colloids and soluble organics soluble microbial by product like substances respectively as a result coagulation sedimentation has an advantage in mf and adsorption sedimentation is more effective in uf it should be noted that pac targets mainly soluble microbial by product like substances the same as the particles while protein like substances are resistant to adsorption by either the original particles or pac 5 conclusions the fouling behavior and anti fouling mechanism in mpt of mw was investigated in this study and the differences between mf and uf were considered throughout the analysis the particles play a protective role of pre filtration during the mpt mf and uf differ in terms of cake growth patterns and major irreversible fouling contributors coagulation pacl and adsorption pac complement each other in fouling mitigation by regulating the characteristics of cake layer and capturing major foulants this study provides an inspiring guideline for future study especially in continuous flow and in pilot scale further validation of these findings will be practical in mpt applications such as

12394,cobalt terephthalate metal organic frameworks co bdc mofs is a well known designed inorganic organic hybrid polymeric material because of its oxo cluster it has a durable and potent capability for cyclic redox applications particularly when synthesis gives cobalt in mixed valency conditions co ii and co iii the mixed valency condition offers a fast redox cycling progression due to the intimate localization of both co ii and co iii within the co bdc structure the oxo cluster and consequently should accelerate h2o2 decomposition hence in this work co bdc mof has been synthesized by the typical solvothermal method and has been characterized via sem edx xrd ftir and xps analyses the most important result of characterizations is that cobalt presents pristinely with mixed valency states co ii co iii to assess its heterogenous catalysis performance co bdc has been applied in combination with h2o2 for an advanced oxidation process aop against a test dye methylene blue mb according to kinetic studies h2o2 decomposition was found to obey the regular second order model with rate constant 0 3649 mm 1 min 1 while mb degradation obeyed the pseudo first order model with rate constant ranges from 0 1116 to 0 0716 min 1 depending on mb initial concentration hence it has been concluded that mb degrades by relatively highly abundant oxidative radicals for the applied h2o2 concentration also a catalytic system where the effects of initial mb concentration 2 5 and 10 ppm and dosage of 10 20 50 and 100 mg of co bdc were investigated according to the results mb degrades well at different doses of co bdc because co ii and co iii coexist in the co bdc matrix a single catalyst synergistic catalysis mechanism may be proposed graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords co bdc h2o2 catalysis decomposition degradation contaminant wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction metal organic frameworks mofs are hybrid material constructed from inorganic and organic constituents functioning as node joint and linker strut respectively the inorganic constituent is a metal ion or cluster mostly of oxo type and the organic constituent is a coordinating ligand 1 synthesis of mofs is usually defined being a self assembly process where some mechanistic molecular steps involve in mof formation 2 the self assembly process is not well understood nevertheless mofs present a set of features that draw immense attraction because of their potentially useful applications these features are related to the three main parts of mofs i the nature of inorganic metal node ii the structure of organic ligand and iii the topology of the framework i e its cages openings tilts etc 3 4 the most important features of mofs in addition to being crystalline in most cases are i chemical stability in many cases ii thermal and or hydro stability in many cases iii ultrahigh well defined porosity up to 90 vacant volume with vast internal surface areas in many cases iv possible presence of the coordinatively unsaturated metal site v readily accessible organic struts vi the chance of post modification and functionalization and vii flexible topological transformability of some mofs responding to various physical and chemical stimuli e g breathing and swelling phenomena as a function of host guest interactions all these features are interesting for many applications 5 7 therefore for about two decades mofs have been an attractive developing contestant for gas storage separation adsorption gaseous liquid phases sensing heat transfer magnetic materials optical devices biomedical applications such as drug delivery heterogeneous catalysis and many other applications 5 8 10 various advantageous properties acclaim using mofs as a practical catalyst i high surface areas ii active site densities per unit volume which deliver high catalytic reaction rates iii possibility of post synthesis modification with catalytic groups and iv possibility for tailoring of pore structures for rapid transportation of reactants products molecules still there are some restrictions for catalysis i possible reactivity of organic constituent to the catalyzed reaction which is a stability concern and ii limited regeneration options because of organic constituent probable sensitivity 11 12 apart from advantages and restrictions applying mofs via heterogeneous catalysis has shown a sturdy catalytic performance regarding organic transformations and the environmental concern of organic wastes elimination from wastewater 13 18 organics elimination from wastewater makes use of the distinguished feature of porosity via adsorption as an operating function or as a necessary step for the later organic destroying reactions typically advanced oxidation processes aops involve generating plenty of hydroxyl radicals oh and sulphate radicals so4 to purify water wastewater from organic and to less extent inorganic contaminants via oxidation transforming them to less and even non toxic products aops can be categorized into i hydroxyl radical based ii sulphate radical based iii ozone based iv uv vis based 19 23 v fenton based vi ultrasound assisted and vii and irradiation assisted 24 26 irrespective of homogeneity heterogeneity fenton like aop is another important category for homogenous systems photo fenton oxidation has been presented as an efficient aop for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment 27 similarly heterogeneous fenton catalysts are strong emergent materials for water wastewater purification applications 28 iron based materials are distinguished as heterogeneous fenton catalysts due to low cost negligible toxicity high catalytic activity and ease of recovery 29 33 for example typically a heterogeneous h2o2 assisted fenton system based on a solid iron oxide catalyst goethite generates oh radicals by catalytic decomposition of h2o2 34 recently an inorganic organic hybrid material co modified zif 8 has been synthesized as a cyclic durable efficient catalyst for h2o2 decomposition for oxidative wastewater treatment against an organic dye where h2o2 decomposition occurs via the predominant co ii co iii redox consecutive cyclic reaction both h2o2 decomposition and dye degradation processes were found to obey the pseudo first order kinetic model as the decomposition rate constant and the average mo degradation rate constant were of the same order it was concluded that adapting h2o2 and dye concentrations and catalyst amount is important for a proper decomposition degradation process 35 henceforth in addition to zifs the inorganic organic hybrid material mofs are highly dedicated materials to apply as catalysts for heterogeneous h2o2 assisted fenton like applications currently the use of mofs through mof h2o2 heterogeneous catalysis systems for wastewater treatment against laden organics is a barely growing research topic despite the highly expected efficient elimination of organics via rapid degradation mineralization and possible reusability of the applied mof 35 36 limited publications are found to deal with this specific issue wastewater treatment by mof h2o2 heterogeneous catalysis system is based mainly on catalytic h2o2 decomposition into the active oxidizing intermediate radicals which in sequence reactively destroy the organics 35 in the present work co bdc mof has been revived for a heterogeneous catalysis application because of some inherent properties i hydro stability ii chemical stability under the catalysis harsh reaction condition and iii reactivity towards h2o2 via cyclic redox co bdc was synthesized and characterizations validated product comprising cobalt in mixed valence state co ii and co iii generally these mixed valence oxide clusters mvocs promote a fenton like reaction herein the double valent property of cobalt within co bdc endorses redox decomposition of h2o2 producing oxidative species oh and ho2 which are required for the subsequent degradation of mb 37 herein accordingly co bdc presents an efficacious cyclic redox process which extends its catalysis service period the decomposition of h2o2 was found to obey regular second order modelling with a significant rate constant value 0 3649 mm 1 min 1 mb degradation by co bdc h2o2 heterogeneous system was found fast and obeys pseudo first order important is the effect of both amounts of co bdc and h2o2 while preserving degradation rate dependency on mb concentration 2 experimental 2 1 materials and synthesis of co bdc precursors for co bdc synthesis were of analytical grade and have been used without further purification cobalt nitrate hexahydrate co no3 2 6h2o 98 sigma aldrich and terephthalic acid benzene 1 4 dicarboxylic acid h2bdc 98 sigma aldrich synthesis was applied by a simple solvothermal method where 0 7 mmol terephthalic acid and 0 7 mmol cobalt nitrate hexahydrate were dissolved together as one solution in a beaker containing 50 ml n n dimethylformamide dmf the mixed solution was allowed for continual heating in an oven at 120 c for 24 h where co bdc precipitate was formed 38 beaker was then removed from the oven was left to cool down after that the co bdc precipitate was washed by dmf and ethanol three times respectively and was allowed to dry overnight at about 50 c 2 2 co bdc characterization fourier transform infrared ftir analysis kbr pellet method using jasco ft ir 4100 was applied to explore the chemical structure of co bdc samples the crystalline nature of co bdc samples was characterized using powder x ray diffraction technique pxrd shimadzu xd l x ray photoelectron spectra of co bdc samples xps themo fisher scientific usa were acquired on k alpha with a monochromatic al kα 1486 7 ev brunauer emmett teller bet analysis n2 adsorption nova station a was also performed to determine the surface area of the pristine co bdc scanning electron microscope sem analysis zeiss evo 10 microscopy was utilized to study the surface morphology and to acquire more information about the elemental composition of co bdc 2 3 h2o2 decomposition and mb degradation the rate of h2o2 decomposition by co bdc was first determined to disclose the co bdc efficiency for a such process as efficient h2o2 decomposition is central for the subsequent degradation of the organic contaminants co bdc 0 05 g was added to the h2o2 solution 5 mm 50 ml and the decomposition rate of h2o2 was determined by applying the permanganate titration method 39 for mb degradation experiments co bdc 0 05 g was added to a mixed solution 50 ml containing h2o2 5 mm and a specified concentration of mb 2 5 and 10 ppm where ph was adjusted at 6 5 it is important to mention that the application of ph 6 5 being near neutral was selected to avoid metal ion leaching from co bdc by acidity and to avoid the expected high radicals production by h2o2 due to alkalinity 35 in addition such selection is appropriate to circumvent co bdc surface interaction with acidity or alkalinity because of the probable buffering of terephthalate struts which might affect h2o2 produced oxidative species 40 41 with no agitation or shacking the three different concentrations of mb samples were left in the dark at ambient temperature 27 c degradation experiments were completed in dark conditions to avoid the possible photocatalysis effect due to lab stray lights periodically 10 min 3 ml from each sample was withdrawn to measure the absorbance of mb residue using a uv vis spectrophotometer jasco model 7850 at λ 591 nm the effect of co bdc dosage was also studied 0 01 0 025 0 05 and 0 1 g by applying the same conditions to a selected mb concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 co bdc characterization particles morphology of pristine co bdc is shown in fig 1 a all particles have the same dodecahedron shape with a longitudinal average size of about 2 3 μm no particles of different shapes can be observed which indicates successful synthesis of co bdc of substantial purity fig 1 b displays the xrd patterns of co bdc simulation co bdc before catalysis and co bdc after catalysis 5 catalytic decomposition degradation cycles patterns of co bdc simulation and co bdc before catalysis are almost identical and this also confirms the successful synthesis of pure co bdc 42 from the figure synthesized co bdc shows the known diffraction fingerprint peaks at 2θ of 8 7 11 2 and 16 1 coming from the diffraction planes of 100 110 and 200 respectively 43 co bdc crystallite size according to the scherrer equation was found 24 57 nm 44 patterns of co bdc before catalysis and co bdc after catalysis are also very similar considering diffraction peaks positions this indicates principally that co bdc structural topology survives five cycles of h2o2 treatment yet upon catalysis reduction in counts is observed which may infer some deterioration of co bdc particles fig 1 c displays the ftir spectra of co bdc before and after catalysis the spectrum of co bdc before catalysis shows the characteristic band in the wavenumber range of 1575 1500 cm 1 that is ascribed to asymmetric vibrations of carboxylate groups coo and another peak at 1380 cm 1 that is attributed to symmetric vibrations of carboxylate groups the peak at 3300 cm 1 arose from the stretching vibration oh group of water vapour adsorbed on the surface while the peaks at 3000 3200 cm 1 correspond to the aromatic stretching of ch of the benzene ring 45 the spectrum of co bdc after catalysis shows the same characteristic peaks albeit with weakness which indicates no major chemical change within the co bdc structure catalytic material surface is a principal factor controlling the catalysis efficiency in heterogeneous catalysis as the surface area increases catalysis enhances the n2 adsorption isotherms of the pristine co bdc are shown in fig 1 d where the correspondingly calculated bet surface area was 15 m2 g the inset of fig 2 d shows the pore size distribution calculated by the barrett joyner1halenda bjh method it shows an average pore size value of about 17 5 nm hence in principle this relatively low surface area may lead to a limited h2o2 adsorption role step during the catalysis process however the aimed beneficial double valent functionality of co bdc gives the chance to speed up the required performance for efficient fenton like reactions the increased speed should come from the intimate localization of both co ii and co iii within the co bdc structure in addition although the determined surface area is limited results indicated the competing h2o2 decomposition rate by co bdc and mb degradation rate by co bdc h2o2 system by compared to some other similar functioning catalysts as will be given later this could be due to the molecular size of h2o2 in pm compared to pore size in nm and or the known phenomenon of breathing behaviour of bdc based coordination polymer structures 46 the xps survey spectra of co bdc before catalysis and co bdc after 5 catalysis degradation cycles are shown in fig 2 a and e respectively the interesting chemical stability of co bdc throughout the h2o2 decomposition process is suggested by the existence of the main c1s o1s and co2p core levels before and after catalysis with similar atomic wt percentage abundances before c 65 12 o 28 09 co 6 79 after c 62 08 o 30 69 co 7 23 hence it can be concluded that the five cycles of catalysis have a limited effect on co bdc and present the chemical structure solidity of co bdc against the harsh h2o2 decomposition catalysis condition also it can be suggested that no adsorbed mb remains are present within the co bdc structure after catalysis degradation cycles a recognized small rise in oxygen abundance is observed after catalysis and this is certainly a normal consequence because of the abundant production of oxidizing radicals during catalysis 35 the co bdc samples c1s xps spectra before and after catalysis are shown in fig 2 b f where the shown peaks at 284 46 and 284 44 ev for the before and after catalysis respectively may be attributed to the ligands c c c c groups 47 peaks at 284 75 and 284 65 ev for the before and after catalysis respectively may be attributed to adventitious surface carbon 48 peaks at 288 32 and 288 26 ev for the before and after catalysis respectively are typical of the linkers o c o groups 47 the o 1s core level spectra of the samples before and after catalysis respectively are shown in fig 2 c g these spectra are presenting various remarkable features related to the substantial probable oxygen species the first peak is at 530 88 ev before catalysis and 530 99 ev after catalysis where both are attributed to the metal oxygen coordination coo 49 52 the second observed peaks at the before 531 47 and after 531 65 ev be assigned to oc coordinated acetate 53 57 and it could also be assigned to oxygen in the vicinity of the oxygen defects 58 lastly the observed peaks before 532 09 and after 532 17 ev could be assigned to o h h2o intercalated and incorporated within the structure 49 58 60 furthermore the coo observed band before showed a significant change after catalysis which may be attributed to the loss of the valency heterogeneity of the catalyst as the co2 co3 ratio declined from 1 6 to 1 25 after catalysis importantly fig 2 d h depicts the co2p xps spectra of co bdc before and after catalysis respectively the binding energies for co iii and co ii species respectively are 781 07 and 783 13 ev co bdc before catalysis and 781 and 783 01 ev after catalysis 61 herein although synthesis was starting with the metal ion precursor of co ii the co bdc product structure constitutes co iii 62 63 it was determined that the pristine co bdc catalyst has a co ii co iii ratio of 1 6 for co bdc after catalysis the ratio dropped to 1 25 the fact that co bdc has a higher percentage of co iii than a homogeneous catalyst made of co ii may account for its superior catalytic activity in the reaction with h2o2 herein the xps shows its importance to help in the identification of h2o2 decomposition performance herein co ii co iii cyclic redox process can be suggested due to which oxidative radicals are produced and these radicals are responsible for the subsequent degradation of mb 3 2 decomposition of h2o2 by co bdc the heterogeneous catalytic decomposition of h2o2 usually obeys pseudo first order kinetics for h2o2 64 the integrated form of the pseudo first order equation is given as follows ln h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 o k dec 1 t where k dec min 1 is the h2o2 decomposition rate constant t is the decomposition reaction time h2o2 o and h2o2 is the initial concentration and the concentration of h2o2 at any time t fig 3 a shows the decomposition rate of h2o2 over co bdc where the initial period the first 10 min offered about 70 of h2o2 decomposition modelling by the pseudo first order equation is shown in fig 3 b which presented a poor correlation coefficient hence modelling by regular second order modelling was applied for mb concentration according to the following integral second order equation 1 h 2 o 2 t 1 h 2 o 2 o k dec 2 t where k dec 2 mm 1 min 1 is the h2o2 decomposition rate constant the second order plot is shown in fig 3 c and table 1 summarizes the k dec 2 of the present system co bdc h2o2 along with some other selected h2o2 decomposition heterogeneous systems for comparison from the table k dec 2 equals 0 3649 mm 1 min 1 which validates co bdc as a good candidate for h2o2 decomposition when compared to some other heterogeneous systems it is worth mentioning that h2o2 decomposition obeying the regular second order rate modelling suggests a pure chemical process where physical steps such as diffusions are almost ineffective 35 3 3 degradation of mb by co bdc h2o2 catalysis system fig 4 shows the degradation time profile of mb for the three different initial concentrations 2 5 and 10 ppm considering three mb solution treatment cases for each with h2o2 only with co bdc and with co bdc h2o2 system from the figure and for the three different initial concentrations sole h2o2 treatment had the least effect degrading mb and this should be due to the relative stability of h2o2 without catalyzing decomposition surface i e limited self decomposition however it can be observed that mb degradation slightly increases with mb initial concentration when applying sole co bdc for treatment however removal of mb is better than in the previous case and also shows an increase with initial concentration two alternative pathways may contribute to mb removal in this case i redox pathway due to the oxidative nature of mb or ii physical adsorption pathway which is the more probable occurring interaction because of the negatively charged surface of co bdc obvious and most remarkable is the mb degradation with co bdc h2o2 system herein degradation is considerably higher than the summation of the individual effect of both h2o2 and co bdc which could be considered a sort of synergism 67 for further quantification of the degradation process a pseudo first order rate model was applied for the acquired time profile data sets of mb degradation the known pseudo first order equation is as follows ln mb mb o k deg t where k deg is the mb degradation rate constant t is the reaction time mb o and mb are the initial concentration and the concentration of mb at any time t fig 4 d shows the model plots of mb degradation by co bdc h2o2 for the different mb initial concentrations the plots linearly fit the data sets r 2 0 9498 which reveal the obedience of the mb degradation process to this rate model this obedience should mean that the degradation process depends solely on mb concentration over the applied concentration range 2 to 10 ppm which may entail a pure chemical process 35 the values of the degradation rate constant k deg are given in table 2 where it decreases with initial concentration this decrease could be a result of the less availability of h2o2 resulted radicals as concentration increases under the specific conditions of this set of experiments to augment the understanding effects of both the catalyst and the oxidant as parameters within the heterogenous catalysis system co bdc h2o2 effects of different amounts of co bdc with constant h2o2 and different amounts of h2o2 with constant co bdc on mb degradation were also studied and fig 5 a b shows these degradations time profiles and their corresponding pseudo first order plots for mb initial concentration 5 ppm fig 5 c d table 3 summarizes the outputs of these plots k deg values interestingly a separate increase of co bdc amount same h2o2 concentration and h2o2 concentration same co bdc amount causes a significant increase of k deg this strongly supports the earlier suggested synergism consideration 68 to sum up from rate studies degradation of organic contaminates by fenton like reaction occurs basically via two successive steps 1 h2o2 decomposition producing oxidant radicals and 2 oxidative degradation of contaminates by these radicals hence in principle studying the kinetics of h2o2 decomposition and mb degradation is important for understanding whether the dependency of the whole process is on the decomposition rate of h2o2 or the degradation rate of mb herein kinetics studies revealed that h2o2 decomposition follows the regular second order modelling which could indicate the dependency of h2o2 decomposition on both h2o2 concentration and the number of available active catalytic sites of co bdc the oxo cluster on the other hand mb degradation follows pseudo first order modelling which should indicate the dependency of mb degradation on mb concentration or produced oxidative radicals concentration results revealed that k deg changes with mb initial concentration which means that for any applied concentration produced oxidative radicals are relatively highly abundant another advantage of this study is to depict the degradation process it can be thought that degradation occurs in bulk solution rather than within pores as catalytically produced oxidant radicals within co bdc pores can easily migrate from these pores towards bulk solution due to small size and concentration gradience 35 a comparison of the co bdc h2o2 system with other selected catalyst h2o2 oxidative systems to mb is given in table 4 co bdc h2o2 is competitive for mb laden wastewater 4 reusability and radical scavenging experiments any heterogeneously catalyzed reaction should consider catalyst reusability only a small number of studies have been done yet to determine if powder oxidative catalysts may be reused this could be the case because after degrading processes the catalyst powder is challenging to separate it is straightforward to separate the co bdc catalyst from the degradation solutions in this study either by centrifugation or filtration following each dye degradation test the catalyst was collected at 4000 rpm for 30 min for reuse it was then washed with water and dried at 120 c for 2 h even though the removal efficiency of mb marginally declines as the cycle number increases under the specified conditions adequate catalytic activity is still maintained as illustrated in fig 6a overall oh and ho2 radicals represent the most quantitatively significant active types in the catalytic oxidation process and oh radical in particular is a potent oxidant for a variety of organic molecules scavenging is typically used to determine these radicals function in the degradation process 2 propanol and 1 4 benzoquinone bq are scavengers for the oh and ho2 radicals respectively 71 the reaction medium was supplemented with the right concentrations of these scavengers to collect any oh and ho2 that were present throughout the mb degradation process fig 6b demonstrates that the use of scavengers lowers mb degradation in the presence of 2 propanol and bq respectively from 95 to 9 and from 95 to 6 this supports the concept that these two radicals are responsible for the mb degrading process the results above also show that the availability of oh and ho2 radical species is important for mb degradation suggesting that their availability is crucial for this process considering reusability the stability of co bdc should be regarded two stability perspectives should be considered chemical stability and hydro stability co bdc has been selected to apply in this work specifically for two reasons i the formation of double valency of cobalt within mof structure to make use of the redox process and because of the linker bdc first bdc is a small linker and short length linkers enhance chemical stability second co bdc is a rigid coordination polymer which enhances chemical stability third linkers with relatively low pk a e g carboxylate bdc enhance chemical stability 72 for hydro stability co bdc belongs to bdc based mofs and this type shows negligible dissolution in aqueous medium 73 5 proposed mechanism of h2o2 decomposition by co bdc for the present material co bdc it is important to reveal that cobalt nods as oxo clusters should be the active sites redox active metal ions at which h2o2 molecules decompose 74 these oxo clusters are similar to metal oxides where several examples in the literature have shown that energy barriers for reactions catalyzed by surface sites of these oxides are related to the undercoordinated metal whose reaction energy barriers are lower than the equivalent reactions catalyzed by non defected surfaces 35 75 76 two preliminary conditions may come behind i the structural environment of regular expected presence of some defected co coordination and or bdc unsaturation and ii the aptitude co ii co iii cyclic redox reactions when both situations are available for the synthesized co bdc enhanced redox catalysis should prevail as shown in fig 7 hence the proposed h2o2 decompaction mechanism can be explained as follows i the first condition plays its role through coordinative adsorption of h2o2 with unsaturated co ii and or co iii sites within oxo cluster moieties the limited crystallite size of co bdc nm range gives the chance for the presence of countable amount of defected co coordination unsaturation sites which enables functioning the coordinative adsorption of h2o2 ii the coii h2o2 and or coiii h2o2 complexes are formed via coordination and stabilized via second sphere hydrogen bonding between h2o2 and the phthalate ligand 77 this coordination is an exchange process where h2o2 h2o dynamic adsorption desorption works 35 as mentioned above co bdc has a limited surface area 15 m2 g which should impose a slow h2o2 decomposition process however the concept of dynamic adsorption desorption could be the reason behind the observed fast h2o2 decomposition as k dec 2 value implies it is important to clarify that both h2o and h2o2 can be considered as lewis bases where h2o has one donating oxygen atom and h2o2 has two hence the suggested essential step of this mechanism is what we can call the h2o2 h2o coordination exchange with catalyst surface 78 where h2o2 replaces h2o coordinatively chemisorption process with the catalyst surface in addition the coordinatively unsaturated sites cus are looked upon as electron deficient metal atoms and hence can act as lewis acid sites e g in catalytic reactions commonly mof catalysts employ cus as catalytically active centers cus acts as a lewis acid sites and it will be available to accept electron density from any donor molecule that can be present 79 cluster nodes of co bdc comprise cobalt ions which act as lewis acid sites able to coordinate with both h2o and h2o2 molecules available in solution iii the second condition plays its role through co ii co iii cyclic redox reactions resembling the haber weiss mechanism yet with metal ions complexed within co bdc structure 35 80 and collectively h2o2 adsorption redox mechanism can be given as follows 1 co ii h 2 o h 2 o 2 co ii h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 co ii h 2 o 2 h 2 o co iii h 2 o ho oh 3 co iii h 2 o h 2 o 2 co iii h 2 o 2 h 2 o 4 co iii h 2 o 2 h 2 o co ii h 2 o h ho 2 the catalytic overall decomposition reaction should be 5 2h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o the reactions 1 through 5 continue cycling as long as h2o2 is available it does not matter if the redox mechanism starts with reaction 1 or with reaction 3 as both are strongly suggested because of the mutual presence of both co ii and co iii within the co bdc matrix during the catalysis period as evidenced through xps analysis a condition that is known for the haber weiss mechanism and analogous systems 35 80 the whole steps can be viewed as a single catalyst synergistic catalysis process wherein both h2o coordinative chemisorption and cyclic redox reactions are simultaneously activated by the single catalyst as shown in fig 7 active sites surface to make allowances for a single set of chemical transformation 81 6 conclusions this work presents the successful synthesis of co bdc whose structure presents cobalt with mixed valency co ii co iii this mixed valency allows for efficient cyclic h2o2 decomposition where h2o2 molecules decompose due to a cyclic process cobalt sites can coordinate with both h2o and h2o2 molecules available in solution due to the undercoordination of metal ions and or bdc unsaturation due to the mutual presence of co ii co iii within the co bdc matrix it is possible to propose a single catalyst synergistic catalysis process wherein both h2o coordinative chemisorption and cyclic redox reactions occur the concept of dynamic adsorption desorption could be assumed as the reason behind the observed fast h2o2 decomposition as h2o2 h2o coordination exchange with catalyst surface because of the present coordinatively unsaturated sites and electron deficient metal atoms the cyclic redox process is responsible for the significant availability of oh and ho2 radical species which are central for mb degradation hence the successive catalytic degradation of mb by the h2o2 co bdc system was investigated deeply in this work the decomposition rate constant h2o2 by co bdc k dec 2 was found 0 3649 mm 1 min 1 according to second order modelling which is 4 5 orders of magnitude better than some recently published works mb catalytic degradation by h2o2 co bdc system obeyed the pseudo first order model with rate constant k deg ranging from 0 1116 to 0 0716 min 1 depending on mb initial concentration studies of both h2o2 decomposition and dye degradation rates are important to assign the factor by which the whole process is affected in this study mb initial concentration is the effective factor due to the excessive production of oh ho2 under the applied amount of catalyst and the h2o2 applied concentration moreover the successive use of co bdc for 5 cycle with h2o2 for mb catalytic degradation showed significant stability with a slight decrease in efficiency from 95 to 88 removal which could be due to the gradual shift in co ii co iii ratio from 1 6 to 1 25 as xps revealed finally the proposed mechanism of h2o2 decomposition by co bdc is given based on coordinative adsorption of h2o2 with unsaturated co ii and or co iii sites within oxo cluster moieties followed by the haber weiss like mechanism declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12394,cobalt terephthalate metal organic frameworks co bdc mofs is a well known designed inorganic organic hybrid polymeric material because of its oxo cluster it has a durable and potent capability for cyclic redox applications particularly when synthesis gives cobalt in mixed valency conditions co ii and co iii the mixed valency condition offers a fast redox cycling progression due to the intimate localization of both co ii and co iii within the co bdc structure the oxo cluster and consequently should accelerate h2o2 decomposition hence in this work co bdc mof has been synthesized by the typical solvothermal method and has been characterized via sem edx xrd ftir and xps analyses the most important result of characterizations is that cobalt presents pristinely with mixed valency states co ii co iii to assess its heterogenous catalysis performance co bdc has been applied in combination with h2o2 for an advanced oxidation process aop against a test dye methylene blue mb according to kinetic studies h2o2 decomposition was found to obey the regular second order model with rate constant 0 3649 mm 1 min 1 while mb degradation obeyed the pseudo first order model with rate constant ranges from 0 1116 to 0 0716 min 1 depending on mb initial concentration hence it has been concluded that mb degrades by relatively highly abundant oxidative radicals for the applied h2o2 concentration also a catalytic system where the effects of initial mb concentration 2 5 and 10 ppm and dosage of 10 20 50 and 100 mg of co bdc were investigated according to the results mb degrades well at different doses of co bdc because co ii and co iii coexist in the co bdc matrix a single catalyst synergistic catalysis mechanism may be proposed graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords co bdc h2o2 catalysis decomposition degradation contaminant wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction metal organic frameworks mofs are hybrid material constructed from inorganic and organic constituents functioning as node joint and linker strut respectively the inorganic constituent is a metal ion or cluster mostly of oxo type and the organic constituent is a coordinating ligand 1 synthesis of mofs is usually defined being a self assembly process where some mechanistic molecular steps involve in mof formation 2 the self assembly process is not well understood nevertheless mofs present a set of features that draw immense attraction because of their potentially useful applications these features are related to the three main parts of mofs i the nature of inorganic metal node ii the structure of organic ligand and iii the topology of the framework i e its cages openings tilts etc 3 4 the most important features of mofs in addition to being crystalline in most cases are i chemical stability in many cases ii thermal and or hydro stability in many cases iii ultrahigh well defined porosity up to 90 vacant volume with vast internal surface areas in many cases iv possible presence of the coordinatively unsaturated metal site v readily accessible organic struts vi the chance of post modification and functionalization and vii flexible topological transformability of some mofs responding to various physical and chemical stimuli e g breathing and swelling phenomena as a function of host guest interactions all these features are interesting for many applications 5 7 therefore for about two decades mofs have been an attractive developing contestant for gas storage separation adsorption gaseous liquid phases sensing heat transfer magnetic materials optical devices biomedical applications such as drug delivery heterogeneous catalysis and many other applications 5 8 10 various advantageous properties acclaim using mofs as a practical catalyst i high surface areas ii active site densities per unit volume which deliver high catalytic reaction rates iii possibility of post synthesis modification with catalytic groups and iv possibility for tailoring of pore structures for rapid transportation of reactants products molecules still there are some restrictions for catalysis i possible reactivity of organic constituent to the catalyzed reaction which is a stability concern and ii limited regeneration options because of organic constituent probable sensitivity 11 12 apart from advantages and restrictions applying mofs via heterogeneous catalysis has shown a sturdy catalytic performance regarding organic transformations and the environmental concern of organic wastes elimination from wastewater 13 18 organics elimination from wastewater makes use of the distinguished feature of porosity via adsorption as an operating function or as a necessary step for the later organic destroying reactions typically advanced oxidation processes aops involve generating plenty of hydroxyl radicals oh and sulphate radicals so4 to purify water wastewater from organic and to less extent inorganic contaminants via oxidation transforming them to less and even non toxic products aops can be categorized into i hydroxyl radical based ii sulphate radical based iii ozone based iv uv vis based 19 23 v fenton based vi ultrasound assisted and vii and irradiation assisted 24 26 irrespective of homogeneity heterogeneity fenton like aop is another important category for homogenous systems photo fenton oxidation has been presented as an efficient aop for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment 27 similarly heterogeneous fenton catalysts are strong emergent materials for water wastewater purification applications 28 iron based materials are distinguished as heterogeneous fenton catalysts due to low cost negligible toxicity high catalytic activity and ease of recovery 29 33 for example typically a heterogeneous h2o2 assisted fenton system based on a solid iron oxide catalyst goethite generates oh radicals by catalytic decomposition of h2o2 34 recently an inorganic organic hybrid material co modified zif 8 has been synthesized as a cyclic durable efficient catalyst for h2o2 decomposition for oxidative wastewater treatment against an organic dye where h2o2 decomposition occurs via the predominant co ii co iii redox consecutive cyclic reaction both h2o2 decomposition and dye degradation processes were found to obey the pseudo first order kinetic model as the decomposition rate constant and the average mo degradation rate constant were of the same order it was concluded that adapting h2o2 and dye concentrations and catalyst amount is important for a proper decomposition degradation process 35 henceforth in addition to zifs the inorganic organic hybrid material mofs are highly dedicated materials to apply as catalysts for heterogeneous h2o2 assisted fenton like applications currently the use of mofs through mof h2o2 heterogeneous catalysis systems for wastewater treatment against laden organics is a barely growing research topic despite the highly expected efficient elimination of organics via rapid degradation mineralization and possible reusability of the applied mof 35 36 limited publications are found to deal with this specific issue wastewater treatment by mof h2o2 heterogeneous catalysis system is based mainly on catalytic h2o2 decomposition into the active oxidizing intermediate radicals which in sequence reactively destroy the organics 35 in the present work co bdc mof has been revived for a heterogeneous catalysis application because of some inherent properties i hydro stability ii chemical stability under the catalysis harsh reaction condition and iii reactivity towards h2o2 via cyclic redox co bdc was synthesized and characterizations validated product comprising cobalt in mixed valence state co ii and co iii generally these mixed valence oxide clusters mvocs promote a fenton like reaction herein the double valent property of cobalt within co bdc endorses redox decomposition of h2o2 producing oxidative species oh and ho2 which are required for the subsequent degradation of mb 37 herein accordingly co bdc presents an efficacious cyclic redox process which extends its catalysis service period the decomposition of h2o2 was found to obey regular second order modelling with a significant rate constant value 0 3649 mm 1 min 1 mb degradation by co bdc h2o2 heterogeneous system was found fast and obeys pseudo first order important is the effect of both amounts of co bdc and h2o2 while preserving degradation rate dependency on mb concentration 2 experimental 2 1 materials and synthesis of co bdc precursors for co bdc synthesis were of analytical grade and have been used without further purification cobalt nitrate hexahydrate co no3 2 6h2o 98 sigma aldrich and terephthalic acid benzene 1 4 dicarboxylic acid h2bdc 98 sigma aldrich synthesis was applied by a simple solvothermal method where 0 7 mmol terephthalic acid and 0 7 mmol cobalt nitrate hexahydrate were dissolved together as one solution in a beaker containing 50 ml n n dimethylformamide dmf the mixed solution was allowed for continual heating in an oven at 120 c for 24 h where co bdc precipitate was formed 38 beaker was then removed from the oven was left to cool down after that the co bdc precipitate was washed by dmf and ethanol three times respectively and was allowed to dry overnight at about 50 c 2 2 co bdc characterization fourier transform infrared ftir analysis kbr pellet method using jasco ft ir 4100 was applied to explore the chemical structure of co bdc samples the crystalline nature of co bdc samples was characterized using powder x ray diffraction technique pxrd shimadzu xd l x ray photoelectron spectra of co bdc samples xps themo fisher scientific usa were acquired on k alpha with a monochromatic al kα 1486 7 ev brunauer emmett teller bet analysis n2 adsorption nova station a was also performed to determine the surface area of the pristine co bdc scanning electron microscope sem analysis zeiss evo 10 microscopy was utilized to study the surface morphology and to acquire more information about the elemental composition of co bdc 2 3 h2o2 decomposition and mb degradation the rate of h2o2 decomposition by co bdc was first determined to disclose the co bdc efficiency for a such process as efficient h2o2 decomposition is central for the subsequent degradation of the organic contaminants co bdc 0 05 g was added to the h2o2 solution 5 mm 50 ml and the decomposition rate of h2o2 was determined by applying the permanganate titration method 39 for mb degradation experiments co bdc 0 05 g was added to a mixed solution 50 ml containing h2o2 5 mm and a specified concentration of mb 2 5 and 10 ppm where ph was adjusted at 6 5 it is important to mention that the application of ph 6 5 being near neutral was selected to avoid metal ion leaching from co bdc by acidity and to avoid the expected high radicals production by h2o2 due to alkalinity 35 in addition such selection is appropriate to circumvent co bdc surface interaction with acidity or alkalinity because of the probable buffering of terephthalate struts which might affect h2o2 produced oxidative species 40 41 with no agitation or shacking the three different concentrations of mb samples were left in the dark at ambient temperature 27 c degradation experiments were completed in dark conditions to avoid the possible photocatalysis effect due to lab stray lights periodically 10 min 3 ml from each sample was withdrawn to measure the absorbance of mb residue using a uv vis spectrophotometer jasco model 7850 at λ 591 nm the effect of co bdc dosage was also studied 0 01 0 025 0 05 and 0 1 g by applying the same conditions to a selected mb concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 co bdc characterization particles morphology of pristine co bdc is shown in fig 1 a all particles have the same dodecahedron shape with a longitudinal average size of about 2 3 μm no particles of different shapes can be observed which indicates successful synthesis of co bdc of substantial purity fig 1 b displays the xrd patterns of co bdc simulation co bdc before catalysis and co bdc after catalysis 5 catalytic decomposition degradation cycles patterns of co bdc simulation and co bdc before catalysis are almost identical and this also confirms the successful synthesis of pure co bdc 42 from the figure synthesized co bdc shows the known diffraction fingerprint peaks at 2θ of 8 7 11 2 and 16 1 coming from the diffraction planes of 100 110 and 200 respectively 43 co bdc crystallite size according to the scherrer equation was found 24 57 nm 44 patterns of co bdc before catalysis and co bdc after catalysis are also very similar considering diffraction peaks positions this indicates principally that co bdc structural topology survives five cycles of h2o2 treatment yet upon catalysis reduction in counts is observed which may infer some deterioration of co bdc particles fig 1 c displays the ftir spectra of co bdc before and after catalysis the spectrum of co bdc before catalysis shows the characteristic band in the wavenumber range of 1575 1500 cm 1 that is ascribed to asymmetric vibrations of carboxylate groups coo and another peak at 1380 cm 1 that is attributed to symmetric vibrations of carboxylate groups the peak at 3300 cm 1 arose from the stretching vibration oh group of water vapour adsorbed on the surface while the peaks at 3000 3200 cm 1 correspond to the aromatic stretching of ch of the benzene ring 45 the spectrum of co bdc after catalysis shows the same characteristic peaks albeit with weakness which indicates no major chemical change within the co bdc structure catalytic material surface is a principal factor controlling the catalysis efficiency in heterogeneous catalysis as the surface area increases catalysis enhances the n2 adsorption isotherms of the pristine co bdc are shown in fig 1 d where the correspondingly calculated bet surface area was 15 m2 g the inset of fig 2 d shows the pore size distribution calculated by the barrett joyner1halenda bjh method it shows an average pore size value of about 17 5 nm hence in principle this relatively low surface area may lead to a limited h2o2 adsorption role step during the catalysis process however the aimed beneficial double valent functionality of co bdc gives the chance to speed up the required performance for efficient fenton like reactions the increased speed should come from the intimate localization of both co ii and co iii within the co bdc structure in addition although the determined surface area is limited results indicated the competing h2o2 decomposition rate by co bdc and mb degradation rate by co bdc h2o2 system by compared to some other similar functioning catalysts as will be given later this could be due to the molecular size of h2o2 in pm compared to pore size in nm and or the known phenomenon of breathing behaviour of bdc based coordination polymer structures 46 the xps survey spectra of co bdc before catalysis and co bdc after 5 catalysis degradation cycles are shown in fig 2 a and e respectively the interesting chemical stability of co bdc throughout the h2o2 decomposition process is suggested by the existence of the main c1s o1s and co2p core levels before and after catalysis with similar atomic wt percentage abundances before c 65 12 o 28 09 co 6 79 after c 62 08 o 30 69 co 7 23 hence it can be concluded that the five cycles of catalysis have a limited effect on co bdc and present the chemical structure solidity of co bdc against the harsh h2o2 decomposition catalysis condition also it can be suggested that no adsorbed mb remains are present within the co bdc structure after catalysis degradation cycles a recognized small rise in oxygen abundance is observed after catalysis and this is certainly a normal consequence because of the abundant production of oxidizing radicals during catalysis 35 the co bdc samples c1s xps spectra before and after catalysis are shown in fig 2 b f where the shown peaks at 284 46 and 284 44 ev for the before and after catalysis respectively may be attributed to the ligands c c c c groups 47 peaks at 284 75 and 284 65 ev for the before and after catalysis respectively may be attributed to adventitious surface carbon 48 peaks at 288 32 and 288 26 ev for the before and after catalysis respectively are typical of the linkers o c o groups 47 the o 1s core level spectra of the samples before and after catalysis respectively are shown in fig 2 c g these spectra are presenting various remarkable features related to the substantial probable oxygen species the first peak is at 530 88 ev before catalysis and 530 99 ev after catalysis where both are attributed to the metal oxygen coordination coo 49 52 the second observed peaks at the before 531 47 and after 531 65 ev be assigned to oc coordinated acetate 53 57 and it could also be assigned to oxygen in the vicinity of the oxygen defects 58 lastly the observed peaks before 532 09 and after 532 17 ev could be assigned to o h h2o intercalated and incorporated within the structure 49 58 60 furthermore the coo observed band before showed a significant change after catalysis which may be attributed to the loss of the valency heterogeneity of the catalyst as the co2 co3 ratio declined from 1 6 to 1 25 after catalysis importantly fig 2 d h depicts the co2p xps spectra of co bdc before and after catalysis respectively the binding energies for co iii and co ii species respectively are 781 07 and 783 13 ev co bdc before catalysis and 781 and 783 01 ev after catalysis 61 herein although synthesis was starting with the metal ion precursor of co ii the co bdc product structure constitutes co iii 62 63 it was determined that the pristine co bdc catalyst has a co ii co iii ratio of 1 6 for co bdc after catalysis the ratio dropped to 1 25 the fact that co bdc has a higher percentage of co iii than a homogeneous catalyst made of co ii may account for its superior catalytic activity in the reaction with h2o2 herein the xps shows its importance to help in the identification of h2o2 decomposition performance herein co ii co iii cyclic redox process can be suggested due to which oxidative radicals are produced and these radicals are responsible for the subsequent degradation of mb 3 2 decomposition of h2o2 by co bdc the heterogeneous catalytic decomposition of h2o2 usually obeys pseudo first order kinetics for h2o2 64 the integrated form of the pseudo first order equation is given as follows ln h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 o k dec 1 t where k dec min 1 is the h2o2 decomposition rate constant t is the decomposition reaction time h2o2 o and h2o2 is the initial concentration and the concentration of h2o2 at any time t fig 3 a shows the decomposition rate of h2o2 over co bdc where the initial period the first 10 min offered about 70 of h2o2 decomposition modelling by the pseudo first order equation is shown in fig 3 b which presented a poor correlation coefficient hence modelling by regular second order modelling was applied for mb concentration according to the following integral second order equation 1 h 2 o 2 t 1 h 2 o 2 o k dec 2 t where k dec 2 mm 1 min 1 is the h2o2 decomposition rate constant the second order plot is shown in fig 3 c and table 1 summarizes the k dec 2 of the present system co bdc h2o2 along with some other selected h2o2 decomposition heterogeneous systems for comparison from the table k dec 2 equals 0 3649 mm 1 min 1 which validates co bdc as a good candidate for h2o2 decomposition when compared to some other heterogeneous systems it is worth mentioning that h2o2 decomposition obeying the regular second order rate modelling suggests a pure chemical process where physical steps such as diffusions are almost ineffective 35 3 3 degradation of mb by co bdc h2o2 catalysis system fig 4 shows the degradation time profile of mb for the three different initial concentrations 2 5 and 10 ppm considering three mb solution treatment cases for each with h2o2 only with co bdc and with co bdc h2o2 system from the figure and for the three different initial concentrations sole h2o2 treatment had the least effect degrading mb and this should be due to the relative stability of h2o2 without catalyzing decomposition surface i e limited self decomposition however it can be observed that mb degradation slightly increases with mb initial concentration when applying sole co bdc for treatment however removal of mb is better than in the previous case and also shows an increase with initial concentration two alternative pathways may contribute to mb removal in this case i redox pathway due to the oxidative nature of mb or ii physical adsorption pathway which is the more probable occurring interaction because of the negatively charged surface of co bdc obvious and most remarkable is the mb degradation with co bdc h2o2 system herein degradation is considerably higher than the summation of the individual effect of both h2o2 and co bdc which could be considered a sort of synergism 67 for further quantification of the degradation process a pseudo first order rate model was applied for the acquired time profile data sets of mb degradation the known pseudo first order equation is as follows ln mb mb o k deg t where k deg is the mb degradation rate constant t is the reaction time mb o and mb are the initial concentration and the concentration of mb at any time t fig 4 d shows the model plots of mb degradation by co bdc h2o2 for the different mb initial concentrations the plots linearly fit the data sets r 2 0 9498 which reveal the obedience of the mb degradation process to this rate model this obedience should mean that the degradation process depends solely on mb concentration over the applied concentration range 2 to 10 ppm which may entail a pure chemical process 35 the values of the degradation rate constant k deg are given in table 2 where it decreases with initial concentration this decrease could be a result of the less availability of h2o2 resulted radicals as concentration increases under the specific conditions of this set of experiments to augment the understanding effects of both the catalyst and the oxidant as parameters within the heterogenous catalysis system co bdc h2o2 effects of different amounts of co bdc with constant h2o2 and different amounts of h2o2 with constant co bdc on mb degradation were also studied and fig 5 a b shows these degradations time profiles and their corresponding pseudo first order plots for mb initial concentration 5 ppm fig 5 c d table 3 summarizes the outputs of these plots k deg values interestingly a separate increase of co bdc amount same h2o2 concentration and h2o2 concentration same co bdc amount causes a significant increase of k deg this strongly supports the earlier suggested synergism consideration 68 to sum up from rate studies degradation of organic contaminates by fenton like reaction occurs basically via two successive steps 1 h2o2 decomposition producing oxidant radicals and 2 oxidative degradation of contaminates by these radicals hence in principle studying the kinetics of h2o2 decomposition and mb degradation is important for understanding whether the dependency of the whole process is on the decomposition rate of h2o2 or the degradation rate of mb herein kinetics studies revealed that h2o2 decomposition follows the regular second order modelling which could indicate the dependency of h2o2 decomposition on both h2o2 concentration and the number of available active catalytic sites of co bdc the oxo cluster on the other hand mb degradation follows pseudo first order modelling which should indicate the dependency of mb degradation on mb concentration or produced oxidative radicals concentration results revealed that k deg changes with mb initial concentration which means that for any applied concentration produced oxidative radicals are relatively highly abundant another advantage of this study is to depict the degradation process it can be thought that degradation occurs in bulk solution rather than within pores as catalytically produced oxidant radicals within co bdc pores can easily migrate from these pores towards bulk solution due to small size and concentration gradience 35 a comparison of the co bdc h2o2 system with other selected catalyst h2o2 oxidative systems to mb is given in table 4 co bdc h2o2 is competitive for mb laden wastewater 4 reusability and radical scavenging experiments any heterogeneously catalyzed reaction should consider catalyst reusability only a small number of studies have been done yet to determine if powder oxidative catalysts may be reused this could be the case because after degrading processes the catalyst powder is challenging to separate it is straightforward to separate the co bdc catalyst from the degradation solutions in this study either by centrifugation or filtration following each dye degradation test the catalyst was collected at 4000 rpm for 30 min for reuse it was then washed with water and dried at 120 c for 2 h even though the removal efficiency of mb marginally declines as the cycle number increases under the specified conditions adequate catalytic activity is still maintained as illustrated in fig 6a overall oh and ho2 radicals represent the most quantitatively significant active types in the catalytic oxidation process and oh radical in particular is a potent oxidant for a variety of organic molecules scavenging is typically used to determine these radicals function in the degradation process 2 propanol and 1 4 benzoquinone bq are scavengers for the oh and ho2 radicals respectively 71 the reaction medium was supplemented with the right concentrations of these scavengers to collect any oh and ho2 that were present throughout the mb degradation process fig 6b demonstrates that the use of scavengers lowers mb degradation in the presence of 2 propanol and bq respectively from 95 to 9 and from 95 to 6 this supports the concept that these two radicals are responsible for the mb degrading process the results above also show that the availability of oh and ho2 radical species is important for mb degradation suggesting that their availability is crucial for this process considering reusability the stability of co bdc should be regarded two stability perspectives should be considered chemical stability and hydro stability co bdc has been selected to apply in this work specifically for two reasons i the formation of double valency of cobalt within mof structure to make use of the redox process and because of the linker bdc first bdc is a small linker and short length linkers enhance chemical stability second co bdc is a rigid coordination polymer which enhances chemical stability third linkers with relatively low pk a e g carboxylate bdc enhance chemical stability 72 for hydro stability co bdc belongs to bdc based mofs and this type shows negligible dissolution in aqueous medium 73 5 proposed mechanism of h2o2 decomposition by co bdc for the present material co bdc it is important to reveal that cobalt nods as oxo clusters should be the active sites redox active metal ions at which h2o2 molecules decompose 74 these oxo clusters are similar to metal oxides where several examples in the literature have shown that energy barriers for reactions catalyzed by surface sites of these oxides are related to the undercoordinated metal whose reaction energy barriers are lower than the equivalent reactions catalyzed by non defected surfaces 35 75 76 two preliminary conditions may come behind i the structural environment of regular expected presence of some defected co coordination and or bdc unsaturation and ii the aptitude co ii co iii cyclic redox reactions when both situations are available for the synthesized co bdc enhanced redox catalysis should prevail as shown in fig 7 hence the proposed h2o2 decompaction mechanism can be explained as follows i the first condition plays its role through coordinative adsorption of h2o2 with unsaturated co ii and or co iii sites within oxo cluster moieties the limited crystallite size of co bdc nm range gives the chance for the presence of countable amount of defected co coordination unsaturation sites which enables functioning the coordinative adsorption of h2o2 ii the coii h2o2 and or coiii h2o2 complexes are formed via coordination and stabilized via second sphere hydrogen bonding between h2o2 and the phthalate ligand 77 this coordination is an exchange process where h2o2 h2o dynamic adsorption desorption works 35 as mentioned above co bdc has a limited surface area 15 m2 g which should impose a slow h2o2 decomposition process however the concept of dynamic adsorption desorption could be the reason behind the observed fast h2o2 decomposition as k dec 2 value implies it is important to clarify that both h2o and h2o2 can be considered as lewis bases where h2o has one donating oxygen atom and h2o2 has two hence the suggested essential step of this mechanism is what we can call the h2o2 h2o coordination exchange with catalyst surface 78 where h2o2 replaces h2o coordinatively chemisorption process with the catalyst surface in addition the coordinatively unsaturated sites cus are looked upon as electron deficient metal atoms and hence can act as lewis acid sites e g in catalytic reactions commonly mof catalysts employ cus as catalytically active centers cus acts as a lewis acid sites and it will be available to accept electron density from any donor molecule that can be present 79 cluster nodes of co bdc comprise cobalt ions which act as lewis acid sites able to coordinate with both h2o and h2o2 molecules available in solution iii the second condition plays its role through co ii co iii cyclic redox reactions resembling the haber weiss mechanism yet with metal ions complexed within co bdc structure 35 80 and collectively h2o2 adsorption redox mechanism can be given as follows 1 co ii h 2 o h 2 o 2 co ii h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 co ii h 2 o 2 h 2 o co iii h 2 o ho oh 3 co iii h 2 o h 2 o 2 co iii h 2 o 2 h 2 o 4 co iii h 2 o 2 h 2 o co ii h 2 o h ho 2 the catalytic overall decomposition reaction should be 5 2h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o the reactions 1 through 5 continue cycling as long as h2o2 is available it does not matter if the redox mechanism starts with reaction 1 or with reaction 3 as both are strongly suggested because of the mutual presence of both co ii and co iii within the co bdc matrix during the catalysis period as evidenced through xps analysis a condition that is known for the haber weiss mechanism and analogous systems 35 80 the whole steps can be viewed as a single catalyst synergistic catalysis process wherein both h2o coordinative chemisorption and cyclic redox reactions are simultaneously activated by the single catalyst as shown in fig 7 active sites surface to make allowances for a single set of chemical transformation 81 6 conclusions this work presents the successful synthesis of co bdc whose structure presents cobalt with mixed valency co ii co iii this mixed valency allows for efficient cyclic h2o2 decomposition where h2o2 molecules decompose due to a cyclic process cobalt sites can coordinate with both h2o and h2o2 molecules available in solution due to the undercoordination of metal ions and or bdc unsaturation due to the mutual presence of co ii co iii within the co bdc matrix it is possible to propose a single catalyst synergistic catalysis process wherein both h2o coordinative chemisorption and cyclic redox reactions occur the concept of dynamic adsorption desorption could be assumed as the reason behind the observed fast h2o2 decomposition as h2o2 h2o coordination exchange with catalyst surface because of the present coordinatively unsaturated sites and electron deficient metal atoms the cyclic redox process is responsible for the significant availability of oh and ho2 radical species which are central for mb degradation hence the successive catalytic degradation of mb by the h2o2 co bdc system was investigated deeply in this work the decomposition rate constant h2o2 by co bdc k dec 2 was found 0 3649 mm 1 min 1 according to second order modelling which is 4 5 orders of magnitude better than some recently published works mb catalytic degradation by h2o2 co bdc system obeyed the pseudo first order model with rate constant k deg ranging from 0 1116 to 0 0716 min 1 depending on mb initial concentration studies of both h2o2 decomposition and dye degradation rates are important to assign the factor by which the whole process is affected in this study mb initial concentration is the effective factor due to the excessive production of oh ho2 under the applied amount of catalyst and the h2o2 applied concentration moreover the successive use of co bdc for 5 cycle with h2o2 for mb catalytic degradation showed significant stability with a slight decrease in efficiency from 95 to 88 removal which could be due to the gradual shift in co ii co iii ratio from 1 6 to 1 25 as xps revealed finally the proposed mechanism of h2o2 decomposition by co bdc is given based on coordinative adsorption of h2o2 with unsaturated co ii and or co iii sites within oxo cluster moieties
