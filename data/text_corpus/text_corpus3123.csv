15615,this study aimed to provide insights into the risk posed by psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in european surface waters and to identify current knowledge gaps hampering this risk assessment first the availability and quality of data on the concentrations of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in surface waters occurrence and on the toxicity to aquatic organisms hazard were reviewed if both occurrence and ecotoxicity data were available risk quotients risk were calculated where abundant ecotoxicity data were available a species sensitivity distribution ssd was constructed from which the hazardous concentration for 5 of the species hc5 was derived allowing to derive integrated multi species risks a total of 702 compounds were categorised as psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs based on a combination of all 502 anatomical therapeutic class atc n pharmaceuticals and a list of illicit drugs according to the dutch opium act of these 343 49 returned occurrence data while only 105 15 returned ecotoxicity data moreover many ecotoxicity tests used irrelevant endpoints for neurologically active compounds such as mortality which may underestimate the hazard of psychopharmaceuticals due to data limitations risks could only be assessed for 87 12 compounds with 23 3 3 compounds indicating a potential risk and several highly prescribed drugs returned neither occurrence nor ecotoxicity data primary bottlenecks in risk calculation included the lack of ecotoxicity data a lack of diversity of test species and ecotoxicological end points and large disparities between well studied and understudied compounds for both occurrence and toxicity data this study identified which compounds merit concern as well as the many compounds that lack the data for any calculation of risk driving research priorities despite the large knowledge gaps we concluded that the presence of a substantial part 26 of data rich psychopharmaceuticals in surface waters present an ecological risk for aquatic non target organisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords psychopharmaceuticals illicit drugs occurrence hazard risk surface water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction psychoactive pharmaceuticals psychopharmaceuticals are a class of pharmaceuticals primarily used to treat mental disorders and illnesses as well as other conditions relating to the nervous system such as analgesics painkillers and anaesthetics these psychopharmaceuticals are vital for our modern society and their use has been steeply increasing around the world due to a multitude of factors such as growing number of psychopharmaceutical based treatments growing global access to psychopharmaceuticals growing global population an ageing population in several regions loss of social stigma and increased availability of mental health treatment european medicines agency 2021 gao et al 2013 massey et al 2018 read et al 2014 world health organization 2011 psychopharmaceuticals often alter the neurochemistry of the brain by changing the concentrations and uptake of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine and or by agonising or antagonising specific receptors jozwiak bebenista and nowak 2014 wrobel 2007 however their activity is not limited to the brain such as in the case of analgesics which work on the nervous system ghanem et al 2016 graham and scott 2005 jozwiak bebenista and nowak 2014 in 1976 the who created the anatomical therapeutic chemical atc classification system a systematic approach to classify pharmaceuticals into therapeutic groupings based on the organ or biological system on which they act as well as on their pharmacological and chemical properties otherwise known as the mechanism of action moa the atc system distinguishes 14 categories in which psychopharmaceuticals are classified with atcn standing for nervous system who collaborating centre for drug statistics methodology 2018 of the over 4000 pharmaceuticals administered worldwide 502 belong to the atcn class wishart et al 2018 in addition to psychopharmaceuticals illicit drugs such as stimulants dissociatives hallucinogenics illicit opioids and cannabinoids can have strong effects on the nervous system as well having a similar moa as psychopharmaceuticals yet studies on illicit drugs tend to consider these in isolation e g deng et al 2020 huizer et al 2021 li et al 2016 thomas et al 2012 even though some illicit compounds are screened as candidates for therapeutic uses e g ketamine cannabis mdma aan het rot et al 2012 ebbert et al 2018 krystal et al 2019 mathew et al 2008 sessa 2017 hence it makes sense to jointly assess the presence hazard and risks of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in the aquatic environment increased use has led to the widespread occurrence of psychopharmaceuticals and their transformation products in the aquatic environment aus der beek et al 2016 pharmaceuticals have been reported in the aquatic environment since the 1960s stumm zollinger and fair 1965 but specific concern for psychopharmaceuticals was only raised in the late 1990s daughton and ternes 1999 halling sørensen et al 1998 consequently there has been a significant increase in the amount of data on the occurrence of psychopharmaceuticals and their transformation products in surface waters attributed also to advancements in analytical techniques such as lchrms heberer 2002 luo et al 2014 ort et al 2014 richardson 2007 which can detect pharmaceuticals in the ng to pg l range e g zrnčić et al 2014 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are a major source of psychopharmaceutical and illicit drug residues entering the environment to such a point that wastewater has become a frequently studied medium to reveal drug use trends in the connected populations deng et al 2020 huizer et al 2021 ort et al 2014 ter laak et al 2010 van nuijs et al 2011 currently up to 60 70 of the consumed pharmaceuticals illicit drugs and the respective transformation products are not removed by wwtps and end up in surface waters depending on the physico chemical properties of the compounds and the setup of the wwtp once in the aquatic environment the fate and persistence of psychopharmaceuticals can vary considerably between the different compounds with some degrading very quickly which are therefore not being detected in the environment while some others have reported half lives t 1 2 that can exceed one year for example carbamazepine has a t 1 2 of 2400 10 000 h while paracetamol has a t 1 2 of 40 350 h andreozzi et al 2003 yamamoto et al 2009 zou et al 2015 this is however an understudied field bu et al 2016 emphasising the need to further study the fate of psycho pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment whether or not the presence of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in the aquatic environment leads to adverse effects on non target species typically depends on their sensitivity to these compounds since the neural and nervous architecture of humans is shared across many different organisms that deviated in evolutionarily terms eons ago edsinger and dölen 2018 weiger 1997 psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs designed to interact with the human nervous system may also successfully interact with the nervous system of non target organisms with potential negative ecological impacts claessens et al 2013 schwarz et al 2021 wang et al 2021 for example antidepressants can affect predatory behaviour in bass impacts tissue metabolic capacities and may compromise the adaptive responses in trout when accumulated through gills or through the food chain best et al 2014 bisesi et al 2016 2014 adverse effects of illicit drugs have also been observed but are considerably less studied than the effects of conventional pharmaceuticals mohan et al 2021 outside the aquatic environment acute effects of psychopharmaceuticals such as changes in physiology and foraging behaviour have been reported for birds bean et al 2014 which are susceptible to exposure through the food chain bean et al 2018 lazarus et al 2015 as well as through direct exposure to sewage sludge bean et al 2014 beyond ecological effects there is also concern about human safety kümmerer 2010 because of the presence of psychopharmaceuticals in drinking water baken et al 2018 houtman et al 2014 and in vegetables grown using recycled water fu et al 2019 goldstein et al 2014 kim et al 2017 paltiel et al 2016 both psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs have the potential to disrupt so called infochemicals which are compounds used for intra species communications e g navigation predator avoidance mating behaviour etc since psychopharmaceuticals can mimic natural infochemicals in structure van donk et al 2016 vera chang et al 2018 therefore endpoints that derive from neurological and infochemical interactions are more sensitive than the classical endpoints i e mortality growth and reproduction and are likely to be of high ecological relevance for compounds that produce these effects despite the increasing amount of pharmaceuticals psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs present in the environment the number of studies on their occurrence hazards and risks has been relatively stagnant when compared to other drivers of ecological changes such as habitat loss and climate change bernhardt et al 2017 in addition the focus is often on the same few psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs e g carbamazepine paracetamol fluoxetine rather than on the newer or more used compounds such as escitalopram elsevier b v 2020a 2020b it is therefore of utmost importance to determine the contribution of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs to the presently ongoing degradation of environmental quality by assessing the environmental risk posed by these chemicals and to put such risks into context by using metrics such as prescription data ecological risk assessments are used to determine which compounds merit concern by weighing the concentrations in the environment occurrence and the effect concentrations hazard to produce risk quotients rqs which informs of the likelihood of effects occurring in the environment under this system an rq of 1 or higher means that the concentration of a compound in the environment has surpassed the minimum concentration to expect ecotoxic effects averaging the calculated rqs for all species for which ecotoxicity data are available provides a median risk for a specific compound species level risk alternatively when sufficient ecotoxicity data are available species sensitivity distributions ssds can be generated which integrate all available ecotoxicity data allowing the derivation of the hazardous concentration for 5 of the species hc5 which is then entered into the rq calculations instead of the species specific effect concentrations hence this method can be considered as an integrated m species risk assessment posthuma et al 2001 however ssds require extensive ecotoxicity data to be considered robust and multiple taxonomic groups to be considered more representative of natural communities wheeler et al 2002 european commission 2018 therefore deriving an ssd may only be feasible for a limited number of data rich compounds despite the rise in the use of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs scientific attention to the presence in the environment ecotoxicological hazards and environmental risks of these compounds is still rather limited currently reliable environmental risk assessments are hampered by a limited insight into the availability of data on the occurrence in the aquatic environment and the hazard to non target organisms therefore the aim of the present study was to review the data on occurrence and ecotoxicological hazard of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in european surface waters paying attention to the accompanying uncertainties and knowledge gaps to this end we provided an ecological risk assessment of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in european surface waters by weighing their occurrence and hazard we contextualised these risks using dutch prescription data 2 methods 2 1 selection and classification of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs we based our selection of psychopharmaceuticals on the atcn list of 502 chemicals who collaborating centre for drug statistics methodology 2018 illicit drugs such as stimulants dissociatives hallucinogenics illicit opioids and cannabinoids were added to this list by using the opium act of the netherlands containing 282 illicit compounds illicit and recreational drugs such as caffeine nicotine cocaine thc and amphetamines were merged to make a stimulants illicits class since the atc categories of these select compounds e g cocaine as an anaesthetic were deemed inappropriate since the atcn list also includes compounds that are used as illicit drugs e g opioids duplicates were removed the resulting list totalled to 702 compounds tables 1 s1 cas numbers were obtained from drugbank and pubchem kim et al 2021 wishart et al 2018 2 2 occurrence data retrieval filtering and confidence score to retrieve data on the occurrence of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in surface waters the eu s ipchem monitoring platform european commission 2021 was used which contains 18 environmental occurrence databases four of these databases contained psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs and data were extracted in july 2021 table s2 these four databases were the german uba pharmaceuticals in the environment database eike et al 2019 the norman network database norman network of reference laboratories 2021 the french naïades database naïades 2020 and the eu waterbase database eea 2021 in addition we were given access to two dutch databases that were not represented in ipchem these were the wkp rijkswaterstaat 2021 and the riwa databases riwa rijn 2021 to maximise the amount of data collected the top 50 most prescribed drugs in the netherlands from 2015 to 2020 zorginstituut nederland 2021 that did not have data in the aforementioned databases were manually searched for in literature by using the search terms drug name environmental environment occurrence detection detected surface water in google scholar in june 2021 occurrence data were filtered for european surface waters only table s3 removing values for other water matrices such as sewage effluent groundwater etc false positives such as nitrophenol being confused with phenol by search engines were also removed if the database flagged any data as questionable these data were not used outliers that were unusual or unrealistically high values e g 1 1011 mg l were either verified when the original source agreed with the database corrected when the source disagreed with the database or else deleted if the original source was unavailable upon merging the data from the six databases any duplicates were removed by inspecting sources monitoring locations monitoring location codes and dates for all data below the limit of detection lod the 90th percentile was calculated for all lod data per compound weltje and sumpter 2017 which helped to provide enough data to calculate the risk for compounds for which all data were lod an occurrence data confidence score was created as an indication of the amount and range of environmental occurrence data per compound since not all compounds have the same quantity and diversity of occurrence data this will serve as an indication of data quantity and diversity it should be noted that the occurrence confidence score was made before the lod adjustments meaning that values below or above the lod are treated equally in the confidence assessment the total score was calculated from 3 sub scores the number of entries measurement frequency countries spatial distribution and years temporal distribution occu rence score entr ies 57 coun tries 12 years 2 equation 1 occurrence data scoring system with entries 57 countries 12 and years 2 these numbers are the median values for each of those categories see tables s5 and s7 i e the median number of entries was 57 the median number of countries was 12 and the median number of years was 2 2 3 ecotoxicity data retrieval filtering and confidence score ecotoxicity data were extracted from the us epa ecotox knowledgebase epa 2013 and the german uba etox database umweltbundesamt 2008 in july 2021 in all cases both compound names and cas numbers were used as search criteria in addition the top 50 most prescribed drugs in the netherlands in the years 2015 to 2020 zorginstituut nederland 2021 that did not have data in the aforementioned databases were manually searched for in literature by using the search terms drug name ecotoxicity ecotoxicology in google scholar in june 2021 ecotoxicity studies with no results no stated endpoint or irrelevant endpoints i e bioaccumulation factors were removed to maximise the usable data values recorded as below or above lowest or highest test concentration were adjusted to the lowest or highest test concentration respectively e g 1 μg became 1 μg and 1 μg became 1 μg outliers that were unusual or unrealistic were either verified when the original source agreed with the database corrected when the source disagreed with the database or else deleted if the original source was unavailable for studies that reported multiple endpoints per compound only the most sensitive relevant endpoint was used to avoid cases for which studies with multiple endpoints held a greater weight than studies with a single endpoint the ecotoxicity data included many different measures of toxicity including ecx effective concentration lcx lethal concentration loec lowest observed effect concentration noec no observed effect concentration and matc maximum acceptable toxicant concentration to maximise the amount of usable data these were extrapolated to either acute ec50 values effective concentration for 50 of the exposed organisms or to chronic noec values no observed effect concentration following the methods for extrapolation described by posthuma 2019 to this end the first step was to categorise datapoints as either chronic or acute following the criteria of ecetoc 1993 table s4 with acute and sub chronic ecotoxicity data being merged as acute table s4 secondly all measures of toxicity were put into two categories noec or ec50 based on the original measure of toxicity see posthuma et al 2019 these two steps yielded four categories of data acute noec chronic noec acute ec50 and chronic ec50 acute noec values were multiplied by 1 3 to give chronic noec values and chronic ec50 values were multiplied by 3 to give acute ec50 values this resulted in two final data categories the extrapolated chronic noec denoted as cnoec and the extrapolated acute ec50 denoted as aec50 ecotoxicity data which were then used for all further analyses in the study if enough ecotoxicity data were available ssds were generated to derive hc5 values allowing for an integrated multispecies measure of the hazard of that specific compound to avoid that lacking ecotoxicity data hampered our analysis ssds were constructed based on a minimum number of 5 data points using the us epa ssd generator epa 2016 different ssds were produced for cnoec and aec50 values ahc5 acute and chc5 chronic hc5 values defined as the hazardous concentration for 5 of species were derived from the ssd plots of the respective compounds in order to assess the quantity and diversity of the ecotoxicity data per compound we assigned a confidence score to each compound s chc5 ahc5 cnoec and aec50 values based on the tg27 criteria european commission 2018 for each compound we scored the number of datapoints out of a maximum of 10 and for taxa out of a maximum of 8 these were then multiplied to create an ecotoxicity data score between 0 and 1 equation 2 ecot oxic ity score entr ies 10 taxa 8 equation 2 ecotoxicity data scoring system with entries 10 and taxa 8 based on tg27 criteria 2 4 ecological risk assessment and confidence scores by weighing the occurrence and ecotoxicity data the ecological risk for each compound was assessed two dimensional matrices of risk quotients rqs were created where each occurrence value was divided by each aec50 cnoec ahc5 or chc5 value per compound consequently each compound could have up to four associated rq matrices to compare the effect of including the 90th percentile of the lod data see 2 2 risk matrices were also made without the lod data r q c o n c e n t r a t i o n i n t h e e n v i r o n m e n t e f f e c t c o n c e n t r a t i o n equation 3 calculation of risk quotients rqs where effect concentration can be aec50 cnoec ahc5 or chc5 values the calculated rqs were then plotted in a logarithmic boxplot and the percentage of rq 1 was determined indicating a potential risk a risk confidence score was calculated for each type of the four risk analysis using the following formula risk score occu rence score ecot oxic ity score equation 4 calculation of risk confidence score all confidence scores were simplified into 5 categories table 2 ecotoxicity data uses an adjusted lower boundary due to the nature of the scoring system described in 2 3 all numerical confidence scores can be found in the supplementary information table s9 2 5 statistical analyses pearson correlations were performed to assess relations between dutch prescription data zorginstituut nederland 2021 and other variables namely occurrence occurrence data quantity i e raw number of entries per compound occurrence data confidence ecotoxicity ecotoxicity data quantity ecotoxicity data confidence and risk a second series of pearson correlations were performed to assess relations between risk both cnoec and aec50 and these same variables these correlations were log transformed and performed using native excel functions with formulae embedded in table s10 t tests were performed on the cumulative data for occurrence cnoec and aec50 data per compound class to test for significance between compound classes using native excel functions table s11 3 results and discussion 3 1 data availability for the selected compounds for 343 out of 702 49 of compounds occurrence data were reported in european surface waters but for 194 28 of the total or 57 of the number of compounds with occurrence data the concentration in the environment was below the lod leaving 149 compounds 21 with at least one occurrence datapoint above the lod only for 105 psychopharmaceuticals 15 ecotoxicity data were available immediately highlighting that ecotoxicity data were even less available than occurrence data only for 87 12 compounds both occurrence and ecotoxicity data were available allowing for a risk assessment an overview of occurrence ecotoxicity and risk data can be found in tables s5 s6 and s7 respectively the norman database provided most of the occurrence data in this study table 3 because it includes both literature studies and monitoring data we noticed that there is a lack of parity between the multi national occurrence databases most notably the uba norman and waterbase databases which contain outdated references to each other waterbase riwa wkp and naïades returned relatively low amounts of data likely because these are general monitoring databases which focus on other contaminants this highlights the low priority of psychopharmaceuticals compared to legacy contaminants such as solvents and persistent organic pollutants the occurrence literature search did not return any additional results for the countries included in this study table s3 considering that the epa and uba databases are both collections of current ecotoxicity literature there was a large lack of parity between the two ecotoxicity databases with the epa database being far larger than the uba database moreover additional ecotoxicity data were found during the present literature search 3 2 occurrence of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in european surface waters over half of all psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs did not return occurrence data fig 1 of the 343 49 psychopharmaceuticals occurrence data was available only 52 7 compounds had the highest possible occurrence data confidence while for almost all others 278 40 the confidence was medium or lower table s5 for 340 compounds the concentration was below the lod and so the 90th percentile procedure was used for those datapoints fig 1 lithium presented by far the highest median concentration 0 016 mg l likely due to its natural occurrence as a mineral in addition common solvents such as diethyl ether trichloroethylene and phenol were also present in high median concentrations due to uses in other applications such as industrial solvents common analgesics such as paracetamol salicylamide salicylic acid aspirin and ibuprofen as well as carbamazepine were also present in high concentrations fig s5 the low number of data entries per compound contributed most to the generally low occurrence confidence when compared to the number of countries and years this indicates that there is a large disparity between well studied and understudied compounds in terms of raw data with five compounds caffeine carbamazepine chloroform trichloroethylene and ibuprofen out of 702 compounds accounting for over 50 of all occurrence data table s5 with caffeine alone accounting for almost 20 of positive detection data importantly occurrence data were missing for common and highly prescribed compounds such as betahistine pyridostigmine and distigmine tables s5 s8 for the illicit compounds 127 out of 199 did not return any occurrence data which were often obscure new psychoactive substances or smartdrugs table s5 castiglioni et al 2021 weinstein et al 2017 other compounds without data included discontinued psychopharmaceuticals such as hexapropymate metamizole and iproniazid mean occurrence concentration occurrence data quantity and occurrence data confidence all showed a positive relation to dutch prescription data conc r 0 207 p 0 015 quant r 0 234 p 0 006 conf r 0 299 p 0 001 table s10 that is to say the more a compound is prescribed the higher its concentration in the environment the higher the amount of data available and the better its confidence score data variety when considering the different drug classes table 4 stimulants illicits were present in the highest median concentration 8 70 10 5 mg l which can be solely attributed to the data dominance of caffeine table s5 the lowest median concentration 3 90 10 6 mg l was presented by the other class however the highest and lowest median concentration per class differed only a factor of 26 whereas the difference within the psycholeptics group for example was a factor of over 10 000 the t tests showed that the median concentrations differed significantly between classes except for the other class and all other classes table s11 the range in the median concentrations within classes were much wider partly attributed to a small number of compounds present in high concentrations e g lithium in the psycholeptics class paracetamol in the analgesics class and carbamazepine in the antiepileptics class this indicates that pharmaceutical class is generally not the governing property for environmental occurrence and other properties such as persistence and prescription may better predict the concentrations in the environment to maximise the amount of occurrence data we utilised all data below the lod by taking the 90th percentile of the collective lods per compound as described by weltje and sumpter 2017 while this method allows the evaluation of risks for compounds that otherwise would have lacked any occurrence data see 3 4 it may however overestimate the occurrence for these compounds therefore we also included occurrence values for compounds using positive detections only to compare the method table s5 the median of medians for dataset using the lod method was 4 85 10 6 mg l while the median of medians for the dataset not using the method was 5 63 10 6 mg l a 16 difference however by including the lod data for 21 additional compounds the risk could be calculated table s7 giving merit to the method of weltje and sumpter 2017 3 3 aquatic ecotoxicity of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs 105 15 psychopharmaceuticals returned ecotoxicity data with none of the compounds achieving the requirements for a maximal ecotoxicity data confidence score while there are numerous compounds that appear to be quite toxic the top 10 most toxic compounds all had a low or very low data confidence leaving the hazard assessment quite ambiguous table s6 compounds with very high data confidence included carbamazepine chloroform paracetamol ibuprofen fluoxetine phenol and trichloroethylene carbamazepine demonstrated the highest toxicity of all compounds and with a very high data score cnoec 0 01 mg l s6 for both the cnoec and the aec50 datasets the tg27 requires higher plants as one of the species groups to be included to provide an ecosystem wide approach which were lacking for all compounds yet even without higher plants as a mandatory category no compound would have achieved the maximum confidence score for either cnoec or aec50 table s6 only 10 compounds achieved a high or very high data confidence with over half of all compounds having a low or very low confidence table s6 as for the occurrence data only a few compounds phenol trichloroethylene carbamazepine chloroform accounted for over 50 of all ecotoxicity data with phenol accounting for 25 therefore ecotoxicity data were also characterised by a large disparity between well studied and understudied compounds most of the raw ecotoxicity data 61 were extrapolated into an aec50 which was because older studies tended to report acute results rather than chronic considering inter class differences in ecotoxicity table 5 there was no clear indication as to which compound class was more toxic for example according to the cnoec data stimulants illicits were the most toxic 0 08 mg l while anaesthetics were the least toxic 6 3 mg l however according to the aec50 data both of these two classes exhibited a very similar toxicity 47 and 42 mg l respectively the t tests showed that there were only a few statistical differences in toxicity between compound classes with the exception for differences between anaesthetics and psychoanaleptics for both datasets which is likely due to the high cnoec values for the antidepressants in the psychoanaleptics class table s11 aside from the notable exception of anaesthetics and psychoanaleptics the broad lack of significant differences in ecotoxicity between compound groups could be related to the low confidence scores of all compound classes table 5 making it difficult to draw firm conclusions as to which class is most toxic indeed the top 5 most toxic psychoanaleptics had a low or very low confidence while 3 out of 5 of the most toxic anaesthetics had a high or higher data confidence which could indicate that poor data quality explains why the t tests showed a significant difference between these two classes like for the occurrence data the intra class differences were much larger than the inter class differences as reflected by the large standard deviations this highlights that each compound needs to be assessed independently and groupings such as therapeutic class obviously do not reflect species specific nor compound specific sensitivities for only 11 out of 702 compounds enough data were available to generate ssds based on the non stringent criteria used here i e a minimum of five species with none reaching the tg27 requirements of 10 diverse species there was a lack of test species diversity as fish crustaceans and algae accounted for almost 75 of all test species and data for invertebrates insects molluscs plants worms and amphibians are largely lacking fig 2 this clearly calls for more extensive and more diverse ecotoxicity data to combat this lack in ecotoxicity diversity and data for all psychopharmaceuticals in use ecotoxicity data should be generated that follow the protocol in tg27 while it may seem counter intuitive to include higher plants as test species for psychoactive compounds we argue that this creates a level playing field between species and chemical classes in addition psychopharmaceuticals may exert ecotoxic effects on higher plants that we simply do not know about due to a total lack of data which was the case in the past for herbicide effects on animals perkins et al 2000 tsui and chu 2003 including such data would help to obtain a better estimation of the hazard of psychopharmaceuticals by means of an ssd aiding a reliable estimation of the risk on a m species level we do however acknowledge that testing many different species may be unfeasible which calls for prioritisation an additional and alternative approach could be to run more in silico tests since there have been strides to move away from animal testing in recent years scholz et al 2013 as such in silico methods like qsars schüürmann et al 2007 have been improving in recent years with the use of machine learning lovrić et al 2021 wu et al 2021 another in vitro alternative is cellular bioassays fent 2007 lammer et al 2009 although there are concerns over the ecological relevance of such bioassays schirmer 2006 while it is beyond the scope of this study to go into detail about in silico in vitro to in vivo extrapolation it is an interesting topic for future research bell et al 2018 unlike for occurrence data for which there is a validated procedure for dealing lod data weltje and sumpter 2017 such a procedure is lacking for hazard data following our pragmatic approach to adjust ecotoxicity data recorded as below or above the lowest or highest test concentration to the lowest or highest test concentration we might respectively under or over estimate ecotoxicity exact effect concentrations were not established in only a small number 6 of the datapoints used in this study however our approach still maximises the number of ecotoxicity data which is relevant given the lack of data only 13 of the ecotoxicity data considered behavioural end points fig 2 since psychopharmaceuticals are designed to influence behaviour and behavioural effects occur by definition at lower concentrations than survival toxicity may be underestimated when using only non behavioural endpoints 3 4 risks of psychopharmaceuticals in european surface waters only for 87 out of 702 12 compounds enough occurrence and ecotoxicity data were available to calculate indicative environmental risks for which the chronic results are visualised in figs 3 and 4 where data above an rq of 1 red line are indicative of risk table s7 table 6 shows the 20 out of 87 compounds that demonstrated a potential risk based on the of rqs above 1 from the cnoec analyses while an additional 3 compounds indicated a potential risk based on the aec50 results table s7 resulting in 23 compounds carrying a potential at least 1 rq 1 risk the five riskiest compounds in this analysis were risperidone carbamazepine paracetamol cocaine and ibuprofen for which at least 10 of the rqs above 1 in addition the chc5 results showed that fluoxetine also carried a high risk 35 fig 4 table 6 however only for carbamazepine paracetamol fluoxetine and ibuprofen the confidence of this risk assessment was high or very high carbamazepine stands out as the only compound in any analysis to have both a median risk above one and very high confidence fig 4 moreover for many of the compounds for which a risk could be assessed 56 out of 87 compounds the confidence scores were below 1 table s9 and thus are labelled as having very low confidence for only 11 out of 702 compounds sufficient ecotoxicity data were available to generate ssds and therefore to calculate integrated multi species risks however none of these ssds met the tg 27 criteria so these results should be interpreted with caution figs 4 s7b table s7 comparing the results of figs 3 and 4 reveals that the risk for compounds based on the chc5 are higher than those based on the individual ecotoxicity data see e g carbamazepine since ssds provide an estimation of a multi species hazard that is closer to being ecosystem wide and therefore provide a more robust estimation of the actual hazard our results indicate that ecosystems are indeed vulnerable to psychopharmaceuticals the most prescribed compounds are also the most well studied e g carbamazepine paracetamol ibuprofen and fluoxetine collectively accounted for 23 of the ecotoxicity data and 28 of the occurrence data when comparing the dutch prescription data in defined daily doses to the calculated risks the compounds that carry the highest risk are often also the most used and prescribed table s8 nonetheless pearson correlations table s10 did not indicate that prescription correlated to risk the amount of occurrence data positively correlated with a higher observed risk cnoec r 0 656 p 0 001 aec50 r 0 659 p 0 001 as did the amount of cnoec data r 0 590 p 0 001 and aec50 data r 0 556 p 0 001 confidence in both ecotoxicity datasets also correlate to risk cnoec r 0 487 p 0 001 aec50 r 0 460 p 0 006 table s10 hence the better a compound is studied the higher the resulting calculated risk this is worrisome since this may indicate that many poorly studied compounds may carry hidden risks and that more research is needed into the occurrence and hazards of psychopharmaceuticals to elucidate if these hidden risks are present in contrast to the general observations discussed above not for all commonly prescribed compounds reliable data were available fig 5 evaluating the data plotted in fig 5 in more detail reveals that risperidone 37th most prescribed in nl table s8 demonstrated the highest median risk of all compounds but with a confidence on the cusp of low and very low table s9 and therefore its calculated risk cannot be considered reliable similarly risk could not be calculated for betahistine 7th most prescribed in nl table s8 due to a lack of both ecotoxicity and occurrence data for the sedative tramadol numerous occurrence data entries were obtained resulting in a maximum occurrence data score yet only one ecotoxicity datapoint was found even for the most prescribed psychopharmaceutical paroxetine the risk was calculated with only a medium confidence owing to a lack of ecotoxicity data since illicit drugs do not have prescription data we were not able to perform a similar comparison however it is notable that some illicit stimulants demonstrated some risk e g cocaine table 6 the stimulants group which consists of many illicit and recreational drugs caffeine nicotine etc included multiple compounds with very high occurrence confidence but low or no ecotoxicity confidence table s9 the present study differs from other risk assessments in that we did not include additional assessment factors this was done because we did not intend to derive environmental quality standards but rather aimed to calculate the risk of adverse effects on non target organisms based on measured concentrations of psychopharmaceuticals in european surface waters and measured effect concentrations this approach therefore leads to a data driven quantification of the risks of psychopharmaceuticals in surface waters which is less stringent than other assessments that do incorporate these assessment factors 3 5 general discussion the present study demonstrated that for psychopharmaceuticals inter class differences were smaller than intra class differences emphasising that each psychopharmaceutical should be assessed individually and that making assumptions based on related drugs cross reading could be problematic in a regulatory setting when considering the chemical structures of psychopharmaceuticals of a certain class there can be very major differences the ssri class of antidepressants highlights this very well see table 1 in silva et al 2012 since compounds within this class have a high degree of variability in chemical structure even though this group has a common pharmacological moa as an alternative to class categorization groupings based on chemical structure may therefore be further explored we found that only for 15 of the psychopharmaceuticals ecotoxicity data were available this appears to be about 19 for human pharmaceuticals in general gunnarsson et al 2019 indicating that the lack of data is not just limited to psychopharmaceuticals as highlighted by gunnarsson et al 2019 this stems from mandatory ecotoxicity testing during clinical trials only starting in 2006 in the eu and not at all in the us indicating that data are missing for legacy prior to 2006 pharmaceuticals comparing psychopharmaceuticals in general to other anthropogenic compounds revealed that they have lower cumulative chronic noecs than other industrial chemicals but higher when compared to biocides pesticides and general pharmaceuticals this was still the case when common solvents were removed from the psychopharmaceutical series fig 6 van dijk et al 2021 this outcome likely stems from the fact that biocides and pesticides are designed to be toxic and as gunnarson 2019 points out pharmaceuticals that disrupt the endocrine system tend to be the most toxic in addition as shown in fig 2 the ecotoxicity data in this study was lacking behavioural endpoints which may suggest that the cumulative noecs presented in fig 6 may be lower with better ecotoxcity data nonetheless in the eu psychopharmaceuticals along with pharmaceuticals are regulated by the european medicines agency ema and the eu pharmaceutical legislation does not provide environmental protection goals unlike legislation for industrial chemicals greater regulatory harmonisation of psycho pharmaceuticals with other industrially produced compounds can help to alleviate both the lack of data presented in the current study as well as the risk through a more coherent regulatory framework indeed the need for a one substance one assessment approach proposes an assessment that does not differentiate between use class but rather on the individual chemical van dijk et al 2021 a 2022 study on pharmaceutical occurrence in global rivers yielded somewhat comparable results to the occurrence data presented here wilkinson et al 2022 interestingly the concentrations of most compounds werehigher in the global rivers than in european surface waters median concentrations of e g paracetamol were 296 vs 148 ng l in the present study gabapentin 272 vs 200 ng l caffeine 500 vs 98 ng l nicotine 128 vs 40 ng l with the notable exeption of carbamazepine which showed higher concentrations in the present study 29 vs 73 ng l this however is in line with the study of wilkinson et al 2022 since they noted that anticonvulsant concentrations vary heavily depending geographic region a 2014 risk assessment of pharmaceuticals in french waters using a pnec based risk assessment found paracetamol ibuprofen oxazepam and carbamazepine to present a likely risk bouissou schurtz et al 2014 this broadly agrees with the results presented here table 6 figs 3 and 4 although bouissou schurtz et al 2014 considered a much smaller geographical area and only seven psychopharmaceuticals it is interesting to note that bouissou schurtz et al 2014 identified five pharmaceuticals to pose a risk four of which being psychopharmaceuticals in contrast a case study of two wwtps in italy found that the three psychopharmacuticals included in the study propyphenazone carbamazepine and diazepam were less of a risk than other pharmacuetical groups such as antibiotics al aukidy et al 2012 a review on the risks of antidepressants to fish yielded comparable results as those shown by the chc5 results of the present study fig 3 gould et al 2021 reported a median rq of 0 41 for fluoxetine compared to 0 44 in the present study sertraline differered by a factor of 10 0 01 vs 0 001 in the present study the most notable difference was for venlafaxine for which gould et al 2021 reported a median rq of 0 66 the highest in the study while we reported 3 1 10 4 however we did not create an ssd for venlafaxine due to inssuficient ecotoxicity data and gould et al 2021 only perform risk assesments for fish which may account for the differences observed between the two studies nonetheless the present study along with some of the aformentioned studies indeed reports risks for some psychopharmacueticals in the aquatic environment beyond surface waters risks have also been reported for psychopharmaceuticals in terrestrial environments namley soils that have been treated with sewage sludge aydın et al 2022 camotti bastos et al 2020 martín et al 2012 mejías et al 2021 such studies tend to focus on other pharmacueticals such as antibiotics and endocrine disruptors since these have a higher risk than psychopharmacuticals soil based studies also show that the risk posed by psychopharmaceuticals appears to be less than those presented in the current study which may indicate that the aquatic environment is the more sensitive ecosystem however carbamazepine sertraline ibuprofen and fluoxetine have demonstrated risks in soils in some studies martín et al 2012 mejías et al 2021 which demonstrate that wastewater effluent is not the only source of environmental psychopharmaceutical risk and that our arguments for more data also extends to other ecosystems 3 6 study limitations and future research this study did not focus on specific locations or situations though site specific risk assessment can be of relevance since prescription consumption and removal of psychopharmaceuticals may depend on local factors temporal variation can also be relevant as prescriptions can vary depending on the time of the year heald et al 2021 winkler et al 2019 furthermore population densities in different wwtp catchment areas wwtp removal efficiencies and drought conditions sjerps et al 2017 influence occurrence events such as natural disasters and the covid 19 pandemic can influence prescription and consumption patterns of psychopharmaceuticals andalo 2020 boehnke et al 2021 palmer and seoudi 2021 robinson 2021 usher et al 2012 despite using european occurrence data we only used prescription data from the netherlands as finding prescription data from all european countries was not feasible yet this does mean that conclusions based on prescription data may not be fully generalisable as such as a follow up and refinement of the present study site specific risk assessments may also investigate local cases such as a single nation or region accounting for specific and temporal differences we also could not verify every datapoint both ecotoxicity and occurrence due to the large amount of data points and only focused verification efforts on outliers we defined psychopharmaceuticals as the atcn class plus illicit drugs according to the dutch opium act the atc system gives an atc code to a compound based on its uses in past and present treatments but overlooks a drug s moa when that moa is not specifically employed in a medical treatment for example the muscle relaxant phenprobamate is in the atc m class muscular system and has no atcn number associated to it yet it has displayed sedative effects demir et al 2015 other examples include illicit compounds that are being screened for various therapeutic uses aan het rot et al 2012 mathew et al 2008 sessa 2017 therefore many of the non atcn pharmaceuticals can in principle exert relevant moas which may affect relevant behavioural endpoints however due to the infeasibility of checking all compounds for these moas these were not included this also lends itself in favour of a one substance one assessment style approach where non psychopharmaceuticals in the strict sense should be screened for behavioural ecotoxicological endpoints alongside pharmaceuticals in addition this will need to be performed not only for new chemicals but also for highly used legacy chemicals however we do acknowledge that this is a costly recommendation and thus could be supplemented with other types of ecotoxicity testing as discussed in 3 3 transformation products can be found in higher concentrations than parent compounds in the environment buser et al 1999 langford and thomas 2011 zhang et al 2008 and are generally more mobile and harder to remove by wwtps rivera utrilla et al 2013 the toxicity of transformation products is of concern since many transformation products may still be biologically active and thus exert a specific toxicity above baseline toxicity through a viable moa celiz et al 2009 escher and fenner 2011 neuwoehner et al 2009 the lack of quantitative occurrence data on transformation products is often a practical issue since detection by techniques such as lcms requires standards for these transformation products in the case of transformation products these standards are often more expensive compared to the parent compound or might not exist at all as an analytical standard and therefore must be synthesised de novo at large financial costs hernández et al 2011 wong and macleod 2009 the lack of availability or the large investments involved often deter researchers from detecting transformation products unless the study is specifically focussed on transformation products for reasons such as calculating consumption of illicit drugs ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 or utilises parent metabolite ratios to predict metabolite concentrations de jongh et al 2012 ter laak et al 2014 the transformation product challenge also extends to ecotoxicity data even more so since ecotoxicity experiments require higher volumes hence transformation products are often overlooked in both pharmaceutical occurrence and ecotoxicity studies celiz et al 2009 charuaud et al 2019 cleuvers 2003 fram and belitz 2011 frédéric and yves 2014 kar and roy 2012 mompelat et al 2009 vestel et al 2016 this study did not incorporate mixture toxicity into the hazard assessment for psychopharmaceutical mixture toxicity only a limited number of studies are available for example additive mixture effects have been demonstrated for ssris christensen et al 2007 and for a mixture of carbamazepine and ibuprofen cleuvers 2004 these mixture toxicity experiments represent realistic scenarios since the compounds present in these mixtures have indeed been demonstrated to be jointly present in surface water samples as listed in the data bases used in this study patrolecco et al 2013 moreover in the occurrence databases table 3 many other examples of jointly present psychopharmaceuticals can be found this should thus be considered in future more focused risk assessments future studies should also screen for transformation products in environmental monitoring and investigate their ecotoxicological impact alongside other parent drugs and transformation products in mixture toxicity tests focus should be given to compounds that are highly used present a risk or have low data confidence as defined in the present study 4 conclusions our findings revealed a lack of both occurrence and ecotoxicity data hampering a reliable environmental risk assessment of most psychopharmaceuticals with ecotoxicity data being the scarcest moreover the limited data were also not spread uniformly with a handful of well researched compounds dominating both occurrence and ecotoxicity data non behavioural endpoints and only a few test species were dominating the ecotoxicity data thus many compounds may present a risk that cannot be estimated due to missing or skewed data this is alarming since we showed that better studied compounds carried higher risks we found that the most prescribed compounds in the netherlands were the most studied and occurred most frequently however many of the highly prescribed psychopharmaceuticals still lack proper data common illicit drugs also demonstrated risks and generally provided good occurrence data but lacked ecotoxicity data furthermore intra class differences were larger than inter class differences emphasising that therapeutic grouping may not be an appropriate way to categorise compounds and that each compound should rather be individually assessed for risk despite the presently identified large knowledge gaps we conclude that the presence of a substantial part of data rich psychopharmaceuticals in surface waters present an ecological risk for aquatic non target organisms author contribution charlie j e davey designed and performed study wrote the manuscript michiel h s

15615,this study aimed to provide insights into the risk posed by psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in european surface waters and to identify current knowledge gaps hampering this risk assessment first the availability and quality of data on the concentrations of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in surface waters occurrence and on the toxicity to aquatic organisms hazard were reviewed if both occurrence and ecotoxicity data were available risk quotients risk were calculated where abundant ecotoxicity data were available a species sensitivity distribution ssd was constructed from which the hazardous concentration for 5 of the species hc5 was derived allowing to derive integrated multi species risks a total of 702 compounds were categorised as psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs based on a combination of all 502 anatomical therapeutic class atc n pharmaceuticals and a list of illicit drugs according to the dutch opium act of these 343 49 returned occurrence data while only 105 15 returned ecotoxicity data moreover many ecotoxicity tests used irrelevant endpoints for neurologically active compounds such as mortality which may underestimate the hazard of psychopharmaceuticals due to data limitations risks could only be assessed for 87 12 compounds with 23 3 3 compounds indicating a potential risk and several highly prescribed drugs returned neither occurrence nor ecotoxicity data primary bottlenecks in risk calculation included the lack of ecotoxicity data a lack of diversity of test species and ecotoxicological end points and large disparities between well studied and understudied compounds for both occurrence and toxicity data this study identified which compounds merit concern as well as the many compounds that lack the data for any calculation of risk driving research priorities despite the large knowledge gaps we concluded that the presence of a substantial part 26 of data rich psychopharmaceuticals in surface waters present an ecological risk for aquatic non target organisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords psychopharmaceuticals illicit drugs occurrence hazard risk surface water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction psychoactive pharmaceuticals psychopharmaceuticals are a class of pharmaceuticals primarily used to treat mental disorders and illnesses as well as other conditions relating to the nervous system such as analgesics painkillers and anaesthetics these psychopharmaceuticals are vital for our modern society and their use has been steeply increasing around the world due to a multitude of factors such as growing number of psychopharmaceutical based treatments growing global access to psychopharmaceuticals growing global population an ageing population in several regions loss of social stigma and increased availability of mental health treatment european medicines agency 2021 gao et al 2013 massey et al 2018 read et al 2014 world health organization 2011 psychopharmaceuticals often alter the neurochemistry of the brain by changing the concentrations and uptake of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine and or by agonising or antagonising specific receptors jozwiak bebenista and nowak 2014 wrobel 2007 however their activity is not limited to the brain such as in the case of analgesics which work on the nervous system ghanem et al 2016 graham and scott 2005 jozwiak bebenista and nowak 2014 in 1976 the who created the anatomical therapeutic chemical atc classification system a systematic approach to classify pharmaceuticals into therapeutic groupings based on the organ or biological system on which they act as well as on their pharmacological and chemical properties otherwise known as the mechanism of action moa the atc system distinguishes 14 categories in which psychopharmaceuticals are classified with atcn standing for nervous system who collaborating centre for drug statistics methodology 2018 of the over 4000 pharmaceuticals administered worldwide 502 belong to the atcn class wishart et al 2018 in addition to psychopharmaceuticals illicit drugs such as stimulants dissociatives hallucinogenics illicit opioids and cannabinoids can have strong effects on the nervous system as well having a similar moa as psychopharmaceuticals yet studies on illicit drugs tend to consider these in isolation e g deng et al 2020 huizer et al 2021 li et al 2016 thomas et al 2012 even though some illicit compounds are screened as candidates for therapeutic uses e g ketamine cannabis mdma aan het rot et al 2012 ebbert et al 2018 krystal et al 2019 mathew et al 2008 sessa 2017 hence it makes sense to jointly assess the presence hazard and risks of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in the aquatic environment increased use has led to the widespread occurrence of psychopharmaceuticals and their transformation products in the aquatic environment aus der beek et al 2016 pharmaceuticals have been reported in the aquatic environment since the 1960s stumm zollinger and fair 1965 but specific concern for psychopharmaceuticals was only raised in the late 1990s daughton and ternes 1999 halling sørensen et al 1998 consequently there has been a significant increase in the amount of data on the occurrence of psychopharmaceuticals and their transformation products in surface waters attributed also to advancements in analytical techniques such as lchrms heberer 2002 luo et al 2014 ort et al 2014 richardson 2007 which can detect pharmaceuticals in the ng to pg l range e g zrnčić et al 2014 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are a major source of psychopharmaceutical and illicit drug residues entering the environment to such a point that wastewater has become a frequently studied medium to reveal drug use trends in the connected populations deng et al 2020 huizer et al 2021 ort et al 2014 ter laak et al 2010 van nuijs et al 2011 currently up to 60 70 of the consumed pharmaceuticals illicit drugs and the respective transformation products are not removed by wwtps and end up in surface waters depending on the physico chemical properties of the compounds and the setup of the wwtp once in the aquatic environment the fate and persistence of psychopharmaceuticals can vary considerably between the different compounds with some degrading very quickly which are therefore not being detected in the environment while some others have reported half lives t 1 2 that can exceed one year for example carbamazepine has a t 1 2 of 2400 10 000 h while paracetamol has a t 1 2 of 40 350 h andreozzi et al 2003 yamamoto et al 2009 zou et al 2015 this is however an understudied field bu et al 2016 emphasising the need to further study the fate of psycho pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment whether or not the presence of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in the aquatic environment leads to adverse effects on non target species typically depends on their sensitivity to these compounds since the neural and nervous architecture of humans is shared across many different organisms that deviated in evolutionarily terms eons ago edsinger and dölen 2018 weiger 1997 psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs designed to interact with the human nervous system may also successfully interact with the nervous system of non target organisms with potential negative ecological impacts claessens et al 2013 schwarz et al 2021 wang et al 2021 for example antidepressants can affect predatory behaviour in bass impacts tissue metabolic capacities and may compromise the adaptive responses in trout when accumulated through gills or through the food chain best et al 2014 bisesi et al 2016 2014 adverse effects of illicit drugs have also been observed but are considerably less studied than the effects of conventional pharmaceuticals mohan et al 2021 outside the aquatic environment acute effects of psychopharmaceuticals such as changes in physiology and foraging behaviour have been reported for birds bean et al 2014 which are susceptible to exposure through the food chain bean et al 2018 lazarus et al 2015 as well as through direct exposure to sewage sludge bean et al 2014 beyond ecological effects there is also concern about human safety kümmerer 2010 because of the presence of psychopharmaceuticals in drinking water baken et al 2018 houtman et al 2014 and in vegetables grown using recycled water fu et al 2019 goldstein et al 2014 kim et al 2017 paltiel et al 2016 both psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs have the potential to disrupt so called infochemicals which are compounds used for intra species communications e g navigation predator avoidance mating behaviour etc since psychopharmaceuticals can mimic natural infochemicals in structure van donk et al 2016 vera chang et al 2018 therefore endpoints that derive from neurological and infochemical interactions are more sensitive than the classical endpoints i e mortality growth and reproduction and are likely to be of high ecological relevance for compounds that produce these effects despite the increasing amount of pharmaceuticals psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs present in the environment the number of studies on their occurrence hazards and risks has been relatively stagnant when compared to other drivers of ecological changes such as habitat loss and climate change bernhardt et al 2017 in addition the focus is often on the same few psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs e g carbamazepine paracetamol fluoxetine rather than on the newer or more used compounds such as escitalopram elsevier b v 2020a 2020b it is therefore of utmost importance to determine the contribution of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs to the presently ongoing degradation of environmental quality by assessing the environmental risk posed by these chemicals and to put such risks into context by using metrics such as prescription data ecological risk assessments are used to determine which compounds merit concern by weighing the concentrations in the environment occurrence and the effect concentrations hazard to produce risk quotients rqs which informs of the likelihood of effects occurring in the environment under this system an rq of 1 or higher means that the concentration of a compound in the environment has surpassed the minimum concentration to expect ecotoxic effects averaging the calculated rqs for all species for which ecotoxicity data are available provides a median risk for a specific compound species level risk alternatively when sufficient ecotoxicity data are available species sensitivity distributions ssds can be generated which integrate all available ecotoxicity data allowing the derivation of the hazardous concentration for 5 of the species hc5 which is then entered into the rq calculations instead of the species specific effect concentrations hence this method can be considered as an integrated m species risk assessment posthuma et al 2001 however ssds require extensive ecotoxicity data to be considered robust and multiple taxonomic groups to be considered more representative of natural communities wheeler et al 2002 european commission 2018 therefore deriving an ssd may only be feasible for a limited number of data rich compounds despite the rise in the use of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs scientific attention to the presence in the environment ecotoxicological hazards and environmental risks of these compounds is still rather limited currently reliable environmental risk assessments are hampered by a limited insight into the availability of data on the occurrence in the aquatic environment and the hazard to non target organisms therefore the aim of the present study was to review the data on occurrence and ecotoxicological hazard of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in european surface waters paying attention to the accompanying uncertainties and knowledge gaps to this end we provided an ecological risk assessment of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in european surface waters by weighing their occurrence and hazard we contextualised these risks using dutch prescription data 2 methods 2 1 selection and classification of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs we based our selection of psychopharmaceuticals on the atcn list of 502 chemicals who collaborating centre for drug statistics methodology 2018 illicit drugs such as stimulants dissociatives hallucinogenics illicit opioids and cannabinoids were added to this list by using the opium act of the netherlands containing 282 illicit compounds illicit and recreational drugs such as caffeine nicotine cocaine thc and amphetamines were merged to make a stimulants illicits class since the atc categories of these select compounds e g cocaine as an anaesthetic were deemed inappropriate since the atcn list also includes compounds that are used as illicit drugs e g opioids duplicates were removed the resulting list totalled to 702 compounds tables 1 s1 cas numbers were obtained from drugbank and pubchem kim et al 2021 wishart et al 2018 2 2 occurrence data retrieval filtering and confidence score to retrieve data on the occurrence of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in surface waters the eu s ipchem monitoring platform european commission 2021 was used which contains 18 environmental occurrence databases four of these databases contained psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs and data were extracted in july 2021 table s2 these four databases were the german uba pharmaceuticals in the environment database eike et al 2019 the norman network database norman network of reference laboratories 2021 the french naïades database naïades 2020 and the eu waterbase database eea 2021 in addition we were given access to two dutch databases that were not represented in ipchem these were the wkp rijkswaterstaat 2021 and the riwa databases riwa rijn 2021 to maximise the amount of data collected the top 50 most prescribed drugs in the netherlands from 2015 to 2020 zorginstituut nederland 2021 that did not have data in the aforementioned databases were manually searched for in literature by using the search terms drug name environmental environment occurrence detection detected surface water in google scholar in june 2021 occurrence data were filtered for european surface waters only table s3 removing values for other water matrices such as sewage effluent groundwater etc false positives such as nitrophenol being confused with phenol by search engines were also removed if the database flagged any data as questionable these data were not used outliers that were unusual or unrealistically high values e g 1 1011 mg l were either verified when the original source agreed with the database corrected when the source disagreed with the database or else deleted if the original source was unavailable upon merging the data from the six databases any duplicates were removed by inspecting sources monitoring locations monitoring location codes and dates for all data below the limit of detection lod the 90th percentile was calculated for all lod data per compound weltje and sumpter 2017 which helped to provide enough data to calculate the risk for compounds for which all data were lod an occurrence data confidence score was created as an indication of the amount and range of environmental occurrence data per compound since not all compounds have the same quantity and diversity of occurrence data this will serve as an indication of data quantity and diversity it should be noted that the occurrence confidence score was made before the lod adjustments meaning that values below or above the lod are treated equally in the confidence assessment the total score was calculated from 3 sub scores the number of entries measurement frequency countries spatial distribution and years temporal distribution occu rence score entr ies 57 coun tries 12 years 2 equation 1 occurrence data scoring system with entries 57 countries 12 and years 2 these numbers are the median values for each of those categories see tables s5 and s7 i e the median number of entries was 57 the median number of countries was 12 and the median number of years was 2 2 3 ecotoxicity data retrieval filtering and confidence score ecotoxicity data were extracted from the us epa ecotox knowledgebase epa 2013 and the german uba etox database umweltbundesamt 2008 in july 2021 in all cases both compound names and cas numbers were used as search criteria in addition the top 50 most prescribed drugs in the netherlands in the years 2015 to 2020 zorginstituut nederland 2021 that did not have data in the aforementioned databases were manually searched for in literature by using the search terms drug name ecotoxicity ecotoxicology in google scholar in june 2021 ecotoxicity studies with no results no stated endpoint or irrelevant endpoints i e bioaccumulation factors were removed to maximise the usable data values recorded as below or above lowest or highest test concentration were adjusted to the lowest or highest test concentration respectively e g 1 μg became 1 μg and 1 μg became 1 μg outliers that were unusual or unrealistic were either verified when the original source agreed with the database corrected when the source disagreed with the database or else deleted if the original source was unavailable for studies that reported multiple endpoints per compound only the most sensitive relevant endpoint was used to avoid cases for which studies with multiple endpoints held a greater weight than studies with a single endpoint the ecotoxicity data included many different measures of toxicity including ecx effective concentration lcx lethal concentration loec lowest observed effect concentration noec no observed effect concentration and matc maximum acceptable toxicant concentration to maximise the amount of usable data these were extrapolated to either acute ec50 values effective concentration for 50 of the exposed organisms or to chronic noec values no observed effect concentration following the methods for extrapolation described by posthuma 2019 to this end the first step was to categorise datapoints as either chronic or acute following the criteria of ecetoc 1993 table s4 with acute and sub chronic ecotoxicity data being merged as acute table s4 secondly all measures of toxicity were put into two categories noec or ec50 based on the original measure of toxicity see posthuma et al 2019 these two steps yielded four categories of data acute noec chronic noec acute ec50 and chronic ec50 acute noec values were multiplied by 1 3 to give chronic noec values and chronic ec50 values were multiplied by 3 to give acute ec50 values this resulted in two final data categories the extrapolated chronic noec denoted as cnoec and the extrapolated acute ec50 denoted as aec50 ecotoxicity data which were then used for all further analyses in the study if enough ecotoxicity data were available ssds were generated to derive hc5 values allowing for an integrated multispecies measure of the hazard of that specific compound to avoid that lacking ecotoxicity data hampered our analysis ssds were constructed based on a minimum number of 5 data points using the us epa ssd generator epa 2016 different ssds were produced for cnoec and aec50 values ahc5 acute and chc5 chronic hc5 values defined as the hazardous concentration for 5 of species were derived from the ssd plots of the respective compounds in order to assess the quantity and diversity of the ecotoxicity data per compound we assigned a confidence score to each compound s chc5 ahc5 cnoec and aec50 values based on the tg27 criteria european commission 2018 for each compound we scored the number of datapoints out of a maximum of 10 and for taxa out of a maximum of 8 these were then multiplied to create an ecotoxicity data score between 0 and 1 equation 2 ecot oxic ity score entr ies 10 taxa 8 equation 2 ecotoxicity data scoring system with entries 10 and taxa 8 based on tg27 criteria 2 4 ecological risk assessment and confidence scores by weighing the occurrence and ecotoxicity data the ecological risk for each compound was assessed two dimensional matrices of risk quotients rqs were created where each occurrence value was divided by each aec50 cnoec ahc5 or chc5 value per compound consequently each compound could have up to four associated rq matrices to compare the effect of including the 90th percentile of the lod data see 2 2 risk matrices were also made without the lod data r q c o n c e n t r a t i o n i n t h e e n v i r o n m e n t e f f e c t c o n c e n t r a t i o n equation 3 calculation of risk quotients rqs where effect concentration can be aec50 cnoec ahc5 or chc5 values the calculated rqs were then plotted in a logarithmic boxplot and the percentage of rq 1 was determined indicating a potential risk a risk confidence score was calculated for each type of the four risk analysis using the following formula risk score occu rence score ecot oxic ity score equation 4 calculation of risk confidence score all confidence scores were simplified into 5 categories table 2 ecotoxicity data uses an adjusted lower boundary due to the nature of the scoring system described in 2 3 all numerical confidence scores can be found in the supplementary information table s9 2 5 statistical analyses pearson correlations were performed to assess relations between dutch prescription data zorginstituut nederland 2021 and other variables namely occurrence occurrence data quantity i e raw number of entries per compound occurrence data confidence ecotoxicity ecotoxicity data quantity ecotoxicity data confidence and risk a second series of pearson correlations were performed to assess relations between risk both cnoec and aec50 and these same variables these correlations were log transformed and performed using native excel functions with formulae embedded in table s10 t tests were performed on the cumulative data for occurrence cnoec and aec50 data per compound class to test for significance between compound classes using native excel functions table s11 3 results and discussion 3 1 data availability for the selected compounds for 343 out of 702 49 of compounds occurrence data were reported in european surface waters but for 194 28 of the total or 57 of the number of compounds with occurrence data the concentration in the environment was below the lod leaving 149 compounds 21 with at least one occurrence datapoint above the lod only for 105 psychopharmaceuticals 15 ecotoxicity data were available immediately highlighting that ecotoxicity data were even less available than occurrence data only for 87 12 compounds both occurrence and ecotoxicity data were available allowing for a risk assessment an overview of occurrence ecotoxicity and risk data can be found in tables s5 s6 and s7 respectively the norman database provided most of the occurrence data in this study table 3 because it includes both literature studies and monitoring data we noticed that there is a lack of parity between the multi national occurrence databases most notably the uba norman and waterbase databases which contain outdated references to each other waterbase riwa wkp and naïades returned relatively low amounts of data likely because these are general monitoring databases which focus on other contaminants this highlights the low priority of psychopharmaceuticals compared to legacy contaminants such as solvents and persistent organic pollutants the occurrence literature search did not return any additional results for the countries included in this study table s3 considering that the epa and uba databases are both collections of current ecotoxicity literature there was a large lack of parity between the two ecotoxicity databases with the epa database being far larger than the uba database moreover additional ecotoxicity data were found during the present literature search 3 2 occurrence of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in european surface waters over half of all psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs did not return occurrence data fig 1 of the 343 49 psychopharmaceuticals occurrence data was available only 52 7 compounds had the highest possible occurrence data confidence while for almost all others 278 40 the confidence was medium or lower table s5 for 340 compounds the concentration was below the lod and so the 90th percentile procedure was used for those datapoints fig 1 lithium presented by far the highest median concentration 0 016 mg l likely due to its natural occurrence as a mineral in addition common solvents such as diethyl ether trichloroethylene and phenol were also present in high median concentrations due to uses in other applications such as industrial solvents common analgesics such as paracetamol salicylamide salicylic acid aspirin and ibuprofen as well as carbamazepine were also present in high concentrations fig s5 the low number of data entries per compound contributed most to the generally low occurrence confidence when compared to the number of countries and years this indicates that there is a large disparity between well studied and understudied compounds in terms of raw data with five compounds caffeine carbamazepine chloroform trichloroethylene and ibuprofen out of 702 compounds accounting for over 50 of all occurrence data table s5 with caffeine alone accounting for almost 20 of positive detection data importantly occurrence data were missing for common and highly prescribed compounds such as betahistine pyridostigmine and distigmine tables s5 s8 for the illicit compounds 127 out of 199 did not return any occurrence data which were often obscure new psychoactive substances or smartdrugs table s5 castiglioni et al 2021 weinstein et al 2017 other compounds without data included discontinued psychopharmaceuticals such as hexapropymate metamizole and iproniazid mean occurrence concentration occurrence data quantity and occurrence data confidence all showed a positive relation to dutch prescription data conc r 0 207 p 0 015 quant r 0 234 p 0 006 conf r 0 299 p 0 001 table s10 that is to say the more a compound is prescribed the higher its concentration in the environment the higher the amount of data available and the better its confidence score data variety when considering the different drug classes table 4 stimulants illicits were present in the highest median concentration 8 70 10 5 mg l which can be solely attributed to the data dominance of caffeine table s5 the lowest median concentration 3 90 10 6 mg l was presented by the other class however the highest and lowest median concentration per class differed only a factor of 26 whereas the difference within the psycholeptics group for example was a factor of over 10 000 the t tests showed that the median concentrations differed significantly between classes except for the other class and all other classes table s11 the range in the median concentrations within classes were much wider partly attributed to a small number of compounds present in high concentrations e g lithium in the psycholeptics class paracetamol in the analgesics class and carbamazepine in the antiepileptics class this indicates that pharmaceutical class is generally not the governing property for environmental occurrence and other properties such as persistence and prescription may better predict the concentrations in the environment to maximise the amount of occurrence data we utilised all data below the lod by taking the 90th percentile of the collective lods per compound as described by weltje and sumpter 2017 while this method allows the evaluation of risks for compounds that otherwise would have lacked any occurrence data see 3 4 it may however overestimate the occurrence for these compounds therefore we also included occurrence values for compounds using positive detections only to compare the method table s5 the median of medians for dataset using the lod method was 4 85 10 6 mg l while the median of medians for the dataset not using the method was 5 63 10 6 mg l a 16 difference however by including the lod data for 21 additional compounds the risk could be calculated table s7 giving merit to the method of weltje and sumpter 2017 3 3 aquatic ecotoxicity of psychopharmaceuticals and illicit drugs 105 15 psychopharmaceuticals returned ecotoxicity data with none of the compounds achieving the requirements for a maximal ecotoxicity data confidence score while there are numerous compounds that appear to be quite toxic the top 10 most toxic compounds all had a low or very low data confidence leaving the hazard assessment quite ambiguous table s6 compounds with very high data confidence included carbamazepine chloroform paracetamol ibuprofen fluoxetine phenol and trichloroethylene carbamazepine demonstrated the highest toxicity of all compounds and with a very high data score cnoec 0 01 mg l s6 for both the cnoec and the aec50 datasets the tg27 requires higher plants as one of the species groups to be included to provide an ecosystem wide approach which were lacking for all compounds yet even without higher plants as a mandatory category no compound would have achieved the maximum confidence score for either cnoec or aec50 table s6 only 10 compounds achieved a high or very high data confidence with over half of all compounds having a low or very low confidence table s6 as for the occurrence data only a few compounds phenol trichloroethylene carbamazepine chloroform accounted for over 50 of all ecotoxicity data with phenol accounting for 25 therefore ecotoxicity data were also characterised by a large disparity between well studied and understudied compounds most of the raw ecotoxicity data 61 were extrapolated into an aec50 which was because older studies tended to report acute results rather than chronic considering inter class differences in ecotoxicity table 5 there was no clear indication as to which compound class was more toxic for example according to the cnoec data stimulants illicits were the most toxic 0 08 mg l while anaesthetics were the least toxic 6 3 mg l however according to the aec50 data both of these two classes exhibited a very similar toxicity 47 and 42 mg l respectively the t tests showed that there were only a few statistical differences in toxicity between compound classes with the exception for differences between anaesthetics and psychoanaleptics for both datasets which is likely due to the high cnoec values for the antidepressants in the psychoanaleptics class table s11 aside from the notable exception of anaesthetics and psychoanaleptics the broad lack of significant differences in ecotoxicity between compound groups could be related to the low confidence scores of all compound classes table 5 making it difficult to draw firm conclusions as to which class is most toxic indeed the top 5 most toxic psychoanaleptics had a low or very low confidence while 3 out of 5 of the most toxic anaesthetics had a high or higher data confidence which could indicate that poor data quality explains why the t tests showed a significant difference between these two classes like for the occurrence data the intra class differences were much larger than the inter class differences as reflected by the large standard deviations this highlights that each compound needs to be assessed independently and groupings such as therapeutic class obviously do not reflect species specific nor compound specific sensitivities for only 11 out of 702 compounds enough data were available to generate ssds based on the non stringent criteria used here i e a minimum of five species with none reaching the tg27 requirements of 10 diverse species there was a lack of test species diversity as fish crustaceans and algae accounted for almost 75 of all test species and data for invertebrates insects molluscs plants worms and amphibians are largely lacking fig 2 this clearly calls for more extensive and more diverse ecotoxicity data to combat this lack in ecotoxicity diversity and data for all psychopharmaceuticals in use ecotoxicity data should be generated that follow the protocol in tg27 while it may seem counter intuitive to include higher plants as test species for psychoactive compounds we argue that this creates a level playing field between species and chemical classes in addition psychopharmaceuticals may exert ecotoxic effects on higher plants that we simply do not know about due to a total lack of data which was the case in the past for herbicide effects on animals perkins et al 2000 tsui and chu 2003 including such data would help to obtain a better estimation of the hazard of psychopharmaceuticals by means of an ssd aiding a reliable estimation of the risk on a m species level we do however acknowledge that testing many different species may be unfeasible which calls for prioritisation an additional and alternative approach could be to run more in silico tests since there have been strides to move away from animal testing in recent years scholz et al 2013 as such in silico methods like qsars schüürmann et al 2007 have been improving in recent years with the use of machine learning lovrić et al 2021 wu et al 2021 another in vitro alternative is cellular bioassays fent 2007 lammer et al 2009 although there are concerns over the ecological relevance of such bioassays schirmer 2006 while it is beyond the scope of this study to go into detail about in silico in vitro to in vivo extrapolation it is an interesting topic for future research bell et al 2018 unlike for occurrence data for which there is a validated procedure for dealing lod data weltje and sumpter 2017 such a procedure is lacking for hazard data following our pragmatic approach to adjust ecotoxicity data recorded as below or above the lowest or highest test concentration to the lowest or highest test concentration we might respectively under or over estimate ecotoxicity exact effect concentrations were not established in only a small number 6 of the datapoints used in this study however our approach still maximises the number of ecotoxicity data which is relevant given the lack of data only 13 of the ecotoxicity data considered behavioural end points fig 2 since psychopharmaceuticals are designed to influence behaviour and behavioural effects occur by definition at lower concentrations than survival toxicity may be underestimated when using only non behavioural endpoints 3 4 risks of psychopharmaceuticals in european surface waters only for 87 out of 702 12 compounds enough occurrence and ecotoxicity data were available to calculate indicative environmental risks for which the chronic results are visualised in figs 3 and 4 where data above an rq of 1 red line are indicative of risk table s7 table 6 shows the 20 out of 87 compounds that demonstrated a potential risk based on the of rqs above 1 from the cnoec analyses while an additional 3 compounds indicated a potential risk based on the aec50 results table s7 resulting in 23 compounds carrying a potential at least 1 rq 1 risk the five riskiest compounds in this analysis were risperidone carbamazepine paracetamol cocaine and ibuprofen for which at least 10 of the rqs above 1 in addition the chc5 results showed that fluoxetine also carried a high risk 35 fig 4 table 6 however only for carbamazepine paracetamol fluoxetine and ibuprofen the confidence of this risk assessment was high or very high carbamazepine stands out as the only compound in any analysis to have both a median risk above one and very high confidence fig 4 moreover for many of the compounds for which a risk could be assessed 56 out of 87 compounds the confidence scores were below 1 table s9 and thus are labelled as having very low confidence for only 11 out of 702 compounds sufficient ecotoxicity data were available to generate ssds and therefore to calculate integrated multi species risks however none of these ssds met the tg 27 criteria so these results should be interpreted with caution figs 4 s7b table s7 comparing the results of figs 3 and 4 reveals that the risk for compounds based on the chc5 are higher than those based on the individual ecotoxicity data see e g carbamazepine since ssds provide an estimation of a multi species hazard that is closer to being ecosystem wide and therefore provide a more robust estimation of the actual hazard our results indicate that ecosystems are indeed vulnerable to psychopharmaceuticals the most prescribed compounds are also the most well studied e g carbamazepine paracetamol ibuprofen and fluoxetine collectively accounted for 23 of the ecotoxicity data and 28 of the occurrence data when comparing the dutch prescription data in defined daily doses to the calculated risks the compounds that carry the highest risk are often also the most used and prescribed table s8 nonetheless pearson correlations table s10 did not indicate that prescription correlated to risk the amount of occurrence data positively correlated with a higher observed risk cnoec r 0 656 p 0 001 aec50 r 0 659 p 0 001 as did the amount of cnoec data r 0 590 p 0 001 and aec50 data r 0 556 p 0 001 confidence in both ecotoxicity datasets also correlate to risk cnoec r 0 487 p 0 001 aec50 r 0 460 p 0 006 table s10 hence the better a compound is studied the higher the resulting calculated risk this is worrisome since this may indicate that many poorly studied compounds may carry hidden risks and that more research is needed into the occurrence and hazards of psychopharmaceuticals to elucidate if these hidden risks are present in contrast to the general observations discussed above not for all commonly prescribed compounds reliable data were available fig 5 evaluating the data plotted in fig 5 in more detail reveals that risperidone 37th most prescribed in nl table s8 demonstrated the highest median risk of all compounds but with a confidence on the cusp of low and very low table s9 and therefore its calculated risk cannot be considered reliable similarly risk could not be calculated for betahistine 7th most prescribed in nl table s8 due to a lack of both ecotoxicity and occurrence data for the sedative tramadol numerous occurrence data entries were obtained resulting in a maximum occurrence data score yet only one ecotoxicity datapoint was found even for the most prescribed psychopharmaceutical paroxetine the risk was calculated with only a medium confidence owing to a lack of ecotoxicity data since illicit drugs do not have prescription data we were not able to perform a similar comparison however it is notable that some illicit stimulants demonstrated some risk e g cocaine table 6 the stimulants group which consists of many illicit and recreational drugs caffeine nicotine etc included multiple compounds with very high occurrence confidence but low or no ecotoxicity confidence table s9 the present study differs from other risk assessments in that we did not include additional assessment factors this was done because we did not intend to derive environmental quality standards but rather aimed to calculate the risk of adverse effects on non target organisms based on measured concentrations of psychopharmaceuticals in european surface waters and measured effect concentrations this approach therefore leads to a data driven quantification of the risks of psychopharmaceuticals in surface waters which is less stringent than other assessments that do incorporate these assessment factors 3 5 general discussion the present study demonstrated that for psychopharmaceuticals inter class differences were smaller than intra class differences emphasising that each psychopharmaceutical should be assessed individually and that making assumptions based on related drugs cross reading could be problematic in a regulatory setting when considering the chemical structures of psychopharmaceuticals of a certain class there can be very major differences the ssri class of antidepressants highlights this very well see table 1 in silva et al 2012 since compounds within this class have a high degree of variability in chemical structure even though this group has a common pharmacological moa as an alternative to class categorization groupings based on chemical structure may therefore be further explored we found that only for 15 of the psychopharmaceuticals ecotoxicity data were available this appears to be about 19 for human pharmaceuticals in general gunnarsson et al 2019 indicating that the lack of data is not just limited to psychopharmaceuticals as highlighted by gunnarsson et al 2019 this stems from mandatory ecotoxicity testing during clinical trials only starting in 2006 in the eu and not at all in the us indicating that data are missing for legacy prior to 2006 pharmaceuticals comparing psychopharmaceuticals in general to other anthropogenic compounds revealed that they have lower cumulative chronic noecs than other industrial chemicals but higher when compared to biocides pesticides and general pharmaceuticals this was still the case when common solvents were removed from the psychopharmaceutical series fig 6 van dijk et al 2021 this outcome likely stems from the fact that biocides and pesticides are designed to be toxic and as gunnarson 2019 points out pharmaceuticals that disrupt the endocrine system tend to be the most toxic in addition as shown in fig 2 the ecotoxicity data in this study was lacking behavioural endpoints which may suggest that the cumulative noecs presented in fig 6 may be lower with better ecotoxcity data nonetheless in the eu psychopharmaceuticals along with pharmaceuticals are regulated by the european medicines agency ema and the eu pharmaceutical legislation does not provide environmental protection goals unlike legislation for industrial chemicals greater regulatory harmonisation of psycho pharmaceuticals with other industrially produced compounds can help to alleviate both the lack of data presented in the current study as well as the risk through a more coherent regulatory framework indeed the need for a one substance one assessment approach proposes an assessment that does not differentiate between use class but rather on the individual chemical van dijk et al 2021 a 2022 study on pharmaceutical occurrence in global rivers yielded somewhat comparable results to the occurrence data presented here wilkinson et al 2022 interestingly the concentrations of most compounds werehigher in the global rivers than in european surface waters median concentrations of e g paracetamol were 296 vs 148 ng l in the present study gabapentin 272 vs 200 ng l caffeine 500 vs 98 ng l nicotine 128 vs 40 ng l with the notable exeption of carbamazepine which showed higher concentrations in the present study 29 vs 73 ng l this however is in line with the study of wilkinson et al 2022 since they noted that anticonvulsant concentrations vary heavily depending geographic region a 2014 risk assessment of pharmaceuticals in french waters using a pnec based risk assessment found paracetamol ibuprofen oxazepam and carbamazepine to present a likely risk bouissou schurtz et al 2014 this broadly agrees with the results presented here table 6 figs 3 and 4 although bouissou schurtz et al 2014 considered a much smaller geographical area and only seven psychopharmaceuticals it is interesting to note that bouissou schurtz et al 2014 identified five pharmaceuticals to pose a risk four of which being psychopharmaceuticals in contrast a case study of two wwtps in italy found that the three psychopharmacuticals included in the study propyphenazone carbamazepine and diazepam were less of a risk than other pharmacuetical groups such as antibiotics al aukidy et al 2012 a review on the risks of antidepressants to fish yielded comparable results as those shown by the chc5 results of the present study fig 3 gould et al 2021 reported a median rq of 0 41 for fluoxetine compared to 0 44 in the present study sertraline differered by a factor of 10 0 01 vs 0 001 in the present study the most notable difference was for venlafaxine for which gould et al 2021 reported a median rq of 0 66 the highest in the study while we reported 3 1 10 4 however we did not create an ssd for venlafaxine due to inssuficient ecotoxicity data and gould et al 2021 only perform risk assesments for fish which may account for the differences observed between the two studies nonetheless the present study along with some of the aformentioned studies indeed reports risks for some psychopharmacueticals in the aquatic environment beyond surface waters risks have also been reported for psychopharmaceuticals in terrestrial environments namley soils that have been treated with sewage sludge aydın et al 2022 camotti bastos et al 2020 martín et al 2012 mejías et al 2021 such studies tend to focus on other pharmacueticals such as antibiotics and endocrine disruptors since these have a higher risk than psychopharmacuticals soil based studies also show that the risk posed by psychopharmaceuticals appears to be less than those presented in the current study which may indicate that the aquatic environment is the more sensitive ecosystem however carbamazepine sertraline ibuprofen and fluoxetine have demonstrated risks in soils in some studies martín et al 2012 mejías et al 2021 which demonstrate that wastewater effluent is not the only source of environmental psychopharmaceutical risk and that our arguments for more data also extends to other ecosystems 3 6 study limitations and future research this study did not focus on specific locations or situations though site specific risk assessment can be of relevance since prescription consumption and removal of psychopharmaceuticals may depend on local factors temporal variation can also be relevant as prescriptions can vary depending on the time of the year heald et al 2021 winkler et al 2019 furthermore population densities in different wwtp catchment areas wwtp removal efficiencies and drought conditions sjerps et al 2017 influence occurrence events such as natural disasters and the covid 19 pandemic can influence prescription and consumption patterns of psychopharmaceuticals andalo 2020 boehnke et al 2021 palmer and seoudi 2021 robinson 2021 usher et al 2012 despite using european occurrence data we only used prescription data from the netherlands as finding prescription data from all european countries was not feasible yet this does mean that conclusions based on prescription data may not be fully generalisable as such as a follow up and refinement of the present study site specific risk assessments may also investigate local cases such as a single nation or region accounting for specific and temporal differences we also could not verify every datapoint both ecotoxicity and occurrence due to the large amount of data points and only focused verification efforts on outliers we defined psychopharmaceuticals as the atcn class plus illicit drugs according to the dutch opium act the atc system gives an atc code to a compound based on its uses in past and present treatments but overlooks a drug s moa when that moa is not specifically employed in a medical treatment for example the muscle relaxant phenprobamate is in the atc m class muscular system and has no atcn number associated to it yet it has displayed sedative effects demir et al 2015 other examples include illicit compounds that are being screened for various therapeutic uses aan het rot et al 2012 mathew et al 2008 sessa 2017 therefore many of the non atcn pharmaceuticals can in principle exert relevant moas which may affect relevant behavioural endpoints however due to the infeasibility of checking all compounds for these moas these were not included this also lends itself in favour of a one substance one assessment style approach where non psychopharmaceuticals in the strict sense should be screened for behavioural ecotoxicological endpoints alongside pharmaceuticals in addition this will need to be performed not only for new chemicals but also for highly used legacy chemicals however we do acknowledge that this is a costly recommendation and thus could be supplemented with other types of ecotoxicity testing as discussed in 3 3 transformation products can be found in higher concentrations than parent compounds in the environment buser et al 1999 langford and thomas 2011 zhang et al 2008 and are generally more mobile and harder to remove by wwtps rivera utrilla et al 2013 the toxicity of transformation products is of concern since many transformation products may still be biologically active and thus exert a specific toxicity above baseline toxicity through a viable moa celiz et al 2009 escher and fenner 2011 neuwoehner et al 2009 the lack of quantitative occurrence data on transformation products is often a practical issue since detection by techniques such as lcms requires standards for these transformation products in the case of transformation products these standards are often more expensive compared to the parent compound or might not exist at all as an analytical standard and therefore must be synthesised de novo at large financial costs hernández et al 2011 wong and macleod 2009 the lack of availability or the large investments involved often deter researchers from detecting transformation products unless the study is specifically focussed on transformation products for reasons such as calculating consumption of illicit drugs ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 or utilises parent metabolite ratios to predict metabolite concentrations de jongh et al 2012 ter laak et al 2014 the transformation product challenge also extends to ecotoxicity data even more so since ecotoxicity experiments require higher volumes hence transformation products are often overlooked in both pharmaceutical occurrence and ecotoxicity studies celiz et al 2009 charuaud et al 2019 cleuvers 2003 fram and belitz 2011 frédéric and yves 2014 kar and roy 2012 mompelat et al 2009 vestel et al 2016 this study did not incorporate mixture toxicity into the hazard assessment for psychopharmaceutical mixture toxicity only a limited number of studies are available for example additive mixture effects have been demonstrated for ssris christensen et al 2007 and for a mixture of carbamazepine and ibuprofen cleuvers 2004 these mixture toxicity experiments represent realistic scenarios since the compounds present in these mixtures have indeed been demonstrated to be jointly present in surface water samples as listed in the data bases used in this study patrolecco et al 2013 moreover in the occurrence databases table 3 many other examples of jointly present psychopharmaceuticals can be found this should thus be considered in future more focused risk assessments future studies should also screen for transformation products in environmental monitoring and investigate their ecotoxicological impact alongside other parent drugs and transformation products in mixture toxicity tests focus should be given to compounds that are highly used present a risk or have low data confidence as defined in the present study 4 conclusions our findings revealed a lack of both occurrence and ecotoxicity data hampering a reliable environmental risk assessment of most psychopharmaceuticals with ecotoxicity data being the scarcest moreover the limited data were also not spread uniformly with a handful of well researched compounds dominating both occurrence and ecotoxicity data non behavioural endpoints and only a few test species were dominating the ecotoxicity data thus many compounds may present a risk that cannot be estimated due to missing or skewed data this is alarming since we showed that better studied compounds carried higher risks we found that the most prescribed compounds in the netherlands were the most studied and occurred most frequently however many of the highly prescribed psychopharmaceuticals still lack proper data common illicit drugs also demonstrated risks and generally provided good occurrence data but lacked ecotoxicity data furthermore intra class differences were larger than inter class differences emphasising that therapeutic grouping may not be an appropriate way to categorise compounds and that each compound should rather be individually assessed for risk despite the presently identified large knowledge gaps we conclude that the presence of a substantial part of data rich psychopharmaceuticals in surface waters present an ecological risk for aquatic non target organisms author contribution charlie j e davey designed and performed study wrote the manuscript michiel h s

15616,currently various strategies have been applied to activate persulfate ps for contaminant removal from water however the background phosphate ions in water affect ps activation and organic degradation and the mechanism of their influence on the processes is still controversial in this review the possible effects of different phosphate forms hpo4 2 h2po4 and po4 3 on ps activation and contaminant degradation were systematically evaluated and summarized specifically hpo4 2 promotes contaminant degradation in direct peroxymonosulfate pms oxidation and thermal pms systems while it exhibits inhibition to thermal peroxodisulfate pds and ultraviolet uv pds systems meanwhile h2po4 inhibits most oxidation processes based on pms and pds except for non metal dominated and metal assisted pms systems coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 could present beneficial effects in thermal co2 and non metal activated and metal assisted pms systems nevertheless their inhibitory effects were found in direct pms oxidation uv pms or pds and metal dominated pms systems generally phosphate ions inhibit pms pds activation through competing adsorption with pms or pds on the solid surface forming a complex with metal ions as well as occupying active sites on solid catalysts in addition phosphate ions can quench radicals for reduced degradation of contaminants however phosphate ions could weaken the bond dissociation energy via combining with pms and contaminants or form a complex with co2 thus displaying a facilitative effect this review further discusses major challenges and opportunities of ps activation with co existing phosphates and will provide guidance for better ps utilization in real water treatment practice graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphate persulfate homogeneous catalysis heterocatalysis water treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction recently persulfates ps based advanced oxidation processes ps aops for organic pollutant degradation have attracted increasing attention commonly ps have two types of ions peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 and peroxodisulfate pds s2o8 2 devi et al 2016 according to previous reports ps cannot directly degrade most persistent organic pollutants effectively due to low oxidation potential e0 pds 2 01 v e0 pms 1 82 v peng et al 2021b encouragingly ps exhibit promising selective oxidation sometimes based on the electron rich moieties of target pollutants zhou et al 2020b thus it is necessary to activate ps to generate more oxidative species such as sulfate radicals so4 hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 for contaminant degradation dai et al 2021 ps aops in terms of sulfate radicals possess remarkable advantages of a high redox potential 2 5 3 1 v wide ph range 4 9 and long half life 30 40 μs zhao et al 2021 zhou et al 2018b many methods have been applied to activate ps using external energy e g uv heat ultrasound transition metal and carbon based catalysts yan et al 2020 li et al 2020a among them exterior energy activation might be restricted in practical applications as it requires more energy input matzek and carter 2016 tan et al 2017 teel et al 2009 transition metal ions might induce secondary pollution and suffer from recycling limitation in the process of ps activation li et al 2019a attractively heterogeneous catalysts could address the above mentioned issues wu et al 2019 especially carbon based catalysts possess a high surface area and large pore volume abundant functional groups and high conductivity thus receiving widespread attentions cheng et al 2019 furthermore transition metals could be immobilized on carbon materials exhibiting excellent stability and reusability for practical applications kang et al 2020 li et al 2020b wu et al 2018 phosphate ions exist widely in water environment mainly in the forms of h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 the dissociation balance of phosphate ions in water depends on solution ph as shown in eq 1 1 h 3 p o 4 k 1 h 2 po 4 k 2 hpo 4 2 k 3 po 4 3 where the values are pk1 2 15 pk2 7 20 and pk3 12 33 perrin and dempsey 1974 therefore the solution ph will determine the dominant form of phosphate fig 1 the impact of phosphate ions has been reported to be either positive negative or negligible in different ps systems for instance lou et al 2014 prepared a phosphate buffer solution pbs with coexistence of h2po4 and hpo4 2 at ph 7 0 the degradation rate constant k obs of acid orange 7 ao7 increased from 1 22 10 4 to 3 95 10 3 s 1 as the pbs concentration changed from 10 0 to 100 0 mm lou et al 2014 however the rate constant of orange ii degradation decreased by 67 0 when 100 0 mm of h2po4 was added to a mnfe2o4 corn stems biochar pms system fu et al 2019 in addition the removal rate of total organic carbon reduced slightly from 28 0 to 26 0 after adding 2 0 mm po4 3 in a co1 51fe1 49o4 pms system initial ph 6 5 yang et al 2019 revealing a negligible effect of the phosphate ion on bisphenol a bpa mineralization noticeably one phosphate form could have different effects on various ps aops systems for example h2po4 could inhibit tetracycline oxidation in a nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi yco3o4 pds system huang et al 2020 while promote norfloxacin degradation in a co3o4 fe2o3 pms system chen et al 2019 besides hpo4 2 also showed different effects on ps activation systems atrazine atz removal was inhibited by hpo4 2 in a cofe2o4 activated pms system li et al 2018 however decolorization of ao7 was promoted significantly in the presence of hpo4 2 in a hpo4 2 pms system peng et al 2021a interestingly varying effects were also observed after adding different forms of phosphate to one ps system for example h2po4 could accelerate bpa degradation while hpo4 2 presented an inhibition effect in a comg bo pms system dan et al 2022 although the effects of phosphate on contaminant degradation have been reported in many ps aops systems the roles of phosphate ions in the processes were not well clarified meanwhile no literature has summarized the mechanisms of phosphate ions in various ps systems herein the main aims of this review are to 1 comprehensively assess the roles of phosphate ions in ps systems 2 summarize the various mechanisms of phosphate ions in different ps systems and 3 provide some references for future investigations of a ps system towards phosphate containing organic degradation in wastewater this review will help promote the strategic development and application of ps systems in practical wastewater treatment 2 influence of phosphate ions on direct oxidation by ps ps aops exhibited strong oxidation ability reactive stability and controllable oxidation potential in removing organic pollutants however the role of inactivated ps is often overlooked during contaminant oxidation ji et al 2018 yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2018a direct oxidation by ps is a non radical process in which the electron rich organics could transfer electrons to ps and then be oxidized peng et al 2021b the degradation process involves three pathways of two electron one electron and 1o2 oxidation fig 2 ding et al 2021 in the two electron oxidation process additional reaction occurs via the transfer of oxygen atoms from pms to organic pollutants ding et al 2021 for one electron oxidation one electron transfer from pollutants to pms leads to the generation of organic cation radicals p which will then participate in hydroxylation reactions and produce degradation intermediates ding et al 2021 moreover 1o2 can be generated by self decomposition of pms eq 2 liang et al 2017 or interactions between intermediates and pms li et al 2019b and will play a certain role in contaminant degradation yin et al 2018 2 hso 5 so 5 2 hso 4 so 4 2 1 o 2 k 0 2 m 1 s 1 according to the literature the effects of phosphate i e hpo4 2 and co existence of hpo4 2 and h2po4 on non activated pms systems have been discussed besides phosphates were reported to show little impact on direct oxidation by pds the phenomenon might be ascribed to steric hindrance of two so3 groups on either side of the peroxide linker and symmetrical distribution of charges duan et al 2021 hpo4 2 accelerates the degradation of pollutants by activating pms to produce so4 for instance the degradation rate of ao7 by pms increased by about 80 0 in the presence of 10 0 mm of hpo4 2 while such an effect was not obvious at a low hpo4 2 concentration 1 0 mm yang et al 2010 the nucleophile hpo4 2 could combine with hso5 easily and form a complex then the p o could attack o atom near s o in pms causing an electron cloud rearrangement and increase of o o bond length from 1 4 å to 1 8 å duan et al 2021 the elongation of o o promoted its breaking and electron transfer thus facilitating so4 formation besides so4 is the primary active species with co existing hpo4 2 in pms solution 8 0 ph 8 6 the hpo4 2 with a low concentration could result in fewer so4 production as a result the effect of a low concentration hpo4 2 on ao7 degradation could be negligible the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 at high concentrations in the neutral media exhibit similar effects to single hpo4 2 on pms activation in contrast the coexistence of hpo4 2 and h2po4 at low concentrations inhibit pollutant degradation after adding 0 1 m pbs ph 7 0 to an un activated pms system the removal rate of ao7 increased by 98 6 in 15 min lou et al 2014 pms with asymmetric structure is nucleophilically attacked by oxygenated anions in pbs then active species e g so4 are produced generally so4 reacts with water in solution to generate oh eq 3 therefore so4 and oh species promote ao7 decomposition however the degradation efficiency of sulfamethoxazole smx decreased by approximately 7 0 when 5 0 mm of po4 3 was added to a non activated pms system ph 7 5 coexistence of hpo4 2 and h2po4 yin et al 2018 both hpo4 2 and h2po4 possess nucleophilic atoms o which can occupy the binding site between pms and smx through attacking the s atom in smx as a result the degradation process was inhibited 3 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 oh h k h 2 o 3 1 0 3 m 1 s 1 as shown in fig 3 different forms of phosphate exhibited different effects on organic degradation in the direct oxidation system by pms hpo4 2 and co existence of hpo4 2 and h2po4 at high concentrations can activate pms to produce oxidative species thus accelerating the degradation process the coexistence of hpo4 2 and h2po4 at low concentrations may preferentially interact with the nucleophilic sites in organics presenting an inhibitory effect by competing with pms for the reaction sites nevertheless to our knowledge no study on the effects of po4 3 and h2po4 in a non activated pms system is reported and it should be investigated in future 3 influence of phosphate ions on energy activated ps systems the generation of oxidative species e g so4 oh and 1o2 is the key for rapid degradation of contaminants and could be achieved by uv visible light thermal and electrochemical activation of ps wacławek et al 2017 uv activation could break o o bond in ps producing free radicals eqs 4 and 5 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004b similarly heating could also activate ps as it is known visible light occupies 45 of the solar spectrum and it is promising for its application in ps activation jia et al 2020 moreover ps could be activated via an electro chemical route in which the sacrificial iron anode attracts much attention cai et al 2016 4 hso 5 h v so 4 oh 5 s 2 o 8 2 h v 2 so 4 3 1 uv light activation in recent studies the effects of hpo4 2 h2po4 and their mixture in a uv activation system have received attention however the effect of po4 3 in the uv activated ps system has not been reported in detail regarding hpo4 2 no investigation was reported in a uv pms system in a uv pds system it was confirmed that hpo4 2 adversely affects contaminant removal whereas the impact became weaker at a low concentration the degradation rates of free cn were decreased by about 8 0 14 0 after adding 1 6 5 2 mm hpo4 2 to a uv pds system ph 11 satizabal gómez et al 2021 however the cn removal rate remained almost unchanged slightly increased by 4 0 in the presence of a low concentration of hpo4 2 0 5 mm satizabal gómez et al 2021 so4 could react with oh to generate oh in an aqueous solution ph 8 5 eq 6 li et al 2019b although oh 1 8 2 7 v huang et al 2014 presents slightly lower redox potential than so4 2 5 3 1 v oh has higher selectivity in degrading cn as oh could react with cn directly or through electron transfer generating cno cn could also react with so4 but the reaction rate is very low because of the static repulsion between cn and so4 satizabal gómez et al 2021 consequently oh formation might increase the cn degradation rate what is more hpo4 2 could react with oh and so4 in solution and produce low oxidation species hpo 4 maruthamuthu and neta 1978 showing negative effects on contaminant removal eq 7 the promoting effects of oh outweigh the negative impact of hpo4 2 at low concentrations hence the inhibition of contaminant degradation was not observed however the scavenging of hpo4 2 became obvious towards oh and so4 eqs 7 and 8 at a higher concentration inhibiting pollutant removal 6 so 4 o h so 4 2 oh k 6 5 1 0 1 0 7 m 1 s 1 7 hpo 4 2 oh o h hpo 4 k 1 5 1 0 5 m 1 s 1 8 hpo 4 2 so 4 so 4 2 hpo 4 k 1 2 1 0 6 m 1 s 1 h2po4 inhibits contaminant degradation in a uv pms system while its effect in a uv pds system is not reported for instance with the addition of h2po4 to a uv pms system ph 5 5 0 5 the time of removing equivalent amount of tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep prolonged from 20 to 30 min xu et al 2017 phosphate presents mainly in the form of h2po4 at ph 5 5 0 5 besides little hpo4 2 exists in the system and its impact could be ignored so4 e 2 5 3 1 v could be consumed by h2po4 producing h 2 po 4 eq 9 with lower oxidation potential e 2 7 v ma et al 2018 as a result the reaction rate decreased 9 h 2 po 4 so 4 so 4 2 h 2 po 4 k 7 2 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 similar to h2po4 a mixture of hpo4 2 and h2po4 in neutral solution with a concentration ratio of about 2 1 could consume partial oh and so4 in a uv pms or pds system inhibiting contaminant degradation for instance the k obs of tcep in a uv pms system decreased from 1 31 10 1 to 8 03 10 2 min 1 with a h2po4 concentration increasing from 1 0 10 2 to 1 03 mm ph 6 6 7 0 yu et al 2021 the mixture of hpo4 2 and h2po4 could consume oh and so4 eqs 7 10 generating low oxidative species the oxidation capacity of the species followed the order of oh so4 h 2 po 4 hpo 4 maruthamuthu and neta 1978 noticeably the reaction rate constants of hpo 4 2 and oh as well as hpo 4 2 and so4 eqs 7 and 8 are larger than those of h 2 po 4 and oh as well as h 2 po 4 and so4 eqs 9 and 10 in other words adding hpo4 2 could consume more oh and so4 compared to h2po4 appearing more obvious inhibition to contaminant decontamination consequently after adding h2po4 the degradation rate of 2 4 di tert butylphenol 2 4 d maintained at about 7 87 10 4 s 1 and the role of phosphate ion was not obvious whereas the degradation rate of 2 4 d decreased from 7 87 10 4 to 4 80 10 4 s 1 with the addition of hpo4 2 ph 7 0 0 1 in a uv pds system wang et al 2016 10 h 2 po 4 oh o h h 2 po 4 k 2 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 as discussed above due to the ability to scavenge free radicals e g so4 and oh fig 4 hpo4 2 in a uv pds system h2po4 in a uv pms system and the mixture of hpo4 2 and h2po4 in a uv pms or pds system generally pose negative impacts on an oxidation process 3 2 thermal activation thermal activation of ps is a high energy consumption process especially at high temperature over 40 c eqs 11 and 12 ghauch and tuqan 2012 in such a system the effects of hpo4 2 h2po4 po4 3 and co existing hpo4 2 and h2po4 on the degradation of pollutants have been reported 11 s 2 o 8 2 thermal activation 2 so 4 30 t 99 12 hso 5 thermal activation so 4 oh in a thermal activated pms system hpo4 2 could activate pms effectively and generate so4 accelerating contaminant degradation for instance k obs of atz decomposition increased from 1 20 10 2 to 1 01 min 1 with hpo4 2 concentration rising from 0 to 50 0 mm ph 9 0 45 c duan et al 2021 according to thermodynamic density functional calculations the energy barrier needed for attacking o o bond in pms with p o in hpo4 2 is 102 5 kj mol duan et al 2021 thus hpo4 2 could break o o bond in pms rapidly at high temperature and phosphate concentration generating so4 nevertheless this reaction process was slower at room temperature and low phosphate concentrations however an inhibitory influence of hpo4 2 was observed in a thermal activated pds system as hpo4 2 failed to activate pds efficiently duan et al 2021 at 50 k obs of methylparaben mep and ethylparaben etp removal decreased by 26 5 and 40 7 separately as the ph of pbs increased from 7 coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 to 9 single hpo4 2 chen et al 2017 according to eq 13 lu et al 2019 the percentage of hpo4 2 increased with solution ph the scavenge of so4 and oh by hpo4 2 became more obvious with ph increasing inhibiting the removal of mep and etp significantly 13 ph 7 20 log hpo 4 2 h 2 po 4 in a thermal activated pms system the positive influence of h2po4 on contaminant degradation could be ignored although no report describes the role of h2po4 in a thermal activated pds system it is reasonable to speculate that it may play an inhibitory role due to quenching of free radicals in a thermal activated pms system k obs of atz degradation increased from 2 80 10 3 to 5 80 10 3 min 1 with a h2po4 concentration increasing from 0 to 20 0 mm at ph 4 1 duan et al 2021 with the h2po4 concentration further rising to 50 0 mm the k obs value decreased slightly to 4 80 10 3 min 1 duan et al 2021 as it is known the energy barrier needed for o o bond attack by p o in h2po4 is high 172 4 kj mol duan et al 2021 consequently it is difficult for h2po4 to activate pms effectively in addition h2po4 could consume so4 and oh eqs 9 and 10 inhibiting contaminant degradation more intensely at a high h2po4 concentration however the reaction rate constants of h2po4 with oh as well as h2po4 with so4 are relatively small making weak inhibition to contaminant removal in particular the role of po4 3 in heat ps systems is still ambiguous according to density functional theory calculation po4 3 could break o o bond of pms easily with a low energy barrier 67 8 kj mol duan et al 2021 thus the role of po4 3 in heat pms or pds systems remains to be further investigated the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 in neutral conditions could also promote contaminant degradation in a thermally activated pms system while the role of coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 in thermally activated pds systems has not been reported with the addition of 4 0 10 0 and 20 0 mm of pbs to the thermally activated pms system separately ph 7 k obs of atz degradation increased from 3 38 10 2 to 8 17 10 2 1 61 10 1 and 2 38 10 1 min 1 correspondingly duan et al 2021 after adding 4 0 mm of pbs the apparent activation energy of phosphate pms e a p 82 8 kj mol was smaller than that of single pms system e a 94 1 kj mol duan et al 2021 more importantly the steady state concentration of so4 showed a good linear relationship with phosphate concentration r 2 0 983 duan et al 2021 obviously phosphate could lower the cleavage energy of o o in pms which was beneficial to produce so4 and promote contaminant degradation therefore hpo4 2 could break o o bond in pms and generate so4 in a thermal activation system promoting contaminant degradation fig 4 in contrast the negative impact of hpo4 2 in thermally activated pds systems is attributed to the quenching of free radicals h2po4 in a heat pms system shows a positive and negligible influence on pollutant degradation the high energy barrier between h2po4 and pms leads to the difficulties in activating pms besides the co existing hpo4 2 and h2po4 also present a positive effect on pms activation which reduces the cleavage energy of o o in pms for radical generation 3 3 electrochemical activation in an electrochemical activation process both anode and cathode could activate ps and produce active species fu et al 2022 ps could accept electrons on the cathode surface to be transformed into so4 and oh eqs 14 and 15 for mineralizing organic pollutants eq 16 zhang et al 2020 moreover ps activation using carbon or metal based anode also attracted wide attention for instance carbon anode could activate ps and produce an active state namely ps on the electrode surface with high reactivity ps could provide electrons and reduce organic contaminants directly eq 17 meanwhile ps could oxidize water molecules on the electrode to form oh eq 18 besides ps might increase the over potential of water oxidation and obtain more oh during electrolysis eq 19 song et al 2018 14 s 2 o 8 2 e so 4 so 4 2 15 hso 5 e so 4 o h or oh so 4 2 16 so 4 oh pollutant c o 2 h 2 o intermediates so 4 2 17 p s pollutants products so 4 2 18 p s h 2 o oh h so 4 2 19 h 2 o e oh h in electrochemical activation of ps it is universal to investigate the degradation under acid condition as the mineralization efficiency of contaminants increased with a decrease of solution ph waclawek et al 2016 thus only the role of h2po4 has been received attention and the effects of other forms of phosphate e g po4 3 and hpo4 2 are seldom reported in an electrochemical activation of pms process the presence of h2po4 inhibits pollutant degradation for a carbon cloth anode activated pms system k obs of smx decomposition increased from 4 75 10 2 to 5 89 10 2 min 1 with low po4 3 dosage 5 0 mm original ph 3 6 fu et al 2022 however the k obs value decreased to 4 67 10 2 and 2 01 10 2 min 1 as po4 3 dosage further increased to 10 0 and 20 0 mm separately fu et al 2022 water molecules could be transferred into oh eq 19 and o2 eq 20 after the reactions at the anode consequently the solution ph in the anode chamber decreased gradually with the generation of h obviously only h2po4 existed in both bulk solution and anode surface in addition p2o8 4 could be formed on anode surface eq 21 for pollutant degradation after adding po4 3 to the system sánchez et al 2013 negatively charged h2po4 would compete with pms on anode surface inhibiting electrochemical activation of pms moreover side reactions between h2po4 and so4 eq 9 as well as h2po4 and oh eq 10 could inhibit smx removal therefore p2o8 4 participated in smx degradation with a low concentration of po4 3 however with an increase of po4 3 concentration the competition between h2po4 and pms and inhibition of free radicals by h2po4 overweigh the contributions of p2o8 4 oxidation leading to a decrease of smx degradation rate 20 2 h 2 o 4 e o 2 4 h 21 2 po 4 3 2 e p 2 o 8 4 h2po4 also exhibits negative impacts on pds activation in a boron doped diamond bdd anode activated pds system the degradation rate of atz decreased by about 31 0 initial ph 4 after adding 1 0 mm of h2po4 bu et al 2018 solution ph maintains at 4 during the reactions in a single electrolytic cell phosphate presents mainly in the form of h2po4 with little h3po4 in the system as mentioned previously h2po4 could consume so4 2 5 3 1 v and oh 1 8 2 7 v eqs 9 and 10 and generate h 2 po 4 with low oxidation potential e0 2 7 v ma et al 2018 as a result the degradation reaction was inhibited similarly the degradation rate of carbamazepine decreased from 6 45 10 2 to 4 95 10 2 min 1 with co existing 20 0 mm of po4 3 song et al 2017 in brief for the electrochemical activation of pms or pds process h2po4 exerts an inhibitory effect as h2po4 could consume so4 and oh and generate phosphoric radicals with low oxidation potential inhibiting contaminant removal fig 4 furthermore h2po4 and hso5 or s2o8 2 are negatively charged ions which could compete for adsorption on the electrode surface as a result the number of adsorbed hso5 or s2o8 2 on electrode surface reduced and the electrochemical activation was inhibited 3 4 photocatalytic activation the combination of different semiconductors e g tio2 zno and wo3 and light uv visible light for the activation of pms and pds has received considerable attention isari et al 2021 large amounts of adsorbed organic pollutants could be degraded through light induced redox reactions mamba and mishra 2016 different from the catalyst free uv activation discussed in section 3 1 the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and light induced ps activation realized more pollutant degradation in the photocatalytic process a semiconductor photocatalyst could absorb energy for generating electron hole pairs eq 22 mamba and mishra 2016 the photo induced electrons could react with oxygen and ps producing o 2 and so 4 respectively eqs 23 and 24 kang et al 2021 meanwhile holes h could activate ps and generate so 5 eq 25 xu et al 2022 in addition h could capture oh or h2o forming oh eqs 26 and 27 mamba and mishra 2016 in general photocatalytic activation of ps is complicated commonly only the initial ph of a ps system with photocatalysis was adjusted according to eqs 24 27 the solution ph always changed during reactions indicating the phosphate forms were altered as well it was found that the removal rate of bpa decreased from 94 6 to 37 8 with a h2po4 concentration increasing from 0 to 5 0 mm at initial ph 3 98 jia et al 2020 phosphate anions could be adsorbed strongly on photocatalyst e g tio2 surface via an inner sphere surface complex thereby changing the interfacial and surface chemistry of the photocatalyst zhao et al 2008 the phosphate anions might act as poisons to a photocatalyst reducing the catalytic activity kanakaraju et al 2015 in addition the photocatalysts modified by phosphate might have a positive effect due to the extended band gap energy and larger surface area jimmy et al 2003 however the influence of phosphate on the photocatalysis assisted ps systems was still ambiguous besides the phosphate form was not clearly controlled without a buffer solution in the system thus the influence of phosphate ions in ps oxidation with photocatalysis requires a deep study in a buffer solution 22 semiconductor h v e h 23 e o 2 o 2 24 e hso 5 so 4 o h 25 h hso 5 so 5 h 26 h oh oh 27 h h 2 o oh h commonly the activation potential of ps can be improved obviously via introducing external energy e g uv thermal and electricity however the co existing phosphate ions in different energy activated ps systems affect the activation and organic degradation to some extent usually phosphate ions inhibit the pollutant degradation in uv thermal and ec ps systems due to the depletion of free radicals and production of low oxidative species noticeably in thermal ps systems phosphate ions hpo4 2 and co existing hpo4 2 and h2po4 can also promote contaminant degradation by generating free radicals via attacking the o o bond in pms besides the consumption of free radicals and the competition between phosphate ions and pms on the anode surface also inhibits pollutant degradation in ec ps systems interestingly p2o8 4 could be formed on the anode surface facilitating pollutant degradation in the ec ps systems with a low po4 3 concentration in terms of poor control of phosphate ion forms the effect of phosphate ions on photocatalysis assisted ps systems needs to be further investigated in buffer solutions 4 influence of phosphate ions on catalytic activation of persulfate 4 1 homogeneous catalysis for ps activation by transition metal ions single electron could transfer from metal ions to pds or pms ding et al 2021 generating so4 and oh eqs 28 30 as it is known co2 exhibited higher activity towards pms activation than other metals anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004a meanwhile iron was environmental friendly and was considered as an effective activator for pds song et al 2020 thus the roles of phosphate ions i e h2po4 and the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 in the two common homogeneous systems were summarized in addition due to the lack of experimental studies the effect of single po4 3 and hpo4 2 will not be discussed 28 m e n s 2 o 8 2 m e n 1 so 4 so 4 2 me metal ions 29 m e n hso 5 m e n 1 so 4 o h 30 m e n hso 5 m e n 1 so 4 2 oh 4 1 1 the effect of h2po4 h2po4 has been reported to inhibit contaminant degradation in co2 pms systems fig 5 with the addition of 10 0 mm po4 3 presenting as h2po4 at ph 6 to a co2 pms system k obs of black b degradation decreased from 0 37 to 0 22 min 1 fig 6 a huang et al 2009 the reason might be ascribed to radical scavenge by phosphate ions besides phosphate ions could react with metal ions to form complexes zhu et al 2021 and further studies are still needed on the formation of h2po4 co2 complexes for the reduced activity for homogeneous catalysis in a pds system h2po4 could lower the catalytic activity of fe2 thereby inhibiting pollutant degradation fig 5 the inhibition has been verified in the removal of carbamazepine rao et al 2014 sulfisoxazole song et al 2020 and orange g yuan et al 2021 for instance with the addition of 1 0 10 0 and 100 0 mm of h2po4 solution to a fe2 activated pds system separately ph 3 5 k obs of orange g degradation decreased from 0 12 to 2 50 10 3 9 00 10 4 and 0 min 1 correspondingly xu and li 2010 under strong acidic conditions h2po4 could react with fe2 to form feh2po4 complexes restraining pds activation song et al 2020 besides the inhibitory effect of h2po4 is also ascribed to quenching so4 and oh in the system in addition to the effect on the catalyst activity and reactive oxygen species h2po4 could also influence the adsorption performance of in situ formed fe oh 3 in a fe2 pds system as shown in fig 6 b the removal efficiency of arsenic decreased from 99 1 to 11 7 after adding 0 1 mm of po4 3 ph 6 0 1 0 wang et al 2020 phosphate ions present mainly in the form of h2po4 with little hpo4 2 in the system the fe oh 3 exhibited positive effects on arsenic adsorption however the ζ potential of fe oh 3 decreased from positive 4 4 mv to negative 3 1 mv in the presence of h2po4 wang et al 2020 electrostatic repulsion occurred between negatively charged fe oh 3 and arsenic decreasing removal rate of total arsenic besides the addition of po4 3 might result in the generation of insoluble fe2 species thereby decreasing the utilization rate of fe2 for pds activation to inhibit the arsenic removal 4 1 2 the effect of co existing hpo4 2 and h2po4 as co2 was applied for pms activation the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 could promote contaminant degradation at low concentrations while exhibit inhibition at a high concentration the k obs of atz degradation increased to 1 29 10 1 min 1 after adding 10 0 mm of pbs which was 5 4 times higher than that 2 40 10 2 min 1 obtained without phosphate ions zhu et al 2021 with phosphate ion concentration further increasing to 15 0 mm the removal rate of atz decreased slightly zhu et al 2021 in neutral solution with coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 hpo4 2 could react with co2 to generate a cohpo4 complex furthermore cohpo4 has unique six coordination unit structure accelerating electron transfer and improving the co3 co2 transformation cycle for pms activation and so4 production notably the reactions between hpo4 2 and radicals played a leading role in the co2 pms system nevertheless the complex formed by hpo4 2 and co2 was not observed as presented in fig 6 c smx removal rate decreased by 10 0 in 8 min in the presence of hpo4 2 in a co2 pms h3bo3 system at ph 8 huang et al 2022 in conclusion h2po4 had adverse impacts in co2 pms systems h2po4 could consume so4 and oh and therefore inhibit contaminant removal in addition to quenching radicals h2po4 could also inhibit contaminant degradation in fe2 pds systems by complexing with fe2 the concentration of fe2 would also be decreased due to the formation of iron precipitation with phosphate reactions inhibiting the ps activation for pollutant removal however the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 at a low concentration has been proven to promote contaminant degradation in co2 pms systems the cohpo4 complex formed from hpo4 2 and co2 with unique ligand structure could promote electron transfer in a co3 co2 cycle benefiting for so4 production 4 2 metal based heterogeneous catalysis heterogeneous metal and carbon based catalysts played vital roles in ps activation and contaminant degradation common single metal catalysts consist of iron manganese and cobalt based oxides or sulfides duan et al 2020 as reported bimetals exhibited synergies in ps activation compared with single metal catalysts enhancing catalytic activity huang et al 2017 nevertheless inevitable metal leaching and particle aggregation limited the activity of pure metal based catalysts yang et al 2021 therefore metal loaded catalysts were designed by introducing the metals into carbon based or nitrogen doped carbon materials in such oxidation systems the effects of h2po4 and the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 have gained extensive attention nevertheless no study on po4 3 and hpo4 2 is reported and it should be investigated in future 4 2 1 the effect of h2po4 in a radical based pms system activated by a heterogeneous catalyst so4 and oh could be quenched by h2po4 leading to the inhibition of pollutant degradation the degradation rates of acetamiprid in the femn ncnts pms system ph 5 0 decreased with the addition of h2po4 duan et al 2019 however the negative impact of h2po4 by quenching radicals was weakened with improved catalyst activity under the same concentrations of the oxidant 0 2 mm contaminant 21 2 μ m and catalyst 0 2 g l the carmazepine cbz removal rates reached 100 0 within 20 min in a comgfe ldo pms system hong et al 2020 and 95 0 within 40 min in a mos2 pms system zhou et al 2020a without h2po4 addition in comparison the comgfe ldo showed a higher catalytic activity as shown in table 1 and fig 6 d the cbz degradation rate decreased by 52 6 76 8 in the mos2 pms system with adding 1 0 10 0 mm of h2po4 zhou et al 2020a the cbz degradation rate decreased by 18 2 125 0 in the mos2 pms system under unit conditions eq 31 zhou et al 2020a however the cbz degradation rate only decreased by 8 5 in the comgfe ldo pms system under unit conditions after adding h2po4 hong et al 2020 in general the higher the catalyst activity the larger yield of radicals in the oxidation system thereby the quenched radicals by h2po4 could be compensated rapidly via pms activation with a highly active catalyst leading to an indistinctive decline of degradation efficiency 31 η η c catalyst c pollutants c oxidant c phosphate t ssa additionally h2po4 could also inhibit contaminant degradation by interacting with metal sites on catalyst surface in heterogeneous catalyst activated pms systems as it is summarized in table 1 the degradation rate of bpa decreased by 6 7 in the presence of 0 1 mm of h2po4 hu et al 2018 h2po4 was believed to form complexes with co ii on catalyst surface through chelation reactions which occupied reactive sites retarding bpa degradation however h2po4 could combine with pms easily and therefore promote oxidative species formation as fewer metal sites were exposed to the catalyst surface the atz degradation rate increased from 3 56 10 2 to 5 90 10 2 1 37 10 1 min 1 after addition of 2 0 10 0 mm h2po4 into the natural kaolinite pms system li et al 2019a the steady state concentrations of so4 and oh were proven to be increased with a rising h2po4 concentration besides the residual pms decreased with an increasing h2po4 concentration li et al 2019a considering that some metal species in natural kaolinite are blocked by abundant hydroxyl groups on catalyst surface the combination of h2po4 and pms may become easier thus promoting contaminant degradation interestingly h2po4 can also inhibit contaminant degradation in heterogeneous catalysts activated pds systems by interacting with metal sites as shown in table 1 and fig 6 e the degradation rate of atz decreased from 91 5 to 88 0 and 57 1 after adding 4 0 and 8 0 mm of hpo4 2 mainly presented as h2po4 in a cus pds system peng et al 2018 the inhibition of phosphate ions to atz degradation was mainly ascribed to its strong affinity to cu ii on catalyst surface and thereby competed with pds to the active sites furthermore h2po4 could react with fe2 or fe3 to form complexes eqs 32 and 33 in the radical dominated zero valent iron zvi pms or pds system restraining organic contaminant degradation gao et al 2021 for example the removal rate of ao7 decreased by 51 5 after adding 50 0 mm of h2po4 into the zvi pds system li et al 2015 iron ions were commonly used to remove phosphate from wastewater by chemical precipitation therefore iron ions could form different complexes with phosphate rapidly decreasing the available soluble fe2 for ps activation fulazzaky et al 2014 in addition the zvi surface might be covered quickly by the generated complexes feh2po4 or feh2po4 2 showing a strong steric resistance effect nie et al 2015 as a result the contact between ps and zvi was prevented suppressing ps activation eqs 34 and 35 32 f e 2 h 2 po 4 fe h 2 po 4 33 f e 3 h 2 po 4 fe h 2 po 4 2 34 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 so 4 so 4 2 35 f e 0 s 2 o 8 2 f e 2 2 so 4 2 4 2 2 the effect of co existing hpo4 2 and h2po4 in the system of pms activation using heterogeneous catalysts the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 is not beneficial to pollutant degradation the degradation rates of bpa in the mnfeo c pms system ph 6 5 decreased with the presence of hpo4 2 and h2po4 yang et al 2021 for an amorphous mno2 pms oxidation system ph 7 dominated by an electron transfer pathway the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 could occupy manganese sites by replacing the hydroxyl group on catalyst surface inhibiting reactive complexes formation between mno2 and pms wang et al 2018 thus the direct electron transfer between the complexes and bpa was hindered similar to h2po4 the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 also play a facilitating role in pms activation the degradation rate of clothianidin ctd increased after introducing hpo4 2 and h2po4 in a femn n c pms system duan et al 2020 attributing to encapsulation of fe and mn metals with nitrogen doped graphene hydrogen bond was formed between phosphate and ctd and then electron density distribution in ctd was altered resulting in a decrease of dissociation energy of ctd molecules and enhancement of ctd degradation meanwhile the dissociation energy of o o bond in pms decreased from 157 3 to 145 2 kj mol after combination with h2po4 duan et al 2020 the production of active oxygen species e g 1o2 so4 and oh would be accelerated unfortunately no conclusion was found regarding the effect of coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 on pollutant degradation in pds oxidation systems and relevant studies are required in future as illustrated in fig 5 h2po4 can inhibit pollutant degradation by quenching so4 and oh in the heterogeneous catalyst activated pms system additionally h2po4 can play an inhibitory role by interacting with metal sites on catalyst surface which hinders the combination of pms and catalysts in contrast the combination of h2po4 and pms became easier as fewer metal sites were exposed to the catalyst surface promoting pms activation and contaminant degradation in the heterogeneous catalyst activated pds system h2po4 exhibited predictable inhibition due to the ability to occupy metal sites similarly the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 are also detrimental to pms activation sometimes the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 can play a positive role in the catalyst activated pms system with fewer metal sites exposed to catalyst surface phosphate ions are more likely to bind with pms or contaminants as a result dissociation energies of chemical bonds in pms or contaminant molecules become lower facilitating contaminant degradation collectively phosphate ions inhibit the pollutant degradation via competing active sites of metal element fe0 and metal sulfide cus catalysts in pms and pds systems respectively besides phosphate ions limit the contaminant degradation through quenching radicals and occupying sites for the formation of complexes in the oxidation systems induced via polymetallic hybrid comgfe ldo metal sulfide mos2 bimetallic oxide composite co3o4 bi2o3 and carbon coated bimetallic particle and oxide femn ncnt and mnfeo c notably phosphate ions reduce the cleavage energy of chemical bonds in pms or pollutants in the pms system catalyzed via graphene coated bimetallic nanoparticles femn n c thereby promoting the pollutant degradation moreover phosphate ions can facilitate pms decomposition via nucleophilic attack to generate radicals for pollutant oxidation in a natural mineral kaolinite catalyzed pms system nevertheless the inhibition effect of phosphate ions is observed in an amorphous mno2 activated pms system because phosphate ions exhibit strong affinity with amorphous mno2 leading to the restriction of reactive complex formation between the amorphous mno2 and pms notably the efficiency of oxidant usage is related to the operational cost of persulfate based oxidation processes directly after adding 0 10 m h2po4 in a sodium citrate sc chelated ferrous ion activated pds system the degradation efficiency of pyrene fe2 sc pds was reduced from 94 4 to 36 9 gao et al 2021 also h2po4 inhibited the pds consumption correspondingly the utilization of pds decreased from 98 2 to 56 7 the inhibition of h2po4 was attributed to the complexation of h2po4 with fe2 or fe3 the catalytic activity of iron phosphate complexes was lower than that of fe2 besides the competitive complexation between sc and phosphate with fe3 inhibited the cycling of fe3 and fe2 consequently pyrene degradation rate was declined to further investigate the change of oxidant usage induced by phosphate anions in the fe2 sc pds system we evaluated the oxidant consumption per unit pollutant removal rate the effective utilization factor of the oxidant was defined as the ratio of oxidant consumption rate to pollutant degradation efficiency by calculation the effective utilization factor of pds was 1 04 in the absence of h2po4 and increased to 1 54 with the addition of h2po4 clearly the addition of h2po4 to the system reduced the effective utilization of the oxidant as a result a higher reagent cost was required to degrade the same amount of pollutants in a ldh nanoscrolls pms system h2po4 promoted mb degradation sun et al 2022 complete degradation of mb was achieved without h2po4 with the addition of 10 mm of h2po4 the k obs was approximately two times higher 1 58 10 1 min 1 than that of the control 8 96 10 2 min 1 sun et al 2022 besides the pms consumption 39 0 was also approximately 3 5 times higher than that of the control group 11 0 sun et al 2022 h2po4 can promote production of reactive oxygen species by reducing the bond dissociation energy of o o in pms in addition the positive effect of h2po4 might be enhanced by the introduction of ldh nano microspheres the effective utilization factor of pms improved from 0 11 to 0 39 after the addition of 10 mm h2po4 implying a decrease in the effective utilization of pms oxidant interestingly phosphate anions inhibited the cbz degradation in the mos2 pms system zhou et al 2020a mo atoms could coordinate with phosphate anions to produce polymetallic oxides such as phosphomolybdate which might inhibit the pms activation and active species production the presence of phosphate anions inhibited the pms consumption and the inhibition became obvious with an increased phosphate anion concentration specifically with the addition of 1 and 10 mm of h2po4 the cbz degradation efficiency was dropped from 95 to 45 and 22 respectively correspondingly the consumption rate of pms was reduced from 75 to 20 and 10 respectively zhou et al 2020a the effective utilization factor of pms was 0 79 in the control while it was decreased to 0 44 and 0 45 with 1 and 10 mm of h2po4 respectively a similar phenomenon was also observed with the addition of 1 and 10 mm of hpo4 2 the effective utilization factor of pms dropped to 0 32 and 0 34 respectively a reduced effective utilization factor implied an increase in the effective utilization of the oxidant and a lower reagent cost femn ncnts fe mn nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes comgfe ldo

heterogeneous catalysis metal catalysts could be substituted by green and promising non metal carbons which have been applied for ps activation extensively gao et al 2020 to be specific carbon catalysts possess a large surface area abundant resources acid and alkali resistance and tunable physicochemical and electronic properties duan et al 2018 in addition the possible secondary contamination induced by metals could be overcome in a ps system activated carbon graphene carbon nanotubes cnts and biochar have been applied in ps activation for contaminant removal liu et al 2020 generally positively charged carbon structural defects oxygen containing functional groups e g c o oh and cooh and heteroatoms e g n and s were considered as the active sites for ps activation commonly free radical and non radical pathways exist simultaneously the non radical pathway includes catalyst ps complex oxidation and electron transfer between 1o2 ps and contaminants huang et al 2021 contaminant degradation might be still restrained in the presence of phosphate ions although the removal rate of ao7 was decreased from 98 6 to 96 2 within 60 min after adding 10 mm of h2po4 to an activated carbon cloth acc pds system the rate constant dropped from 8 20 10 2 to 6 00 10 2 min 1 obviously fig 6 f liu et al 2020 on one hand h2po4 could quench partial so4 and oh on the other hand h2po4 could occupy c oh sites on catalyst surface suppressing pds activation to some extent liu et al 2020 however no other route was reported regarding the effect of phosphate ions on contaminant removal the related influence mechanism remained ambiguous in carbon activated ps systems specially whether active sites except for hydroxyl groups in carbon can interact with phosphate needs to be paid more attention in general the available studies show that phosphate inhibition is weaker in carbon based catalysts than in metal based systems to better compare the effect of phosphate ions on different catalyst activated ps systems we have developed a metric i e ie factor which is the inhibitory effect of unit phosphate concentration on the elimination of unit amount of target pollutant per unit time pms and catalyst eq 32 the degradation rate of bpa decreased by about 58 0 within 20 min after adding 25 0 mm of h2po4 to the nitrogen containing carbon ncc activated pms system xue et al 2020 in contrast in the co3o4 bi2o3 pms system 0 1 mm of h2po4 led to a 6 7 decrease in the degradation rate of bpa within 15 min hu et al 2018 using eq 32 to compare the h2po4 effect the ie factor of bpa degradation in the ncc pms system was 0 024 whereas it was 8 59 in the co3o4 bi2o3 pms system due to the presence of h2po4 32 ie degradation rate c catalyst g l c

play an important role in the activation of ps the 1o2 induced non radical pathway in ps systems has been widely reported in metal activated ps systems the metal sites or surface hydroxyl groups oh lead to the generation of free radicals e g so4 and oh the inhibition of h2po4 and hpo4 2 to ps activation by carbon based and metal based catalysts will be different h2po4 can compete with ps for the metal sites and oh groups on metal based catalyst surface thus inhibiting ps activation h2po4 can occupy metal sites by substituting oh eq 33 in addition the oh groups on catalyst surface are positively charged m oh2 eq 34 under acidic condition the negatively charged h2po4 can occupy oh groups through electrostatic attraction with the positively charged me oh2 however it has been reported that h2po4 only occupies the oh groups on carbon based catalysts the oh on carbon based catalysts tends to play a minor role in activating ps while the metal center or oh group of metal based catalysts is the main active site moreover h2po4 shows strong affinity to the metal sites producing stronger inhibition to metal activated ps systems in metal activated ps systems under alkaline condition the negatively charged hydroxyl group mo eq 35 will exhibit electrostatic repulsion with hpo4 2 however the oxygen anion in hpo4 2 is likely to react with the metal site of the catalyst through lewis acid base interaction to form m o coordination liu et al 2013 in addition hpo4 2 is less capable of forming hydrogen bonds with oh than h2po4 chubar et al 2005 indicating its weaker ability to occupy oh on carbon based catalyst surface thus hpo4 2 shows greater inhibition in metal activated ps systems due to the strong affinity to metal sites and weak effect on oh of carbon based catalysts besides both h2po4 and hpo4 2 can react with so4 and oh to generate phosphate radicals with weak oxidation ability making h2po4 and hpo4 2 present a stronger inhibitory effect on metal activated ps systems 33 m oh h 2 po 4 m h 2 p o 4 o h m metal 34 m oh h m oh 2 m metal 35 m oh o h m o h 2 o m metal 5 conclusions and perspectives as discussed above the role of phosphate ions in a ps aops system for water treatment has been investigated widely the influences of various phosphate ions e g hpo4 2 and h2po4 on ps activation and contaminant degradation were analyzed systematically main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 in a pms system without activation hpo4 2 and coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 at high concentrations could promote pollutant degradation by activating pms to produce oxidative species thus accelerating the degradation process coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 at low concentrations could occupy the nucleophilic sites in organics restraining contaminant degradation by pms 2 in uv activated ps systems free radicals e g so4 and oh dominated in contaminant degradation hpo4 2 in a uv pds system h2po4 in a uv pms system and coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 in a uv pms or pds system could quench so4 and oh generating phosphate based radicals e g h2po4 and hpo4 with a lower oxidation capacity 3 hpo4 2 promoted contaminant degradation in thermal activated pms systems but it showed inhibition in the thermally activated pds systems the former effect is due to the fact that hpo4 2 could break o o bond in pms and generate so4 while the latter effect is attributed to the quenching of radicals nevertheless h2po4 in a heat pms system exhibited slight promotion at low concentrations while presented inhibition at high concentrations inconspicuous pms activation was noticed owing to the high energy barrier needed for pms attack by h2po4 in addition inhibition by quenching free radicals held a dominated position at high h2po4 concentrations the co existing hpo4 2 and h2po4 also presented a positive effect on pms activation and their ability to reduce the cleavage energy of o o in pms facilitated so4 production 4 in the electro activated pms pds systems h2po4 could compete with pms or pds for adsorption on electrode surface and quench free radicals suppressing contaminant decomposition 5 h2po4 could react with metal ions and generate complexes reducing the catalyst concentration and inhibiting pms pds activation besides the inhibitory effect of h2po4 is also attributed to its ability to quench radicals however the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 at a low concentration promoted contaminant degradation in co2 pms systems the formed complex between hpo4 2 and co2 with unique six coordination structure was conducive to electron transfer accelerating so4 production 6 in heterogeneous metal catalyst activated pms system h2po4 can inhibit pollutant degradation by quenching so4 and oh and strong affinity to metal sites on the catalyst surface by comparison it is easier for h2po4 to combine with pms in a non metal activated pms system thereby promoting pms activation and pollutant degradation moreover h2po4 in a pds system and coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 in a pms system exhibited predictable inhibition due to their ability to occupy metal sites surprisingly the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 also play a positive role in a pms oxidation system as fewer metal sites exposed to the catalyst surface the bond dissociation energy in pms or contaminants decreased after binding to phosphate which helps pms activation and contaminant degradation besides for a fe0 ps system the inhibition was ascribed to the complexation between h2po4 and fe2 or fe3 in solution decreasing the utilization efficiency of the catalysts some research findings have been obtained in terms of the role of phosphate in ps aops systems however multiple challenges still exist the following points should be considered in future research 1 for pms direct oxidation coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 exhibit opposite effects due to their concentration considering that hpo4 2 has a considerable portion in the mixture of hpo4 2 and h2po4 it is necessary to investigate whether hpo4 2 alone exhibits different effects on pollutant degradation with different concentrations 2 for coupled light and photocatalyst activated ps systems only initial ph adjustment was carried out however the solution ph changed during contaminant degradation and the phosphate forms could not be maintained therefore the application of an acetate or borate buffer solution was necessary to alleviate the impacts of the inorganic anions on ps activation furthermore the possible interactions between photo induced holes with strong oxidation potential and phosphate need to be paid more attention 3 the role of phosphate ions in a ps system with different activation routes should be further explored for instance the photo thermal activation of ps is effective for removing refractory organic pollutants tian et al 2022 the effects of co existing phosphate ions on the activity of a photo thermal activated ps system are worth investigation 4 the active sites in catalysts play a vital role in ps activation changes of the active sites on carbon based catalyst surface and their effects on oxidative species production in a ps system remain vague in the presence of phosphate ions hence researches on active site distribution and oxidative species regulation need to be intensified 5 composition and toxicity of intermediates were related to the degradation routes of contaminants in a ps system the influence of phosphate ions on degradation pathways of target contaminants has received little attention both the type and concentration of active species might be altered after adding phosphate ions affecting contaminant oxidation therefore density functional theory calculations and intermediate measurements should be combined to explore the change of degradation pathways 6 currently kinetic modeling and simulation of the effect of phosphate anions on ps oxidation are insufficient in research a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of phosphate anions on advanced oxidation based water treatment systems is necessary via combination of kinetic model simulation and experimental validation this will provide guidance for the actual wastewater treatment by catalytic oxidation systems 7 the phosphate anions might act as poisons to a photocatalyst reducing the catalytic activity however the influence of phosphate anions on the photocatalysis assisted ps systems was still ambiguous more attention should be paid in the future to the effect of co existing phosphate in wastewater on catalyst activity and on the oxidation capacity of photocatalysis assisted ps systems 8 currently few reactors have been designed regarding the effect of phosphate ions on persulfate based systems ps can be activated by uv electrochemistry and homogeneous catalysts in these systems however the reactors in homogeneous catalytic ps systems was seldom studied on the role of phosphate ions the effect of phosphate anions on pollutant degradation was studied in a two chamber electro catalytic cell the cell is separated by a cation exchange membrane forming the cathode and anode chambers especially ps activation on anode surface has received greater attention due to the generation of free radicals and non radicals noticeably all the investigations were operated in a reactor of intermittent mode in addition no reactor was reported in the study of phosphate effect in direct ps oxidation or thermal photocatalysis and heterogeneous metal activated ps systems it is desirable to design reactors for ps oxidation systems especially continuous flow reactors this will help provide guidance for practical applications of ps oxidation technology credit authorship contribution statement ning li conceptualization methodology formal

15616,currently various strategies have been applied to activate persulfate ps for contaminant removal from water however the background phosphate ions in water affect ps activation and organic degradation and the mechanism of their influence on the processes is still controversial in this review the possible effects of different phosphate forms hpo4 2 h2po4 and po4 3 on ps activation and contaminant degradation were systematically evaluated and summarized specifically hpo4 2 promotes contaminant degradation in direct peroxymonosulfate pms oxidation and thermal pms systems while it exhibits inhibition to thermal peroxodisulfate pds and ultraviolet uv pds systems meanwhile h2po4 inhibits most oxidation processes based on pms and pds except for non metal dominated and metal assisted pms systems coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 could present beneficial effects in thermal co2 and non metal activated and metal assisted pms systems nevertheless their inhibitory effects were found in direct pms oxidation uv pms or pds and metal dominated pms systems generally phosphate ions inhibit pms pds activation through competing adsorption with pms or pds on the solid surface forming a complex with metal ions as well as occupying active sites on solid catalysts in addition phosphate ions can quench radicals for reduced degradation of contaminants however phosphate ions could weaken the bond dissociation energy via combining with pms and contaminants or form a complex with co2 thus displaying a facilitative effect this review further discusses major challenges and opportunities of ps activation with co existing phosphates and will provide guidance for better ps utilization in real water treatment practice graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphate persulfate homogeneous catalysis heterocatalysis water treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction recently persulfates ps based advanced oxidation processes ps aops for organic pollutant degradation have attracted increasing attention commonly ps have two types of ions peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 and peroxodisulfate pds s2o8 2 devi et al 2016 according to previous reports ps cannot directly degrade most persistent organic pollutants effectively due to low oxidation potential e0 pds 2 01 v e0 pms 1 82 v peng et al 2021b encouragingly ps exhibit promising selective oxidation sometimes based on the electron rich moieties of target pollutants zhou et al 2020b thus it is necessary to activate ps to generate more oxidative species such as sulfate radicals so4 hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 for contaminant degradation dai et al 2021 ps aops in terms of sulfate radicals possess remarkable advantages of a high redox potential 2 5 3 1 v wide ph range 4 9 and long half life 30 40 μs zhao et al 2021 zhou et al 2018b many methods have been applied to activate ps using external energy e g uv heat ultrasound transition metal and carbon based catalysts yan et al 2020 li et al 2020a among them exterior energy activation might be restricted in practical applications as it requires more energy input matzek and carter 2016 tan et al 2017 teel et al 2009 transition metal ions might induce secondary pollution and suffer from recycling limitation in the process of ps activation li et al 2019a attractively heterogeneous catalysts could address the above mentioned issues wu et al 2019 especially carbon based catalysts possess a high surface area and large pore volume abundant functional groups and high conductivity thus receiving widespread attentions cheng et al 2019 furthermore transition metals could be immobilized on carbon materials exhibiting excellent stability and reusability for practical applications kang et al 2020 li et al 2020b wu et al 2018 phosphate ions exist widely in water environment mainly in the forms of h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 the dissociation balance of phosphate ions in water depends on solution ph as shown in eq 1 1 h 3 p o 4 k 1 h 2 po 4 k 2 hpo 4 2 k 3 po 4 3 where the values are pk1 2 15 pk2 7 20 and pk3 12 33 perrin and dempsey 1974 therefore the solution ph will determine the dominant form of phosphate fig 1 the impact of phosphate ions has been reported to be either positive negative or negligible in different ps systems for instance lou et al 2014 prepared a phosphate buffer solution pbs with coexistence of h2po4 and hpo4 2 at ph 7 0 the degradation rate constant k obs of acid orange 7 ao7 increased from 1 22 10 4 to 3 95 10 3 s 1 as the pbs concentration changed from 10 0 to 100 0 mm lou et al 2014 however the rate constant of orange ii degradation decreased by 67 0 when 100 0 mm of h2po4 was added to a mnfe2o4 corn stems biochar pms system fu et al 2019 in addition the removal rate of total organic carbon reduced slightly from 28 0 to 26 0 after adding 2 0 mm po4 3 in a co1 51fe1 49o4 pms system initial ph 6 5 yang et al 2019 revealing a negligible effect of the phosphate ion on bisphenol a bpa mineralization noticeably one phosphate form could have different effects on various ps aops systems for example h2po4 could inhibit tetracycline oxidation in a nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi yco3o4 pds system huang et al 2020 while promote norfloxacin degradation in a co3o4 fe2o3 pms system chen et al 2019 besides hpo4 2 also showed different effects on ps activation systems atrazine atz removal was inhibited by hpo4 2 in a cofe2o4 activated pms system li et al 2018 however decolorization of ao7 was promoted significantly in the presence of hpo4 2 in a hpo4 2 pms system peng et al 2021a interestingly varying effects were also observed after adding different forms of phosphate to one ps system for example h2po4 could accelerate bpa degradation while hpo4 2 presented an inhibition effect in a comg bo pms system dan et al 2022 although the effects of phosphate on contaminant degradation have been reported in many ps aops systems the roles of phosphate ions in the processes were not well clarified meanwhile no literature has summarized the mechanisms of phosphate ions in various ps systems herein the main aims of this review are to 1 comprehensively assess the roles of phosphate ions in ps systems 2 summarize the various mechanisms of phosphate ions in different ps systems and 3 provide some references for future investigations of a ps system towards phosphate containing organic degradation in wastewater this review will help promote the strategic development and application of ps systems in practical wastewater treatment 2 influence of phosphate ions on direct oxidation by ps ps aops exhibited strong oxidation ability reactive stability and controllable oxidation potential in removing organic pollutants however the role of inactivated ps is often overlooked during contaminant oxidation ji et al 2018 yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2018a direct oxidation by ps is a non radical process in which the electron rich organics could transfer electrons to ps and then be oxidized peng et al 2021b the degradation process involves three pathways of two electron one electron and 1o2 oxidation fig 2 ding et al 2021 in the two electron oxidation process additional reaction occurs via the transfer of oxygen atoms from pms to organic pollutants ding et al 2021 for one electron oxidation one electron transfer from pollutants to pms leads to the generation of organic cation radicals p which will then participate in hydroxylation reactions and produce degradation intermediates ding et al 2021 moreover 1o2 can be generated by self decomposition of pms eq 2 liang et al 2017 or interactions between intermediates and pms li et al 2019b and will play a certain role in contaminant degradation yin et al 2018 2 hso 5 so 5 2 hso 4 so 4 2 1 o 2 k 0 2 m 1 s 1 according to the literature the effects of phosphate i e hpo4 2 and co existence of hpo4 2 and h2po4 on non activated pms systems have been discussed besides phosphates were reported to show little impact on direct oxidation by pds the phenomenon might be ascribed to steric hindrance of two so3 groups on either side of the peroxide linker and symmetrical distribution of charges duan et al 2021 hpo4 2 accelerates the degradation of pollutants by activating pms to produce so4 for instance the degradation rate of ao7 by pms increased by about 80 0 in the presence of 10 0 mm of hpo4 2 while such an effect was not obvious at a low hpo4 2 concentration 1 0 mm yang et al 2010 the nucleophile hpo4 2 could combine with hso5 easily and form a complex then the p o could attack o atom near s o in pms causing an electron cloud rearrangement and increase of o o bond length from 1 4 å to 1 8 å duan et al 2021 the elongation of o o promoted its breaking and electron transfer thus facilitating so4 formation besides so4 is the primary active species with co existing hpo4 2 in pms solution 8 0 ph 8 6 the hpo4 2 with a low concentration could result in fewer so4 production as a result the effect of a low concentration hpo4 2 on ao7 degradation could be negligible the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 at high concentrations in the neutral media exhibit similar effects to single hpo4 2 on pms activation in contrast the coexistence of hpo4 2 and h2po4 at low concentrations inhibit pollutant degradation after adding 0 1 m pbs ph 7 0 to an un activated pms system the removal rate of ao7 increased by 98 6 in 15 min lou et al 2014 pms with asymmetric structure is nucleophilically attacked by oxygenated anions in pbs then active species e g so4 are produced generally so4 reacts with water in solution to generate oh eq 3 therefore so4 and oh species promote ao7 decomposition however the degradation efficiency of sulfamethoxazole smx decreased by approximately 7 0 when 5 0 mm of po4 3 was added to a non activated pms system ph 7 5 coexistence of hpo4 2 and h2po4 yin et al 2018 both hpo4 2 and h2po4 possess nucleophilic atoms o which can occupy the binding site between pms and smx through attacking the s atom in smx as a result the degradation process was inhibited 3 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 oh h k h 2 o 3 1 0 3 m 1 s 1 as shown in fig 3 different forms of phosphate exhibited different effects on organic degradation in the direct oxidation system by pms hpo4 2 and co existence of hpo4 2 and h2po4 at high concentrations can activate pms to produce oxidative species thus accelerating the degradation process the coexistence of hpo4 2 and h2po4 at low concentrations may preferentially interact with the nucleophilic sites in organics presenting an inhibitory effect by competing with pms for the reaction sites nevertheless to our knowledge no study on the effects of po4 3 and h2po4 in a non activated pms system is reported and it should be investigated in future 3 influence of phosphate ions on energy activated ps systems the generation of oxidative species e g so4 oh and 1o2 is the key for rapid degradation of contaminants and could be achieved by uv visible light thermal and electrochemical activation of ps wacławek et al 2017 uv activation could break o o bond in ps producing free radicals eqs 4 and 5 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004b similarly heating could also activate ps as it is known visible light occupies 45 of the solar spectrum and it is promising for its application in ps activation jia et al 2020 moreover ps could be activated via an electro chemical route in which the sacrificial iron anode attracts much attention cai et al 2016 4 hso 5 h v so 4 oh 5 s 2 o 8 2 h v 2 so 4 3 1 uv light activation in recent studies the effects of hpo4 2 h2po4 and their mixture in a uv activation system have received attention however the effect of po4 3 in the uv activated ps system has not been reported in detail regarding hpo4 2 no investigation was reported in a uv pms system in a uv pds system it was confirmed that hpo4 2 adversely affects contaminant removal whereas the impact became weaker at a low concentration the degradation rates of free cn were decreased by about 8 0 14 0 after adding 1 6 5 2 mm hpo4 2 to a uv pds system ph 11 satizabal gómez et al 2021 however the cn removal rate remained almost unchanged slightly increased by 4 0 in the presence of a low concentration of hpo4 2 0 5 mm satizabal gómez et al 2021 so4 could react with oh to generate oh in an aqueous solution ph 8 5 eq 6 li et al 2019b although oh 1 8 2 7 v huang et al 2014 presents slightly lower redox potential than so4 2 5 3 1 v oh has higher selectivity in degrading cn as oh could react with cn directly or through electron transfer generating cno cn could also react with so4 but the reaction rate is very low because of the static repulsion between cn and so4 satizabal gómez et al 2021 consequently oh formation might increase the cn degradation rate what is more hpo4 2 could react with oh and so4 in solution and produce low oxidation species hpo 4 maruthamuthu and neta 1978 showing negative effects on contaminant removal eq 7 the promoting effects of oh outweigh the negative impact of hpo4 2 at low concentrations hence the inhibition of contaminant degradation was not observed however the scavenging of hpo4 2 became obvious towards oh and so4 eqs 7 and 8 at a higher concentration inhibiting pollutant removal 6 so 4 o h so 4 2 oh k 6 5 1 0 1 0 7 m 1 s 1 7 hpo 4 2 oh o h hpo 4 k 1 5 1 0 5 m 1 s 1 8 hpo 4 2 so 4 so 4 2 hpo 4 k 1 2 1 0 6 m 1 s 1 h2po4 inhibits contaminant degradation in a uv pms system while its effect in a uv pds system is not reported for instance with the addition of h2po4 to a uv pms system ph 5 5 0 5 the time of removing equivalent amount of tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep prolonged from 20 to 30 min xu et al 2017 phosphate presents mainly in the form of h2po4 at ph 5 5 0 5 besides little hpo4 2 exists in the system and its impact could be ignored so4 e 2 5 3 1 v could be consumed by h2po4 producing h 2 po 4 eq 9 with lower oxidation potential e 2 7 v ma et al 2018 as a result the reaction rate decreased 9 h 2 po 4 so 4 so 4 2 h 2 po 4 k 7 2 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 similar to h2po4 a mixture of hpo4 2 and h2po4 in neutral solution with a concentration ratio of about 2 1 could consume partial oh and so4 in a uv pms or pds system inhibiting contaminant degradation for instance the k obs of tcep in a uv pms system decreased from 1 31 10 1 to 8 03 10 2 min 1 with a h2po4 concentration increasing from 1 0 10 2 to 1 03 mm ph 6 6 7 0 yu et al 2021 the mixture of hpo4 2 and h2po4 could consume oh and so4 eqs 7 10 generating low oxidative species the oxidation capacity of the species followed the order of oh so4 h 2 po 4 hpo 4 maruthamuthu and neta 1978 noticeably the reaction rate constants of hpo 4 2 and oh as well as hpo 4 2 and so4 eqs 7 and 8 are larger than those of h 2 po 4 and oh as well as h 2 po 4 and so4 eqs 9 and 10 in other words adding hpo4 2 could consume more oh and so4 compared to h2po4 appearing more obvious inhibition to contaminant decontamination consequently after adding h2po4 the degradation rate of 2 4 di tert butylphenol 2 4 d maintained at about 7 87 10 4 s 1 and the role of phosphate ion was not obvious whereas the degradation rate of 2 4 d decreased from 7 87 10 4 to 4 80 10 4 s 1 with the addition of hpo4 2 ph 7 0 0 1 in a uv pds system wang et al 2016 10 h 2 po 4 oh o h h 2 po 4 k 2 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 as discussed above due to the ability to scavenge free radicals e g so4 and oh fig 4 hpo4 2 in a uv pds system h2po4 in a uv pms system and the mixture of hpo4 2 and h2po4 in a uv pms or pds system generally pose negative impacts on an oxidation process 3 2 thermal activation thermal activation of ps is a high energy consumption process especially at high temperature over 40 c eqs 11 and 12 ghauch and tuqan 2012 in such a system the effects of hpo4 2 h2po4 po4 3 and co existing hpo4 2 and h2po4 on the degradation of pollutants have been reported 11 s 2 o 8 2 thermal activation 2 so 4 30 t 99 12 hso 5 thermal activation so 4 oh in a thermal activated pms system hpo4 2 could activate pms effectively and generate so4 accelerating contaminant degradation for instance k obs of atz decomposition increased from 1 20 10 2 to 1 01 min 1 with hpo4 2 concentration rising from 0 to 50 0 mm ph 9 0 45 c duan et al 2021 according to thermodynamic density functional calculations the energy barrier needed for attacking o o bond in pms with p o in hpo4 2 is 102 5 kj mol duan et al 2021 thus hpo4 2 could break o o bond in pms rapidly at high temperature and phosphate concentration generating so4 nevertheless this reaction process was slower at room temperature and low phosphate concentrations however an inhibitory influence of hpo4 2 was observed in a thermal activated pds system as hpo4 2 failed to activate pds efficiently duan et al 2021 at 50 k obs of methylparaben mep and ethylparaben etp removal decreased by 26 5 and 40 7 separately as the ph of pbs increased from 7 coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 to 9 single hpo4 2 chen et al 2017 according to eq 13 lu et al 2019 the percentage of hpo4 2 increased with solution ph the scavenge of so4 and oh by hpo4 2 became more obvious with ph increasing inhibiting the removal of mep and etp significantly 13 ph 7 20 log hpo 4 2 h 2 po 4 in a thermal activated pms system the positive influence of h2po4 on contaminant degradation could be ignored although no report describes the role of h2po4 in a thermal activated pds system it is reasonable to speculate that it may play an inhibitory role due to quenching of free radicals in a thermal activated pms system k obs of atz degradation increased from 2 80 10 3 to 5 80 10 3 min 1 with a h2po4 concentration increasing from 0 to 20 0 mm at ph 4 1 duan et al 2021 with the h2po4 concentration further rising to 50 0 mm the k obs value decreased slightly to 4 80 10 3 min 1 duan et al 2021 as it is known the energy barrier needed for o o bond attack by p o in h2po4 is high 172 4 kj mol duan et al 2021 consequently it is difficult for h2po4 to activate pms effectively in addition h2po4 could consume so4 and oh eqs 9 and 10 inhibiting contaminant degradation more intensely at a high h2po4 concentration however the reaction rate constants of h2po4 with oh as well as h2po4 with so4 are relatively small making weak inhibition to contaminant removal in particular the role of po4 3 in heat ps systems is still ambiguous according to density functional theory calculation po4 3 could break o o bond of pms easily with a low energy barrier 67 8 kj mol duan et al 2021 thus the role of po4 3 in heat pms or pds systems remains to be further investigated the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 in neutral conditions could also promote contaminant degradation in a thermally activated pms system while the role of coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 in thermally activated pds systems has not been reported with the addition of 4 0 10 0 and 20 0 mm of pbs to the thermally activated pms system separately ph 7 k obs of atz degradation increased from 3 38 10 2 to 8 17 10 2 1 61 10 1 and 2 38 10 1 min 1 correspondingly duan et al 2021 after adding 4 0 mm of pbs the apparent activation energy of phosphate pms e a p 82 8 kj mol was smaller than that of single pms system e a 94 1 kj mol duan et al 2021 more importantly the steady state concentration of so4 showed a good linear relationship with phosphate concentration r 2 0 983 duan et al 2021 obviously phosphate could lower the cleavage energy of o o in pms which was beneficial to produce so4 and promote contaminant degradation therefore hpo4 2 could break o o bond in pms and generate so4 in a thermal activation system promoting contaminant degradation fig 4 in contrast the negative impact of hpo4 2 in thermally activated pds systems is attributed to the quenching of free radicals h2po4 in a heat pms system shows a positive and negligible influence on pollutant degradation the high energy barrier between h2po4 and pms leads to the difficulties in activating pms besides the co existing hpo4 2 and h2po4 also present a positive effect on pms activation which reduces the cleavage energy of o o in pms for radical generation 3 3 electrochemical activation in an electrochemical activation process both anode and cathode could activate ps and produce active species fu et al 2022 ps could accept electrons on the cathode surface to be transformed into so4 and oh eqs 14 and 15 for mineralizing organic pollutants eq 16 zhang et al 2020 moreover ps activation using carbon or metal based anode also attracted wide attention for instance carbon anode could activate ps and produce an active state namely ps on the electrode surface with high reactivity ps could provide electrons and reduce organic contaminants directly eq 17 meanwhile ps could oxidize water molecules on the electrode to form oh eq 18 besides ps might increase the over potential of water oxidation and obtain more oh during electrolysis eq 19 song et al 2018 14 s 2 o 8 2 e so 4 so 4 2 15 hso 5 e so 4 o h or oh so 4 2 16 so 4 oh pollutant c o 2 h 2 o intermediates so 4 2 17 p s pollutants products so 4 2 18 p s h 2 o oh h so 4 2 19 h 2 o e oh h in electrochemical activation of ps it is universal to investigate the degradation under acid condition as the mineralization efficiency of contaminants increased with a decrease of solution ph waclawek et al 2016 thus only the role of h2po4 has been received attention and the effects of other forms of phosphate e g po4 3 and hpo4 2 are seldom reported in an electrochemical activation of pms process the presence of h2po4 inhibits pollutant degradation for a carbon cloth anode activated pms system k obs of smx decomposition increased from 4 75 10 2 to 5 89 10 2 min 1 with low po4 3 dosage 5 0 mm original ph 3 6 fu et al 2022 however the k obs value decreased to 4 67 10 2 and 2 01 10 2 min 1 as po4 3 dosage further increased to 10 0 and 20 0 mm separately fu et al 2022 water molecules could be transferred into oh eq 19 and o2 eq 20 after the reactions at the anode consequently the solution ph in the anode chamber decreased gradually with the generation of h obviously only h2po4 existed in both bulk solution and anode surface in addition p2o8 4 could be formed on anode surface eq 21 for pollutant degradation after adding po4 3 to the system sánchez et al 2013 negatively charged h2po4 would compete with pms on anode surface inhibiting electrochemical activation of pms moreover side reactions between h2po4 and so4 eq 9 as well as h2po4 and oh eq 10 could inhibit smx removal therefore p2o8 4 participated in smx degradation with a low concentration of po4 3 however with an increase of po4 3 concentration the competition between h2po4 and pms and inhibition of free radicals by h2po4 overweigh the contributions of p2o8 4 oxidation leading to a decrease of smx degradation rate 20 2 h 2 o 4 e o 2 4 h 21 2 po 4 3 2 e p 2 o 8 4 h2po4 also exhibits negative impacts on pds activation in a boron doped diamond bdd anode activated pds system the degradation rate of atz decreased by about 31 0 initial ph 4 after adding 1 0 mm of h2po4 bu et al 2018 solution ph maintains at 4 during the reactions in a single electrolytic cell phosphate presents mainly in the form of h2po4 with little h3po4 in the system as mentioned previously h2po4 could consume so4 2 5 3 1 v and oh 1 8 2 7 v eqs 9 and 10 and generate h 2 po 4 with low oxidation potential e0 2 7 v ma et al 2018 as a result the degradation reaction was inhibited similarly the degradation rate of carbamazepine decreased from 6 45 10 2 to 4 95 10 2 min 1 with co existing 20 0 mm of po4 3 song et al 2017 in brief for the electrochemical activation of pms or pds process h2po4 exerts an inhibitory effect as h2po4 could consume so4 and oh and generate phosphoric radicals with low oxidation potential inhibiting contaminant removal fig 4 furthermore h2po4 and hso5 or s2o8 2 are negatively charged ions which could compete for adsorption on the electrode surface as a result the number of adsorbed hso5 or s2o8 2 on electrode surface reduced and the electrochemical activation was inhibited 3 4 photocatalytic activation the combination of different semiconductors e g tio2 zno and wo3 and light uv visible light for the activation of pms and pds has received considerable attention isari et al 2021 large amounts of adsorbed organic pollutants could be degraded through light induced redox reactions mamba and mishra 2016 different from the catalyst free uv activation discussed in section 3 1 the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and light induced ps activation realized more pollutant degradation in the photocatalytic process a semiconductor photocatalyst could absorb energy for generating electron hole pairs eq 22 mamba and mishra 2016 the photo induced electrons could react with oxygen and ps producing o 2 and so 4 respectively eqs 23 and 24 kang et al 2021 meanwhile holes h could activate ps and generate so 5 eq 25 xu et al 2022 in addition h could capture oh or h2o forming oh eqs 26 and 27 mamba and mishra 2016 in general photocatalytic activation of ps is complicated commonly only the initial ph of a ps system with photocatalysis was adjusted according to eqs 24 27 the solution ph always changed during reactions indicating the phosphate forms were altered as well it was found that the removal rate of bpa decreased from 94 6 to 37 8 with a h2po4 concentration increasing from 0 to 5 0 mm at initial ph 3 98 jia et al 2020 phosphate anions could be adsorbed strongly on photocatalyst e g tio2 surface via an inner sphere surface complex thereby changing the interfacial and surface chemistry of the photocatalyst zhao et al 2008 the phosphate anions might act as poisons to a photocatalyst reducing the catalytic activity kanakaraju et al 2015 in addition the photocatalysts modified by phosphate might have a positive effect due to the extended band gap energy and larger surface area jimmy et al 2003 however the influence of phosphate on the photocatalysis assisted ps systems was still ambiguous besides the phosphate form was not clearly controlled without a buffer solution in the system thus the influence of phosphate ions in ps oxidation with photocatalysis requires a deep study in a buffer solution 22 semiconductor h v e h 23 e o 2 o 2 24 e hso 5 so 4 o h 25 h hso 5 so 5 h 26 h oh oh 27 h h 2 o oh h commonly the activation potential of ps can be improved obviously via introducing external energy e g uv thermal and electricity however the co existing phosphate ions in different energy activated ps systems affect the activation and organic degradation to some extent usually phosphate ions inhibit the pollutant degradation in uv thermal and ec ps systems due to the depletion of free radicals and production of low oxidative species noticeably in thermal ps systems phosphate ions hpo4 2 and co existing hpo4 2 and h2po4 can also promote contaminant degradation by generating free radicals via attacking the o o bond in pms besides the consumption of free radicals and the competition between phosphate ions and pms on the anode surface also inhibits pollutant degradation in ec ps systems interestingly p2o8 4 could be formed on the anode surface facilitating pollutant degradation in the ec ps systems with a low po4 3 concentration in terms of poor control of phosphate ion forms the effect of phosphate ions on photocatalysis assisted ps systems needs to be further investigated in buffer solutions 4 influence of phosphate ions on catalytic activation of persulfate 4 1 homogeneous catalysis for ps activation by transition metal ions single electron could transfer from metal ions to pds or pms ding et al 2021 generating so4 and oh eqs 28 30 as it is known co2 exhibited higher activity towards pms activation than other metals anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004a meanwhile iron was environmental friendly and was considered as an effective activator for pds song et al 2020 thus the roles of phosphate ions i e h2po4 and the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 in the two common homogeneous systems were summarized in addition due to the lack of experimental studies the effect of single po4 3 and hpo4 2 will not be discussed 28 m e

co2 pms systems fig 5 with the addition of 10 0 mm po4 3 presenting as h2po4 at ph 6 to a co2 pms system k obs of black b degradation decreased from 0 37 to 0 22 min 1 fig 6 a huang et al 2009 the reason might be ascribed to radical scavenge by phosphate ions besides phosphate ions could react with metal ions to form complexes zhu et al 2021 and further studies are still needed on the formation of h2po4 co2 complexes for the reduced activity for homogeneous catalysis in a pds system h2po4 could lower the catalytic activity of fe2 thereby inhibiting pollutant degradation fig 5 the inhibition has been verified in the removal of carbamazepine rao et al 2014 sulfisoxazole song et al 2020 and orange g yuan et al 2021 for instance with the addition of 1 0 10 0 and 100 0 mm of h2po4 solution to a fe2 activated pds system separately ph 3 5 k obs of orange g degradation decreased from 0 12 to 2 50 10 3 9 00 10 4 and 0 min 1 correspondingly xu and li 2010 under strong acidic conditions h2po4 could react with fe2 to form feh2po4 complexes restraining pds activation song et al 2020 besides the inhibitory effect of h2po4 is also ascribed to quenching so4 and oh in the system in addition to the effect on the catalyst activity and reactive oxygen species h2po4 could also influence the adsorption performance of in situ formed fe oh 3 in a fe2 pds system as shown in fig 6 b the removal efficiency of arsenic decreased from 99 1 to 11 7 after adding 0 1 mm of po4 3 ph 6 0 1 0 wang et al 2020 phosphate ions present mainly in the form of h2po4 with little hpo4 2 in the system the fe oh 3 exhibited positive effects on arsenic adsorption however the ζ potential of fe oh 3 decreased from positive 4 4 mv to negative 3 1 mv in the presence of h2po4 wang et al 2020 electrostatic repulsion occurred between negatively charged fe oh 3 and arsenic decreasing removal rate of total arsenic besides the addition of po4 3 might result in the generation of insoluble fe2 species thereby decreasing the utilization rate of fe2 for pds activation to inhibit the arsenic removal 4 1 2 the effect of co existing hpo4 2 and h2po4 as co2 was applied for pms activation the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 could promote contaminant degradation at low concentrations while exhibit inhibition at a high concentration the k obs of atz degradation increased to 1 29 10 1 min 1 after adding 10 0 mm of pbs which was 5 4 times higher than that 2 40 10 2 min 1 obtained without phosphate ions zhu et al 2021 with phosphate ion concentration further increasing to 15 0 mm the removal rate of atz decreased slightly zhu et al 2021 in neutral solution with coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 hpo4 2 could react with co2 to generate a cohpo4 complex furthermore cohpo4 has unique six coordination unit structure accelerating electron transfer and improving the co3 co2 transformation cycle for pms activation and so4 production notably the reactions between hpo4 2 and radicals played a leading role in the co2 pms system nevertheless the complex formed by hpo4 2 and co2 was not observed as presented in fig 6 c smx removal rate decreased by 10 0 in 8 min in the presence of hpo4 2 in a co2 pms h3bo3 system at ph 8 huang et al 2022 in conclusion h2po4 had adverse impacts in co2 pms systems h2po4 could consume so4 and oh and therefore inhibit contaminant removal in addition to quenching radicals h2po4 could also inhibit contaminant degradation in fe2 pds systems by complexing with fe2 the concentration of fe2 would also be decreased due to the formation of iron precipitation with phosphate reactions inhibiting the ps activation for pollutant removal however the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 at a low concentration has been proven to promote contaminant degradation in co2 pms systems the cohpo4 complex formed from hpo4 2 and co2 with unique ligand structure could promote electron transfer in a co3 co2 cycle benefiting for so4 production 4 2 metal based heterogeneous catalysis heterogeneous metal and carbon based catalysts played vital roles in ps activation and contaminant degradation common single metal catalysts consist of iron manganese and cobalt based oxides or sulfides duan et al 2020 as reported bimetals exhibited synergies in ps activation compared with single metal catalysts enhancing catalytic activity huang et al 2017 nevertheless inevitable metal leaching and particle aggregation limited the activity of pure metal based catalysts yang et al 2021 therefore metal loaded catalysts were designed by introducing the metals into carbon based or nitrogen doped carbon materials in such oxidation systems the effects of h2po4 and the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 have gained extensive attention nevertheless no study on po4 3 and hpo4 2 is reported and it should be investigated in future 4 2 1 the effect of h2po4 in a radical based pms system activated by a heterogeneous catalyst so4 and oh could be quenched by h2po4 leading to the inhibition of pollutant degradation the degradation rates of acetamiprid in the femn ncnts pms system ph 5 0 decreased with the addition of h2po4 duan et al 2019 however the negative impact of h2po4 by quenching radicals was weakened with improved catalyst activity under the same concentrations of the oxidant 0 2 mm contaminant 21 2 μ m and catalyst 0 2 g l the carmazepine cbz removal rates reached 100 0 within 20 min in a comgfe ldo pms system hong et al 2020 and 95 0 within 40 min in a mos2 pms system zhou et al 2020a without h2po4 addition in comparison the comgfe ldo showed a higher catalytic activity as shown in table 1 and fig 6 d the cbz degradation rate decreased by 52 6 76 8 in the mos2 pms system with adding 1 0 10 0 mm of h2po4 zhou et al 2020a the cbz degradation rate decreased by 18 2 125 0 in the mos2 pms system under unit conditions eq 31 zhou et al 2020a however the cbz degradation rate only decreased by 8 5 in the comgfe ldo pms system under unit conditions after adding h2po4 hong et al 2020 in general the higher the catalyst activity the larger yield of radicals in the oxidation system thereby the quenched radicals by h2po4 could be compensated rapidly via pms activation with a highly active catalyst leading to an indistinctive decline of degradation efficiency 31 η η c catalyst c pollutants c oxidant c phosphate t ssa additionally h2po4 could also inhibit contaminant degradation by interacting with metal sites on catalyst surface in heterogeneous catalyst activated pms systems as it is summarized in table 1 the degradation rate of bpa decreased by 6 7 in the presence of 0 1 mm of h2po4 hu et al 2018 h2po4 was believed to form complexes with co ii on catalyst surface through chelation reactions which occupied reactive sites retarding bpa degradation however h2po4 could combine with pms easily and therefore promote oxidative species formation as fewer metal sites were exposed to the catalyst surface the atz degradation rate increased from 3 56 10 2 to 5 90 10 2 1 37 10 1 min 1 after addition of 2 0 10 0 mm h2po4 into the natural kaolinite pms system li et al 2019a the steady state concentrations of so4 and oh were proven to be increased with a rising h2po4 concentration besides the residual pms decreased with an increasing h2po4 concentration li et al 2019a considering that some metal species in natural kaolinite are blocked by abundant hydroxyl groups on catalyst surface the combination of h2po4 and pms may become easier thus promoting contaminant degradation interestingly h2po4 can also inhibit contaminant degradation in heterogeneous catalysts activated pds systems by interacting with metal sites as shown in table 1 and fig 6 e the degradation rate of atz decreased from 91 5 to 88 0 and 57 1 after adding 4 0 and 8 0 mm of hpo4 2 mainly presented as h2po4 in a cus pds system peng et al 2018 the inhibition of phosphate ions to atz degradation was mainly ascribed to its strong affinity to cu ii on catalyst surface and thereby competed with pds to the active sites furthermore h2po4 could react with fe2 or fe3 to form complexes eqs 32 and 33 in the radical dominated zero valent iron zvi pms or pds system restraining organic contaminant degradation gao et al 2021 for example the removal rate of ao7 decreased by 51 5 after adding 50 0 mm of h2po4 into the zvi pds system li et al 2015 iron ions were commonly used to remove phosphate from wastewater by chemical precipitation therefore iron ions could form different complexes with phosphate rapidly decreasing the available soluble fe2 for ps activation fulazzaky et al 2014 in addition the zvi surface might be covered quickly by the generated complexes feh2po4 or feh2po4 2 showing a strong steric resistance effect nie et al 2015 as a result the contact between ps and zvi was prevented suppressing ps activation eqs 34 and 35 32 f e 2 h 2 po 4 fe h 2 po 4 33 f e 3 h 2 po 4 fe h 2 po 4 2 34 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 so 4 so 4 2 35 f e 0 s 2 o 8 2 f e 2 2 so 4 2 4 2 2 the effect of co existing hpo4 2 and h2po4 in the system of pms activation using heterogeneous catalysts the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 is not beneficial to pollutant degradation the degradation rates of bpa in the mnfeo c pms system ph 6 5 decreased with the presence of hpo4 2 and h2po4 yang et al 2021 for an amorphous mno2 pms oxidation system ph 7 dominated by an electron transfer pathway the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 could occupy manganese sites by replacing the hydroxyl group on catalyst surface inhibiting reactive complexes formation between mno2 and pms wang et al 2018 thus the direct electron transfer between the complexes and bpa was hindered similar to h2po4 the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 also play a facilitating role in pms activation the degradation rate of clothianidin ctd increased after introducing hpo4 2 and h2po4 in a femn n c pms system duan et al 2020 attributing to encapsulation of fe and mn metals with nitrogen doped graphene hydrogen bond was formed between phosphate and ctd and then electron density distribution in ctd was altered resulting in a decrease of dissociation energy of ctd molecules and enhancement of ctd degradation meanwhile the dissociation energy of o o bond in pms decreased from 157 3 to 145 2 kj mol after combination with h2po4 duan et al 2020 the production of active oxygen species e g 1o2 so4 and oh would be accelerated unfortunately no conclusion was found regarding the effect of coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 on pollutant degradation in pds oxidation systems and relevant studies are required in future as illustrated in fig 5 h2po4 can inhibit pollutant degradation by quenching so4 and oh in the heterogeneous catalyst activated pms system additionally h2po4 can play an inhibitory role by interacting with metal sites on catalyst surface which hinders the combination of pms and catalysts in contrast the combination of h2po4 and pms became easier as fewer metal sites were exposed to the catalyst surface promoting pms activation and contaminant degradation in the heterogeneous catalyst activated pds system h2po4 exhibited predictable inhibition due to the ability to occupy metal sites similarly the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 are also detrimental to pms activation sometimes the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 can play a positive role in the catalyst activated pms system with fewer metal sites exposed to catalyst surface phosphate ions are more likely to bind with pms or contaminants as a result dissociation energies of chemical bonds in pms or contaminant molecules become lower facilitating contaminant degradation collectively phosphate ions inhibit the pollutant degradation via competing active sites of metal element fe0 and metal sulfide cus catalysts in pms and pds systems respectively besides phosphate ions limit the contaminant degradation through quenching radicals and occupying sites for the formation of complexes in the oxidation systems induced via polymetallic hybrid comgfe ldo metal sulfide mos2 bimetallic oxide composite co3o4 bi2o3 and carbon coated bimetallic particle and oxide femn ncnt and mnfeo c notably phosphate ions reduce the cleavage energy of chemical bonds in pms or pollutants in the pms system catalyzed via graphene coated bimetallic nanoparticles femn n c thereby promoting the pollutant degradation moreover phosphate ions can facilitate pms decomposition via nucleophilic attack to generate radicals for pollutant oxidation in a natural mineral kaolinite catalyzed pms system nevertheless the inhibition effect of phosphate ions is observed in an amorphous mno2 activated pms system because phosphate ions exhibit strong affinity with amorphous mno2 leading to the restriction of reactive complex formation between the amorphous mno2 and pms notably the efficiency of oxidant usage is related to the operational cost of persulfate based oxidation processes directly after adding 0 10 m h2po4 in a sodium citrate sc chelated ferrous ion activated pds system the degradation efficiency of pyrene fe2 sc pds was reduced from 94 4 to 36 9 gao et al 2021 also h2po4 inhibited the pds consumption correspondingly the utilization of pds decreased from 98 2 to 56 7 the inhibition of h2po4 was attributed to the complexation of h2po4 with fe2 or fe3 the catalytic activity of iron phosphate complexes was lower than that of fe2 besides the competitive complexation between sc and phosphate with fe3 inhibited the cycling of fe3 and fe2 consequently pyrene degradation rate was declined to further investigate the change of oxidant usage induced by phosphate anions in the fe2 sc pds system we evaluated the oxidant consumption per unit pollutant removal rate the effective utilization factor of the oxidant was defined as the ratio of oxidant consumption rate to pollutant degradation efficiency by calculation the effective utilization factor of pds was 1 04 in the absence of h2po4 and increased to 1 54 with the addition of h2po4 clearly the addition of h2po4 to the system reduced the effective utilization of the oxidant as a result a higher reagent cost was required to degrade the same amount of pollutants in a ldh nanoscrolls pms system h2po4 promoted mb degradation sun et al 2022 complete degradation of mb was achieved without h2po4 with the addition of 10 mm of h2po4 the k obs was approximately two times higher 1 58 10 1 min 1 than that of the control 8 96 10 2 min 1 sun et al 2022 besides the pms consumption 39 0 was also approximately 3 5 times higher than that of the control group 11 0 sun et al 2022 h2po4 can promote production of reactive oxygen species by reducing the bond dissociation energy of o o in pms in addition the positive effect of h2po4 might be enhanced by the introduction of ldh nano microspheres the effective utilization factor of pms improved from 0 11 to 0 39 after the addition of 10 mm h2po4 implying a decrease in the effective utilization of pms oxidant interestingly phosphate anions inhibited the cbz degradation in the mos2 pms system zhou et al 2020a mo atoms could coordinate with phosphate anions to produce polymetallic oxides such as phosphomolybdate which might inhibit the pms activation and active species production the presence of phosphate anions inhibited the pms consumption and the inhibition became obvious with an increased phosphate anion concentration specifically with the addition of 1 and 10 mm of h2po4 the cbz degradation efficiency was dropped from 95 to 45 and 22 respectively correspondingly the consumption rate of pms was reduced from 75 to 20 and 10 respectively zhou et al 2020a the effective utilization factor of pms was 0 79 in the control while it was decreased to 0 44 and 0 45 with 1 and 10 mm of h2po4 respectively a similar phenomenon was also observed with the addition of 1 and 10 mm of hpo4 2 the effective utilization factor of pms dropped to 0 32 and 0 34 respectively a reduced effective utilization factor implied an increase in the effective utilization of the oxidant and a lower reagent cost femn ncnts fe mn nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes comgfe ldo

heterogeneous catalysis metal catalysts could be substituted by green and promising non metal carbons which have been applied for ps activation extensively gao et al 2020 to be specific carbon catalysts possess a large surface area abundant resources acid and alkali resistance and tunable physicochemical and electronic properties duan et al 2018 in addition the possible secondary contamination induced by metals could be overcome in a ps system activated carbon graphene carbon nanotubes cnts and biochar have been applied in ps activation for contaminant removal liu et al 2020 generally positively charged carbon structural defects oxygen containing functional groups e g c o oh and cooh and heteroatoms e g n and s were considered as the active sites for ps activation commonly free radical and non radical pathways exist simultaneously the non radical pathway includes catalyst ps complex oxidation and electron transfer between 1o2 ps and contaminants huang et al 2021 contaminant degradation might be still restrained in the presence of phosphate ions although the removal rate of ao7 was decreased from 98 6 to 96 2 within 60 min after adding 10 mm of h2po4 to an activated carbon cloth acc pds system the rate constant dropped from 8 20 10 2 to 6 00 10 2 min 1 obviously fig 6 f liu et al 2020 on one hand h2po4 could quench partial so4 and oh on the other hand h2po4 could occupy c oh sites on catalyst surface suppressing pds activation to some extent liu et al 2020 however no other route was reported regarding the effect of phosphate ions on contaminant removal the related influence mechanism remained ambiguous in carbon activated ps systems specially whether active sites except for hydroxyl groups in carbon can interact with phosphate needs to be paid more attention in general the available studies show that phosphate inhibition is weaker in carbon based catalysts than in metal based systems to better compare the effect of phosphate ions on different catalyst activated ps systems we have developed a metric i e ie factor which is the inhibitory effect of unit phosphate concentration on the elimination of unit amount of target pollutant per unit time pms and catalyst eq 32 the degradation rate of bpa decreased by about 58 0 within 20 min after adding 25 0 mm of h2po4 to the nitrogen containing carbon ncc activated pms system xue et al 2020 in contrast in the co3o4 bi2o3 pms system 0 1 mm of h2po4 led to a 6 7 decrease in the degradation rate of bpa within 15 min hu et al 2018 using eq 32 to compare the h2po4 effect the ie factor of bpa degradation in the ncc pms system was 0 024 whereas it was 8 59 in the co3o4 bi2o3 pms system due to the presence of h2po4 32 ie degradation rate c catalyst g l c

play an important role in the activation of ps the 1o2 induced non radical pathway in ps systems has been widely reported in metal activated ps systems the metal sites or surface hydroxyl groups oh lead to the generation of free radicals e g so4 and oh the inhibition of h2po4 and hpo4 2 to ps activation by carbon based and metal based catalysts will be different h2po4 can compete with ps for the metal sites and oh groups on metal based catalyst surface thus inhibiting ps activation h2po4 can occupy metal sites by substituting oh eq 33 in addition the oh groups on catalyst surface are positively charged m oh2 eq 34 under acidic condition the negatively charged h2po4 can occupy oh groups through electrostatic attraction with the positively charged me oh2 however it has been reported that h2po4 only occupies the oh groups on carbon based catalysts the oh on carbon based catalysts tends to play a minor role in activating ps while the metal center or oh group of metal based catalysts is the main active site moreover h2po4 shows strong affinity to the metal sites producing stronger inhibition to metal activated ps systems in metal activated ps systems under alkaline condition the negatively charged hydroxyl group mo eq 35 will exhibit electrostatic repulsion with hpo4 2 however the oxygen anion in hpo4 2 is likely to react with the metal site of the catalyst through lewis acid base interaction to form m o coordination liu et al 2013 in addition hpo4 2 is less capable of forming hydrogen bonds with oh than h2po4 chubar et al 2005 indicating its weaker ability to occupy oh on carbon based catalyst surface thus hpo4 2 shows greater inhibition in metal activated ps systems due to the strong affinity to metal sites and weak effect on oh of carbon based catalysts besides both h2po4 and hpo4 2 can react with so4 and oh to generate phosphate radicals with weak oxidation ability making h2po4 and hpo4 2 present a stronger inhibitory effect on metal activated ps systems 33 m oh h 2 po 4 m h 2 p o 4 o h m metal 34 m oh h m oh 2 m metal 35 m oh o h m o h 2 o m metal 5 conclusions and perspectives as discussed above the role of phosphate ions in a ps aops system for water treatment has been investigated widely the influences of various phosphate ions e g hpo4 2 and h2po4 on ps activation and contaminant degradation were analyzed systematically main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 in a pms system without activation hpo4 2 and coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 at high concentrations could promote pollutant degradation by activating pms to produce oxidative species thus accelerating the degradation process coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 at low concentrations could occupy the nucleophilic sites in organics restraining contaminant degradation by pms 2 in uv activated ps systems free radicals e g so4 and oh dominated in contaminant degradation hpo4 2 in a uv pds system h2po4 in a uv pms system and coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 in a uv pms or pds system could quench so4 and oh generating phosphate based radicals e g h2po4 and hpo4 with a lower oxidation capacity 3 hpo4 2 promoted contaminant degradation in thermal activated pms systems but it showed inhibition in the thermally activated pds systems the former effect is due to the fact that hpo4 2 could break o o bond in pms and generate so4 while the latter effect is attributed to the quenching of radicals nevertheless h2po4 in a heat pms system exhibited slight promotion at low concentrations while presented inhibition at high concentrations inconspicuous pms activation was noticed owing to the high energy barrier needed for pms attack by h2po4 in addition inhibition by quenching free radicals held a dominated position at high h2po4 concentrations the co existing hpo4 2 and h2po4 also presented a positive effect on pms activation and their ability to reduce the cleavage energy of o o in pms facilitated so4 production 4 in the electro activated pms pds systems h2po4 could compete with pms or pds for adsorption on electrode surface and quench free radicals suppressing contaminant decomposition 5 h2po4 could react with metal ions and generate complexes reducing the catalyst concentration and inhibiting pms pds activation besides the inhibitory effect of h2po4 is also attributed to its ability to quench radicals however the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 at a low concentration promoted contaminant degradation in co2 pms systems the formed complex between hpo4 2 and co2 with unique six coordination structure was conducive to electron transfer accelerating so4 production 6 in heterogeneous metal catalyst activated pms system h2po4 can inhibit pollutant degradation by quenching so4 and oh and strong affinity to metal sites on the catalyst surface by comparison it is easier for h2po4 to combine with pms in a non metal activated pms system thereby promoting pms activation and pollutant degradation moreover h2po4 in a pds system and coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 in a pms system exhibited predictable inhibition due to their ability to occupy metal sites surprisingly the coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 also play a positive role in a pms oxidation system as fewer metal sites exposed to the catalyst surface the bond dissociation energy in pms or contaminants decreased after binding to phosphate which helps pms activation and contaminant degradation besides for a fe0 ps system the inhibition was ascribed to the complexation between h2po4 and fe2 or fe3 in solution decreasing the utilization efficiency of the catalysts some research findings have been obtained in terms of the role of phosphate in ps aops systems however multiple challenges still exist the following points should be considered in future research 1 for pms direct oxidation coexisting hpo4 2 and h2po4 exhibit opposite effects due to their concentration considering that hpo4 2 has a considerable portion in the mixture of hpo4 2 and h2po4 it is necessary to investigate whether hpo4 2 alone exhibits different effects on pollutant degradation with different concentrations 2 for coupled light and photocatalyst activated ps systems only initial ph adjustment was carried out however the solution ph changed during contaminant degradation and the phosphate forms could not be maintained therefore the application of an acetate or borate buffer solution was necessary to alleviate the impacts of the inorganic anions on ps activation furthermore the possible interactions between photo induced holes with strong oxidation potential and phosphate need to be paid more attention 3 the role of phosphate ions in a ps system with different activation routes should be further explored for instance the photo thermal activation of ps is effective for removing refractory organic pollutants tian et al 2022 the effects of co existing phosphate ions on the activity of a photo thermal activated ps system are worth investigation 4 the active sites in catalysts play a vital role in ps activation changes of the active sites on carbon based catalyst surface and their effects on oxidative species production in a ps system remain vague in the presence of phosphate ions hence researches on active site distribution and oxidative species regulation need to be intensified 5 composition and toxicity of intermediates were related to the degradation routes of contaminants in a ps system the influence of phosphate ions on degradation pathways of target contaminants has received little attention both the type and concentration of active species might be altered after adding phosphate ions affecting contaminant oxidation therefore density functional theory calculations and intermediate measurements should be combined to explore the change of degradation pathways 6 currently kinetic modeling and simulation of the effect of phosphate anions on ps oxidation are insufficient in research a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of phosphate anions on advanced oxidation based water treatment systems is necessary via combination of kinetic model simulation and experimental validation this will provide guidance for the actual wastewater treatment by catalytic oxidation systems 7 the phosphate anions might act as poisons to a photocatalyst reducing the catalytic activity however the influence of phosphate anions on the photocatalysis assisted ps systems was still ambiguous more attention should be paid in the future to the effect of co existing phosphate in wastewater on catalyst activity and on the oxidation capacity of photocatalysis assisted ps systems 8 currently few reactors have been designed regarding the effect of phosphate ions on persulfate based systems ps can be activated by uv electrochemistry and homogeneous catalysts in these systems however the reactors in homogeneous catalytic ps systems was seldom studied on the role of phosphate ions the effect of phosphate anions on pollutant degradation was studied in a two chamber electro catalytic cell the cell is separated by a cation exchange membrane forming the cathode and anode chambers especially ps activation on anode surface has received greater attention due to the generation of free radicals and non radicals noticeably all the investigations were operated in a reactor of intermittent mode in addition no reactor was reported in the study of phosphate effect in direct ps oxidation or thermal photocatalysis and heterogeneous metal activated ps systems it is desirable to design reactors for ps oxidation systems especially continuous flow reactors this will help provide guidance for practical applications of ps oxidation technology credit authorship contribution statement ning li conceptualization methodology formal

15617,in the face of the growing global water crisis membrane technology is a promising means of purifying water and wastewater silver nanoparticles agnps have been widely used to improve membrane performance for antibiofouling and to aid in photocatalytic degradation thermal response and electro conductivity however several critical issues such as short antimicrobial periods trade off effects and silver inactivation seriously restrict the engineering application of agnps incorporated membranes in addition there is controversy around the use of agnps given the toxic preparation process and environmental biological risks hence it is of great significance to summarize and analyze the recent developments and critical challenges in the use of agnps incorporated membranes in water and wastewater treatment and to propose potential solutions we reviewed the different properties and functions of agnps and their corresponding applications in agnps incorporated membranes recently multifunctional novel agnp incorporated membranes combined with other functional materials have been developed with high performance we further clarified the synergistic mechanisms between agnps and these novel nanomaterials and or polymers and elucidated their functions and roles in membrane separation finally the critical challenges of agnps incorporated membranes and the proposed solutions were outlined i prolonging the antimicrobial cycle through long term and controlled agnps release ii overcoming the trade off effect and organic fouling of the agnps incorporated membranes iii

image graphical abstract keywords nanoparticles membrane material anti fouling life cycle biotoxicity data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction over 60 years diverse membrane materials and processes have been widely used for liquid separations in a variety of industries such as wastewater water treatment obotey ezugbe and rathilal 2020 tang et al 2018 food drinks castro muñoz et al 2020 petrochemical santos et al 2020 and refinery luiz et al 2018 industries because of the superior advantages such as high permeate quality ease of operation and maintenance excellent separation efficiency and compact modular construction membrane technologies have become a fundamental process in the engineering systems lee et al 2016 in the global membrane market 2021 2025 report a compound annual growth rate cagr of 7 is expected during the next few years mainly due to the growing demand for wastewater water resources management large scale industrial applications of membrane based technologies have been rapidly developed for sewage wastewater treatment advanced treatment of drinking water and desalination of seawater brackish water shannon et al 2008 however the application of membranes in practical engineering is limited by membrane fouling trade off effects membrane aging and high costs membrane fouling is the greatest issue of the operation of membrane processes suspended solids and solvents including bacterial cells colloids biomacromolecules and salts can accumulate on the surface or internal structure of the membrane during the filtration and reduce the membrane flux meng et al 2017 the adhesion and growth of microorganisms on the membrane can result in the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps and thus the biofilm formation known as biofouling significantly changing the membrane surface properties and reducing separation performance rumbaugh and sauer 2020 biofouling is a complex process involving interactions between the cell membrane material and between cells vanysacker et al 2014 chemicals such as naclo h2o2 and citric acid are used to control membrane fouling biofouling resulting in the degradation of membrane materials and membrane ageing thus shortening the service life of membranes porcelli and judd 2010 moreover trade offs exist in membrane separation between the mutual restriction of fluxes and the rejection rate of membranes shin et al 2021 to improve the adaptability economy and stability of the membrane and membrane processes therefore membrane modifications are usually carried out during or after membrane fabrication liao et al 2018 miller et al 2017 typically the membrane performance can be improved by various modifications such as surface coating ni et al 2014 surface grafting yang et al 2010 surface bioadhesion yang et al 2019a physical blending ran et al 2014 surface segregation chen et al 2011 or adding the functional substances to the membrane matrix materials yin and deng 2015 in recent years nanomaterials metal base carbon base and nanocomposite bolisetty and mezzenga 2016 ng et al 2013 yin and deng 2015 organic molecules ong et al 2016 metal organic framework mof qiu et al 2014 natural compounds dobosz et al 2015 and composites lau et al 2012 have been extensively incorporated with membranes to enhance resistance to biofouling composite materials achieve antibiofouling though anti adhesion release killing contact killing and photo responsive antibacterial behavior wang et al 2021b anti adhesive substances e g zwitterions and carbon quantum dots cqds can form a regular hydrated layer on the membrane surface to prevent cell adhesion and hydrophobic foulants deposition on the membrane through their hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions but have limited ability to resist complex biofilms guo et al 2020 mahat et al 2020 the release and contact type antibiofouling materials such as gold nanoparticles aunps copper nanoparticles cunps enzymes and antibiotics can be immobilized within the membrane or on the membrane surface by encapsulation or grafting to achieve chemical compatibility or the desired mode of release chen et al 2012 xu et al 2020b the antimicrobial substances that fail to be released can cause bacterial cell death upon contact with bacteria zhu et al 2021 such active antibiofouling materials can achieve dual antimicrobial effects inside and outside the membrane but their application is limited by unstable release and lower contact efficiency photosensitive antimicrobial materials such as titanium dioxide tio2 li et al 2020b zinc oxide zno sheikh et al 2020 graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 li et al 2019b and mil 125 zhou et al 2020 rapidly kill bacteria through the generation of thermal energy and hydroxyl radicals during photothermal conversion under solar or uv light irradiation however the generation of hydroxyl radicals is strongly dependent on the light absorption efficiency of photosensitive materials which can damage the membrane itself in particular silver nanoparticles agnps have been widely investigated in the membrane technologies due to their antibacterial optical electrical and catalytic properties the agnps incorporated membrane has unique separation efficiency and performances with high antimicrobial activity photocatalytic degradation thermal response and electro conductivity as shown in fig 1 over 10000 articles related to agnps incorporated membrane have been published in the past two decades according to the web of science prevalent keywords associated with agnps incorporated membrane include microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis and membrane distillation numerous studies have confirmed that agnps can improve the membrane antifouling effect of membranes either through the use of agnps alone or combination with substances such as graphene oxide go sun et al 2015 graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 zhao et al 2020b polydopamine pda wu et al 2018b silicon dioxide sio2 huang et al 2014 metal oxides yildiz et al 2020 moreover agnps can improve the catalytic effect of photocatalytic membranes goei and lim 2014 as well as the conductivity of membranes in summary agnps have a great potential for improving membrane performance and reducing biofouling however there are limitations in the application of agnps in the membrane fabrication and modification firstly the effective antifouling period of agnps incorporated membranes is reduced due to the uncontrolled release and inactivation of agnps on the membrane bi et al 2018 secondly the addition of agnps will reduce the membrane flux through blockage of the membrane pores fang et al 2019 thirdly the preparation and recovery of agnps are not sustainable due to the extensive use of toxic and harmful agents xiang et al 2020 fourthly the biological toxicity and environmental impact of agnps released from the composite membrane needs to warrant further attention jinlong shao 2017 therefore the practical applications of agnps incorporated membranes in engineering systems face various challenges numerous reviews of agnps have been reported in the past decades however they mainly focused on the properties of agnps including antimicrobial and antibiofouling behaviors zheng et al 2018 electro photo catalytic applications sharma et al 2021 synthesis and toxicity effects tortella et al 2020 there are limited comprehensive reviews and discussions of recent advancements and critical challenges in the use of agnps incorporated membranes in purifying water and wastewater treatment therefore the objective of this review is to summarize the recent progress in the fabrication and application of agnps incorporated membranes in water and wastewater treatment first we provide an overview of the properties of agnps especially the advanced research on improving the antimicrobial and antibiofouling properties of agnps the application and critical challenges of agnps incorporated membranes are further highlighted and discussed following a detailed analysis of the existing solutions we proposed a novel sustainable full life cycle process for agnps incorporated membranes generally this review could improve understandings of the development and current challenges of agnps incorporated membranes and provide important information for developing more robust multi functional and sustainable agnps incorporated membranes 2 multi properties of agnps 2 1 antimicrobial behavior antimicrobial behavior is one of the most prominent properties of agnps their antimicrobial effect activity is mainly determined by two distinctive processes le ouay and stellacci 2015 fig 2 i the dissolution release of agnps and ag ii and the reaction of agnps and ag with cells firstly the large size agnps dissolves themselves due to complex physical or chemical reactions with the surrounding environment bogumiła reidy 1 2013 echegoyen and nerin 2013 afterwards the smaller agnps and ag produces and directly damages the cell structure of microorganisms causing their death piao et al 2011 rastogi et al 2019 the antimicrobial process of agnps greatly depends on the small size agnps and ag in the solution in other words the dissolution process of agnps is the premise of the final antimicrobial effect activity 2 1 1 dissolution process of agnps the dissolution of agnps is mainly related to 1 the release of small size agnps and ag 2 the passivation on the surface of agnps and 3 the deactivation of agnps and ag fig 2a normally the reaction of agnps with o2 forms an agox oh y oxide layer on the exterior surface of the nanoparticles schnadt et al 2009 slightly acidic or other corrosive substances i e molecules containing ammonia primary amines and or secondary amines in the form of deprotonation could lead to the dissolution of the oxide layer promoting the release of ag sotiriou et al 2012 in addition the release of chemisorbed ions on the surface of the agnps could also produce a large amount of ag dobias and bernier latmani 2013 the generation of ag leads to the fracture of large size agnps along with the formation of small size agnps during ag reduction under chemical or light induced conditions kaegi et al 2010 li et al 2010 the passivation on the surface of agnps often hampers the release of small size agnps and ag the reaction of sulfides chloride halides oxygen and organic mercaptan with agnps could form insoluble substances leading to passivation on the surface of agnps given the very low solubility of ag2s and agcl a strong passivation layer could form on the surface of agnps choi et al 2009 levard et al 2013 reinsch et al 2012 note that in the presence of excess chloride the agcl passivation layer generates soluble agclx x 1 afrooz et al 2013 levard et al 2013 moreover the passivation process of agnps reacting with organic thiols is similar to that with chloride jingyu liu 2010 when the thiols concentration is too low the thiolate ligand forms a thiolate ligand shell around the agnps however if the thiol groups provide sufficient solubility silver can be quantitatively converted into soluble thiolates and facilitate the release of ag gondikas et al 2012 meanwhile the photothermal effect of plasmon excitation leads to the reduction of ag to agnps which gradually grow into the large agnps xue et al 2007 both the formation of insoluble precipitates and large size agnps result in loss of ag antimicrobial activity in the solution nanoparticles tend to aggregate due to van der waals interactions when the ionic strength of the solution increases the electrostatic repulsion potential energy between the agnps is shielded promoting the aggregation of agnps amro m el badawy et al 2010 on the other hand citrate or polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp ligands used in the process of preparing agnps are not firmly bound to the surface of agnps and can be easily displaced by various organic molecules such as amines phosphines mercaptans and anionic ligands such as oxides halides and sulfides levard et al 2011 as such these ligands cause the loss of colloidal stability in agnps in the formation of ion ligands the oxidative dissolution of agnps leads to the formation of the corresponding silver salt layers the silver salt layers surrounding the two particles could be a fuse causing an insoluble bridge between particles and actively contributing to the formation of large aggregates li and lenhart 2012 therefore both the formation of insoluble precipitates and large agnps result in the reduction of antibacterial activity in ag overall the complex passivation of agnps is usually accompanied by the deactivation of small size agnps and ag 2 1 2 antimicrobial mechanism of agnps as mentioned above the small size agnps and ag play an antimicrobial role by damaging the cell structures li et al 2008 manke et al 2013 marambio jones and hoek 2010 rajeshkumar and malarkodi 2014 factors such as the size of agnps oxygen content and environmental substances affect the antimicrobial effect activity of agnps currently there are three types of antimicrobial mechanisms of agnps and ag fig 2b 1 directly destruction of the cell membrane structures 2 inhibition of dna replication and adenosine triphosphate atp production 3 formation of reactive oxygen species ros destroying the cytoplasmic structure firstly agnps can be adsorbed on the cell membrane and interact with the membrane proteins to form complexes resulting in the inactivation of membrane binding enzymes and proteins holt and bard 2005 the fluidity of cell membranes can be altered by increasing the trans cis ratio of unsaturated fatty acids anas et al 2013 mueller spitz and crawford 2014 changes to membrane structures such as the lipid bilayer can cause loss of membrane integrity and increased permeability leading to the influx and leakage of cell contents once the small size agnps and ag enter the cell they can interact with the exocyclic nitrogen in guanine adenine and cytosine to cause dna structure changes and inhibit dna replication duran et al 2016 agnps may further interrupt the energy source of energy dependent reactions in cells leading to cell death bogumiła reidy 1 2013 pal et al 2007 in addition ros produced from the interaction of agnps with sulfur containing proteins enzymes and dna could cause strong oxidative damage to cellular materials mao et al 2018 note that although the antimicrobial mechanism of agnps and ag is similar their antimicrobial conditions and specific processes are different 1 agnps and ag have a different range of action concentrations i e nanomolar concentrations for agnps and micromolar ranges for ag mao et al 2018 2 ag could allow the cell to enter the active condition but non culturable state while agnps could anchor different parts of the cell and damage the different parts of the membrane jung et al 2008 and 3 ag could pass through smaller protein pores 1 nm to reach the cell while larger size agnps cannot bondarenko et al 2013 2 2 photo catalytic property due to surface plasmon resonance effects agnps can absorb the visible light to generate electrons and electron holes lim et al 2005 electrons are then transferred to the conduction band cb of agcl and react with oxygen molecules to form o2 meanwhile the electron holes from the agnps are also transferred to agcl and react with cl to form cl0 atoms o2 and cl0 atoms are both highly oxidizing substances with strong catalytic degradation ability zhou et al 2018 in addition to directly participating in the photocatalytic process agnps can also improve the catalytic efficiency of photocatalyst through synergistic action hou et al 2017 korkmaz et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 normally agnps can attract photogenerated electrons floating on the surface of photocatalyst inhibit the recombination of the photogenerated electron hole pairs and prolong the persistence of photogenerated electron hole pairs to improve photocatalytic efficiency wang et al 2017a agnps can also indirectly reduce the band gap of the photocatalyst expanding the wavelength range of the photocatalytic reaction light source zhang et al 2020b therefore agnps are unique photocatalysts and photocatalytic modifiers for improving photocatalytic performance 2 3 solar thermal conversion agnps can also achieve solar thermal conversion under lighting conditions zhao et al 2020a which is mainly based on the plasmon induced hot electron transfer phet ye et al 2019 in phet the plasma agnps as light absorbers can generate plasmons which then could decay into hot electrons k wu 2021 the hot electrons are transferred to adjacent molecules and the plasmonic metal heats up finally the heat of the plasma metal dissipates increasing the temperature of the surrounding medium rising wang et al 2014b generally the light heat conversion property makes agnps an excellent modifier for improving the efficiency of membranes distillation 2 4 electro catalytic conductive property as a metal agnps possess clear electrical conductivity with rapid transfer of electrons langley et al 2013 agnps have bifunctional effects with other active metals such as au pt and cu in the electrocatalytic process sleightholme et al 2008 due to the low zero charge potential epzc 0 67v vs she agnps often act as auxiliary metals for other metallic substances and form m ohads with oh in the medium hu et al 2020 therefore reactants adsorbed on the active metal will readily react with agnps to accelerate the reaction rate overall agnps are promising candidates in the fabrication of conductive and electrocatalytic membranes due to the unique physical chemical antibacterial optical electronic and catalytic properties of agnps they have been extensively used for the fabrication of high performance agnps incorporated membranes the application of agnps in membranes has expanded from pressure driven membranes to photocatalytic membranes thermally driven membranes and electro conductivity membranes here we summarized the applications and performance of various agnps incorporated membranes and further analyzed the role of agnps in membranes 3 applications of agnps in membrane fabrication and or modification 3 1 antifouling membranes 3 1 1 in situ synthesized agnps membranes the most direct way to prepare the antibacterial membrane is to add agnps into the casting solution however the agglomeration of agnps in the casting solution often damages the membrane structure and reduces separation performance thus decreasing the antibacterial effect valenti and giacomelli 2017 andrade et al andrade et al 2015 reported that the in situ synthesized agnps incorporated membranes had a higher antimicrobial property compared with that of ex situ synthesized agnps incorporated membranes due to the uniform distribution of agnps as such the in situ generation of agnps in or on membranes could be an effective strategy for the construction of agnps incorporated membranes with antibacterial properties ben sasson et al 2014 however the compatibility of agnps directly embedded in the polymer matrix is poor reducing the stability of the internal structure of the composite membrane the performance of in situ synthesized agnps in the membrane is affected by the membrane materials the surface colony forming units cfu on the polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polyethersulfone pes membranes after modification using agnps are reduced by 64 5 and 31 1 respectively amouamouha and badalians gholikandi 2017 due to the higher roughness and lower surface hydrophilicity of pes membranes the binding ability of the polymer with agnps is lower leading to greater silver loss and lower antimicrobial potential although increasing the doping amount of agnps can improve the antibacterial performance of the membrane azhar et al 2020 this can lead to the blockage of membrane pores reducing the membrane flux the position of agnps in the membrane also varies with the substrate material affecting the hydrophilicity water flux and thus antibacterial effect of the membrane directly doped agnps form along the membrane base of pes and phosphatidylserine ps nanocomposite membranes especially in the surface and epidermis layers while agnps may form in the sublayer or bottom layer of cellulose acetate ca nanocomposite membranes and the interior of macropores due to the exposure of hydrophilic agnps on the membrane surface the contact angles of pes and ps decreased from 71 4 and 71 3 to 22 3 and 52 2 respectively hence pes and ps membranes have a higher antibacterial effect compared with acetate fiber membranes the smaller size of agnps the stronger antibacterial performance due to higher release rate and lower crystallinity mollahosseini et al 2012 the size of the agnps also affects the morphology of the synthesized membrane compared with larger agnps 70 nm the composite membrane doped with smaller agnps 30 nm has a smoother surface and lower contact angle surface contact angled70 62 7 surface contact angled30 60 9 mollahosseini et al 2012 generally the antibacterial or antifouling ability of agnps incorporated membranes was greatly impacted by the synthesized method of agnps the membrane materials and the position and size of agnps in membranes meanwhile impact the membrane properties 3 1 2 immobilization grafting of agnps on membrane surface recently electrospun nanofiber membranes have been extensively studied due to their advantages such as a large specific surface area interconnected porous structures fine nanofibers and high porosity which make them an ideal membrane fabrication technology for in situ growth of agnps the high specific surface area substantially increases the interaction between the agnps and bacteria which effectively improves the antibacterial ability of the membrane maziya et al 2020 uniform distribution of agnps on the membrane surface can be achieved through direct in situ growth on the membrane surface or through grafting agnps onto the membrane surface parekh et al 2018 surface grafting allows agnps to be exposed on the surface of the membrane but avoids the accumulation of agnps in the membrane pores pda is one of the most used polymer compounds for membrane surface modification its catechol groups can reduce ag for the uniform distribution and high loadings on the membrane of agnps park et al 2021 tang et al tang et al 2015 prepared the agnps modified polydopamine pda polysulfone psu membrane by in situ surface synthesis and found that the sterilization rate of the pda psu agnps membrane for e coli is more than 99 pda also has a bactericidal effect and strong hydrophilicity reducing contact between bacteria and the membrane and reducing the membrane fouling therefore pda fixes agnps and cooperates with agnps to improve antibacterial performance and membrane hydrophilicity moreover plasma enhanced magnetron sputtering can enhance the uniform distribution of agnps on the membrane hirsch et al 2019 after sputtering for a very short period 5s an average particle size of 30 nm agnps is uniformly formed on membranes and the biofilm formation rate of pseudomonas sp on the membrane decreases by 64 6 after 14 days of continuous culture agnps on the membrane surface can improve membrane hydrophilicity by increasing the roughness of the membrane surface ghorab et al 2019 agnps also increase the electrostatic repulsive of organics on the membrane surface thus improving the antifouling ability of the membrane zou et al 2020 however the extensive loading of agnps on the membrane surface could increase the risk of blockage of membrane pores mukherjee and bandyopadhyaya mukherjee and bandyopadhyaya 2020 compared the properties of agnps composite membranes with different grafting degrees and found that the membrane with the highest grafting degree 16 94 wt has the lowest water flux due to the severe blockage of membrane pores therefore it is critical to optimize the loading capacity water flux and antibacterial and antifouling effect of agnps to improve the comprehensive performance of the membrane 3 1 3 loading of agnps with functional materials on membrane the synergistic effect of agnps with other antimicrobial substances can improve the antimicrobial performance of agnps incorporated membranes at present carbon based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes cnts and graphene oxide go often show excellent synergistic effects when combined with agnps as cnts have stronger chemical stability a larger specific surface area and more abundant internal void structures they can provide sufficient binding sites for agnps to form heterozygous materials shukla et al shukla et al 2019 prepared silver doped multiwalled carbon nanotube mwcnt polyphenylsulfone ppsu nanocomposite membranes to obtain smaller size agnps 5 1 nm exposed on the membrane surface the resultant nanocomposite membrane has 100 inhibition ability against e coli moreover agnps go nanocomposites are stronger antibacterial agents due to synergistic enhancement of biocidal activity zhu et al 2017 importantly the introduction of oxygen containing groups chemically stabilizes go and provides more surface active sites and a larger specific surface area tian et al 2021b preventing agnps from agglomerating sun et al 2015 in addition go is also effective against bacteria due to its hydrophobic intermediate lamellae and hydrophilic edge structure yu et al 2013b li et al li et al 2016 uniformly assembled agnps onto go sheets and then added them into pvdf membranes through a simple phase transformation method which greatly improved the hydrophilicity mechanical properties permeability and antimicrobial performance of the agnps go composite pvdf membrane faria et al faria et al 2015 used a cross linking agent to stably anchor agnps go nanocomposites to an electrospun membrane containing poly lactide co glycolide plga and chitosan which had excellent inactivation efficiencies for gram negative 99 e coli and p aeruginosa and gram positive bacteria 76 s aureus in addition using three dimensional crumpled go cgo to load agnps could achieve a higher loading capacity and a stronger antimicrobial effect jiang et al 2015 jiang et al jiang et al 2016 reported that cgo encapsulated with a quasi tio2 agnps core shell structure on the ultrafiltration uf membrane achieved a good antibacterial performance 3log removal rate for e coli overall carbon based nanomaterials provide abundant growth sites for agnps and prevent the aggregation of agnps moreover carbon based nanomaterials can potentially control the size of agnps in the membrane conversely the presence of agnps also promotes the uniform dispersion of carbon based nanomaterials in the membrane generally the synergistic effect of the carbon based nanomaterials and agnps can substantially improve the antibacterial and antifouling effect of the composite membrane thus improving the prospect of fabrications of novel agnps incorporated membranes likewise silica sio2 nanoparticles with strong hydrophilicity weak toxicity and antibacterial effects enhance the synergistic effect in combination with agnps sri abirami saraswathi et al 2019 once the agnps grew on the surface of the sio2 nanoparticles numerous spikes on the sio2 nanopores and shells could prevent the agnps from clumping together these spikes can pierce the cell membrane and kill bacteria zhang et al zhang et al 2020a prepared agnps sio2 nanopollens pvdf modified membrane and confirmed that silica as a carrier of agnps can improve the delivery effect of silver avoid agnps aggregation and control the sterilization effect of agnps similarly agnps sio2 nanopollens fixed on the membrane surface can improve the antibacterial effect park et al park et al 2016b used cysteamine as a covalent bond to fix agnps sio2 nanopollens on a polyimide film composite membrane even with low particle coverage the modified membrane showed excellent antibacterial activity against e coli 92 7 p aeruginosa 99 5 and s aureus 73 5 notably the current tests on agnps incorporated membranes are limited to the treatment of synthetic wastewater in the laboratory and few studies have been conducted on their antifouling effects in the practical water wastewater treatment process recently chen et al chen et al 2020 reported that a agnps tio2 composite membrane consistently exhibited the best anti fouling and antibiotic degradation properties compared to the original membrane and the tio2 composited membrane in the treatment of secondary clarifier effluent likewise in the treatment of real palm oil wastewater the membranes with the addition of agnps titanium nanotubes composite nanomaterials had a higher antimicrobial effect compared to the original membranes 95 vs less than 20 hazaraimi et al 2021 in addition we note that some auxiliary methods i e microwave radiation uv and ultrasound fan et al 2019 guan et al 2021 can also improve the antibacterial properties of agnps and even play an important role in killing drug resistant pathogenic bacteria ayres et al ayres et al 2021 used microwave radiation to assist agnps to inhibit the growth of chlorine resistant legionella pneumophila overall the above organic polymers carbon based nanomaterials and other nanomaterials combine with agnps to form a stronger antibacterial effect and improve the membrane separation performance water flux and resistance to organic fouling table 1 we will discuss in detail in the section 4 the testing methods used to evaluate the antibacterial performance of membranes are inconsistent including the static test disk diffusion test and impregnation test and the dynamic test water components test disk diffusion tests can evaluate the inhibition effect of the modified membrane on the microorganisms attached to the membrane surface the impregnation test evaluates the antibacterial effect of agnps in the solution however the effects of water pressure and water flow on agnps in the membrane have been neglected the difference in the transmembrane pressure during the operation will deform part of the membrane and the water flow will accelerate the release of agnps therefore a simple static test cannot accurately characterize the antibacterial properties of the membrane the retention of bacteria on the membrane can be determined through filtration test but it is difficult to evaluate the inhibition of bacterial therefore it is necessary to culture and analyze the bacteria remaining on the membrane after the filtration test similar to the static test neither static tests nor dynamic tests can individually fully characterize the antimicrobial properties of the membrane and these tests can be combined in addition membrane contamination by microorganisms is extremely complex e coli and s aureus are typically selected as test strains in the existing antimicrobial tests and thus the test results only reflect the inhibition effect of agnps incorporated membranes on a single bacterium therefore mixed cultures extracted from actual sewage should be considered in antibacterial tests of membranes importantly simple agnps can no longer meet the current requirements for high efficiency sustainable and renewable antimicrobial membranes the synergistic effect of agnps and other materials often promotes the antimicrobial properties of the composites which could be a promising way to prepare low cost and high efficiency antimicrobial membranes 3 2 photocatalytic membranes the antibacterial properties of agnps to reduce biofouling is an effective method however the increasingly complex water environment requires membranes resistant to organic fouling and degrading toxic substances based on this antimicrobial photocatalytic nanomaterials can be used to develop antimicrobial antifouling and self cleaning membranes subramaniam et al 2021 these membranes are activated by artificial or solar irradiation to break down foulants and or organic pollutants into smaller even non toxic substances without secondary contaminants shi et al 2019 five main types of photocatalytic membranes pms have attracted the attention of researchers including g c3n4 based zno based β feooh based tio2 based photocatalytic membranes as well as the incorporation of them koe et al 2020 however the large bandgap of the above photocatalytic materials and the poor absorption ability of visible light greatly limit the catalytic effect of the photocatalytic membrane currently the development of photocatalysts has two directions nascimbén santos et al 2020 a preparing composite materials to reduce the recombination rate of electron and electron holes and thus broaden the wavelength range and enhance the photon utilization rate b enhancing the visible light activity by reducing the bandgap value improving the solar energy utilization efficiency the excellent optical properties of agnps endow them with strong light absorption and catalytic properties surface ion resonance spr amirmostafa amirjani 2018 and the schottky effect khan et al 2015 of metallic agnps can improve visible light absorption of photocatalytic materials as such the coupling of agnps and traditional photocatalysts can improve the photocatalytic performance of the modified membrane enhancing antibacterial and organic degradation ability table 2 summarizes the previous studies on the agnps modified photocatalytic membranes ke et al ke et al 2011 prepared a photocatalytic membrane for degrading dyes by fixing agnps on alumina nanofibers af filtration membranes with an aperture of about 10 nm when methylene blue is used as the feed solution the permeation selectivity of the modified membrane is 85 and the water flux reaches 200 l m 2 h 1 liu et al liu et al 2018 prepared visible light driven ag go titanate nanotubes tnt photocatalytic membranes and found that agnps broaden the response wavelength range of go based hybrid photocatalysts resulting in the rapid degradation of methylene blue 90 removal efficiency after 120 min irradiation with 8 mg photo catalyst the visible light irradiation also reduces membrane fouling of ag go tnt photocatalytic membranes zhang et al zhang et al 2017 loaded agnps onto g c3n4 to fabricate agnps g c3n4 pes membranes obtaining a higher bovine serum albumin bsa rejection or removal rate of 96 5 and a higher e coli and p aeruginosa inhibition rate of 100 due to the formation of strong oxidizing species under visible light irradiation in addition agnps can enhance the electron hole separation ability interfacial charge transferability and visible light excitation ability of tio2 to maximize the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions song et al 2019 membrane prepared by combining agnps with tio2 exhibit photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes 80 humic acid 88 3 bsa 86 and antibiotics 80 7 chen et al 2016 liu et al 2012 salazar et al 2020 liu et al liu et al 2012 report that the ag tio2 composite membrane has higher hydrophilicity than the pristine tio2 membrane moreover zno agnps cnt pi membranes have a higher removal efficiency than the original membrane about 82 compared to 0 for methyl orange mo under uv irradiation kou et al 2012 in combination with photocatalytic materials agnps and some silver salts such as agcl and agbr exhibit extremely strong photocatalytic ability and combine with photocatalytic materials lei et al 2011 wang et al 2021c due to the schottky junction of agbr ag the primary reaction rate constant of agbr ag can be several dozen times faster than those of polyacrylonitrile pan ag and pan agbr qayum et al 2019 in summary agnps have photocatalytic ability which can achieve organic degradation under light irradiation moreover agnps can expand the bandgap width of traditional photocatalytic materials and thus improve the electron hole separation ability and interfacial charge transferability further promoting the photocatalytic process different photocatalytic materials should be optimized and modified to prepare more low cost sustainable wide bandgap and high activity photocatalysts the combination of the photocatalytic membrane process with uv disinfection can reduce the energy consumption of the light source and membrane fouling the resultant ag bioi tio2 membrane exhibits superior photocatalytic disinfection activity 7 5 log inactivation of e coli within 1 h under visible light illumination which could be applied to high efficiency disinfection of high volume contaminated water song et al 2019 in addition a small amount of h2o2 can be added in the photocatalytic process of agnps to construct a fenton like reaction this process achieves antibacterial and organic degradation and generates micro bubbles that can promote flotation demulsification in oil water separation ding et al 2020 however we should note that the membrane polymer could be damaged by the strong oxidizing species produced in the photocatalytic process 3 3 thermally driven membranes membrane distillation md is a thermally driven process with low energy consumption and high efficiency recent literature shows the important role of md processes in wastewater treatment and desalination as mentioned above the excellent photothermal conversion efficiency and antibacterial properties of agnps can significantly improve the distillation performance of the membrane and reduce membrane fouling md membranes are usually synthesized from hydrophobic polymers such as pvdf polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe or polypropylene pp nthunya et al 2019b however such hydrophobic membranes can easily adsorb organic matter and then breed microorganisms leading to biofouling previous studies have shown that the formation of biofilm can significantly reduce the efficiency of the md system zodrow et al 2014 although the high temperature 60 c in the md system could inhibit the growth of the most bacteria thermophilic bacteria in seawater and wastewater systems can breed on the membrane causing biofouling phattaranawik et al 2008 as such a few studies report the use of agnps to modify the membrane in md to inhibit the growth of thermophilic bacteria nthunya et al 2019a and thus reduce the biofouling of the md membrane nthunya et al 2020 in addition to using agnps to directly reduce membrane biofouling some researchers combine agnps with other photocatalytic substances to degrade organic matter in feed solutions hou et al 2017 the combination of the thermal process antibacterial process and photocatalytic process could greatly improve the fouling resistance of the md membrane agnps can also improve the photothermal conversion efficiency of md membranes the results show that the heat flow generated by agnps is about ten times that of aunps under plasma resonance conditions politano et al 2017 table 3 summarizes the related properties of md membranes modified by agnps politano et al politano et al 2019 doped agnps into pvdf membranes to eliminate temperature polarization by utilizing the thermal collective effect excited by the plasma model the transmembrane fluxes of pure water and 0 5 m nacl solution of the modified membrane were 11 and 9 times higher than those of the original membrane respectively agnps can increase the temperature polarization factor tpf of the modified md membranes to 106 5 ye et al ye et al 2019 incorporated agnps into pvdf nanofiber membranes to capture uv light without any other auxiliary heating methods the agnps allow photothermal conversion to be completed at the interface between the membrane surface and water providing a high efficiency 53 7 heating method in md in the future the coupling effect between agnps and other substances should be considered to further improve membrane performance as mentioned above thermophilic bacteria could be still the primary biofoulants of md systems phattaranawik et al 2008 therefore further research is needed on the inhibition of thermophilic bacteria by agnps the inhibition mechanism and the development of a highly effective antifouling md membrane 3 4 electro catalytic conductive membrane the electro catalytic conductive membrane is a combination of electrocatalysis and membrane filtration which exhibits good electro catalytic and conductivity performance as well as membrane retention the electro catalytic and antimicrobial properties of agnps incorporated electro conductivity membranes can be improved mushtaq et al mushtaq et al 2019 prepared agnps incorporated pes membranes to achieve an increasing conductivity 3 9 104 s cm and better fouling mitigation with electric fields this can be attributed to the enhancement of the electrostatic repulsion between foulants and membranes and the generation of in situ micro bubble on the membrane reducing the blockage of the membrane abu thabit et al abu thabit and basheer 2014 directly used cotton fibers conductive polyaniline and silver nanostructures to form conductive composite membranes at a filtration rate of 0 8 l h 1 and a potential of 20 v the inactivation efficiency of e coli was 92 on the agnps incorporated membrane thus agnps are highly effective in alleviating electrocatalytic membrane fouling in addition adding agnps into pvdf nanofiber membranes can induce the formation of β phase and increase the piezoelectric effect the low frequency power of agnps pvdf membranes was significantly increased by 40 compared to traditional pvdf membranes which provided a novel means of applying agnps in conductive membranes wu and chou 2020 in summary agnps are widely used in modified membranes to improve their antibacterial properties additionally agnps endow the incorporated membrane with good photocatalytic photothermal conversion and electrocatalytic performance due to the easy of agglomeration of nanoparticles agnps are generally coupled with other substances such as go cnts g c3n4 sio2 tio2 and pda to inhibit the agglomeration of agnps through the synergistic effect of agnps with other substances the modified agnp membranes combined with other substances can improve membrane performance especially in terms of resistance to organic fouling and water flux however there are challenges in practical engineering applications of agnps incorporated membranes including the need for improving the antimicrobial cycle hydrophilicity and water flux in addition the development of a sustainable membrane and defining the biological toxicity of the membrane are important issues that must be solved in the future development of agnps incorporated membranes 4 challenges in the development of agnps incorporated membrane 4 1 achieving long term and controlled agnps release on the agnps incorporated membrane the releasable amount and rate of agnps directly affect the lifetime of the agnps incorporated membrane normally the agnps exposed to the aqueous environment could be released from agnps incorporated membranes zodrow et al 2009 as such the most direct way to increase the service life of composite membranes the loading of agnps within the membranes must be increased kharaghani et al 2018 the size of the membrane pores gradually increases from 0 167 to 0 251 nm with the addition of agnps 0 5 1 5 wt using the phase conversion method li et al 2013 larger membrane pores allow more agnps to be exposed to the water mass increasing the releasable amount of agnps and lengthening the release period moreover the composite membranes with smaller size agnps 30 nm exhibited a longer release lifetime compared to larger size agnps 70 nm under the same conditions mollahosseini et al 2012 which could be primarily due to the smaller agnps being concentrated on the membrane surface with a stronger affinity in the organic phase the thermodynamic incompatibility between polymers could be employed for preparing silver containing compounds e g silver lactate and silver citrate to achieve silver enrichment on the membrane surface during the polymerization process kim et al 2012 as previously summarized however the regulation of agnps loading and size is likely to have a risk of decreasing mechanical strength and separation properties of membranes due to initially excessive release of agnps therefore control of the release rate of agnps in on the membrane is critical to improving the antimicrobial cycle and reducing the environmental risk fig 3 shows the relationship between the stable release of agnps and membrane lifetime in the agnps incorporated membrane increasing the loading of agnps does not enhance the release lifetime of the agnps incorporated membrane while a lower stable release rate can enhance the membrane lifetime the release of agnps in membranes could be controlled using specific organic or inorganic materials such as pda go cnts and sio2 for the fixation of agnps table 4 summarizes recent literature on the release of agnps from agnps incorporated membranes coating agnps with polymer materials is an effective way to control the release rate of agnps among them pda is one of the most common organic molecules used to fix agnps under alkaline conditions ph 8 5 dopamine da can be oxidized to form pda due to abundant catechin structures and strong adhesive property lynge et al 2011 pda can wrap the agnps to form a nanocoating on membrane surfaces moreover the structure of catechin makes the agnps negatively charged forming a strong electrostatic repulsive force to stabilize the pda coated agnps and show extremely strong stability as such the pda coated agnps are released slowly from the membrane with the release time more than 10 times that of the agnps blended within the membrane mollahosseini et al 2012 qi et al 2018b on the other hand the oxidation of metallic ag0 into ag is governed by the oxygen concentration in the followed eqs zhang et al 2016a 4 a g 0 o 2 2 a g 2 o 2 a g 2 o 4 h 4 a g 2 h 2 o due to the low sensitivity of pda mediated agnps to oxygen the pda thin layer can reduce ag and instantly adsorb agnps to the surface of pda film resulting in a lower release rate of agnps the freely bound silver in the agnps pda matrix readily leaches out due to hydraulic pressure during the filtration process especially in the initial filtration stage wai et al 2020 similarly miesen et al miesen et al 2020 used the hydrophobic sulfhydryl group and sodium oleate soa anchored by l a phosphatidylcholine pc membrane as a hydrophobic binding material to prepare agnps coated with mixed lipids the protection of the mixed lipid prevents surface oxidation of the agnps and the release of ag thus controlling the loss of agnps peng et al peng et al 2020 grafted polyimide pi half encapsulated agnps onto ceramic membranes cm via an in situ reduction method in the immersion experiment the release rate of agnps rapidly reached 0 7 μg l in the first 25 h and basically stabilized at 0 74 μg l after 72 h recently the dispersion and immobilization of agnps using two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d materials was found to be an effective and promising way to control the release rate of agnps and prolong the antibacterial cycle of agnps incorporated membranes among these materials go could be uniformly dispersed across the membrane due to its unique 2d structure as such the in situ growth of agnps on go achieves uniform distribution of agnps in the membranes and effectively controls release rate of agnps after seven days of immersion the release rate of go fixed agnps on the membrane is stable at 0 0002 μg cm2 day el gendi et al 2018 cnts sio2 and zno are typical 3d materials that could be used in the fixation of agnps the large surface area of multi walled cnts mwcnts provides a stable growth site for agnps the cumulative ag release concentration is only 12 5 μg g day after soaking 100 mg mwcnts agnps 3 8 wt composite membrane for 96 h raj kumar and gopinath 2016 similarly spherical nanoparticles with rough surfaces and abundant surface groups such as sio2 and fe3o4 can be firmly bound to the surface of agnps through covalent bonds and stable growth sites the results show that the covalent bonding of agnps on the rough surface of sio2 forms an agnp sio2 core shell structure with a ag release rate of just 0 0011μg cm2 day park et al 2016b ag fe3o4 core shell nps exhibit a broad bactericidal effect due to the slow diffusion of the ag from the fe3o4 shell yildiz et al 2020 in addition agnps can act as a core to be coated by other nanoparticles thus achieving slow release huang et al huang et al 2020 coated the surface of the agnps with a zno film of 1 nm to form the ag zno oac core shell structure which made the release rate of ag maintain at 0 02 μg cm2 day within 30 days and the antibacterial effect and durability were significantly higher than the unmodified membrane in particular metal organic frameworks mofs are an outstanding class of new porous nanostructured materials the main advantage of mofs over inorganic microporous materials is that their specific structures can be highly adjustable by applying different metal centers or changing organic ligands ding et al 2019 shen et al 2022 zhuang et al 2012 the depletion of metal ions from the mofs is an attractive feature that makes them be excellent candidates for antibacterial materials seyedpour et al seyedpour et al 2019 proposed to develop a novel antifouling polyamide membrane by surface an in situ assembly of ag based organic frameworks ag mofs it took seven months for the ag on the membrane to be fully released and regeneration of the ag mof could be achieved in the same way in addition a god ag zif antibacterial composite membrane with a responsive function was designed by inserting large size agnps 50 nm and glucose oxidase god simultaneously into the zeolite imidazole framework zif li et al 2020c during glycolysis agnp was continuously decomposed into ag and ultra small agnps 5 nm by inducing the generation of h2o2 which completely inhibited the growth of two model strains e coli for 5 μg ml and s aureus for 10 μg ml in addition to using various materials to anchor the agnps the release rate of agnps can be controlled by improving the synthesis methods and adjusting the hydrochemical conditions thompson et al thompson et al 2020 found that compared with untreated membranes pva coated agnps and uv functionalized membranes could reduce the leaching of agnps and improve the stability and duration of antibacterial activity of the membranes the fixed substances of agnps and the water quality also have a great influence on the release rate of agnps mikelonis et al mikelonis et al 2020 showed that the statically stabilized agnps citrate had a longer release time when treated with hard water while the spatially stabilized agnps polyethyleneimine and polyvinylpyrrolidone had the opposite result in addition adding natural organic matter nom to water prolonged the release time of citrate coated agnps under hard water conditions these differences are mainly due to the change in the hadrochemical environment which changes the agnps and the double electric layer of the membrane thus affecting the release rate of the agnps in general in order to obtain longer release times we can adjust the ph values so that the membrane and the agnps maintain surface potentials of opposite sign uz et al uz et al 2020 proved that tio2 supported agcl nps had a longer ag release period when filtering highly mineralized water compared with agnps therefore in the process of agnps loading the water quality should be considered and a substrate with an opposite surface potential to the agnps could be selected in summary organic polymer cap seals inorganic nanoparticles and mof fixed agnps can achieve low dose release of agnps from the membrane thus prolonging the service life of agnps incorporated membranes table 5 summarizes the combination of various materials and agnps and the related advantages disadvantages of these methods the use of auxiliary materials can control the morphology distribution and release of agnps from the membrane more controllable than the traditional simple loading method which could be a more promising way for further development of agnps composite membranes it is also consistent with the current status and trends of controlled release studies of agnps in recent years fig 4 it is worth noting that agnps are not generally incorporated directly into dense membranes such as nanofiltration reverse osmosis and forward osmosis membranes this is because the presence of agnps in dense membranes will inevitably cause changes to the membrane structure posing the risk of loss of retention capacity thus immobilization of agnps on the surface of dense membranes by surface grafting solid loading is the preferred method as such the release rate of the agnps immobilized on the membrane surface is mainly influenced by the grafting immobilization material rather than the membrane structure meanwhile the development of mof materials has recently opened new ideas and directions for the controlled release of agnps note that the synergistic effects of these fixation substances could support multiple functions i e recovery of expensive heavy metals and removal of trace organic matter for the modified membranes in addition membrane regeneration should be addressed carefully as non regenerative membranes will be greatly limited in practical applications currently few studies address the regeneration of agnps on exhausted membranes therefore we must prolong the service life of agnps incorporated membranes from the two perspectives of the slow release and regeneration of agnps finally we should note that the water quality influences the release of agnps from the composite membrane 4 2 overcoming the trade off effect and organic fouling of the agnps incorporated membrane the addition of agnps into the membrane can certainly achieve a better anti biofouling effect and selectivity which however might reduce the water flux of the membrane and fails to overcome the trade off effect xu et al 2020a the hydrophobic membrane can readily repel water molecules and adsorb hydrophobic organic compounds ochoa 2003 consequently the hydrophilic modification of the membrane is very important to improve the antifouling performance and water flux as agnps have low surface tension the water could readily spread on the surface of the agnps incorporated membranes some studies have shown that highly hydrophilic agnps can form a hydration layer around each agnps this hydration layer acts as a nano channel for the rapid transport of water molecules allowing the membrane to retain the trapping effect and meanwhile increase the water flux yang et al 2019b andrade et al andrade et al 2015 grew agnps in situ on a polysulfone psf membrane surface and found that the addition of 2 0 wt agnps reduced the contact angle of the membrane surface from 75 7 to 63 however the addition of a large number of agnps led to the deterioration of the membrane structure in addition the hydrophilicity of agnps mainly depends on the groups on surface fig 5 a shows that the hydrophilic modified agnps using hydrophilic materials i e go goqd cnt and tio2 etc could significantly reduce the contact angle on the surface of the membrane that is the hydrophilicity of the membrane increased accordingly the increase in the surface hydrophilicity promotes the membrane water flux as shown in fig 5 b this phenomenon is constant from mf to ro and fo membranes it is worth noting however that in fig 5 b a decrease in membrane hydrophilicity could occur when agnps are added in excess especially for nf and ro membranes with high nanoparticle concentrations the increased viscosity and reduced pore size of the cast solution reduce water flux mahmoudi et al 2020 also the hydrophilic modified agnps could impact on the anti fouling performance of the membrane as per fig 5 c and d we observe that the modified agnps significantly improve the rejection and anti fouling performance of the membrane in fig 5 d the flux recovery of the membranes could be significantly improved by adding a small amount of agnps 0 1 2 wt for all membrane types with the appropriate modifiers overall appropriate hydrophilic substances should be selected to modify the agnps to ensure that the membrane has an increasing water flux without reducing the rejection rate in summary the hydrophilic modification of agnps can significantly improve the anti fouling performance and water flux of the membranes and alleviate the trade off effect which highly depends on the modified substances the modification effect of agnps combining with go is particularly outstanding having a good anti fouling performance and high water flux however the go agnps incorporated membranes prepared by vacuum filtration lose the advantage of water flux due to the narrow two dimensional nano channels formed by go therefore the membrane preparation method should be reasonably selected and utilized for agnps incorporated membranes 4 3 preparing sustainable agnps incorporated membranes in the membrane industry development the extensive use of petroleum based non biodegradable polymers and toxic organic solvents poses risks to the health and environment hence the sustainability of membrane research fabrication and application are of great importance fig 6 evaluates the sustainability of the whole life cycle process of agnps incorporated membranes the preparation of agnps membrane synthesis application and the end of life management negative environmental impacts occur throughout the existing membrane preparation and management process during the preparation process of agnps the physical methods i e vacuum condensation magnetron sputtering and laser ablation and electrochemical reduction methods have high energy consumption rajoriya et al 2021 chemical reduction is the most commonly used method of preparing agnps nahb4 as the most popular compound to reduce ag is toxic to the humans and the environment and is highly flammable xu et al 2020c therefore improving the sustainability of the ag reduction process is of great significance for the preparation of agnps incorporated membranes this can be achieved through the use of non toxic solvents instead of toxic and harmful reducing agents at present bacteria fungi and plant extracts are used in the sustainable preparation of agnps ahmad et al 2019 roy et al 2019 bacteria such as escherichia coli el shanshoury et al 2011 actinobacteria rhodococcus sp otari et al 2012 pseudomonas sp and fungi such as verticillium sp priyabrata mukherjee 2001 penicillium fellutanum kathiresan et al 2009 and trichoderma asperellum mukherjee et al 2008 can be used to prepare agnps agnps synthesis in vitro by algae such as chaetomorpha linum kannan et al 2012 caulerpa resmosa kathiraven et al 2014 and ulva armoricana sp massironi et al 2019 has also been reported the carboxyl groups of aspartic acid and or glutamine residues and the hydroxyl groups of protein tyrosine residues in polysaccharides extracted from ulva armoricana sp can also be used to reduce ag to prepare agnps massironi et al 2019 xie et al 2006 however the large scale preparation of agnps by microorganisms is more difficult than other technologies rafique et al 2017 compared with microorganisms there are more abundant studies on the preparation of agnps by using extracts from various parts of plants ahmed et al 2016 the chemical properties of plant extracts showed greater reduction and stabilization mohamad et al 2013 and plant extracts can also be used as both reductants and capping agents ontong et al ontong et al 2019 used senna alata bark extracts to directly reduce ag to obtain agnps and successfully immobilize them on the membrane reducing the use of toxic and harmful reducing agents in the membrane preparation process agnps synthesis from water extract of neem leaves has also been studied and at room temperature the conversion of ag to agnps takes only 15 minutes without the involvement of any dangerous chemicals kannan et al 2012 in addition some studies have successfully prepared agnps using bio based materials such as panchakavya govarthanan et al 2014 coconut water elumalai et al 2014 honey philip 2010 leishmania parasite abdulsadah et al 2013 milk lee et al 2013 protein lu et al 2012 and dung pellets adeeyo and odiyo 2018 the reduction of ag can be achieved by using an eco friendly method such as ultraviolet light instead of the pharmaceutical reduction process ren et al 2016 to enhance the antibacterial effect of agnps the synergistic effect of antibacterial organics and agnps is often adopted and the combination of natural antimicrobial agents and agnps is an effective means of preparing sustainable agnps incorporated membranes chitosan as biological extract can be used as a green coating agent of agnps under certain conditions due to the existence of amino and hydroxyl functional groups kolangare et al 2018 moreover natural extracts such as artemisia argyi oil li et al 2020a da lynge et al 2011 and gallic acid xuan et al 2020 also have certain antibacterial properties which can effectively improve the antibacterial effect of the membrane when combined with agnps the conventional synthesis and modification of agnps using toxic and harmful agents may have high energy consumption in fig 6 most of the membrane substrates are nonbiodegradable the toxicity and risks depend on the environment in which these membranes are used at present the typical polymers for agnps incorporated membranes include pvdf pes psf polyester pet and polyethylene peg zuo et al 2021 which are all difficult to degrade and non renewable the addition of biopolymers in the membrane preparation process can solve these above problems to some extent bandehali et al 2021 cellulose acetate as a derivative of the naturally abundant cellulose has been used as the base material to manufacture porous membranes due to its high selectivity high permeability and simple processing kargarzadeh et al 2018 stefan et al stefan et al 2021 prepared a biodegradable acetate fiber nf membrane based on cellulose acetate and the addition of agnps can increase water flux by three times chitin is a polysaccharide extracted from the shells of marine crustaceans and its chemical structure is very similar to plant cellulose the evenly dispersed chitin nanocrystals can be transformed into nanoporous membranes by a simple vacuum filtration method wang et al 2017b after reaching service life these bio based membranes can be degraded by microorganisms and converted into other resources such as methane hydrogen and sugar simplifying the preparation process of agnps incorporated membrane can support sustainable membrane production kharaghani et al kharaghani et al 2018 addressed the need for antimicrobial activity of nanofiber membranes for biomedical filtration devices by reducing ag in situ under physiological mild conditions through a simple wetting process the prepared ag functionalized pan nanofibers pan agnps have a significant antibacterial effect against e coli and s aureus and can be reused sustainably in summary the sustainable preparation of agnps incorporated membranes can be open a new horizon for modern membrane technology by using bio based materials instead of conventional organic substances using green solvents instead of traditional solvents using animal and plant extracts or ultraviolet light instead of traditional reducing agents and simplifying the preparation process based on this we preliminarily propose a desirable sustainable full life cycle development model for future agnps incorporated membranes fig 7 the use of green natural substances is maximized in the preparation of agnps and membranes technology and management improvements to reduce the chemical and energy consumption during membrane operation and accurate analysis and treatment to achieve the recovery of resources and energy substances however we must take into account some realities to achieve this desirable cycle firstly most of the membranes currently used in engineering applications are non biodegradable materials and thus cannot be recovered by the fermentation direct upgrading of membranes using organic polymers should be considered to achieve membrane regeneration dai et al 2021 secondly it is extremely difficult to achieve complete self cleaning of used membranes given that the light self cleaning has very limited application in practice for the spiral wound and hollow fiber configurations of membranes artificial intelligence control system can be used to design membrane materials for different wastewater to control the usage of chemicals and cleaning efficiency and to monitor the membrane systems in real time to avoid unrecoverable fouling and deactivation of agnps niu et al 2022 finally the environmental impacts of the extraction of green natural materials should be assessed the most immediate issue is the large amount of highly alkaline wastewater produced when cellulose is extracted from plants therefore the toxicity of raw materials should be reduced we have to acknowledge that there is still a long way to go to realize the complete greening of agnps incorporated membranes as prof liu said xie et al 2020 partial substitution could be a relatively easy first step in the substitution of these materials in addition we must also overcome the defects of green materials themselves such as serious aging poor tolerance and mechanical strength in the process of water treatment moreover biodegradation photodegradation and a combination of processes could be considered for the treatment of wasted agnps incorporated membranes to generate usable resources 4 4 addressing the issue of agnps biotoxicity due to the differences in the structures of human and bacterial cells some scholars believe that agnps cannot damage human cells due to a lack of specific structures for binding agnps le ouay and stellacci 2015 however in terms of biological evolution marambio jones and hoek 2010 the respiration of eukaryotes mitochondria and bacterial cells is very similar in term of electron transport atp synthesis and proton power hence it is reasonable to think that agnps could enter human cells and cause damage to the mitochondria studies have shown that agnps could cause lung function attenuation and inflammatory lesions in rats sung et al 2008 stem cell and liver cell leakage and the reduction of mitochondrial function braydich stolle et al 2005 rajeshkumar and malarkodi 2014 moreover agnps could induce human fibrosarcoma and human skin carcinoma to form the oxidative stress response thus causing cell apoptosis at a low dose 50 ppb and necrosis at a high dose 100 ppb arora et al 2008 most importantly a study on human fibroblasts found that agnps have cytotoxic genotoxic and anti proliferation effects tortella et al 2020 as a result the world health organization who has set a limit of 0 5 ppm for agnps in drinking water when agnps incorporated membranes were widely used in water wastewater treatment the agnps on the membrane would enter the environment with the effluent due to the complex component in the water wastewter environment agnps could exhibit a variety of complex forms and toxicity the environmental toxic effects of agnps are mainly related to three processes dissolution aggregation and adsorption jorge de souza et al 2019 research shows that even low concentrations of agnps in water could cause zebrafish to become hyperactive and when ag is in the acidic ph environment its toxicity will be enhanced asmonaite et al 2016 kataoka et al kataoka et al 2018 found that when 0 06 mg l ag was exposed to the solution of ph 4 the hatchability of japanese medaka embryos was reduced to 18 and the eye size was also reduced note that the size of agnps will directly affects their toxicity in the environment in an environment of high ionic strength the increased aggregation of agnps leads to the decrease of the dissolution surface area which reduces the release of ag and thus the toxicity hotze et al 2010 at the same time using green materials i e amphotericin b aqueous extract of isatis tinctoria tannic acid ta and moringa oleifera extract to coating agnps can also reduce their toxicity roy et al 2019 in addition the organics in the environment attached to the surface of agnps can increase the stability prolong their residence time and increase their exposure grillo et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 research also shown that agnps enter the soil with the water flow which could destroy the original microbial community in the soil khodaparast et al 2021 complex minerals and organics in water and soil are likely to combine with agnps and increase toxicity which can impede bioremediation of water and soil typically a large number of agnps in the environment can induce the emergence of silver resistant bacteria reducing the antimicrobial effect duran et al 2016 in summary although most studies claim that the amount of agnps released from modified membranes prepared in the laboratory is much lower than the who limit no studies have assessed the long term impact the specific antibacterial process and mechanisms of agnps should be elucidated to inform the design of agnps incorporated membranes and to establish a suitable detection process in particular selective toxicity and chronic toxicity tests for agnps should be carried out to clarify the toxicity mechanism of agnps in the human body and necessary surface modifications could be further designed to avoid human health risks 4 5 deactivation of agnps incorporated membranes in practical engineering applications complex environments contain harmful substances and lead to the rapid deactivation of agnps incorporated membranes fig 8 some anions such as hs s2 cl or po4 3 in raw water can react with ag to form insoluble precipitations on agnps surface such as ag2s solubility 140 μg l agcl solubility 1 9 mg l and ag3po4 solubility 6 5 mg l and thus passivation layers as such the activity of agnps is strongly decreased and the release of agnps and ag is greatly inhibited sulfides which are widely present in wastewater pose the greatest threat to agnps incorporated membranes because of the lowest solubility of ag2s choi et al 2009 this precipitate will readily consume ag and reduce the antibacterial properties of the membrane in addition s2 forms an extremely insoluble ag2s layer on the surface of agnps which further inhibits the dissolution of agnps and ag levard et al 2013 and thus causes the inactivation of the agnps incorporated membranes in addition biological sludge and dissolved organic matter dom in bioreactors have been shown to adsorb agnps in the wastewater hou et al 2013 hurt 2010 finally the release of agnps and ag is highly dependent on the presence of oxygen that is if the agnps incorporated membranes are in an anaerobic state for a long time the antibacterial effect may be also reduced le ouay and stellacci 2015 given that the passivation layers the absorption of sludge biopolymers and the anerobic anoxic condition greatly decreased the amount of available ag in the agnps incorporated membranes corresponding solutions could be proposed such as surface modification with active substances i e pda cs sbma and aa and regeneration of agnps by chemical cleaning i e citric acid oxalic acid formic acid and acetic acid wang et al 2014a nevertheless it is important to control the use of chemicals during the chemical cleaning process to prevent the loss of agnps within the membrane hence we recommend that certain physical cleaning methods i e air scouring backflushing vibration rotation and ultrasonic could be used to supplement the chemical cleaning process abdel karim et al 2021 wang et al 2014a 5 conclusion and outlook in the past decades agnps have been widely used to prepare polymer and ceramic membranes for water and wastewater treatment to improve the antibacterial antibiofouling photocatalytic photothermal conversion and electro catalytic conductive performance of the membranes here the properties applications and challenges of agnps incorporated membranes for water and wastewater treatment were reviewed the following conclusions were drawn 1 agnps can significantly improve the membrane performance agnps can directly kill microorganisms attached to the membrane with the release of small size agnps and ag meanwhile the hydrophilicity of the agnps incorporated membrane was improved to repel the fouling of the membrane by hydrophobic substances through strong light absorption and electron conversion agnps can widen the bandgap of photocatalytic materials such as tio2 zno g c3n4 and go and improve the photocatalytic effect of the membrane the excellent photothermal conversion effect and catalytic conductive property of agnps can improve the performance of membrane distillation and conductive membranes all these excellent properties endow the wide application of agnps in the composite membranes 2 different synthesis methods influence on the properties of agnps incorporated membranes the distribution of agnps on in situ synthesis membranes could be more uniform than that in ectopic synthesis surface grafting can result in more direct contact between agnps with microorganisms moreover it is important to avoid the blockage of the membrane pores by the agnps during blending meanwhile the agnps fixed in the membrane need to be slowly released to extend the extension of the antibacterial cycle thus the target water quality should be considered for the design of agnps incorporated membranes in terms of the appropriate polymers and auxiliary substances and the appropriate preparation method 3 the combination of agnps with functional materials compounds is an effective and promising way to further improve the properties of agnps incorporated membranes the incompatibility between agnps and membrane materials limits the performance of agnps incorporated membranes the current research breaking through this bottleneck is to combine agnps with other functional substances such as pda chitosan go cnts sio2 mof and cof etc and thus achieve efficient distribution and immobilization of agnps which could enhance the inherent properties of agnps control the release rate of agnps and protect the agnps from interfering substances in addition the hydrophilic materials such as pda go and sio2 could strengthen the attraction of the membrane to water molecules and the repulsion to hydrophobic substances and thus the trade off effect of agnps incorporated membranes could be broken through meanwhile other auxiliary methods like ultrasonic wave radiation light and voltage could be also considered to enhance the flux and antifouling performance of agnps incorporated membranes 4 the sustainable preparation of agnps incorporated membranes can improve their application potential in water and wastewater treatment processes the traditional preparation of agnps and agnps incorporated membranes employed toxic solvents leading to great environment and human health risks animal plant and microorganism extracts can be used in the preparation of agnps and agnps incorporated membranes suitable technical management and artificial intelligent strategies can realize a sustainable life cycle for agnps incorporated membranes in the future including the agnps production and the fabrication application regeneration and recovery of agnps incorporated membranes to achieve closed loop operation 5 the large scale use of agnps incorporated membranes is still restricted due to the release of ag and agnps threatening the human body and the environment the direct use of agnps incorporated membranes in drinking water treatment should be carefully considered the impact of the use of agnps incorporated membranes on the environment should be monitored in a long period and the application of agnps incorporated membrane should be controlled to avoid the health risk we can also start from the intelligent release of agnps depending on the ph temperature oxygen concentration and salt concentration of the

15617,in the face of the growing global water crisis membrane technology is a promising means of purifying water and wastewater silver nanoparticles agnps have been widely used to improve membrane performance for antibiofouling and to aid in photocatalytic degradation thermal response and electro conductivity however several critical issues such as short antimicrobial periods trade off effects and silver inactivation seriously restrict the engineering application of agnps incorporated membranes in addition there is controversy around the use of agnps given the toxic preparation process and environmental biological risks hence it is of great significance to summarize and analyze the recent developments and critical challenges in the use of agnps incorporated membranes in water and wastewater treatment and to propose potential solutions we reviewed the different properties and functions of agnps and their corresponding applications in agnps incorporated membranes recently multifunctional novel agnp incorporated membranes combined with other functional materials have been developed with high performance we further clarified the synergistic mechanisms between agnps and these novel nanomaterials and or polymers and elucidated their functions and roles in membrane separation finally the critical challenges of agnps incorporated membranes and the proposed solutions were outlined i prolonging the antimicrobial cycle through long term and controlled agnps release ii overcoming the trade off effect and organic fouling of the agnps incorporated membranes iii preparation of sustainable agnps incorporated membranes iv addressing biotoxicity induced by agnps and v deactivation of agnps incorporated membrane overall this review provides a comprehensive discussion of the advancements and challenges of agnps incorporated membranes and guides the development of more robust multi functional and sustainable agnps incorporated membranes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoparticles membrane material anti fouling life cycle biotoxicity data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction over 60 years diverse membrane materials and processes have been widely used for liquid separations in a variety of industries such as wastewater water treatment obotey ezugbe and rathilal 2020 tang et al 2018 food drinks castro muñoz et al 2020 petrochemical santos et al 2020 and refinery luiz et al 2018 industries because of the superior advantages such as high permeate quality ease of operation and maintenance excellent separation efficiency and compact modular construction membrane technologies have become a fundamental process in the engineering systems lee et al 2016 in the global membrane market 2021 2025 report a compound annual growth rate cagr of 7 is expected during the next few years mainly due to the growing demand for wastewater water resources management large scale industrial applications of membrane based technologies have been rapidly developed for sewage wastewater treatment advanced treatment of drinking water and desalination of seawater brackish water shannon et al 2008 however the application of membranes in practical engineering is limited by membrane fouling trade off effects membrane aging and high costs membrane fouling is the greatest issue of the operation of membrane processes suspended solids and solvents including bacterial cells colloids biomacromolecules and salts can accumulate on the surface or internal structure of the membrane during the filtration and reduce the membrane flux meng et al 2017 the adhesion and growth of microorganisms on the membrane can result in the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps and thus the biofilm formation known as biofouling significantly changing the membrane surface properties and reducing separation performance rumbaugh and sauer 2020 biofouling is a complex process involving interactions between the cell membrane material and between cells vanysacker et al 2014 chemicals such as naclo h2o2 and citric acid are used to control membrane fouling biofouling resulting in the degradation of membrane materials and membrane ageing thus shortening the service life of membranes porcelli and judd 2010 moreover trade offs exist in membrane separation between the mutual restriction of fluxes and the rejection rate of membranes shin et al 2021 to improve the adaptability economy and stability of the membrane and membrane processes therefore membrane modifications are usually carried out during or after membrane fabrication liao et al 2018 miller et al 2017 typically the membrane performance can be improved by various modifications such as surface coating ni et al 2014 surface grafting yang et al 2010 surface bioadhesion yang et al 2019a physical blending ran et al 2014 surface segregation chen et al 2011 or adding the functional substances to the membrane matrix materials yin and deng 2015 in recent years nanomaterials metal base carbon base and nanocomposite bolisetty and mezzenga 2016 ng et al 2013 yin and deng 2015 organic molecules ong et al 2016 metal organic framework mof qiu et al 2014 natural compounds dobosz et al 2015 and composites lau et al 2012 have been extensively incorporated with membranes to enhance resistance to biofouling composite materials achieve antibiofouling though anti adhesion release killing contact killing and photo responsive antibacterial behavior wang et al 2021b anti adhesive substances e g zwitterions and carbon quantum dots cqds can form a regular hydrated layer on the membrane surface to prevent cell adhesion and hydrophobic foulants deposition on the membrane through their hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions but have limited ability to resist complex biofilms guo et al 2020 mahat et al 2020 the release and contact type antibiofouling materials such as gold nanoparticles aunps copper nanoparticles cunps enzymes and antibiotics can be immobilized within the membrane or on the membrane surface by encapsulation or grafting to achieve chemical compatibility or the desired mode of release chen et al 2012 xu et al 2020b the antimicrobial substances that fail to be released can cause bacterial cell death upon contact with bacteria zhu et al 2021 such active antibiofouling materials can achieve dual antimicrobial effects inside and outside the membrane but their application is limited by unstable release and lower contact efficiency photosensitive antimicrobial materials such as titanium dioxide tio2 li et al 2020b zinc oxide zno sheikh et al 2020 graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 li et al 2019b and mil 125 zhou et al 2020 rapidly kill bacteria through the generation of thermal energy and hydroxyl radicals during photothermal conversion under solar or uv light irradiation however the generation of hydroxyl radicals is strongly dependent on the light absorption efficiency of photosensitive materials which can damage the membrane itself in particular silver nanoparticles agnps have been widely investigated in the membrane technologies due to their antibacterial optical electrical and catalytic properties the agnps incorporated membrane has unique separation efficiency and performances with high antimicrobial activity photocatalytic degradation thermal response and electro conductivity as shown in fig 1 over 10000 articles related to agnps incorporated membrane have been published in the past two decades according to the web of science prevalent keywords associated with agnps incorporated membrane include microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis and membrane distillation numerous studies have confirmed that agnps can improve the membrane antifouling effect of membranes either through the use of agnps alone or combination with substances such as graphene oxide go sun et al 2015 graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 zhao et al 2020b polydopamine pda wu et al 2018b silicon dioxide sio2 huang et al 2014 metal oxides yildiz et al 2020 moreover agnps can improve the catalytic effect of photocatalytic membranes goei and lim 2014 as well as the conductivity of membranes in summary agnps have a great potential for improving membrane performance and reducing biofouling however there are limitations in the application of agnps in the membrane fabrication and modification firstly the effective antifouling period of agnps incorporated membranes is reduced due to the uncontrolled release and inactivation of agnps on the membrane bi et al 2018 secondly the addition of agnps will reduce the membrane flux through blockage of the membrane pores fang et al 2019 thirdly the preparation and recovery of agnps are not sustainable due to the extensive use of toxic and harmful agents xiang et al 2020 fourthly the biological toxicity and environmental impact of agnps released from the composite membrane needs to warrant further attention jinlong shao 2017 therefore the practical applications of agnps incorporated membranes in engineering systems face various challenges numerous reviews of agnps have been reported in the past decades however they mainly focused on the properties of agnps including antimicrobial and antibiofouling behaviors zheng et al 2018 electro photo catalytic applications sharma et al 2021 synthesis and toxicity effects tortella et al 2020 there are limited comprehensive reviews and discussions of recent advancements and critical challenges in the use of agnps incorporated membranes in purifying water and wastewater treatment therefore the objective of this review is to summarize the recent progress in the fabrication and application of agnps incorporated membranes in water and wastewater treatment first we provide an overview of the properties of agnps especially the advanced research on improving the antimicrobial and antibiofouling properties of agnps the application and critical challenges of agnps incorporated membranes are further highlighted and discussed following a detailed analysis of the existing solutions we proposed a novel sustainable full life cycle process for agnps incorporated membranes generally this review could improve understandings of the development and current challenges of agnps incorporated membranes and provide important information for developing more robust multi functional and sustainable agnps incorporated membranes 2 multi properties of agnps 2 1 antimicrobial behavior antimicrobial behavior is one of the most prominent properties of agnps their antimicrobial effect activity is mainly determined by two distinctive processes le ouay and stellacci 2015 fig 2 i the dissolution release of agnps and ag ii and the reaction of agnps and ag with cells firstly the large size agnps dissolves themselves due to complex physical or chemical reactions with the surrounding environment bogumiła reidy 1 2013 echegoyen and nerin 2013 afterwards the smaller agnps and ag produces and directly damages the cell structure of microorganisms causing their death piao et al 2011 rastogi et al 2019 the antimicrobial process of agnps greatly depends on the small size agnps and ag in the solution in other words the dissolution process of agnps is the premise of the final antimicrobial effect activity 2 1 1 dissolution process of agnps the dissolution of agnps is mainly related to 1 the release of small size agnps and ag 2 the passivation on the surface of agnps and 3 the deactivation of agnps and ag fig 2a normally the reaction of agnps with o2 forms an agox oh y oxide layer on the exterior surface of the nanoparticles schnadt et al 2009 slightly acidic or other corrosive substances i e molecules containing ammonia primary amines and or secondary amines in the form of deprotonation could lead to the dissolution of the oxide layer promoting the release of ag sotiriou et al 2012 in addition the release of chemisorbed ions on the surface of the agnps could also produce a large amount of ag dobias and bernier latmani 2013 the generation of ag leads to the fracture of large size agnps along with the formation of small size agnps during ag reduction under chemical or light induced conditions kaegi et al 2010 li et al 2010 the passivation on the surface of agnps often hampers the release of small size agnps and ag the reaction of sulfides chloride halides oxygen and organic mercaptan with agnps could form insoluble substances leading to passivation on the surface of agnps given the very low solubility of ag2s and agcl a strong passivation layer could form on the surface of agnps choi et al 2009 levard et al 2013 reinsch et al 2012 note that in the presence of excess chloride the agcl passivation layer generates soluble agclx x 1 afrooz et al 2013 levard et al 2013 moreover the passivation process of agnps reacting with organic thiols is similar to that with chloride jingyu liu 2010 when the thiols concentration is too low the thiolate ligand forms a thiolate ligand shell around the agnps however if the thiol groups provide sufficient solubility silver can be quantitatively converted into soluble thiolates and facilitate the release of ag gondikas et al 2012 meanwhile the photothermal effect of plasmon excitation leads to the reduction of ag to agnps which gradually grow into the large agnps xue et al 2007 both the formation of insoluble precipitates and large size agnps result in loss of ag antimicrobial activity in the solution nanoparticles tend to aggregate due to van der waals interactions when the ionic strength of the solution increases the electrostatic repulsion potential energy between the agnps is shielded promoting the aggregation of agnps amro m el badawy et al 2010 on the other hand citrate or polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp ligands used in the process of preparing agnps are not firmly bound to the surface of agnps and can be easily displaced by various organic molecules such as amines phosphines mercaptans and anionic ligands such as oxides halides and sulfides levard et al 2011 as such these ligands cause the loss of colloidal stability in agnps in the formation of ion ligands the oxidative dissolution of agnps leads to the formation of the corresponding silver salt layers the silver salt layers surrounding the two particles could be a fuse causing an insoluble bridge between particles and actively contributing to the formation of large aggregates li and lenhart 2012 therefore both the formation of insoluble precipitates and large agnps result in the reduction of antibacterial activity in ag overall the complex passivation of agnps is usually accompanied by the deactivation of small size agnps and ag 2 1 2 antimicrobial mechanism of agnps as mentioned above the small size agnps and ag play an antimicrobial role by damaging the cell structures li et al 2008 manke et al 2013 marambio jones and hoek 2010 rajeshkumar and malarkodi 2014 factors such as the size of agnps oxygen content and environmental substances affect the antimicrobial effect activity of agnps currently there are three types of antimicrobial mechanisms of agnps and ag fig 2b 1 directly destruction of the cell membrane structures 2 inhibition of dna replication and adenosine triphosphate atp production 3 formation of reactive oxygen species ros destroying the cytoplasmic structure firstly agnps can be adsorbed on the cell membrane and interact with the membrane proteins to form complexes resulting in the inactivation of membrane binding enzymes and proteins holt and bard 2005 the fluidity of cell membranes can be altered by increasing the trans cis ratio of unsaturated fatty acids anas et al 2013 mueller spitz and crawford 2014 changes to membrane structures such as the lipid bilayer can cause loss of membrane integrity and increased permeability leading to the influx and leakage of cell contents once the small size agnps and ag enter the cell they can interact with the exocyclic nitrogen in guanine adenine and cytosine to cause dna structure changes and inhibit dna replication duran et al 2016 agnps may further interrupt the energy source of energy dependent reactions in cells leading to cell death bogumiła reidy 1 2013 pal et al 2007 in addition ros produced from the interaction of agnps with sulfur containing proteins enzymes and dna could cause strong oxidative damage to cellular materials mao et al 2018 note that although the antimicrobial mechanism of agnps and ag is similar their antimicrobial conditions and specific processes are different 1 agnps and ag have a different range of action concentrations i e nanomolar concentrations for agnps and micromolar ranges for ag mao et al 2018 2 ag could allow the cell to enter the active condition but non culturable state while agnps could anchor different parts of the cell and damage the different parts of the membrane jung et al 2008 and 3 ag could pass through smaller protein pores 1 nm to reach the cell while larger size agnps cannot bondarenko et al 2013 2 2 photo catalytic property due to surface plasmon resonance effects agnps can absorb the visible light to generate electrons and electron holes lim et al 2005 electrons are then transferred to the conduction band cb of agcl and react with oxygen molecules to form o2 meanwhile the electron holes from the agnps are also transferred to agcl and react with cl to form cl0 atoms o2 and cl0 atoms are both highly oxidizing substances with strong catalytic degradation ability zhou et al 2018 in addition to directly participating in the photocatalytic process agnps can also improve the catalytic efficiency of photocatalyst through synergistic action hou et al 2017 korkmaz et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 normally agnps can attract photogenerated electrons floating on the surface of photocatalyst inhibit the recombination of the photogenerated electron hole pairs and prolong the persistence of photogenerated electron hole pairs to improve photocatalytic efficiency wang et al 2017a agnps can also indirectly reduce the band gap of the photocatalyst expanding the wavelength range of the photocatalytic reaction light source zhang et al 2020b therefore agnps are unique photocatalysts and photocatalytic modifiers for improving photocatalytic performance 2 3 solar thermal conversion agnps can also achieve solar thermal conversion under lighting conditions zhao et al 2020a which is mainly based on the plasmon induced hot electron transfer phet ye et al 2019 in phet the plasma agnps as light absorbers can generate plasmons which then could decay into hot electrons k wu 2021 the hot electrons are transferred to adjacent molecules and the plasmonic metal heats up finally the heat of the plasma metal dissipates increasing the temperature of the surrounding medium rising wang et al 2014b generally the light heat conversion property makes agnps an excellent modifier for improving the efficiency of membranes distillation 2 4 electro catalytic conductive property as a metal agnps possess clear electrical conductivity with rapid transfer of electrons langley et al 2013 agnps have bifunctional effects with other active metals such as au pt and cu in the electrocatalytic process sleightholme et al 2008 due to the low zero charge potential epzc 0 67v vs she agnps often act as auxiliary metals for other metallic substances and form m ohads with oh in the medium hu et al 2020 therefore reactants adsorbed on the active metal will readily react with agnps to accelerate the reaction rate overall agnps are promising candidates in the fabrication of conductive and electrocatalytic membranes due to the unique physical chemical antibacterial optical electronic and catalytic properties of agnps they have been extensively used for the fabrication of high performance agnps incorporated membranes the application of agnps in membranes has expanded from pressure driven membranes to photocatalytic membranes thermally driven membranes and electro conductivity membranes here we summarized the applications and performance of various agnps incorporated membranes and further analyzed the role of agnps in membranes 3 applications of agnps in membrane fabrication and or modification 3 1 antifouling membranes 3 1 1 in situ synthesized agnps membranes the most direct way to prepare the antibacterial membrane is to add agnps into the casting solution however the agglomeration of agnps in the casting solution often damages the membrane structure and reduces separation performance thus decreasing the antibacterial effect valenti and giacomelli 2017 andrade et al andrade et al 2015 reported that the in situ synthesized agnps incorporated membranes had a higher antimicrobial property compared with that of ex situ synthesized agnps incorporated membranes due to the uniform distribution of agnps as such the in situ generation of agnps in or on membranes could be an effective strategy for the construction of agnps incorporated membranes with antibacterial properties ben sasson et al 2014 however the compatibility of agnps directly embedded in the polymer matrix is poor reducing the stability of the internal structure of the composite membrane the performance of in situ synthesized agnps in the membrane is affected by the membrane materials the surface colony forming units cfu on the polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polyethersulfone pes membranes after modification using agnps are reduced by 64 5 and 31 1 respectively amouamouha and badalians gholikandi 2017 due to the higher roughness and lower surface hydrophilicity of pes membranes the binding ability of the polymer with agnps is lower leading to greater silver loss and lower antimicrobial potential although increasing the doping amount of agnps can improve the antibacterial performance of the membrane azhar et al 2020 this can lead to the blockage of membrane pores reducing the membrane flux the position of agnps in the membrane also varies with the substrate material affecting the hydrophilicity water flux and thus antibacterial effect of the membrane directly doped agnps form along the membrane base of pes and phosphatidylserine ps nanocomposite membranes especially in the surface and epidermis layers while agnps may form in the sublayer or bottom layer of cellulose acetate ca nanocomposite membranes and the interior of macropores due to the exposure of hydrophilic agnps on the membrane surface the contact angles of pes and ps decreased from 71 4 and 71 3 to 22 3 and 52 2 respectively hence pes and ps membranes have a higher antibacterial effect compared with acetate fiber membranes the smaller size of agnps the stronger antibacterial performance due to higher release rate and lower crystallinity mollahosseini et al 2012 the size of the agnps also affects the morphology of the synthesized membrane compared with larger agnps 70 nm the composite membrane doped with smaller agnps 30 nm has a smoother surface and lower contact angle surface contact angled70 62 7 surface contact angled30 60 9 mollahosseini et al 2012 generally the antibacterial or antifouling ability of agnps incorporated membranes was greatly impacted by the synthesized method of agnps the membrane materials and the position and size of agnps in membranes meanwhile impact the membrane properties 3 1 2 immobilization grafting of agnps on membrane surface recently electrospun nanofiber membranes have been extensively studied due to their advantages such as a large specific surface area interconnected porous structures fine nanofibers and high porosity which make them an ideal membrane fabrication technology for in situ growth of agnps the high specific surface area substantially increases the interaction between the agnps and bacteria which effectively improves the antibacterial ability of the membrane maziya et al 2020 uniform distribution of agnps on the membrane surface can be achieved through direct in situ growth on the membrane surface or through grafting agnps onto the membrane surface parekh et al 2018 surface grafting allows agnps to be exposed on the surface of the membrane but avoids the accumulation of agnps in the membrane pores pda is one of the most used polymer compounds for membrane surface modification its catechol groups can reduce ag for the uniform distribution and high loadings on the membrane of agnps park et al 2021 tang et al tang et al 2015 prepared the agnps modified polydopamine pda polysulfone psu membrane by in situ surface synthesis and found that the sterilization rate of the pda psu agnps membrane for e coli is more than 99 pda also has a bactericidal effect and strong hydrophilicity reducing contact between bacteria and the membrane and reducing the membrane fouling therefore pda fixes agnps and cooperates with agnps to improve antibacterial performance and membrane hydrophilicity moreover plasma enhanced magnetron sputtering can enhance the uniform distribution of agnps on the membrane hirsch et al 2019 after sputtering for a very short period 5s an average particle size of 30 nm agnps is uniformly formed on membranes and the biofilm formation rate of pseudomonas sp on the membrane decreases by 64 6 after 14 days of continuous culture agnps on the membrane surface can improve membrane hydrophilicity by increasing the roughness of the membrane surface ghorab et al 2019 agnps also increase the electrostatic repulsive of organics on the membrane surface thus improving the antifouling ability of the membrane zou et al 2020 however the extensive loading of agnps on the membrane surface could increase the risk of blockage of membrane pores mukherjee and bandyopadhyaya mukherjee and bandyopadhyaya 2020 compared the properties of agnps composite membranes with different grafting degrees and found that the membrane with the highest grafting degree 16 94 wt has the lowest water flux due to the severe blockage of membrane pores therefore it is critical to optimize the loading capacity water flux and antibacterial and antifouling effect of agnps to improve the comprehensive performance of the membrane 3 1 3 loading of agnps with functional materials on membrane the synergistic effect of agnps with other antimicrobial substances can improve the antimicrobial performance of agnps incorporated membranes at present carbon based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes cnts and graphene oxide go often show excellent synergistic effects when combined with agnps as cnts have stronger chemical stability a larger specific surface area and more abundant internal void structures they can provide sufficient binding sites for agnps to form heterozygous materials shukla et al shukla et al 2019 prepared silver doped multiwalled carbon nanotube mwcnt polyphenylsulfone ppsu nanocomposite membranes to obtain smaller size agnps 5 1 nm exposed on the membrane surface the resultant nanocomposite membrane has 100 inhibition ability against e coli moreover agnps go nanocomposites are stronger antibacterial agents due to synergistic enhancement of biocidal activity zhu et al 2017 importantly the introduction of oxygen containing groups chemically stabilizes go and provides more surface active sites and a larger specific surface area tian et al 2021b preventing agnps from agglomerating sun et al 2015 in addition go is also effective against bacteria due to its hydrophobic intermediate lamellae and hydrophilic edge structure yu et al 2013b li et al li et al 2016 uniformly assembled agnps onto go sheets and then added them into pvdf membranes through a simple phase transformation method which greatly improved the hydrophilicity mechanical properties permeability and antimicrobial performance of the agnps go composite pvdf membrane faria et al faria et al 2015 used a cross linking agent to stably anchor agnps go nanocomposites to an electrospun membrane containing poly lactide co glycolide plga and chitosan which had excellent inactivation efficiencies for gram negative 99 e coli and p aeruginosa and gram positive bacteria 76 s aureus in addition using three dimensional crumpled go cgo to load agnps could achieve a higher loading capacity and a stronger antimicrobial effect jiang et al 2015 jiang et al jiang et al 2016 reported that cgo encapsulated with a quasi tio2 agnps core shell structure on the ultrafiltration uf membrane achieved a good antibacterial performance 3log removal rate for e coli overall carbon based nanomaterials provide abundant growth sites for agnps and prevent the aggregation of agnps moreover carbon based nanomaterials can potentially control the size of agnps in the membrane conversely the presence of agnps also promotes the uniform dispersion of carbon based nanomaterials in the membrane generally the synergistic effect of the carbon based nanomaterials and agnps can substantially improve the antibacterial and antifouling effect of the composite membrane thus improving the prospect of fabrications of novel agnps incorporated membranes likewise silica sio2 nanoparticles with strong hydrophilicity weak toxicity and antibacterial effects enhance the synergistic effect in combination with agnps sri abirami saraswathi et al 2019 once the agnps grew on the surface of the sio2 nanoparticles numerous spikes on the sio2 nanopores and shells could prevent the agnps from clumping together these spikes can pierce the cell membrane and kill bacteria zhang et al zhang et al 2020a prepared agnps sio2 nanopollens pvdf modified membrane and confirmed that silica as a carrier of agnps can improve the delivery effect of silver avoid agnps aggregation and control the sterilization effect of agnps similarly agnps sio2 nanopollens fixed on the membrane surface can improve the antibacterial effect park et al park et al 2016b used cysteamine as a covalent bond to fix agnps sio2 nanopollens on a polyimide film composite membrane even with low particle coverage the modified membrane showed excellent antibacterial activity against e coli 92 7 p aeruginosa 99 5 and s aureus 73 5 notably the current tests on agnps incorporated membranes are limited to the treatment of synthetic wastewater in the laboratory and few studies have been conducted on their antifouling effects in the practical water wastewater treatment process recently chen et al chen et al 2020 reported that a agnps tio2 composite membrane consistently exhibited the best anti fouling and antibiotic degradation properties compared to the original membrane and the tio2 composited membrane in the treatment of secondary clarifier effluent likewise in the treatment of real palm oil wastewater the membranes with the addition of agnps titanium nanotubes composite nanomaterials had a higher antimicrobial effect compared to the original membranes 95 vs less than 20 hazaraimi et al 2021 in addition we note that some auxiliary methods i e microwave radiation uv and ultrasound fan et al 2019 guan et al 2021 can also improve the antibacterial properties of agnps and even play an important role in killing drug resistant pathogenic bacteria ayres et al ayres et al 2021 used microwave radiation to assist agnps to inhibit the growth of chlorine resistant legionella pneumophila overall the above organic polymers carbon based nanomaterials and other nanomaterials combine with agnps to form a stronger antibacterial effect and improve the membrane separation performance water flux and resistance to organic fouling table 1 we will discuss in detail in the section 4 the testing methods used to evaluate the antibacterial performance of membranes are inconsistent including the static test disk diffusion test and impregnation test and the dynamic test water components test disk diffusion tests can evaluate the inhibition effect of the modified membrane on the microorganisms attached to the membrane surface the impregnation test evaluates the antibacterial effect of agnps in the solution however the effects of water pressure and water flow on agnps in the membrane have been neglected the difference in the transmembrane pressure during the operation will deform part of the membrane and the water flow will accelerate the release of agnps therefore a simple static test cannot accurately characterize the antibacterial properties of the membrane the retention of bacteria on the membrane can be determined through filtration test but it is difficult to evaluate the inhibition of bacterial therefore it is necessary to culture and analyze the bacteria remaining on the membrane after the filtration test similar to the static test neither static tests nor dynamic tests can individually fully characterize the antimicrobial properties of the membrane and these tests can be combined in addition membrane contamination by microorganisms is extremely complex e coli and s aureus are typically selected as test strains in the existing antimicrobial tests and thus the test results only reflect the inhibition effect of agnps incorporated membranes on a single bacterium therefore mixed cultures extracted from actual sewage should be considered in antibacterial tests of membranes importantly simple agnps can no longer meet the current requirements for high efficiency sustainable and renewable antimicrobial membranes the synergistic effect of agnps and other materials often promotes the antimicrobial properties of the composites which could be a promising way to prepare low cost and high efficiency antimicrobial membranes 3 2 photocatalytic membranes the antibacterial properties of agnps to reduce biofouling is an effective method however the increasingly complex water environment requires membranes resistant to organic fouling and degrading toxic substances based on this antimicrobial photocatalytic nanomaterials can be used to develop antimicrobial antifouling and self cleaning membranes subramaniam et al 2021 these membranes are activated by artificial or solar irradiation to break down foulants and or organic pollutants into smaller even non toxic substances without secondary contaminants shi et al 2019 five main types of photocatalytic membranes pms have attracted the attention of researchers including g c3n4 based zno based β feooh based tio2 based photocatalytic membranes as well as the incorporation of them koe et al 2020 however the large bandgap of the above photocatalytic materials and the poor absorption ability of visible light greatly limit the catalytic effect of the photocatalytic membrane currently the development of photocatalysts has two directions nascimbén santos et al 2020 a preparing composite materials to reduce the recombination rate of electron and electron holes and thus broaden the wavelength range and enhance the photon utilization rate b enhancing the visible light activity by reducing the bandgap value improving the solar energy utilization efficiency the excellent optical properties of agnps endow them with strong light absorption and catalytic properties surface ion resonance spr amirmostafa amirjani 2018 and the schottky effect khan et al 2015 of metallic agnps can improve visible light absorption of photocatalytic materials as such the coupling of agnps and traditional photocatalysts can improve the photocatalytic performance of the modified membrane enhancing antibacterial and organic degradation ability table 2 summarizes the previous studies on the agnps modified photocatalytic membranes ke et al ke et al 2011 prepared a photocatalytic membrane for degrading dyes by fixing agnps on alumina nanofibers af filtration membranes with an aperture of about 10 nm when methylene blue is used as the feed solution the permeation selectivity of the modified membrane is 85 and the water flux reaches 200 l m 2 h 1 liu et al liu et al 2018 prepared visible light driven ag go titanate nanotubes tnt photocatalytic membranes and found that agnps broaden the response wavelength range of go based hybrid photocatalysts resulting in the rapid degradation of methylene blue 90 removal efficiency after 120 min irradiation with 8 mg photo catalyst the visible light irradiation also reduces membrane fouling of ag go tnt photocatalytic membranes zhang et al zhang et al 2017 loaded agnps onto g c3n4 to fabricate agnps g c3n4 pes membranes obtaining a higher bovine serum albumin bsa rejection or removal rate of 96 5 and a higher e coli and p aeruginosa inhibition rate of 100 due to the formation of strong oxidizing species under visible light irradiation in addition agnps can enhance the electron hole separation ability interfacial charge transferability and visible light excitation ability of tio2 to maximize the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions song et al 2019 membrane prepared by combining agnps with tio2 exhibit photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes 80 humic acid 88 3 bsa 86 and antibiotics 80 7 chen et al 2016 liu et al 2012 salazar et al 2020 liu et al liu et al 2012 report that the ag tio2 composite membrane has higher hydrophilicity than the pristine tio2 membrane moreover zno agnps cnt pi membranes have a higher removal efficiency than the original membrane about 82 compared to 0 for methyl orange mo under uv irradiation kou et al 2012 in combination with photocatalytic materials agnps and some silver salts such as agcl and agbr exhibit extremely strong photocatalytic ability and combine with photocatalytic materials lei et al 2011 wang et al 2021c due to the schottky junction of agbr ag the primary reaction rate constant of agbr ag can be several dozen times faster than those of polyacrylonitrile pan ag and pan agbr qayum et al 2019 in summary agnps have photocatalytic ability which can achieve organic degradation under light irradiation moreover agnps can expand the bandgap width of traditional photocatalytic materials and thus improve the electron hole separation ability and interfacial charge transferability further promoting the photocatalytic process different photocatalytic materials should be optimized and modified to prepare more low cost sustainable wide bandgap and high activity photocatalysts the combination of the photocatalytic membrane process with uv disinfection can reduce the energy consumption of the light source and membrane fouling the resultant ag bioi tio2 membrane exhibits superior photocatalytic disinfection activity 7 5 log inactivation of e coli within 1 h under visible light illumination which could be applied to high efficiency disinfection of high volume contaminated water song et al 2019 in addition a small amount of h2o2 can be added in the photocatalytic process of agnps to construct a fenton like reaction this process achieves antibacterial and organic degradation and generates micro bubbles that can promote flotation demulsification in oil water separation ding et al 2020 however we should note that the membrane polymer could be damaged by the strong oxidizing species produced in the photocatalytic process 3 3 thermally driven membranes membrane distillation md is a thermally driven process with low energy consumption and high efficiency recent literature shows the important role of md processes in wastewater treatment and desalination as mentioned above the excellent photothermal conversion efficiency and antibacterial properties of agnps can significantly improve the distillation performance of the membrane and reduce membrane fouling md membranes are usually synthesized from hydrophobic polymers such as pvdf polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe or polypropylene pp nthunya et al 2019b however such hydrophobic membranes can easily adsorb organic matter and then breed microorganisms leading to biofouling previous studies have shown that the formation of biofilm can significantly reduce the efficiency of the md system zodrow et al 2014 although the high temperature 60 c in the md system could inhibit the growth of the most bacteria thermophilic bacteria in seawater and wastewater systems can breed on the membrane causing biofouling phattaranawik et al 2008 as such a few studies report the use of agnps to modify the membrane in md to inhibit the growth of thermophilic bacteria nthunya et al 2019a and thus reduce the biofouling of the md membrane nthunya et al 2020 in addition to using agnps to directly reduce membrane biofouling some researchers combine agnps with other photocatalytic substances to degrade organic matter in feed solutions hou et al 2017 the combination of the thermal process antibacterial process and photocatalytic process could greatly improve the fouling resistance of the md membrane agnps can also improve the photothermal conversion efficiency of md membranes the results show that the heat flow generated by agnps is about ten times that of aunps under plasma resonance conditions politano et al 2017 table 3 summarizes the related properties of md membranes modified by agnps politano et al politano et al 2019 doped agnps into pvdf membranes to eliminate temperature polarization by utilizing the thermal collective effect excited by the plasma model the transmembrane fluxes of pure water and 0 5 m nacl solution of the modified membrane were 11 and 9 times higher than those of the original membrane respectively agnps can increase the temperature polarization factor tpf of the modified md membranes to 106 5 ye et al ye et al 2019 incorporated agnps into pvdf nanofiber membranes to capture uv light without any other auxiliary heating methods the agnps allow photothermal conversion to be completed at the interface between the membrane surface and water providing a high efficiency 53 7 heating method in md in the future the coupling effect between agnps and other substances should be considered to further improve membrane performance as mentioned above thermophilic bacteria could be still the primary biofoulants of md systems phattaranawik et al 2008 therefore further research is needed on the inhibition of thermophilic bacteria by agnps the inhibition mechanism and the development of a highly effective antifouling md membrane 3 4 electro catalytic conductive membrane the electro catalytic conductive membrane is a combination of electrocatalysis and membrane filtration which exhibits good electro catalytic and conductivity performance as well as membrane retention the electro catalytic and antimicrobial properties of agnps incorporated electro conductivity membranes can be improved mushtaq et al mushtaq et al 2019 prepared agnps incorporated pes membranes to achieve an increasing conductivity 3 9 104 s cm and better fouling mitigation with electric fields this can be attributed to the enhancement of the electrostatic repulsion between foulants and membranes and the generation of in situ micro bubble on the membrane reducing the blockage of the membrane abu thabit et al abu thabit and basheer 2014 directly used cotton fibers conductive polyaniline and silver nanostructures to form conductive composite membranes at a filtration rate of 0 8 l h 1 and a potential of 20 v the inactivation efficiency of e coli was 92 on the agnps incorporated membrane thus agnps are highly effective in alleviating electrocatalytic membrane fouling in addition adding agnps into pvdf nanofiber membranes can induce the formation of β phase and increase the piezoelectric effect the low frequency power of agnps pvdf membranes was significantly increased by 40 compared to traditional pvdf membranes which provided a novel means of applying agnps in conductive membranes wu and chou 2020 in summary agnps are widely used in modified membranes to improve their antibacterial properties additionally agnps endow the incorporated membrane with good photocatalytic photothermal conversion and electrocatalytic performance due to the easy of agglomeration of nanoparticles agnps are generally coupled with other substances such as go cnts g c3n4 sio2 tio2 and pda to inhibit the agglomeration of agnps through the synergistic effect of agnps with other substances the modified agnp membranes combined with other substances can improve membrane performance especially in terms of resistance to organic fouling and water flux however there are challenges in practical engineering applications of agnps incorporated membranes including the need for improving the antimicrobial cycle hydrophilicity and water flux in addition the development of a sustainable membrane and defining the biological toxicity of the membrane are important issues that must be solved in the future development of agnps incorporated membranes 4 challenges in the development of agnps incorporated membrane 4 1 achieving long term and controlled agnps release on the agnps incorporated membrane the releasable amount and rate of agnps directly affect the lifetime of the agnps incorporated membrane normally the agnps exposed to the aqueous environment could be released from agnps incorporated membranes zodrow et al 2009 as such the most direct way to increase the service life of composite membranes the loading of agnps within the membranes must be increased kharaghani et al 2018 the size of the membrane pores gradually increases from 0 167 to 0 251 nm with the addition of agnps 0 5 1 5 wt using the phase conversion method li et al 2013 larger membrane pores allow more agnps to be exposed to the water mass increasing the releasable amount of agnps and lengthening the release period moreover the composite membranes with smaller size agnps 30 nm exhibited a longer release lifetime compared to larger size agnps 70 nm under the same conditions mollahosseini et al 2012 which could be primarily due to the smaller agnps being concentrated on the membrane surface with a stronger affinity in the organic phase the thermodynamic incompatibility between polymers could be employed for preparing silver containing compounds e g silver lactate and silver citrate to achieve silver enrichment on the membrane surface during the polymerization process kim et al 2012 as previously summarized however the regulation of agnps loading and size is likely to have a risk of decreasing mechanical strength and separation properties of membranes due to initially excessive release of agnps therefore control of the release rate of agnps in on the membrane is critical to improving the antimicrobial cycle and reducing the environmental risk fig 3 shows the relationship between the stable release of agnps and membrane lifetime in the agnps incorporated membrane increasing the loading of agnps does not enhance the release lifetime of the agnps incorporated membrane while a lower stable release rate can enhance the membrane lifetime the release of agnps in membranes could be controlled using specific organic or inorganic materials such as pda go cnts and sio2 for the fixation of agnps table 4 summarizes recent literature on the release of agnps from agnps incorporated membranes coating agnps with polymer materials is an effective way to control the release rate of agnps among them pda is one of the most common organic molecules used to fix agnps under alkaline conditions ph 8 5 dopamine da can be oxidized to form pda due to abundant catechin structures and strong adhesive property lynge et al 2011 pda can wrap the agnps to form a nanocoating on membrane surfaces moreover the structure of catechin makes the agnps negatively charged forming a strong electrostatic repulsive force to stabilize the pda coated agnps and show extremely strong stability as such the pda coated agnps are released slowly from the membrane with the release time more than 10 times that of the agnps blended within the membrane mollahosseini et al 2012 qi et al 2018b on the other hand the oxidation of metallic ag0 into ag is governed by the oxygen concentration in the followed eqs zhang et al 2016a 4 a g 0 o 2 2 a g 2 o 2 a g 2 o 4 h 4 a g 2 h 2 o due to the low sensitivity of pda mediated agnps to oxygen the pda thin layer can reduce ag and instantly adsorb agnps to the surface of pda film resulting in a lower release rate of agnps the freely bound silver in the agnps pda matrix readily leaches out due to hydraulic pressure during the filtration process especially in the initial filtration stage wai et al 2020 similarly miesen et al miesen et al 2020 used the hydrophobic sulfhydryl group and sodium oleate soa anchored by l a phosphatidylcholine pc membrane as a hydrophobic binding material to prepare agnps coated with mixed lipids the protection of the mixed lipid prevents surface oxidation of the agnps and the release of ag thus controlling the loss of agnps peng et al peng et al 2020 grafted polyimide pi half encapsulated agnps onto ceramic membranes cm via an in situ reduction method in the immersion experiment the release rate of agnps rapidly reached 0 7 μg l in the first 25 h and basically stabilized at 0 74 μg l after 72 h recently the dispersion and immobilization of agnps using two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d materials was found to be an effective and promising way to control the release rate of agnps and prolong the antibacterial cycle of agnps incorporated membranes among these materials go could be uniformly dispersed across the membrane due to its unique 2d structure as such the in situ growth of agnps on go achieves uniform distribution of agnps in the membranes and effectively controls release rate of agnps after seven days of immersion the release rate of go fixed agnps on the membrane is stable at 0 0002 μg cm2 day el gendi et al 2018 cnts sio2 and zno are typical 3d materials that could be used in the fixation of agnps the large surface area of multi walled cnts mwcnts provides a stable growth site for agnps the cumulative ag release concentration is only 12 5 μg g day after soaking 100 mg mwcnts agnps 3 8 wt composite membrane for 96 h raj kumar and gopinath 2016 similarly spherical nanoparticles with rough surfaces and abundant surface groups such as sio2 and fe3o4 can be firmly bound to the surface of agnps through covalent bonds and stable growth sites the results show that the covalent bonding of agnps on the rough surface of sio2 forms an agnp sio2 core shell structure with a ag release rate of just 0 0011μg cm2 day park et al 2016b ag fe3o4 core shell nps exhibit a broad bactericidal effect due to the slow diffusion of the ag from the fe3o4 shell yildiz et al 2020 in addition agnps can act as a core to be coated by other nanoparticles thus achieving slow release huang et al huang et al 2020 coated the surface of the agnps with a zno film of 1 nm to form the ag zno oac core shell structure which made the release rate of ag maintain at 0 02 μg cm2 day within 30 days and the antibacterial effect and durability were significantly higher than the unmodified membrane in particular metal organic frameworks mofs are an outstanding class of new porous nanostructured materials the main advantage of mofs over inorganic microporous materials is that their specific structures can be highly adjustable by applying different metal centers or changing organic ligands ding et al 2019 shen et al 2022 zhuang et al 2012 the depletion of metal ions from the mofs is an attractive feature that makes them be excellent candidates for antibacterial materials seyedpour et al seyedpour et al 2019 proposed to develop a novel antifouling polyamide membrane by surface an in situ assembly of ag based organic frameworks ag mofs it took seven months for the ag on the membrane to be fully released and regeneration of the ag mof could be achieved in the same way in addition a god ag zif antibacterial composite membrane with a responsive function was designed by inserting large size agnps 50 nm and glucose oxidase god simultaneously into the zeolite imidazole framework zif li et al 2020c during glycolysis agnp was continuously decomposed into ag and ultra small agnps 5 nm by inducing the generation of h2o2 which completely inhibited the growth of two model strains e coli for 5 μg ml and s aureus for 10 μg ml in addition to using various materials to anchor the agnps the release rate of agnps can be controlled by improving the synthesis methods and adjusting the hydrochemical conditions thompson et al thompson et al 2020 found that compared with untreated membranes pva coated agnps and uv functionalized membranes could reduce the leaching of agnps and improve the stability and duration of antibacterial activity of the membranes the fixed substances of agnps and the water quality also have a great influence on the release rate of agnps mikelonis et al mikelonis et al 2020 showed that the statically stabilized agnps citrate had a longer release time when treated with hard water while the spatially stabilized agnps polyethyleneimine and polyvinylpyrrolidone had the opposite result in addition adding natural organic matter nom to water prolonged the release time of citrate coated agnps under hard water conditions these differences are mainly due to the change in the hadrochemical environment which changes the agnps and the double electric layer of the membrane thus affecting the release rate of the agnps in general in order to obtain longer release times we can adjust the ph values so that the membrane and the agnps maintain surface potentials of opposite sign uz et al uz et al 2020 proved that tio2 supported agcl nps had a longer ag release period when filtering highly mineralized water compared with agnps therefore in the process of agnps loading the water quality should be considered and a substrate with an opposite surface potential to the agnps could be selected in summary organic polymer cap seals inorganic nanoparticles and mof fixed agnps can achieve low dose release of agnps from the membrane thus prolonging the service life of agnps incorporated membranes table 5 summarizes the combination of various materials and agnps and the related advantages disadvantages of these methods the use of auxiliary materials can control the morphology distribution and release of agnps from the membrane more controllable than the traditional simple loading method which could be a more promising way for further development of agnps composite membranes it is also consistent with the current status and trends of controlled release studies of agnps in recent years fig 4 it is worth noting that agnps are not generally incorporated directly into dense membranes such as nanofiltration reverse osmosis and forward osmosis membranes this is because the presence of agnps in dense membranes will inevitably cause changes to the membrane structure posing the risk of loss of retention capacity thus immobilization of agnps on the surface of dense membranes by surface grafting solid loading is the preferred method as such the release rate of the agnps immobilized on the membrane surface is mainly influenced by the grafting immobilization material rather than the membrane structure meanwhile the development of mof materials has recently opened new ideas and directions for the controlled release of agnps note that the synergistic effects of these fixation substances could support multiple functions i e recovery of expensive heavy metals and removal of trace organic matter for the modified membranes in addition membrane regeneration should be addressed carefully as non regenerative membranes will be greatly limited in practical applications currently few studies address the regeneration of agnps on exhausted membranes therefore we must prolong the service life of agnps incorporated membranes from the two perspectives of the slow release and regeneration of agnps finally we should note that the water quality influences the release of agnps from the composite membrane 4 2 overcoming the trade off effect and organic fouling of the agnps incorporated membrane the addition of agnps into the membrane can certainly achieve a better anti biofouling effect and selectivity which however might reduce the water flux of the membrane and fails to overcome the trade off effect xu et al 2020a the hydrophobic membrane can readily repel water molecules and adsorb hydrophobic organic compounds ochoa 2003 consequently the hydrophilic modification of the membrane is very important to improve the antifouling performance and water flux as agnps have low surface tension the water could readily spread on the surface of the agnps incorporated membranes some studies have shown that highly hydrophilic agnps can form a hydration layer around each agnps this hydration layer acts as a nano channel for the rapid transport of water molecules allowing the membrane to retain the trapping effect and meanwhile increase the water flux yang et al 2019b andrade et al andrade et al 2015 grew agnps in situ on a polysulfone psf membrane surface and found that the addition of 2 0 wt agnps reduced the contact angle of the membrane surface from 75 7 to 63 however the addition of a large number of agnps led to the deterioration of the membrane structure in addition the hydrophilicity of agnps mainly depends on the groups on surface fig 5 a shows that the hydrophilic modified agnps using hydrophilic materials i e go goqd cnt and tio2 etc could significantly reduce the contact angle on the surface of the membrane that is the hydrophilicity of the membrane increased accordingly the increase in the surface hydrophilicity promotes the membrane water flux as shown in fig 5 b this phenomenon is constant from mf to ro and fo membranes it is worth noting however that in fig 5 b a decrease in membrane hydrophilicity could occur when agnps are added in excess especially for nf and ro membranes with high nanoparticle concentrations the increased viscosity and reduced pore size of the cast solution reduce water flux mahmoudi et al 2020 also the hydrophilic modified agnps could impact on the anti fouling performance of the membrane as per fig 5 c and d we observe that the modified agnps significantly improve the rejection and anti fouling performance of the membrane in fig 5 d the flux recovery of the membranes could be significantly improved by adding a small amount of agnps 0 1 2 wt for all membrane types with the appropriate modifiers overall appropriate hydrophilic substances should be selected to modify the agnps to ensure that the membrane has an increasing water flux without reducing the rejection rate in summary the hydrophilic modification of agnps can significantly improve the anti fouling performance and water flux of the membranes and alleviate the trade off effect which highly depends on the modified substances the modification effect of agnps combining with go is particularly outstanding having a good anti fouling performance and high water flux however the go agnps incorporated membranes prepared by vacuum filtration lose the advantage of water flux due to the narrow two dimensional nano channels formed by go therefore the membrane preparation method should be reasonably selected and utilized for agnps incorporated membranes 4 3 preparing sustainable agnps incorporated membranes in the membrane industry development the extensive use of petroleum based non biodegradable polymers and toxic organic solvents poses risks to the health and environment hence the sustainability of membrane research fabrication and application are of great importance fig 6 evaluates the sustainability of the whole life cycle process of agnps incorporated membranes the preparation of agnps membrane synthesis application and the end of life management negative environmental impacts occur throughout the existing membrane preparation and management process during the preparation process of agnps the physical methods i e vacuum condensation magnetron sputtering and laser ablation and electrochemical reduction methods have high energy consumption rajoriya et al 2021 chemical reduction is the most commonly used method of preparing agnps nahb4 as the most popular compound to reduce ag is toxic to the humans and the environment and is highly flammable xu et al 2020c therefore improving the sustainability of the ag reduction process is of great significance for the preparation of agnps incorporated membranes this can be achieved through the use of non toxic solvents instead of toxic and harmful reducing agents at present bacteria fungi and plant extracts are used in the sustainable preparation of agnps ahmad et al 2019 roy et al 2019 bacteria such as escherichia coli el shanshoury et al 2011 actinobacteria rhodococcus sp otari et al 2012 pseudomonas sp and fungi such as verticillium sp priyabrata mukherjee 2001 penicillium fellutanum kathiresan et al 2009 and trichoderma asperellum mukherjee et al 2008 can be used to prepare agnps agnps synthesis in vitro by algae such as chaetomorpha linum kannan et al 2012 caulerpa resmosa kathiraven et al 2014 and ulva armoricana sp massironi et al 2019 has also been reported the carboxyl groups of aspartic acid and or glutamine residues and the hydroxyl groups of protein tyrosine residues in polysaccharides extracted from ulva armoricana sp can also be used to reduce ag to prepare agnps massironi et al 2019 xie et al 2006 however the large scale preparation of agnps by microorganisms is more difficult than other technologies rafique et al 2017 compared with microorganisms there are more abundant studies on the preparation of agnps by using extracts from various parts of plants ahmed et al 2016 the chemical properties of plant extracts showed greater reduction and stabilization mohamad et al 2013 and plant extracts can also be used as both reductants and capping agents ontong et al ontong et al 2019 used senna alata bark extracts to directly reduce ag to obtain agnps and successfully immobilize them on the membrane reducing the use of toxic and harmful reducing agents in the membrane preparation process agnps synthesis from water extract of neem leaves has also been studied and at room temperature the conversion of ag to agnps takes only 15 minutes without the involvement of any dangerous chemicals kannan et al 2012 in addition some studies have successfully prepared agnps using bio based materials such as panchakavya govarthanan et al 2014 coconut water elumalai et al 2014 honey philip 2010 leishmania parasite abdulsadah et al 2013 milk lee et al 2013 protein lu et al 2012 and dung pellets adeeyo and odiyo 2018 the reduction of ag can be achieved by using an eco friendly method such as ultraviolet light instead of the pharmaceutical reduction process ren et al 2016 to enhance the antibacterial effect of agnps the synergistic effect of antibacterial organics and agnps is often adopted and the combination of natural antimicrobial agents and agnps is an effective means of preparing sustainable agnps incorporated membranes chitosan as biological extract can be used as a green coating agent of agnps under certain conditions due to the existence of amino and hydroxyl functional groups kolangare et al 2018 moreover natural extracts such as artemisia argyi oil li et al 2020a da lynge et al 2011 and gallic acid xuan et al 2020 also have certain antibacterial properties which can effectively improve the antibacterial effect of the membrane when combined with agnps the conventional synthesis and modification of agnps using toxic and harmful agents may have high energy consumption in fig 6 most of the membrane substrates are nonbiodegradable the toxicity and risks depend on the environment in which these membranes are used at present the typical polymers for agnps incorporated membranes include pvdf pes psf polyester pet and polyethylene peg zuo et al 2021 which are all difficult to degrade and non renewable the addition of biopolymers in the membrane preparation process can solve these above problems to some extent bandehali et al 2021 cellulose acetate as a derivative of the naturally abundant cellulose has been used as the base material to manufacture porous membranes due to its high selectivity high permeability and simple processing kargarzadeh et al 2018 stefan et al stefan et al 2021 prepared a biodegradable acetate fiber nf membrane based on cellulose acetate and the addition of agnps can increase water flux by three times chitin is a polysaccharide extracted from the shells of marine crustaceans and its chemical structure is very similar to plant cellulose the evenly dispersed chitin nanocrystals can be transformed into nanoporous membranes by a simple vacuum filtration method wang et al 2017b after reaching service life these bio based membranes can be degraded by microorganisms and converted into other resources such as methane hydrogen and sugar simplifying the preparation process of agnps incorporated membrane can support sustainable membrane production kharaghani et al kharaghani et al 2018 addressed the need for antimicrobial activity of nanofiber membranes for biomedical filtration devices by reducing ag in situ under physiological mild conditions through a simple wetting process the prepared ag functionalized pan nanofibers pan agnps have a significant antibacterial effect against e coli and s aureus and can be reused sustainably in summary the sustainable preparation of agnps incorporated membranes can be open a new horizon for modern membrane technology by using bio based materials instead of conventional organic substances using green solvents instead of traditional solvents using animal and plant extracts or ultraviolet light instead of traditional reducing agents and simplifying the preparation process based on this we preliminarily propose a desirable sustainable full life cycle development model for future agnps incorporated membranes fig 7 the use of green natural substances is maximized in the preparation of agnps and membranes technology and management improvements to reduce the chemical and energy consumption during membrane operation and accurate analysis and treatment to achieve the recovery of resources and energy substances however we must take into account some realities to achieve this desirable cycle firstly most of the membranes currently used in engineering applications are non biodegradable materials and thus cannot be recovered by the fermentation direct upgrading of membranes using organic polymers should be considered to achieve membrane regeneration dai et al 2021 secondly it is extremely difficult to achieve complete self cleaning of used membranes given that the light self cleaning has very limited application in practice for the spiral wound and hollow fiber configurations of membranes artificial intelligence control system can be used to design membrane materials for different wastewater to control the usage of chemicals and cleaning efficiency and to monitor the membrane systems in real time to avoid unrecoverable fouling and deactivation of agnps niu et al 2022 finally the environmental impacts of the extraction of green natural materials should be assessed the most immediate issue is the large amount of highly alkaline wastewater produced when cellulose is extracted from plants therefore the toxicity of raw materials should be reduced we have to acknowledge that there is still a long way to go to realize the complete greening of agnps incorporated membranes as prof liu said xie et al 2020 partial substitution could be a relatively easy first step in the substitution of these materials in addition we must also overcome the defects of green materials themselves such as serious aging poor tolerance and mechanical strength in the process of water treatment moreover biodegradation photodegradation and a combination of processes could be considered for the treatment of wasted agnps incorporated membranes to generate usable resources 4 4 addressing the issue of agnps biotoxicity due to the differences in the structures of human and bacterial cells some scholars believe that agnps cannot damage human cells due to a lack of specific structures for binding agnps le ouay and stellacci 2015 however in terms of biological evolution marambio jones and hoek 2010 the respiration of eukaryotes mitochondria and bacterial cells is very similar in term of electron transport atp synthesis and proton power hence it is reasonable to think that agnps could enter human cells and cause damage to the mitochondria studies have shown that agnps could cause lung function attenuation and inflammatory lesions in rats sung et al 2008 stem cell and liver cell leakage and the reduction of mitochondrial function braydich stolle et al 2005 rajeshkumar and malarkodi 2014 moreover agnps could induce human fibrosarcoma and human skin carcinoma to form the oxidative stress response thus causing cell apoptosis at a low dose 50 ppb and necrosis at a high dose 100 ppb arora et al 2008 most importantly a study on human fibroblasts found that agnps have cytotoxic genotoxic and anti proliferation effects tortella et al 2020 as a result the world health organization who has set a limit of 0 5 ppm for agnps in drinking water when agnps incorporated membranes were widely used in water wastewater treatment the agnps on the membrane would enter the environment with the effluent due to the complex component in the water wastewter environment agnps could exhibit a variety of complex forms and toxicity the environmental toxic effects of agnps are mainly related to three processes dissolution aggregation and adsorption jorge de souza et al 2019 research shows that even low concentrations of agnps in water could cause zebrafish to become hyperactive and when ag is in the acidic ph environment its toxicity will be enhanced asmonaite et al 2016 kataoka et al kataoka et al 2018 found that when 0 06 mg l ag was exposed to the solution of ph 4 the hatchability of japanese medaka embryos was reduced to 18 and the eye size was also reduced note that the size of agnps will directly affects their toxicity in the environment in an environment of high ionic strength the increased aggregation of agnps leads to the decrease of the dissolution surface area which reduces the release of ag and thus the toxicity hotze et al 2010 at the same time using green materials i e amphotericin b aqueous extract of isatis tinctoria tannic acid ta and moringa oleifera extract to coating agnps can also reduce their toxicity roy et al 2019 in addition the organics in the environment attached to the surface of agnps can increase the stability prolong their residence time and increase their exposure grillo et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 research also shown that agnps enter the soil with the water flow which could destroy the original microbial community in the soil khodaparast et al 2021 complex minerals and organics in water and soil are likely to combine with agnps and increase toxicity which can impede bioremediation of water and soil typically a large number of agnps in the environment can induce the emergence of silver resistant bacteria reducing the antimicrobial effect duran et al 2016 in summary although most studies claim that the amount of agnps released from modified membranes prepared in the laboratory is much lower than the who limit no studies have assessed the long term impact the specific antibacterial process and mechanisms of agnps should be elucidated to inform the design of agnps incorporated membranes and to establish a suitable detection process in particular selective toxicity and chronic toxicity tests for agnps should be carried out to clarify the toxicity mechanism of agnps in the human body and necessary surface modifications could be further designed to avoid human health risks 4 5 deactivation of agnps incorporated membranes in practical engineering applications complex environments contain harmful substances and lead to the rapid deactivation of agnps incorporated membranes fig 8 some anions such as hs s2 cl or po4 3 in raw water can react with ag to form insoluble precipitations on agnps surface such as ag2s solubility 140 μg l agcl solubility 1 9 mg l and ag3po4 solubility 6 5 mg l and thus passivation layers as such the activity of agnps is strongly decreased and the release of agnps and ag is greatly inhibited sulfides which are widely present in wastewater pose the greatest threat to agnps incorporated membranes because of the lowest solubility of ag2s choi et al 2009 this precipitate will readily consume ag and reduce the antibacterial properties of the membrane in addition s2 forms an extremely insoluble ag2s layer on the surface of agnps which further inhibits the dissolution of agnps and ag levard et al 2013 and thus causes the inactivation of the agnps incorporated membranes in addition biological sludge and dissolved organic matter dom in bioreactors have been shown to adsorb agnps in the wastewater hou et al 2013 hurt 2010 finally the release of agnps and ag is highly dependent on the presence of oxygen that is if the agnps incorporated membranes are in an anaerobic state for a long time the antibacterial effect may be also reduced le ouay and stellacci 2015 given that the passivation layers the absorption of sludge biopolymers and the anerobic anoxic condition greatly decreased the amount of available ag in the agnps incorporated membranes corresponding solutions could be proposed such as surface modification with active substances i e pda cs sbma and aa and regeneration of agnps by chemical cleaning i e citric acid oxalic acid formic acid and acetic acid wang et al 2014a nevertheless it is important to control the use of chemicals during the chemical cleaning process to prevent the loss of agnps within the membrane hence we recommend that certain physical cleaning methods i e air scouring backflushing vibration rotation and ultrasonic could be used to supplement the chemical cleaning process abdel karim et al 2021 wang et al 2014a 5 conclusion and outlook in the past decades agnps have been widely used to prepare polymer and ceramic membranes for water and wastewater treatment to improve the antibacterial antibiofouling photocatalytic photothermal conversion and electro catalytic conductive performance of the membranes here the properties applications and challenges of agnps incorporated membranes for water and wastewater treatment were reviewed the following conclusions were drawn 1 agnps can significantly improve the membrane performance agnps can directly kill microorganisms attached to the membrane with the release of small size agnps and ag meanwhile the hydrophilicity of the agnps incorporated membrane was improved to repel the fouling of the membrane by hydrophobic substances through strong light absorption and electron conversion agnps can widen the bandgap of photocatalytic materials such as tio2 zno g c3n4 and go and improve the photocatalytic effect of the membrane the excellent photothermal conversion effect and catalytic conductive property of agnps can improve the performance of membrane distillation and conductive membranes all these excellent properties endow the wide application of agnps in the composite membranes 2 different synthesis methods influence on the properties of agnps incorporated membranes the distribution of agnps on in situ synthesis membranes could be more uniform than that in ectopic synthesis surface grafting can result in more direct contact between agnps with microorganisms moreover it is important to avoid the blockage of the membrane pores by the agnps during blending meanwhile the agnps fixed in the membrane need to be slowly released to extend the extension of the antibacterial cycle thus the target water quality should be considered for the design of agnps incorporated membranes in terms of the appropriate polymers and auxiliary substances and the appropriate preparation method 3 the combination of agnps with functional materials compounds is an effective and promising way to further improve the properties of agnps incorporated membranes the incompatibility between agnps and membrane materials limits the performance of agnps incorporated membranes the current research breaking through this bottleneck is to combine agnps with other functional substances such as pda chitosan go cnts sio2 mof and cof etc and thus achieve efficient distribution and immobilization of agnps which could enhance the inherent properties of agnps control the release rate of agnps and protect the agnps from interfering substances in addition the hydrophilic materials such as pda go and sio2 could strengthen the attraction of the membrane to water molecules and the repulsion to hydrophobic substances and thus the trade off effect of agnps incorporated membranes could be broken through meanwhile other auxiliary methods like ultrasonic wave radiation light and voltage could be also considered to enhance the flux and antifouling performance of agnps incorporated membranes 4 the sustainable preparation of agnps incorporated membranes can improve their application potential in water and wastewater treatment processes the traditional preparation of agnps and agnps incorporated membranes employed toxic solvents leading to great environment and human health risks animal plant and microorganism extracts can be used in the preparation of agnps and agnps incorporated membranes suitable technical management and artificial intelligent strategies can realize a sustainable life cycle for agnps incorporated membranes in the future including the agnps production and the fabrication application regeneration and recovery of agnps incorporated membranes to achieve closed loop operation 5 the large scale use of agnps incorporated membranes is still restricted due to the release of ag and agnps threatening the human body and the environment the direct use of agnps incorporated membranes in drinking water treatment should be carefully considered the impact of the use of agnps incorporated membranes on the environment should be monitored in a long period and the application of agnps incorporated membrane should be controlled to avoid the health risk we can also start from the intelligent release of agnps depending on the ph temperature oxygen concentration and salt concentration of the

15618,the scaling problem in the water supply pipeline will increase the resistance coefficient of the pipeline and the pressure of the water supply pipeline which will not only affect the operation safety of the water supply pipeline but also cause energy waste the scale in the pipeline will also enrich heavy metal ions and pathogenic microorganisms affecting the safety of water supply water quality and causing secondary pollution of water quality at present a lot of research has been done on the composition structure and crystallization process of the scale the study found that calcite is the main component of the scale the scale process is a heterogeneous nucleation process induced by heavy metal particles and their corrosion products in the pipeline the introduction of electrochemical detection technology density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulation has greatly improved the accuracy and timeliness of water scaling conditions detection and realized the visualization of scaling mechanism in this paper the measurement methods of the scale in the water supply pipeline and the corresponding material composition and crystal structure characteristics are reviewed and the mechanism of the scale and the water quality conditions are summarized at the end of this paper based on summarizing the existing water quality scaling tendency evaluation methods it is proposed to establish a water quality potential scaling risk assessment framework based on puckorius scaling index psi and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water supply pipeline scaling calcite and aragonite type calcium carbonate molecular dynamics theory electrochemical detection and analysis technology water quality stability evaluation index data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction scale is a calcareous deposit formed by precipitation of minerals contained in water consisting mainly of calcium and magnesium belattar et al 2018 yanagisawa 2015 the deposition of foulants can threaten the safety and economic operation of various industrial production and municipal service facilities jordan et al 2016 when scale is attached to the pipe wall free heavy metal ions microorganisms and organic pollutants in the water will accumulate in the scale layer and when water quality or hydraulic conditions of pipeline change pollutants accumulated in scale will be released into water endangering water quality safety of water supply system hanna attisha et al 2015 he et al 2021 li et al 2018 yang et al 2012 it is worth noting that in some cases scales such as calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide adhered to the pipe wall can also inhibit the diffusion of oxygen thus delaying the corrosion of the pipe möller 2007 vasyliev et al 2022 therefore reasonable control of scaling can be achieved by studying scaling formation mechanism to ensure the safety of pipeline water conveyance to the maximum extent most of the descaling technologies currently used are physical and chemical methods however whether it is a physical descaling method such as a high pressure water gun or a chemical descaling method that dissolves acidic substances such as hydrochloric acid and polyacrylic acid tut haklidir and haklidir 2017 large scale mechanical equipment is required and the pipeline is emptied which undoubtedly increases the extra cost in addition the addition of acidic substances will also cause water safety risks alahmad 2010 therefore the safe operation of water supply network can be guaranteed to the greatest extent by accurate prediction and elimination of scaling risk scale in the water supply pipeline will not only affect the stability and economy of water supply but also bring potential secondary pollution risks such as heavy metal dissolution and microbial enrichment based on reviewing the crystal structure and formation mechanism of the scaling substances this paper summarizes the water quality characteristics of the scaling pipelines and the evaluation methods for the scaling tendency of the water quality 2 scaling phenomenon in water supply pipes scaling is common in water supply pipelines and valve equipment li et al 2015 for example a mineral layer mainly composed of calcium salts will form on the surface of a water heat exchanger or a water pump which will reduce the heating efficiency of the equipment increase the surface roughness and water head loss teng et al 2017 and then reduce the heat transfer efficiency water delivery efficiency energy efficiency müller steinhagen et al 2005 2 1 current situation of scaling in water supply pipes pipeline scaling is particularly pronounced when transporting high hardness groundwater or surface water with high carbonate hardness temporary hardness for example the water supply system in southern tunisia takes the groundwater in weak supersaturated state of calcium carbonate as the main water source touati et al 2018a so scaling exists to a certain extent in agadir and other areas the water quality shows strong scaling characteristics belattar et al 2020 which is particularly significant in hot water pipelines and when the water temperature rises in summer this is due to the reduction of the solubility of carbon dioxide resulting in the intensification of calcium carbonate precipitation belattar et al 2018 the presence of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium in water pipelines e g western pennsylvania wells and storage structures e g crude oil reservoirs can accelerate the scaling process of pipelines and lead to corrosion under chloride scale cheng et al 2016 dresel and rose 2010 vasyliev et al 2022 scaling can also be aggravated when pipe materials such as steel or galvanized are used especially when welded joints are present on the pipe li et al 2016 peng et al 2010 at present 56 6 and 53 of water supply pipelines in the united states and poland still use steel materials and even more than 90 in some cities świetlik et al 2012 75 of the water supply pipelines in italy and beijing china are made of cast iron nodular cast iron and steel lu 2015 the precipitation of scales in pipelines can be divided into three main types ① precipitation of single calcium carbonate minerals ② co precipitation of calcium carbonate minerals with heavy metal ions and ③ adhesion and precipitation of calcium carbonate minerals with microorganisms 1 sedimentation of single calcium carbonate minerals minerals such as calcium carbonate precipitated from water adhere directly to the pipe wall and form a stable and dense scale layer in the pipe li et al 2021a as shown in fig 1 a 2 co precipitation of calcium carbonate minerals with metal ions accelerating the precipitation of calcium carbonate and other minerals under the co induction of metals in water and corrosive particulate matter in pipelines and connecting with pipelines through ion gravity hydrogen bond van der waals force and electrostatic exclusion force at this time metal ions will continue to enrich and release in the scale layer li et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 b 3 adhesion and precipitation of calcium carbonate minerals with microorganisms under this action microorganisms can achieve the connection between calcium carbonate minerals microorganisms and pipeline matrix by secreting extracellular polymers which will lead to more particulate matter bonding with pipelines douterelo et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 c 2 2 harm of scaling in water supply pipeline under certain circumstances scale adhered to the pipeline can be used as protective layer for corrosion of the pipeline isolating oxygen transfer and reducing iron oxidation reduction corrosion current cheng et al 2016 however chloride ions can penetrate the scale layer and locally pit corrosion occurs in the lower part of the scale layer which leads to the loose and falling scale layer destroying the integrity of the pipeline and increasing the possibility of corrosion or scale formation on a wider scale mansoori et al 2017 vasyliev et al 2022 as shown in fig 2 when the water quality in the water supply pipeline changes or when the water supply system is restarted after maintenance and shutdown loose corrosion scales in the pipeline will fall off and suspend in the water of the pipeline due to 1 local pitting on the lower part of the scales and 2 accumulation release of iron and manganese in the scales and 3 removal of microorganisms such as iron oxidizing bacteria iob from the scales thus causing red water or yellow water cheng et al 2016 li et al 2010 wang et al 2021 this has happened in many countries brodeur et al 2006 yang et al 2012 and leads to user suspicions about the quality of water supply dijk and van der kooij 2004 vasyliev et al 2022 metal contaminants and heavy metal particles produced by natural corrosion in water supply pipes can also lead to the crystallization and growth of calcium carbonate lin et al 2020 and metal contaminants can also be released from scale zhang et al 2021 depending on the casting process of cast iron pipes scales in the pipes can also detect metallic contaminants such as vanadium v arsenic as lead pb chromium cr and cadmium cd li et al 2016 sun et al 2017 after long distance water transfer the concentration of metal pollutants in scale is several orders of magnitude higher than that at the beginning of the pipe liu et al 2018 vanadium v released from scales can cause functional damage to human liver kidney spleen and skeleton and can cause teratogenic and carcinogenic damage in severe cases wu et al 2018 if drinking water is contaminated with arsenic as it can lead to acute or chronic poisoning with non specific symptoms including fatigue colitis loss of reflex gastritis alopecia and anorexia fatoki and badmus 2022 hall 2002 shaji et al 2021 the release of lead pb leads to the accumulation of lead in the body which affects the nervous system liver kidney and blood circulation especially in children infants and fetuses guo et al 2018 zwolak et al 2019 calcium carbonate sediment in pipeline can provide more attachment sites for legionella and other pathogenic microorganisms so that microorganisms cannot be damaged by water flow and disinfectants thus promoting microbial proliferation in pipeline dirany et al 2016 in the summer of 2012 for example legionella contamination caused by calcium carbonate precipitation in quebec city canada resulted in 180 people being hospitalized and 14 deaths bretin et al 2022 legionella pneumophila is highly susceptible to corrosion scaling products in drinking water and pipes in intermittent copper pipes leading to disease and death from drinking water benedict et al 2017 cassini et al 2019 gonçalves et al 2021 paniagua et al 2020 van der kooij et al 2020 scaling on industrial facilities such as water supply pipeline municipal water supply pipeline heat exchange pipeline and cooling tower will seriously affect the economic safe and stable operation of equipment zhang et al 2018b in the uk and france additional non productive costs of around 600 million uk gabrielli et al 1997 and 1 5 billion france rosset 1992 per year are required due to scaling of water supply pipelines worldwide economic losses due to blockage of pipeline equipment due to pipe fouling can reach hundreds of millions of dollars zhang et al 2018b in summary scaling in water supply pipelines is common and will affect the operation of pipeline network and the economy and safety of water supply quality therefore on the premise of defining the composition characteristics and generating mechanism of scaling the potential pre risk of scaling should be further explored and the scaling phenomenon can be reasonably controlled 3 composition and crystal structure characteristics of scales to solve the problem of scaling in water supply pipeline the composition and crystal characteristics of scaling should be clearly defined at first the main components of scale are calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide minerals li et al 2021 liu and zou 2019 the crystal structure of magnesium hydroxide is relatively single and the common crystal type is brucite calcium carbonate has abundant crystal structure and its common crystalline forms are calcite aragonite and columbite therefore the basic morphology and crystal structure of scale should be defined firstly and on this basis its crystallization nucleation mechanism and growth characteristics can be further explored 3 1 morphological and component characteristics the main crystal structure of calcium carbonate can be divided into calcite and aragonite liu et al 2021 in which aragonite can be converted into calcite which leads to changes in crystal mechanical properties navabzadeh esmaeely et al 2013 therefore the key to solve scale formation on the wall of water supply pipeline is to define the form and mineral composition of scale layer and then analyze the formation process of scale layer and scale inhibiting measures the combination of scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray diffraction xrd can qualitatively determine the surface appearance and crystal structure of crystals and precipitates and the characterization results are shown in fig 3 touati et al 2018b x ray diffraction xrd data indicate that the deposit is aragonite type calcium carbonate at the same time the surface morphology observation by scanning electron microscopy sem further confirmed that the sediments present needle like and cylindrical shape which is consistent with the crystallization of aragonite therefore the mineral composition and crystal structure of the crystal can be determined other studies have shown that corrosion particles of fe2o3 exist in carbon steel pipes at the beginning of service and fe2o3 has strong absorption ability to aragonite leeuw 2002 which results in aragonite type calcium carbonate particles in scaling layer however due to the conversion of aragonite type calcium carbonate to calcite type calcium carbonate there is calcite type calcium carbonate on the outside surface of scaling layer the diagram of deposited solids on the surface of carbon steel pipes is shown in fig 4 3 2 crystal structure characteristics fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir can be used to further verify the crystal structure of calcium carbonate as shown in fig 5 the crystal structure of calcium carbonate will vary greatly under different crystallization conditions 713cm 1 is the common absorption peak of calcite and aragonite while 699cm 1 853cm 1 1082cm 1 and 1492cm 1 are the absorption peak of aragonite and 873cm 1 and 1420cm 1 are the absorption peak of calcite fig 5 b shows that aragonite is the main crystalline when sulfate is present in the reaction system density functional theory dft and molecular dynamics md simulation are commonly used in theoretical research on crystallization ren et al 2020 the molecular dynamics model of calcite is shown in fig 6 where the red atom represents the o atom and the green atom represents the ca atom the initial lattice constant is a b 0 4990 nm and c 1 7061 nm milman et al 2000 calcite type calcium carbonate has two main growth surfaces 1 1 0 and 1 0 4 respectively the surface activity of 1 1 0 is higher and it is easier to combine with cations or scale inhibitors the crystal growth process is obviously better than that of 1 0 4 tang et al 2012 according to the characterization analysis process of pipeline sediments most mineral and material characterization techniques can identify the basic surface appearance and composition of scale in water supply pipelines but at present most analysis techniques can only qualitatively analyze scale molecular dynamics and other model simulations can describe scaling at the micro level so traditional material characterization techniques can be combined with molecular dynamics and molecular models in the future and the basic characteristics of scaling layer can be described more perfectly and accurately and provide theoretical reference for the explanation of formation mechanism 4 formation mechanism of scale the scale formation process can be described as the following four steps 1 soluble ions in water collide with each other and combine to form insoluble or slightly soluble inorganic salt molecules 2 inorganic salt molecules are combined and arranged to form larger microcrystalline particles 3 the microcrystalline particles are adhered continuously again and bond reaction is generated to form larger crystals 4 the crystals adhere to the pipe wall and form different forms of scale ketrane et al 2010 oliveira et al 2012 the growth and crystallization of scale layer is centered on the precipitated and stable solute precipitates in solution so agglomeration of pre nucleated particles is an important step to form stable calcium carbonate particles pouget et al 2009 at the same time there are instantaneous amorphous calcium carbonate acc and long term amorphous calcium carbonate crystals in the scaling process lam et al 2007 in which amorphous calcium carbonate acc occurs after ion collision and binding and before the formation of crystal nucleus kobori and norris 2006 so it can be considered as the starting point of the scaling process at the same time the water flow pattern in the pipeline will control the degree of scaling by affecting the formation of pre nucleated clusters and crystal nuclei waly et al 2012 therefore exploring the nucleation principle of pre nucleation or instantaneous amorphous calcium carbonate is the key to clarify the formation mechanism of scale a large number of literatures have studied the homogeneous nucleation principle of calcium carbonate the main process is the mixing of sodium carbonate and calcium chloride solution and then the reaction to produce calcium carbonate most of the crystallization process of calcium carbonate is heterogeneous nucleation or heterogeneous nucleation principle calcite garnet and other crystal inducing nuclei are added to the dissolution of saturated calcium carbonate to accelerate the precipitation rate of calcium carbonate house and tutton 1982 4 1 homogeneous nucleation principle as shown in fig 6 the previous classical nucleation theory cnt on the nucleation phenomenon of electrolyte solution is based on two key principles ① due to the surface tension on the solid liquid interface there is a free energy barrier for nucleation and the particle size of crystal clusters needs to reach a certain size before they can grow spontaneously under the action of chemical potential driving force ② although the free energy shows an upward trend the inherent energy fluctuation of the crystal cluster system can overcome the free energy barrier and allow the crystallization and nucleation of a single ion or molecule kashchiev 2006 however based on the classical molecular mechanics simulation of the formation of clusters in caco3 supersaturated solution a phenomenon contrary to the classical nucleation theory was found which aroused people s doubts about the classical nucleation theory the experimental results show that the number of pre nucleation clusters contained in the solution is several orders of magnitude more than expected in the classical nucleation theory and 30 75 of calcium ions in the mixed solution exist in the complex gebauer et al 2008 this high degree of complexation reaction reflects the advantages of large pre nucleated clusters demichelis et al 2011 gebauer and cölfen 2011 and the complexation reaction is attributed to the formation of caco3 aq or cahco3 aq plasma pairs plummer and busenberg 1982 in addition it is also considered that the nucleation process of solids in the pre nucleation cluster model is realized by aggregating oligomeric clusters with low free energy barrier or by forming dense but disordered liquid precursors as shown in fig 7 in the classical nucleation theory the high free energy barrier in the thermodynamic energy diagram can realize uniform nucleation fig 8 d which is related to the large surface volume ratio of nano scale nuclei dynamically formed by solute molecules ions lee et al 2016 variation of free energy during homogeneous nucleation δghom can be expressed as 1 δ g h o m 4 π r 2 γ 4 3 π r 3 δ g v where r is the nuclear radius m γ represents the surface energy of the nucleus in supersaturated solution j m2 δgv refers to the residual free energy per unit volume of particles relative to the solute in the solution j m3 and the degree of supersaturation can be used σ express degree of supersaturation σ the description is as follows mullin 2001 2 δ g v k b t σ ν 3 σ ln i a p k s p where kb is the boltzmann constant t is the temperature k ν represents the molecular volume 6 13 10 23cm3 calcite molecule hamm et al 2014 iap represents the ionic activity product of ca2 and co3 2 and ksp represents the solubility product constant in the principle of homogeneous nucleation when the critical radius of atomic nucleus reaches r 2 γ δgv δghom reaches the maximum energy barrier δghom mullin 2001 therefore r represents the size of the smallest stable core nuclei larger than r will continue to grow while particles smaller than r will dissolve δghom can be derived as 4 δ g h o m 16 π γ 3 ν 2 3 k b t σ 2 using specific crystal planes and simulation methods duffy and harding 2004 through the uniform precipitation test the surface energy γ of caco3 and water at 25 was determined to be 83 124mj m2 mullin 2001 söhnel and mullin 1978 through the simulation calculation at 300 k the range of is 140 412 mj m2 since the classical nucleation theory is a simplified model its assumptions γ and δgv is constant relative to the nuclear radius r however in the actual crystallization process it does not completely follow the classical nucleation theory as shown in fig 8e the presence of pre nucleated clusters makes the energy barrier lower than that in the nucleation process δghom and is an important step in the formation of stable size calcium carbonate core sebastiani et al 2017 the collision between precritical nuclei r r also enables them to combine and form stable aggregates with an effective radius greater than r when the collision speed of crystal nucleus is much faster than its dissolution speed this aggregation phenomenon will be more prominent after aggregation the size increases suddenly so that these nuclei pass through high temperature δghom barrier tunnel fig 8f lee et al 2016 4 2 heterogeneous nucleation principle previous research results show that heterogeneous nucleation and scaling can occur on the metal surface in water supply pipeline this is due to the discovery of heavy metals such as copper and nickel in the scale which provide active surfaces for heterogeneous nucleation and scaling processes shams el din et al 2005 dalvi et al added trace heavy metals such as copper chromium and nickel to brine and evaluated the effect of scale inhibitors on scale formation in water the test results show that in the presence of copper and chromium the scale inhibitors based on polyphosphonate and polymaleic acid have a reduced performance while the heterogeneous nucleation in water increases dalvi et al 2000 previous research results also show that the iap of brine in multistage flash reactor may be 120 170 times that of aragonite and calcite ksp el din and mohammed 1994 higher supersaturation σ 4 78 5 14 makes the homogeneous crystallization process impossible so this process is the result of heterogeneous nucleation in the classical nucleation theory the existence of seed can significantly reduce the free energy barrier of calcium carbonate nucleation free energy change in heterogeneous nucleation process δghet is defined as 5 δ g h e t v s δ g v a l s γ l s a s m γ l m γ s m where vs represents the volume of the fixed spherical cover m3 als and asm represent the interface surface area m2 between the liquid and the scale and between the scale and the heterogeneous surface respectively γls γlm and γsm represents the interface energy j m2 between liquid and scale between liquid and heterogeneous surface and between scale and mold respectively through young s equation γls γlm and γsm and contact angle θ relevant 6 γ l m γ s m γ l s c o s θ on a flat heterogeneous surface the scale can be represented by a solid hemispherical substance formed on its surface as shown in fig 7c corresponding δghet can be obtained by geometric transformation 7 δ g h e t δ g h o m g m where the geometric factor g m is defined as a function of m m cosθ 8 g m 1 4 1 m 2 2 m it is worth noting that as shown in fig 7c the geometric factor g m is only applicable to heterogeneous nucleation crystallization on planar heterogeneous surfaces for heterogeneous nucleation crystals on planar heterogeneous surfaces the critical radius is the same as that of homogeneous nucleation crystals r 2γls δgv and the maximum value of the energy barrier δghet is 9 δ g h e t δ g h o m g m according to the classical nucleation theory of crystallization the crystallization process of inorganic minerals starts from the complementary binding process of constituent ions in random collisions which forms small crystal clusters volmer 1939 when the small crystal clusters continue to grow and eventually exceed the critical size they become stable at this time the surface free energy which increases with the surface area can be balanced with the crystal volume which decreases with the formation of the lattice the crystal is the key nucleus of primary nanoparticles which can provide lower gibbs free energy in solution and provide a site for further crystal growth in the field of biology and biomimetics however the formation of calcium carbonate crystals takes place through an instantaneous amorphous precursor phase lee et al 2007 pichon et al 2008 it has also been shown that pre nucleation particles form before the formation of calcium carbonate crystals which can be called prenucleation clusters gebauer et al 2008 freeman colin l and others have established models describing the transition process of calcium carbonate from amorphous precursor phase acc to directed nucleation but the practical role of pre formed nucleation clusters is still unclear freeman et al 2008 if heterogeneous surfaces exist during nucleation and crystallization the gibbs free energy barrier will be further reduced during nucleation which will lead to more caco3 nucleation and more scaling when water flows over the pipe wall 5 water quality conditions for scaling water used as the source of drinking water for urban residents can generally be divided into surface water and groundwater surface water generally refers to rivers lakes and reservoirs formed by surface runoff groundwater generally refers to shallow diving water and deep confined water below the natural surface it is worth mentioning that although sea water is also above the surface it is not considered as surface water source drinking water the water quality characteristics of most surface water sources are that the total hardness total alkalinity and other soluble ions are low and the total dissolved solids can be maintained below 500 mg l the content of carbon containing organic matter ammonia nitrogen bacteria and microorganisms is high codmn and tn can be maintained above 5 mg l in o2 and 1 mg l in n and they are vulnerable to seasonal changes due to weather and other factors ashbolt 2015 nguyen et al 2021 rogawski mcquade et al 2020 wu et al 2019 particular attention is paid to the fact that the temporary hardness carbonate hardness content of surface water in carbonate rock areas is generally high compared with surface water the water quality characteristics of groundwater will not change greatly in a short time and is not susceptible to weather and other factors desbarats et al 2017 but affected by rock types of specific strata especially in limestone and carbonate strata the total hardness sulfate bicarbonate and other soluble ions in groundwater are higher and the total hardness and alkalinity can reach 300 400 mg l in caco3 and 1500 mg l in caco3 bogart et al 2016 increased groundwater production may lead to an increase in dissolved ions such as ca and mg when affected by specific formation rock types de graaf et al 2017 it can be seen that water quality and water chemical characteristics of source water vary greatly from place to place water quality characteristics of source water and treatment process of water treatment plant will directly affect the overall characteristics of water quality and scale degree in water supply pipeline therefore the relationship between scale formation and water chemical characteristics and water quality index should be clarified first among many hydrochemical characteristics and water quality indexes co2 mansoori et al 2017 ca2 and mg2 mansoori et al 2018 alkalinity wang et al 2018 fe chai and navrotsky 1996 water temperature water pressure and ph peña et al 2010 have a great influence on scaling so it is necessary to pay more attention to them in future research 5 1 groundwater source water for hardness removal only according to previous research data some groundwater sources especially underground confined water have high co2 partial pressure and calcium ion content low ph and low water temperature e g new valley governorate egypt abdelhafez et al 2021 when groundwater is extracted and raised to the ground the environmental pressure of water decreases rapidly which leads to the decrease of co2 partial pressure in water at this time with the increase of ph and water temperature the calcium rapidly converts into scales mainly composed of calcium carbonate bahadori and vuthaluru 2010 it can be shown that the scales of calcium carbonate are a function of total soluble solids water temperature ph calcium ion concentration and concentration of bicarbonate ion chilingar et al 2008 gebauer et al 2008 studied the influence of calcium ion concentration and ph on the crystallization of calcium carbonate as shown in fig 9 fig 9a shows that even if the amount of calcium ions added is lower than the saturation limit pre nucleation clusters of calcium ions will occur in the solution thus reducing the concentration of dissolved calcium ions when the critical point of nucleation is reached the concentration of calcium ions drops extremely to saturation state to realize the dynamic equilibrium of calcium carbonate in solution lamer and dinegar 1950 fig 9b shows that with the increase of ph value the degree of crystallization of calcium carbonate gradually increases and the transition critical point from pre nucleated cluster state to stable nucleation state is also gradually advanced it is clear from the above research that calcium ion concentration and ph value have a direct influence on the precipitation of calcium carbonate chen et al 2016 mahasti et al 2017 a the relationship between theoretical addition of calcium ion in solution and actual detection at ph 9 25 the red line represents the amount of calcium ion added and the black line represents the concentration of calcium ions detectable in the solution b effect of ph on the degree of crystallization of calcium carbonate red dotted line indicates complete crystallization of calcium ions in solution 5 2 surface water with hardness turbidity and organic matter to be removed due to the influence of surface runoff and other factors the content of ca mg bicarbonate and other ions related to scale in surface water is low so the scale phenomenon is not obvious yan et al 2022 it is noteworthy that surface water dissolves mixes and exchanges minerals in rocks mainly composed of carbonate rocks e g karst geomorphy cao et al 2020 which leads to the high content of scaling ions such as calcium magnesium and bicarbonate in source water hao et al 2021 as shown in fig 10 circulation complementary mechanism between shallow groundwater and surface water of rivers and lakes is realized through vertical and horizontal passages of karst fissures in hilly and mountainous areas with carbonate rocks as the main rock layer with the intensification of circulating flow the water rock interaction in karst aquifer and polar inhomogeneity of karst medium lead to the increase of ca2 mg2 sr2 and so4 2 concentration in surface water and the increase of total soluble solids content wang et al 2022 according to the water quality research results of shallow groundwater and surface water the calcium magnesium bicarbonate and total soluble solids in exposed karst areas of carbonate rocks are higher than those in buried karst areas and the hydrochemical characteristics are ca mg hco3 peng et al 2022 unlike deep groundwater almost all dissolved ions in shallow groundwater and surface water of rivers and lakes are of temporary hardness carbonate hardness and have relatively high water temperature and ph which makes this part of surface water more liable to scale in pipelines li et al 2021b 6 evaluation method of water quality scaling tendency previous studies on scaling thermodynamics have shown that scaling is an inorganic solid compound formed under local supersaturation in water yuan 2010 the degree of supersaturation in water directly determines the physical and chemical driving force for the formation of initial scale and precipitation from water for the mechanism of scaling process the scaling risk of water can be described and evaluated by saturation ratio index as follows kan and tomson 2012 10 saturation ratio ion activity product solubility product the logarithm of saturation ratio at the bottom of 10 is the saturation index si if the saturation index si is greater than 0 the water tends to scale this method has been used in piping scaling prediction software but this prediction method only considers the influence of ion supersaturation on scaling ignoring the influence of water quality overall hydrochemical characteristics and hydrodynamics etc zhang et al 2015 therefore this paper reviews the commonly used water quality scaling prediction evaluation standards and rapid monitoring methods 6 1 water quality stability evaluation index scaling will occur in the water when the alkalinity and ph value of bicarbonate and carbonate in the water are kept at high levels millette and mavinic 1985 therefore several indices or coefficients for water quality stability evaluation are proposed based on the dissolution balance of calcium carbonate including langelier saturation index lsi langelier 1936 ryznar stability index rsi ryznar 1944 puckorius scaling index psi ravikumar and somashekar 2012 calcium carbonate precipitation potential ccpp merrill 1983 driving force index dfi abrasion index ai and momentary excess me langelier saturation index lsi langelier 1946 is a basic theoretical formula for evaluating water quality stability ryznar stability index rsi and pukorius scale index psi are semi empirical formulas modified by actual engineering application data and alkalinity values such as bicarbonate in water so the evaluation results are more realistic kenny et al 2015 calcium carbonate precipitation potential ccpp can quantitatively determine the amount of calcium carbonate merrill 1983 that needs to be precipitated or dissolved into the water to reach equilibrium state the evaluation indices for judging the tendency of scale formation in water supply pipelines are shown in table 1 it can be seen from the above table that calcium ion concentration total alkalinity ph and other factors are basically included in the calculation expression of each evaluation index table 2 lists the results of water quality investigation of raw water from water plants in typical areas where scale problem exists in china in the last three years the evaluation indices in table 1 are used to verify the calculation it can be seen from table 2 that the content of calcium ion and total alkalinity in the raw water of water plants in typical areas with scaling problems is high and the ph value of water also exceeds 7 50 which belongs to the characteristics of weakly alkaline hydrochemistry the evaluation results of raw water from water plants in typical areas in table 2 are shown in table 3 by using each water quality evaluation index in table 1 and corresponding evaluation rules from table 3 scaling tendency exists in raw water of each water plant and the evaluation results are basically consistent with the actual scaling situation among them hs water plant ts water plant and tz water plant are scaling problems caused by high calcium ion content while lc water plant xc water plant and lm water plant is scaling problems caused by high total alkalinity and ph value the evaluation indexes in table 1 provide the basis for judging the scaling tendency of drinking water but the evaluation indexes are still calculated by theoretical or semi empirical formula so there are still limitations studies have shown that when different evaluation indices are used to evaluate the same water quality it is possible to get completely opposite evaluation results e g there is a deviation between the rsi and psi evaluation results of xc water plant in q city and their actual scale tendency changshan et al 2009 huan et al 2009 kalyani et al 2017 therefore the evaluation results of each index can only provide a relative reference for describing the scaling of water quality not an absolute judgment changshan et al 2009 huan et al 2009 this means that in future research on the one hand the scaling of drinking water should be described after comprehensive consideration of various components on the other hand a more practical evaluation method of water scaling tendency should be established 6 2 electrochemical characteristic method in the previous research on the amount of scale in water two methods are usually used to express the scale quantitatively on the one hand hanging tablets are set in the water and the quality of hanging tablets is measured regularly so as to calculate the generation rate of scale dalas and koutsoukos 1989 on the other hand by simulating the natural conditions of calcium carbonate precipitation when carbon dioxide comes into contact with the solution containing calcium the content of bicarbonate in water gradually decreases cailleau1 et al 1979 the precipitation state of calcium carbonate is determined by measuring the change of ph and the actual scaling amount is determined by measuring the calcium ion concentration in the solution the above methods are time consuming complex and difficult to accurately know the scaling rate and scaling status of water while the electrochemical detection and analysis method can avoid the above problems and evaluate the scaling status of water in a short time haaring et al 2019 ketrane et al 2009 based on the three electrode system the electrochemical detection method uses the electrochemical workstation to determine the electrochemical performance indexes such as open circuit potential ocp polarization curve pc electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis cyclic voltammetry analysis cv cheng et al 2016 gao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the three electrode system includes working electrode pair electrode and reference electrode the working electrode can be sliced by actual water supply pipeline or common water supply pipeline platinum chip or platinum wire electrode commonly used for the electrode and saturated mercury or potassium chloride electrode commonly used for the reference electrode gao et al 2020 ketrane et al 2009 zhili 2020 commonly used pipes for water supply pipeline include ductile iron galvanized stainless steel carbon steel reinforced concrete polyvinyl chloride polyethylene polypropylene etc when water deposits scale in the pipeline the electrochemical performance of the water and pipeline will change zhang et al 2018a these changes can be detected by electrochemical analysis methods to determine the corrosion or scaling of pipelines and their potential mechanisms zhang et al 2020 among many electrochemical indicators ocp pc and eis are common methods for analyzing pipeline corrosion or scaling su et al 2014 the self corrosion current density icorr can be obtained by fitting the pc and the ocp pc and eis can jointly describe the scaling condition of electrolyte on the surface of working electrode 1 open circuit potential ocp on an isolated metal electrode an anode reaction and a cathode reaction are carried out at the same time at equal speed when the two electrode reactions are coupled with each other the electrode potential reaches the same level and does not change with time this potential is called self corrosive potential ecorr or open circuit potential ocp in the corrosion scaling system becerra araneda et al 2022 carrillo et al 2012 jegdić et al 2008 generally the more positive the ocp the easier the water in the water supply pipeline to get electrons and thus scale zhang et al 2020 1 polarization curve pc the phenomenon that the electrode potential deviates from the equilibrium potential when current passes is called polarization in electrochemical system when electrode polarization occurs the negative shift of electrode potential from equilibrium potential is called cathodic polarization and vice versa the polarization curve is the relation between overpotential or electrode potential and current density gao et al 2020 the electrochemical workstation software and various fitting software can automatically fit the polarization curve calculate the tafel slope ba and bc of the anode and cathode segments and obtain the self corrosive current density icorr of metal materials as shown in fig 11 poorqasemi et al 2009 the icorr is proportional to the oxygen flow to the electrode through convection diffusion and inversely to the fouling attachment on the active surface of the working electrode feed water pipe slice when the active surface of the working electrode feed water pipe slice is adhered to by scale the self corrosive current density will decrease gradually and when the surface of the working electrode feed water pipe slice is completely covered by scale icorr will approach zero gabrielli et al 1999 haaring et al 2019 sebastiani et al 2017 1 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis electrochemical impedance technology is to measures the change of voltage or current of electrochemical system with time by controlling the current or voltage of the chemical system and sinusoidal law of small amplitude with time or measures the impedance of the electrochemical system so as to measure the reaction mechanism of the system and analyze the electrochemical parameters fitting the measuring system li et al 2012 the eis can determine the shape of the porous scale i e the cavity under the calcite crystal layer by measuring the impedance of the surface of the working electrode slice of water supply pipe further the resistance and capacitance of scale inhibitor layer at zero current are measured to study the mineral information of scale deposits such as compactness and deposition thickness gabrielli et al 1997 in previous studies eis analysis has been widely used in corrosion research of steel and other materials in industrial industry he et al 2020 hida et al 2019 mishra et al 2020 as shown in fig 12 the working electrodes and electrolytes are respectively set as the materials to be studied and the corrosion characteristics of different materials in different solutions are investigated by eis such as nyquist diagram de motte et al 2020 due to the advantages of high precision detection of pipeline corrosion by eis this method has been widely used in the research of acid corrosion and calcium carbonate scale and iron corrosion of water supply pipelines in recent years kindi et al 2021 osorio celestino et al 2020 rakitin and kichigin 2009 zhang et al 2020 as shown in fig 13 the electrochemical equivalent circuit eec can be fitted by eis which will help to interpret the measured eis data and further visualize the scaling process and mechanism de motte et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the electrochemical analysis method can continuously detect the electrochemical properties of metal pipes so the influence of individual factors on the scale formation process can be determined however the detection time is usually within a few minutes so the continuous in situ inspection of water supply pipeline and its quality cannot be realized for many years thus the long term and complete process of scale formation in pipeline cannot be reflected dehghani et al 2020 sanaei et al 2017 7 conclusion and prospect water quality potential scaling risk assessment framework because drinking water contains a certain amount of calcium magnesium ions and bicarbonate ions when the external environment changes bicarbonate is easy to be transformed into carbonate and then reacts with calcium ions to form calcium carbonate scale which is mineral scale in the general sense the generation of scale will lead to a lot of energy waste and economic cost loss which will threaten personal health and safety in serious cases this paper reviews the basic morphological structure and formation mechanism of scale layer in water supply pipeline and summarizes the relationship between water quality and the formation of scale as well as the evaluation methods of water quality scaling tendency 1 describe the structure and molecular characteristics of scale with calcite and aragonite as the main components by means of traditional material characterization technology and molecular dynamics model 2 the formation mechanism of scale can be divided into homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation but their essence is the crossing of gibbs free energy barrier in the crystallization process of calcium carbonate 3 electrochemical analysis method can quickly and accurately analyze the scaling process of scaling substances and improve the shortcomings of previous experimental research 4 due to the close relationship between water quality and the formation of scale the influence of water quality on the scaling process is discussed the results show that calcium magnesium ion bicarbonate alkalinity ion and ph value in water have a great influence on the formation of scale the combination of psi and eis can detect the scaling tendency and potential scaling risk more accurately and quickly than single water quality index detection and calculation of scaling tendency evaluation index therefore future research should be more combined with electrochemical analysis methods to reveal the direct relationship between different pipes and water quality at the same time new means such as density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulation can be used to visualize the formation process of pipeline scale layer this will help to provide a more comprehensive and accurate scaling distribution map in the actual water supply pipeline at the same time it can also provide important information about scaling control and ensure the quality and safety of drinking water supply declaration of competing interest the

15618,the scaling problem in the water supply pipeline will increase the resistance coefficient of the pipeline and the pressure of the water supply pipeline which will not only affect the operation safety of the water supply pipeline but also cause energy waste the scale in the pipeline will also enrich heavy metal ions and pathogenic microorganisms affecting the safety of water supply water quality and causing secondary pollution of water quality at present a lot of research has been done on the composition structure and crystallization process of the scale the study found that calcite is the main component of the scale the scale process is a heterogeneous nucleation process induced by heavy metal particles and their corrosion products in the pipeline the introduction of electrochemical detection technology density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulation has greatly improved the accuracy and timeliness of water scaling conditions detection and realized the visualization of scaling mechanism in this paper the measurement methods of the scale in the water supply pipeline and the corresponding material composition and crystal structure characteristics are reviewed and the mechanism of the scale and the water quality conditions are summarized at the end of this paper based on summarizing the existing water quality scaling tendency evaluation methods it is proposed to establish a water quality potential scaling risk assessment framework based on puckorius scaling index psi and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water supply pipeline scaling calcite and aragonite type calcium carbonate molecular dynamics theory electrochemical detection and analysis technology water quality stability evaluation index data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction scale is a calcareous deposit formed by precipitation of minerals contained in water consisting mainly of calcium and magnesium belattar et al 2018 yanagisawa 2015 the deposition of foulants can threaten the safety and economic operation of various industrial production and municipal service facilities jordan et al 2016 when scale is attached to the pipe wall free heavy metal ions microorganisms and organic pollutants in the water will accumulate in the scale layer and when water quality or hydraulic conditions of pipeline change pollutants accumulated in scale will be released into water endangering water quality safety of water supply system hanna attisha et al 2015 he et al 2021 li et al 2018 yang et al 2012 it is worth noting that in some cases scales such as calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide adhered to the pipe wall can also inhibit the diffusion of oxygen thus delaying the corrosion of the pipe möller 2007 vasyliev et al 2022 therefore reasonable control of scaling can be achieved by studying scaling formation mechanism to ensure the safety of pipeline water conveyance to the maximum extent most of the descaling technologies currently used are physical and chemical methods however whether it is a physical descaling method such as a high pressure water gun or a chemical descaling method that dissolves acidic substances such as hydrochloric acid and polyacrylic acid tut haklidir and haklidir 2017 large scale mechanical equipment is required and the pipeline is emptied which undoubtedly increases the extra cost in addition the addition of acidic substances will also cause water safety risks alahmad 2010 therefore the safe operation of water supply network can be guaranteed to the greatest extent by accurate prediction and elimination of scaling risk scale in the water supply pipeline will not only affect the stability and economy of water supply but also bring potential secondary pollution risks such as heavy metal dissolution and microbial enrichment based on reviewing the crystal structure and formation mechanism of the scaling substances this paper summarizes the water quality characteristics of the scaling pipelines and the evaluation methods for the scaling tendency of the water quality 2 scaling phenomenon in water supply pipes scaling is common in water supply pipelines and valve equipment li et al 2015 for example a mineral layer mainly composed of calcium salts will form on the surface of a water heat exchanger or a water pump which will reduce the heating efficiency of the equipment increase the surface roughness and water head loss teng et al 2017 and then reduce the heat transfer efficiency water delivery efficiency energy efficiency müller steinhagen et al 2005 2 1 current situation of scaling in water supply pipes pipeline scaling is particularly pronounced when transporting high hardness groundwater or surface water with high carbonate hardness temporary hardness for example the water supply system in southern tunisia takes the groundwater in weak supersaturated state of calcium carbonate as the main water source touati et al 2018a so scaling exists to a certain extent in agadir and other areas the water quality shows strong scaling characteristics belattar et al 2020 which is particularly significant in hot water pipelines and when the water temperature rises in summer this is due to the reduction of the solubility of carbon dioxide resulting in the intensification of calcium carbonate precipitation belattar et al 2018 the presence of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium in water pipelines e g western pennsylvania wells and storage structures e g crude oil reservoirs can accelerate the scaling process of pipelines and lead to corrosion under chloride scale cheng et al 2016 dresel and rose 2010 vasyliev et al 2022 scaling can also be aggravated when pipe materials such as steel or galvanized are used especially when welded joints are present on the pipe li et al 2016 peng et al 2010 at present 56 6 and 53 of water supply pipelines in the united states and poland still use steel materials and even more than 90 in some cities świetlik et al 2012 75 of the water supply pipelines in italy and beijing china are made of cast iron nodular cast iron and steel lu 2015 the precipitation of scales in pipelines can be divided into three main types ① precipitation of single calcium carbonate minerals ② co precipitation of calcium carbonate minerals with heavy metal ions and ③ adhesion and precipitation of calcium carbonate minerals with microorganisms 1 sedimentation of single calcium carbonate minerals minerals such as calcium carbonate precipitated from water adhere directly to the pipe wall and form a stable and dense scale layer in the pipe li et al 2021a as shown in fig 1 a 2 co precipitation of calcium carbonate minerals with metal ions accelerating the precipitation of calcium carbonate and other minerals under the co induction of metals in water and corrosive particulate matter in pipelines and connecting with pipelines through ion gravity hydrogen bond van der waals force and electrostatic exclusion force at this time metal ions will continue to enrich and release in the scale layer li et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 b 3 adhesion and precipitation of calcium carbonate minerals with microorganisms under this action microorganisms can achieve the connection between calcium carbonate minerals microorganisms and pipeline matrix by secreting extracellular polymers which will lead to more particulate matter bonding with pipelines douterelo et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 c 2 2 harm of scaling in water supply pipeline under certain circumstances scale adhered to the pipeline can be used as protective layer for corrosion of the pipeline isolating oxygen transfer and reducing iron oxidation reduction corrosion current cheng et al 2016 however chloride ions can penetrate the scale layer and locally pit corrosion occurs in the lower part of the scale layer which leads to the loose and falling scale layer destroying the integrity of the pipeline and increasing the possibility of corrosion or scale formation on a wider scale mansoori et al 2017 vasyliev et al 2022 as shown in fig 2 when the water quality in the water supply pipeline changes or when the water supply system is restarted after maintenance and shutdown loose corrosion scales in the pipeline will fall off and suspend in the water of the pipeline due to 1 local pitting on the lower part of the scales and 2 accumulation release of iron and manganese in the scales and 3 removal of microorganisms such as iron oxidizing bacteria iob from the scales thus causing red water or yellow water cheng et al 2016 li et al 2010 wang et al 2021 this has happened in many countries brodeur et al 2006 yang et al 2012 and leads to user suspicions about the quality of water supply dijk and van der kooij 2004 vasyliev et al 2022 metal contaminants and heavy metal particles produced by natural corrosion in water supply pipes can also lead to the crystallization and growth of calcium carbonate lin et al 2020 and metal contaminants can also be released from scale zhang et al 2021 depending on the casting process of cast iron pipes scales in the pipes can also detect metallic contaminants such as vanadium v arsenic as lead pb chromium cr and cadmium cd li et al 2016 sun et al 2017 after long distance water transfer the concentration of metal pollutants in scale is several orders of magnitude higher than that at the beginning of the pipe liu et al 2018 vanadium v released from scales can cause functional damage to human liver kidney spleen and skeleton and can cause teratogenic and carcinogenic damage in severe cases wu et al 2018 if drinking water is contaminated with arsenic as it can lead to acute or chronic poisoning with non specific symptoms including fatigue colitis loss of reflex gastritis alopecia and anorexia fatoki and badmus 2022 hall 2002 shaji et al 2021 the release of lead pb leads to the accumulation of lead in the body which affects the nervous system liver kidney and blood circulation especially in children infants and fetuses guo et al 2018 zwolak et al 2019 calcium carbonate sediment in pipeline can provide more attachment sites for legionella and other pathogenic microorganisms so that microorganisms cannot be damaged by water flow and disinfectants thus promoting microbial proliferation in pipeline dirany et al 2016 in the summer of 2012 for example legionella contamination caused by calcium carbonate precipitation in quebec city canada resulted in 180 people being hospitalized and 14 deaths bretin et al 2022 legionella pneumophila is highly susceptible to corrosion scaling products in drinking water and pipes in intermittent copper pipes leading to disease and death from drinking water benedict et al 2017 cassini et al 2019 gonçalves et al 2021 paniagua et al 2020 van der kooij et al 2020 scaling on industrial facilities such as water supply pipeline municipal water supply pipeline heat exchange pipeline and cooling tower will seriously affect the economic safe and stable operation of equipment zhang et al 2018b in the uk and france additional non productive costs of around 600 million uk gabrielli et al 1997 and 1 5 billion france rosset 1992 per year are required due to scaling of water supply pipelines worldwide economic losses due to blockage of pipeline equipment due to pipe fouling can reach hundreds of millions of dollars zhang et al 2018b in summary scaling in water supply pipelines is common and will affect the operation of pipeline network and the economy and safety of water supply quality therefore on the premise of defining the composition characteristics and generating mechanism of scaling the potential pre risk of scaling should be further explored and the scaling phenomenon can be reasonably controlled 3 composition and crystal structure characteristics of scales to solve the problem of scaling in water supply pipeline the composition and crystal characteristics of scaling should be clearly defined at first the main components of scale are calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide minerals li et al 2021 liu and zou 2019 the crystal structure of magnesium hydroxide is relatively single and the common crystal type is brucite calcium carbonate has abundant crystal structure and its common crystalline forms are calcite aragonite and columbite therefore the basic morphology and crystal structure of scale should be defined firstly and on this basis its crystallization nucleation mechanism and growth characteristics can be further explored 3 1 morphological and component characteristics the main crystal structure of calcium carbonate can be divided into calcite and aragonite liu et al 2021 in which aragonite can be converted into calcite which leads to changes in crystal mechanical properties navabzadeh esmaeely et al 2013 therefore the key to solve scale formation on the wall of water supply pipeline is to define the form and mineral composition of scale layer and then analyze the formation process of scale layer and scale inhibiting measures the combination of scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray diffraction xrd can qualitatively determine the surface appearance and crystal structure of crystals and precipitates and the characterization results are shown in fig 3 touati et al 2018b x ray diffraction xrd data indicate that the deposit is aragonite type calcium carbonate at the same time the surface morphology observation by scanning electron microscopy sem further confirmed that the sediments present needle like and cylindrical shape which is consistent with the crystallization of aragonite therefore the mineral composition and crystal structure of the crystal can be determined other studies have shown that corrosion particles of fe2o3 exist in carbon steel pipes at the beginning of service and fe2o3 has strong absorption ability to aragonite leeuw 2002 which results in aragonite type calcium carbonate particles in scaling layer however due to the conversion of aragonite type calcium carbonate to calcite type calcium carbonate there is calcite type calcium carbonate on the outside surface of scaling layer the diagram of deposited solids on the surface of carbon steel pipes is shown in fig 4 3 2 crystal structure characteristics fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir can be used to further verify the crystal structure of calcium carbonate as shown in fig 5 the crystal structure of calcium carbonate will vary greatly under different crystallization conditions 713cm 1 is the common absorption peak of calcite and aragonite while 699cm 1 853cm 1 1082cm 1 and 1492cm 1 are the absorption peak of aragonite and 873cm 1 and 1420cm 1 are the absorption peak of calcite fig 5 b shows that aragonite is the main crystalline when sulfate is present in the reaction system density functional theory dft and molecular dynamics md simulation are commonly used in theoretical research on crystallization ren et al 2020 the molecular dynamics model of calcite is shown in fig 6 where the red atom represents the o atom and the green atom represents the ca atom the initial lattice constant is a b 0 4990 nm and c 1 7061 nm milman et al 2000 calcite type calcium carbonate has two main growth surfaces 1 1 0 and 1 0 4 respectively the surface activity of 1 1 0 is higher and it is easier to combine with cations or scale inhibitors the crystal growth process is obviously better than that of 1 0 4 tang et al 2012 according to the characterization analysis process of pipeline sediments most mineral and material characterization techniques can identify the basic surface appearance and composition of scale in water supply pipelines but at present most analysis techniques can only qualitatively analyze scale molecular dynamics and other model simulations can describe scaling at the micro level so traditional material characterization techniques can be combined with molecular dynamics and molecular models in the future and the basic characteristics of scaling layer can be described more perfectly and accurately and provide theoretical reference for the explanation of formation mechanism 4 formation mechanism of scale the scale formation process can be described as the following four steps 1 soluble ions in water collide with each other and combine to form insoluble or slightly soluble inorganic salt molecules 2 inorganic salt molecules are combined and arranged to form larger microcrystalline particles 3 the microcrystalline particles are adhered continuously again and bond reaction is generated to form larger crystals 4 the crystals adhere to the pipe wall and form different forms of scale ketrane et al 2010 oliveira et al 2012 the growth and crystallization of scale layer is centered on the precipitated and stable solute precipitates in solution so agglomeration of pre nucleated particles is an important step to form stable calcium carbonate particles pouget et al 2009 at the same time there are instantaneous amorphous calcium carbonate acc and long term amorphous calcium carbonate crystals in the scaling process lam et al 2007 in which amorphous calcium carbonate acc occurs after ion collision and binding and before the formation of crystal nucleus kobori and norris 2006 so it can be considered as the starting point of the scaling process at the same time the water flow pattern in the pipeline will control the degree of scaling by affecting the formation of pre nucleated clusters and crystal nuclei waly et al 2012 therefore exploring the nucleation principle of pre nucleation or instantaneous amorphous calcium carbonate is the key to clarify the formation mechanism of scale a large number of literatures have studied the homogeneous nucleation principle of calcium carbonate the main process is the mixing of sodium carbonate and calcium chloride solution and then the reaction to produce calcium carbonate most of the crystallization process of calcium carbonate is heterogeneous nucleation or heterogeneous nucleation principle calcite garnet and other crystal inducing nuclei are added to the dissolution of saturated calcium carbonate to accelerate the precipitation rate of calcium carbonate house and tutton 1982 4 1 homogeneous nucleation principle as shown in fig 6 the previous classical nucleation theory cnt on the nucleation phenomenon of electrolyte solution is based on two key principles ① due to the surface tension on the solid liquid interface there is a free energy barrier for nucleation and the particle size of crystal clusters needs to reach a certain size before they can grow spontaneously under the action of chemical potential driving force ② although the free energy shows an upward trend the inherent energy fluctuation of the crystal cluster system can overcome the free energy barrier and allow the crystallization and nucleation of a single ion or molecule kashchiev 2006 however based on the classical molecular mechanics simulation of the formation of clusters in caco3 supersaturated solution a phenomenon contrary to the classical nucleation theory was found which aroused people s doubts about the classical nucleation theory the experimental results show that the number of pre nucleation clusters contained in the solution is several orders of magnitude more than expected in the classical nucleation theory and 30 75 of calcium ions in the mixed solution exist in the complex gebauer et al 2008 this high degree of complexation reaction reflects the advantages of large pre nucleated clusters demichelis et al 2011 gebauer and cölfen 2011 and the complexation reaction is attributed to the formation of caco3 aq or cahco3 aq plasma pairs plummer and busenberg 1982 in addition it is also considered that the nucleation process of solids in the pre nucleation cluster model is realized by aggregating oligomeric clusters with low free energy barrier or by forming dense but disordered liquid precursors as shown in fig 7 in the classical nucleation theory the high free energy barrier in the thermodynamic energy diagram can realize uniform nucleation fig 8 d which is related to the large surface volume ratio of nano scale nuclei dynamically formed by solute molecules ions lee et al 2016 variation of free energy during homogeneous nucleation δghom can be expressed as 1 δ g h o m 4 π r 2 γ 4 3 π r 3 δ g v where r is the nuclear radius m γ represents the surface energy of the nucleus in supersaturated solution j m2 δgv refers to the residual free energy per unit volume of particles relative to the solute in the solution j m3 and the degree of supersaturation can be used σ express degree of supersaturation σ the description is as follows mullin 2001 2 δ g v k b t σ ν 3 σ ln i a p k s p where kb is the boltzmann constant t is the temperature k ν represents the molecular volume 6 13 10 23cm3 calcite molecule hamm et al 2014 iap represents the ionic activity product of ca2 and co3 2 and ksp represents the solubility product constant in the principle of homogeneous nucleation when the critical radius of atomic nucleus reaches r 2 γ δgv δghom reaches the maximum energy barrier δghom mullin 2001 therefore r represents the size of the smallest stable core nuclei larger than r will continue to grow while particles smaller than r will dissolve δghom can be derived as 4 δ g h o m 16 π γ 3 ν 2 3 k b t σ 2 using specific crystal planes and simulation methods duffy and harding 2004 through the uniform precipitation test the surface energy γ of caco3 and water at 25 was determined to be 83 124mj m2 mullin 2001 söhnel and mullin 1978 through the simulation calculation at 300 k the range of is 140 412 mj m2 since the classical nucleation theory is a simplified model its assumptions γ and δgv is constant relative to the nuclear radius r however in the actual crystallization process it does not completely follow the classical nucleation theory as shown in fig 8e the presence of pre nucleated clusters makes the energy barrier lower than that in the nucleation process δghom and is an important step in the formation of stable size calcium carbonate core sebastiani et al 2017 the collision between precritical nuclei r r also enables them to combine and form stable aggregates with an effective radius greater than r when the collision speed of crystal nucleus is much faster than its dissolution speed this aggregation phenomenon will be more prominent after aggregation the size increases suddenly so that these nuclei pass through high temperature δghom barrier tunnel fig 8f lee et al 2016 4 2 heterogeneous nucleation principle previous research results show that heterogeneous nucleation and scaling can occur on the metal surface in water supply pipeline this is due to the discovery of heavy metals such as copper and nickel in the scale which provide active surfaces for heterogeneous nucleation and scaling processes shams el din et al 2005 dalvi et al added trace heavy metals such as copper chromium and nickel to brine and evaluated the effect of scale inhibitors on scale formation in water the test results show that in the presence of copper and chromium the scale inhibitors based on polyphosphonate and polymaleic acid have a reduced performance while the heterogeneous nucleation in water increases dalvi et al 2000 previous research results also show that the iap of brine in multistage flash reactor may be 120 170 times that of aragonite and calcite ksp el din and mohammed 1994 higher supersaturation σ 4 78 5 14 makes the homogeneous crystallization process impossible so this process is the result of heterogeneous nucleation in the classical nucleation theory the existence of seed can significantly reduce the free energy barrier of calcium carbonate nucleation free energy change in heterogeneous nucleation process δghet is defined as 5 δ g h e t v s δ g v a l s γ l s a s m γ l m γ s m where vs represents the volume of the fixed spherical cover m3 als and asm represent the interface surface area m2 between the liquid and the scale and between the scale and the heterogeneous surface respectively γls γlm and γsm represents the interface energy j m2 between liquid and scale between liquid and heterogeneous surface and between scale and mold respectively through young s equation γls γlm and γsm and contact angle θ relevant 6 γ l m γ s m γ l s c o s θ on a flat heterogeneous surface the scale can be represented by a solid hemispherical substance formed on its surface as shown in fig 7c corresponding δghet can be obtained by geometric transformation 7 δ g h e t δ g h o m g m where the geometric factor g m is defined as a function of m m cosθ 8 g m 1 4 1 m 2 2 m it is worth noting that as shown in fig 7c the geometric factor g m is only applicable to heterogeneous nucleation crystallization on planar heterogeneous surfaces for heterogeneous nucleation crystals on planar heterogeneous surfaces the critical radius is the same as that of homogeneous nucleation crystals r 2γls δgv and the maximum value of the energy barrier δghet is 9 δ g h e t δ g h o m g m according to the classical nucleation theory of crystallization the crystallization process of inorganic minerals starts from the complementary binding process of constituent ions in random collisions which forms small crystal clusters volmer 1939 when the small crystal clusters continue to grow and eventually exceed the critical size they become stable at this time the surface free energy which increases with the surface area can be balanced with the crystal volume which decreases with the formation of the lattice the crystal is the key nucleus of primary nanoparticles which can provide lower gibbs free energy in solution and provide a site for further crystal growth in the field of biology and biomimetics however the formation of calcium carbonate crystals takes place through an instantaneous amorphous precursor phase lee et al 2007 pichon et al 2008 it has also been shown that pre nucleation particles form before the formation of calcium carbonate crystals which can be called prenucleation clusters gebauer et al 2008 freeman colin l and others have established models describing the transition process of calcium carbonate from amorphous precursor phase acc to directed nucleation but the practical role of pre formed nucleation clusters is still unclear freeman et al 2008 if heterogeneous surfaces exist during nucleation and crystallization the gibbs free energy barrier will be further reduced during nucleation which will lead to more caco3 nucleation and more scaling when water flows over the pipe wall 5 water quality conditions for scaling water used as the source of drinking water for urban residents can generally be divided into surface water and groundwater surface water generally refers to rivers lakes and reservoirs formed by surface runoff groundwater generally refers to shallow diving water and deep confined water below the natural surface it is worth mentioning that although sea water is also above the surface it is not considered as surface water source drinking water the water quality characteristics of most surface water sources are that the total hardness total alkalinity and other soluble ions are low and the total dissolved solids can be maintained below 500 mg l the content of carbon containing organic matter ammonia nitrogen bacteria and microorganisms is high codmn and tn can be maintained above 5 mg l in o2 and 1 mg l in n and they are vulnerable to seasonal changes due to weather and other factors ashbolt 2015 nguyen et al 2021 rogawski mcquade et al 2020 wu et al 2019 particular attention is paid to the fact that the temporary hardness carbonate hardness content of surface water in carbonate rock areas is generally high compared with surface water the water quality characteristics of groundwater will not change greatly in a short time and is not susceptible to weather and other factors desbarats et al 2017 but affected by rock types of specific strata especially in limestone and carbonate strata the total hardness sulfate bicarbonate and other soluble ions in groundwater are higher and the total hardness and alkalinity can reach 300 400 mg l in caco3 and 1500 mg l in caco3 bogart et al 2016 increased groundwater production may lead to an increase in dissolved ions such as ca and mg when affected by specific formation rock types de graaf et al 2017 it can be seen that water quality and water chemical characteristics of source water vary greatly from place to place water quality characteristics of source water and treatment process of water treatment plant will directly affect the overall characteristics of water quality and scale degree in water supply pipeline therefore the relationship between scale formation and water chemical characteristics and water quality index should be clarified first among many hydrochemical characteristics and water quality indexes co2 mansoori et al 2017 ca2 and mg2 mansoori et al 2018 alkalinity wang et al 2018 fe chai and navrotsky 1996 water temperature water pressure and ph peña et al 2010 have a great influence on scaling so it is necessary to pay more attention to them in future research 5 1 groundwater source water for hardness removal only according to previous research data some groundwater sources especially underground confined water have high co2 partial pressure and calcium ion content low ph and low water temperature e g new valley governorate egypt abdelhafez et al 2021 when groundwater is extracted and raised to the ground the environmental pressure of water decreases rapidly which leads to the decrease of co2 partial pressure in water at this time with the increase of ph and water temperature the calcium rapidly converts into scales mainly composed of calcium carbonate bahadori and vuthaluru 2010 it can be shown that the scales of calcium carbonate are a function of total soluble solids water temperature ph calcium ion concentration and concentration of bicarbonate ion chilingar et al 2008 gebauer et al 2008 studied the influence of calcium ion concentration and ph on the crystallization of calcium carbonate as shown in fig 9 fig 9a shows that even if the amount of calcium ions added is lower than the saturation limit pre nucleation clusters of calcium ions will occur in the solution thus reducing the concentration of dissolved calcium ions when the critical point of nucleation is reached the concentration of calcium ions drops extremely to saturation state to realize the dynamic equilibrium of calcium carbonate in solution lamer and dinegar 1950 fig 9b shows that with the increase of ph value the degree of crystallization of calcium carbonate gradually increases and the transition critical point from pre nucleated cluster state to stable nucleation state is also gradually advanced it is clear from the above research that calcium ion concentration and ph value have a direct influence on the precipitation of calcium carbonate chen et al 2016 mahasti et al 2017 a the relationship between theoretical addition of calcium ion in solution and actual detection at ph 9 25 the red line represents the amount of calcium ion added and the black line represents the concentration of calcium ions detectable in the solution b effect of ph on the degree of crystallization of calcium carbonate red dotted line indicates complete crystallization of calcium ions in solution 5 2 surface water with hardness turbidity and organic matter to be removed due to the influence of surface runoff and other factors the content of ca mg bicarbonate and other ions related to scale in surface water is low so the scale phenomenon is not obvious yan et al 2022 it is noteworthy that surface water dissolves mixes and exchanges minerals in rocks mainly composed of carbonate rocks e g karst geomorphy cao et al 2020 which leads to the high content of scaling ions such as calcium magnesium and bicarbonate in source water hao et al 2021 as shown in fig 10 circulation complementary mechanism between shallow groundwater and surface water of rivers and lakes is realized through vertical and horizontal passages of karst fissures in hilly and mountainous areas with carbonate rocks as the main rock layer with the intensification of circulating flow the water rock interaction in karst aquifer and polar inhomogeneity of karst medium lead to the increase of ca2 mg2 sr2 and so4 2 concentration in surface water and the increase of total soluble solids content wang et al 2022 according to the water quality research results of shallow groundwater and surface water the calcium magnesium bicarbonate and total soluble solids in exposed karst areas of carbonate rocks are higher than those in buried karst areas and the hydrochemical characteristics are ca mg hco3 peng et al 2022 unlike deep groundwater almost all dissolved ions in shallow groundwater and surface water of rivers and lakes are of temporary hardness carbonate hardness and have relatively high water temperature and ph which makes this part of surface water more liable to scale in pipelines li et al 2021b 6 evaluation method of water quality scaling tendency previous studies on scaling thermodynamics have shown that scaling is an inorganic solid compound formed under local supersaturation in water yuan 2010 the degree of supersaturation in water directly determines the physical and chemical driving force for the formation of initial scale and precipitation from water for the mechanism of scaling process the scaling risk of water can be described and evaluated by saturation ratio index as follows kan and tomson 2012 10 saturation ratio ion activity product solubility product the logarithm of saturation ratio at the bottom of 10 is the saturation index si if the saturation index si is greater than 0 the water tends to scale this method has been used in piping scaling prediction software but this prediction method only considers the influence of ion supersaturation on scaling ignoring the influence of water quality overall hydrochemical characteristics and hydrodynamics etc zhang et al 2015 therefore this paper reviews the commonly used water quality scaling prediction evaluation standards and rapid monitoring methods 6 1 water quality stability evaluation index scaling will occur in the water when the alkalinity and ph value of bicarbonate and carbonate in the water are kept at high levels millette and mavinic 1985 therefore several indices or coefficients for water quality stability evaluation are proposed based on the dissolution balance of calcium carbonate including langelier saturation index lsi langelier 1936 ryznar stability index rsi ryznar 1944 puckorius scaling index psi ravikumar and somashekar 2012 calcium carbonate precipitation potential ccpp merrill 1983 driving force index dfi abrasion index ai and momentary excess me langelier saturation index lsi langelier 1946 is a basic theoretical formula for evaluating water quality stability ryznar stability index rsi and pukorius scale index psi are semi empirical formulas modified by actual engineering application data and alkalinity values such as bicarbonate in water so the evaluation results are more realistic kenny et al 2015 calcium carbonate precipitation potential ccpp can quantitatively determine the amount of calcium carbonate merrill 1983 that needs to be precipitated or dissolved into the water to reach equilibrium state the evaluation indices for judging the tendency of scale formation in water supply pipelines are shown in table 1 it can be seen from the above table that calcium ion concentration total alkalinity ph and other factors are basically included in the calculation expression of each evaluation index table 2 lists the results of water quality investigation of raw water from water plants in typical areas where scale problem exists in china in the last three years the evaluation indices in table 1 are used to verify the calculation it can be seen from table 2 that the content of calcium ion and total alkalinity in the raw water of water plants in typical areas with scaling problems is high and the ph value of water also exceeds 7 50 which belongs to the characteristics of weakly alkaline hydrochemistry the evaluation results of raw water from water plants in typical areas in table 2 are shown in table 3 by using each water quality evaluation index in table 1 and corresponding evaluation rules from table 3 scaling tendency exists in raw water of each water plant and the evaluation results are basically consistent with the actual scaling situation among them hs water plant ts water plant and tz water plant are scaling problems caused by high calcium ion content while lc water plant xc water plant and lm water plant is scaling problems caused by high total alkalinity and ph value the evaluation indexes in table 1 provide the basis for judging the scaling tendency of drinking water but the evaluation indexes are still calculated by theoretical or semi empirical formula so there are still limitations studies have shown that when different evaluation indices are used to evaluate the same water quality it is possible to get completely opposite evaluation results e g there is a deviation between the rsi and psi evaluation results of xc water plant in q city and their actual scale tendency changshan et al 2009 huan et al 2009 kalyani et al 2017 therefore the evaluation results of each index can only provide a relative reference for describing the scaling of water quality not an absolute judgment changshan et al 2009 huan et al 2009 this means that in future research on the one hand the scaling of drinking water should be described after comprehensive consideration of various components on the other hand a more practical evaluation method of water scaling tendency should be established 6 2 electrochemical characteristic method in the previous research on the amount of scale in water two methods are usually used to express the scale quantitatively on the one hand hanging tablets are set in the water and the quality of hanging tablets is measured regularly so as to calculate the generation rate of scale dalas and koutsoukos 1989 on the other hand by simulating the natural conditions of calcium carbonate precipitation when carbon dioxide comes into contact with the solution containing calcium the content of bicarbonate in water gradually decreases cailleau1 et al 1979 the precipitation state of calcium carbonate is determined by measuring the change of ph and the actual scaling amount is determined by measuring the calcium ion concentration in the solution the above methods are time consuming complex and difficult to accurately know the scaling rate and scaling status of water while the electrochemical detection and analysis method can avoid the above problems and evaluate the scaling status of water in a short time haaring et al 2019 ketrane et al 2009 based on the three electrode system the electrochemical detection method uses the electrochemical workstation to determine the electrochemical performance indexes such as open circuit potential ocp polarization curve pc electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis cyclic voltammetry analysis cv cheng et al 2016 gao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the three electrode system includes working electrode pair electrode and reference electrode the working electrode can be sliced by actual water supply pipeline or common water supply pipeline platinum chip or platinum wire electrode commonly used for the electrode and saturated mercury or potassium chloride electrode commonly used for the reference electrode gao et al 2020 ketrane et al 2009 zhili 2020 commonly used pipes for water supply pipeline include ductile iron galvanized stainless steel carbon steel reinforced concrete polyvinyl chloride polyethylene polypropylene etc when water deposits scale in the pipeline the electrochemical performance of the water and pipeline will change zhang et al 2018a these changes can be detected by electrochemical analysis methods to determine the corrosion or scaling of pipelines and their potential mechanisms zhang et al 2020 among many electrochemical indicators ocp pc and eis are common methods for analyzing pipeline corrosion or scaling su et al 2014 the self corrosion current density icorr can be obtained by fitting the pc and the ocp pc and eis can jointly describe the scaling condition of electrolyte on the surface of working electrode 1 open circuit potential ocp on an isolated metal electrode an anode reaction and a cathode reaction are carried out at the same time at equal speed when the two electrode reactions are coupled with each other the electrode potential reaches the same level and does not change with time this potential is called self corrosive potential ecorr or open circuit potential ocp in the corrosion scaling system becerra araneda et al 2022 carrillo et al 2012 jegdić et al 2008 generally the more positive the ocp the easier the water in the water supply pipeline to get electrons and thus scale zhang et al 2020 1 polarization curve pc the phenomenon that the electrode potential deviates from the equilibrium potential when current passes is called polarization in electrochemical system when electrode polarization occurs the negative shift of electrode potential from equilibrium potential is called cathodic polarization and vice versa the polarization curve is the relation between overpotential or electrode potential and current density gao et al 2020 the electrochemical workstation software and various fitting software can automatically fit the polarization curve calculate the tafel slope ba and bc of the anode and cathode segments and obtain the self corrosive current density icorr of metal materials as shown in fig 11 poorqasemi et al 2009 the icorr is proportional to the oxygen flow to the electrode through convection diffusion and inversely to the fouling attachment on the active surface of the working electrode feed water pipe slice when the active surface of the working electrode feed water pipe slice is adhered to by scale the self corrosive current density will decrease gradually and when the surface of the working electrode feed water pipe slice is completely covered by scale icorr will approach zero gabrielli et al 1999 haaring et al 2019 sebastiani et al 2017 1 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis electrochemical impedance technology is to measures the change of voltage or current of electrochemical system with time by controlling the current or voltage of the chemical system and sinusoidal law of small amplitude with time or measures the impedance of the electrochemical system so as to measure the reaction mechanism of the system and analyze the electrochemical parameters fitting the measuring system li et al 2012 the eis can determine the shape of the porous scale i e the cavity under the calcite crystal layer by measuring the impedance of the surface of the working electrode slice of water supply pipe further the resistance and capacitance of scale inhibitor layer at zero current are measured to study the mineral information of scale deposits such as compactness and deposition thickness gabrielli et al 1997 in previous studies eis analysis has been widely used in corrosion research of steel and other materials in industrial industry he et al 2020 hida et al 2019 mishra et al 2020 as shown in fig 12 the working electrodes and electrolytes are respectively set as the materials to be studied and the corrosion characteristics of different materials in different solutions are investigated by eis such as nyquist diagram de motte et al 2020 due to the advantages of high precision detection of pipeline corrosion by eis this method has been widely used in the research of acid corrosion and calcium carbonate scale and iron corrosion of water supply pipelines in recent years kindi et al 2021 osorio celestino et al 2020 rakitin and kichigin 2009 zhang et al 2020 as shown in fig 13 the electrochemical equivalent circuit eec can be fitted by eis which will help to interpret the measured eis data and further visualize the scaling process and mechanism de motte et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the electrochemical analysis method can continuously detect the electrochemical properties of metal pipes so the influence of individual factors on the scale formation process can be determined however the detection time is usually within a few minutes so the continuous in situ inspection of water supply pipeline and its quality cannot be realized for many years thus the long term and complete process of scale formation in pipeline cannot be reflected dehghani et al 2020 sanaei et al 2017 7 conclusion and prospect water quality potential scaling risk assessment framework because drinking water contains a certain amount of calcium magnesium ions and bicarbonate ions when the external environment changes bicarbonate is easy to be transformed into carbonate and then reacts with calcium ions to form calcium carbonate scale which is mineral scale in the general sense the generation of scale will lead to a lot of energy waste and economic cost loss which will threaten personal health and safety in serious cases this paper reviews the basic morphological structure and formation mechanism of scale layer in water supply pipeline and summarizes the relationship between water quality and the formation of scale as well as the evaluation methods of water quality scaling tendency 1 describe the structure and molecular characteristics of scale with calcite and aragonite as the main components by means of traditional material characterization technology and molecular dynamics model 2 the formation mechanism of scale can be divided into homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation but their essence is the crossing of gibbs free energy barrier in the crystallization process of calcium carbonate 3 electrochemical analysis method can quickly and accurately analyze the scaling process of scaling substances and improve the shortcomings of previous experimental research 4 due to the close relationship between water quality and the formation of scale the influence of water quality on the scaling process is discussed the results show that calcium magnesium ion bicarbonate alkalinity ion and ph value in water have a great influence on the formation of scale the combination of psi and eis can detect the scaling tendency and potential scaling risk more accurately and quickly than single water quality index detection and calculation of scaling tendency evaluation index therefore future research should be more combined with electrochemical analysis methods to reveal the direct relationship between different pipes and water quality at the same time new means such as density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulation can be used to visualize the formation process of pipeline scale layer this will help to provide a more comprehensive and accurate scaling distribution map in the actual water supply pipeline at the same time it can also provide important information about scaling control and ensure the quality and safety of drinking water supply declaration of competing interest the

15619,detection and identification of macroplastic debris in aquatic environments is crucial to understand and counter the growing emergence and current developments in distribution and deposition of macroplastics in this context close range remote sensing approaches revealing spatial and spectral properties of macroplastics are very beneficial to date field surveys and visual census approaches are broadly acknowledged methods to acquire information but since 2018 techniques based on remote sensing and artificial intelligence are advancing despite their proven efficiency speed and wide applicability there are still obstacles to overcome especially when looking at the availability and accessibility of data thus our review summarizes state of the art research about the visual recognition and identification of different sorts of macroplastics the focus is on both data acquisition techniques and evaluation methods including machine learning and deep learning but resulting products and published data will also be taken into account our aim is to provide a critical overview and outlook in a time where this research direction is thriving fast this study shows that most machine learning and deep learning approaches are still in an infancy state regarding accuracy and detail when compared to visual monitoring even though their results look very promising keywords

yolo you only look once object detection algorithm data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction approaches to monitor detect track and identify macroplastics or more generally spoken anthropogenic litter with support of visual techniques or remote sensing methods have become more diverse in the last decade biermann et al 2020 gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 kataoka et al 2012 kataoka and nihei 2020 kylili et al 2021 martin et al 2018 wolf et al 2020 a common denominator of these works is the advancement of knowledge about sources pathways sinks or quantities of anthropogenic litter in the natural environment while the water quality of european waters is regularly measured for several pollutants such as pesticides nutrients pharmaceuticals or phytoplankton innovative parameters such as macroplastics are to date less monitored although adverse effects of plastic are seen as one of the most pressing global environmental problems german environment agency 2017 loos et al 2018 the pathways of macroplastics in particular from the interior of a continent via rivers and lakes towards the sea is influenced by many barriers including sluices barrages or vegetation traps on top of that changing water levels may temporarily mobilize plastic debris from riverbanks or shores thus huge regional differences in abundance of plastic debris already occur in the river compartments because of these regional differences detailed investigations are essential to determine or improve plastic transfer rates towards marine regions gonzález fernández et al 2021 van emmerik et al 2022 in order to monitor these dynamics research in the field of macroplastic monitoring with a focus on automation and affordability is essential to grasp the real extent of macroplastic pollution in the respective environment however there are still many questions to be answered such as how to unambiguously monitor macroplastics using spectral information or how to automate the time and labor intensive plastic field surveys in a way that data can be collected more frequently with larger spatial scale and in a more harmonious way in the past a high number of surveys were conducted sometimes with the support of citizen science reporting numbers of litter abundance distribution measures or details about detected plastic or litter objects such as compositions or size ranges bergmann et al 2016 bui et al 2022 chambault et al 2018 kiessling et al 2019 tramoy et al 2019 vlachogianni et al 2018 nevertheless most of these studies lack in terms of spatial and temporal extent as well as in transferability if methods are tailored to specific aquatic regions owing to high needs of resources human labor as well as time but also because of various competing monitoring approaches provoking a lack of standards these studies have a limited potential in providing a fundamental understanding of sources pathways sinks or quantities of anthropogenic litter in aquatic environments vriend et al 2020 for riverine regions the visual monitoring approach proposed by gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 encouraged consistency and harmonization floating macro litter larger than 2 5 cm was counted and categorized during observation sessions with the jrc floating litter monitoring app in total 32 institutions implemented the monitoring scheme on several rivers in 15 eu and non eu countries thereby achieving a harmonization of data and metadata with repetition and incorporation into wider monitoring approaches for instance by van emmerik et al 2018 castro jiménez et al 2019 or crosti et al 2018 the first standard monitoring procedure for riverine regions was created to date this broadly applicable approach is a state of the art in the field of macroplastic load quantification in rivers however visual observation also has its disadvantages considering the observer bias produced the potentially disturbing environmental conditions the diverse characteristics of the macroplastic items and the low degree of automation gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 van emmerik et al 2018 the potential of remote sensing based approaches to detect identify and quantify the macroplastic load on beaches river surface waters at riverbanks or on marine water surfaces is growing while a wider area can be covered in a similar quality as with visual monitoring approaches there are options of automated and more objective evaluation saving time and human resources van lieshout et al 2020 successfully performed a semi automated evaluation of floating debris larger than 5 cm on the river water surface utilizing a camera and a convolutional neural network cnn similarly martin et al 2018 2021a presented semi automated approaches for beaches highlighting their efficiency in time and spatial scale garcia garin et al 2021 focused on automatic monitoring of floating marine macro litter moreover the potential of multi and hyperspectral sensors is investigated for beached and floating plastics balsi et al 2021 cocking et al 2022 cortesi et al 2022 these recent developments encourage the further rise of imaging sensor and ai based macroplastic monitoring techniques downsides inherent in such approaches but also in visual monitoring techniques are that deeper layers of water or subsoil can hardly be assessed with regard to the macroplastic or litter load due to missing sight high absorption or reflection of radiation wetting or submergence as well as weathering of items also negatively influence the litter detectability garaba and harmel 2022 moshtaghi et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge all of the currently existing close range remote sensing based studies focussing on the automatic evaluation of macroplastic or litter load in aquatic environments have in common that they evaluate the occurrence of one or a few object classes 12 only for a certain area and point in time one reason might be limited data availability which leads to a bottleneck in case of machine and deep learning approaches since a large amount of data is required for a robust model training this state is likely to remain unchanged unless more sensors are installed to systematically record data at one or several locations and over longer periods of time more limitations to the monitoring process are owed to the fact that the list of litter or plastic classification guidelines is long but the remote sensing perspective is not properly considered to date this affects both the compatibility and comparability of approaches furthermore in contrast to far range remote sensing the close range remote sensing view on macroplastic currently mostly focuses on the area of visible light only very few recent studies incorporate near infrared nir and shortwave infrared swir bands to quantify plastic load in aquatic environments balsi et al 2021 cortesi et al 2022 this review is intended to provide an insight into how remote sensing sensors can be deployed for detection identification and quantification of macroplastics a closer look is taken on the spectral and spatial properties of imaging sensors and its potential to portray macroplastics as well as to discriminate it from natural materials occurring in the field chapter 2 both the strengths and limits of the remote sensing based approaches are to be discussed in chapter 3 we review and assess evaluation procedures from pixel based approaches over object based segmentation and machine learning techniques to deep cnn based classifications finally chapter 4 clarifies how plastic quantities can be retrieved from images after an ai based analysis 2 potential of remote sensing sensors for the detection and identification of macroplastic litter 2 1 interrelations of spatial resolution coverage and macroplastic object details the aim of this chapter is to grasp the full range of macroplastics which can realistically be monitored and assessed using remote sensing rs tools this also includes highlighting the vanishing probability to detect smaller items in contrast to larger ones there are various macroplastic size definitions describing macroplastics as all plastic particles which either are larger than 25 mm and smaller than 1 m ryan et al 2019 ranging from 50 to 500 mm lebreton et al 2018 or exceeding the size of 5 mm garaba et al 2018 these definitions gain importance in the search for the optimal acquisition altitude in case of rs based applications the minimum observable macroplastic object size is largely determined by the spatial resolution achieved by the sensor a point that applies independently from any definition is that the bigger the macroplastic items are the higher are the chances for detection or identification as bigger objects contain more representative pixels andriolo et al 2022 tharani et al 2020 therefore adjusting the observation height to the macroplastic target class es can be beneficial for the subsequent data analysis in a bid to evaluate plastic pollution or litter in aquatic environments and along beaches several close range mid range and far distance rs sensing platforms have already been successfully tested these include satellites acuña ruz et al 2018 biermann et al 2020 kremezi et al 2021 topouzelis et al 2019 aircrafts garaba et al 2018 kataoka et al 2018 moy et al 2017 balloons kako et al 2012 nakashima et al 2011 ships papachristopoulou et al 2020 bridges or other elevated points kako et al 2010 van lieshout et al 2020 unmanned aerial vehicles andriolo et al 2020 balsi et al 2021 deidun et al 2018 escobar sánchez et al 2021 jakovljevic et al 2020 maharjan et al 2022 martin et al 2018 martin et al 2021a wolf et al 2020 or auvs fulton et al 2019 detecting either the occurrence of plastic or litter in general or of particular plastic or litter items table 1 describes the spatial resolutions that have been achieved when detecting macroplastic or litter objects from different altitudes and which areas have been covered lo et al 2020 have compared the impact of several parameters including acquisition altitude weather condition time of day and substrate characteristics and found that acquisition altitude is the only factor which significantly influences the accuracy of litter identification however in addition to platform height sensor specifics also determine the resulting spatial resolution an opposing factor namely the area coverage is also very decisive for many users hence many applications aim at a compromise between spatial resolution and coverable area deidun et al 2018 gonçalves et al 2019 martin et al 2018 wolf et al 2020 this review divides the existing rs based approaches used to monitor macroplastics or litter into three categories i far range ii mid range and iii close range rs approaches table 1 it primarily focusses on close range rs as defined in table 1 which also includes more permanently installed cameras on bridges or other elevated points martin et al 2018 aimed at distinguishing certain litter objects such as drink containers bottle caps and plastic bags to the best of our knowledge the authors were the first to define a clear item size boundary creating two distinct classes of objects that are more objects 4 cm or less objects 4 cm prone to misdetection gonçalves et al 2019 delimited their approach of detecting marine litter items a generic class to perform well for items between 2 and 1200 cm2 both studies have in common that they used a ground sampling distance gsd between 0 5 and 0 7 cm per pixel and fixed the threshold of detectability in the same region contrary to detection identification of specific macroplastic objects e g bottles bags straws requires a higher spatial detail due to the high variety of potential object categories present within the imagery the spatial resolution should resolve the visual differences between similar but different classes inter class variability deformations or scale variations wolf et al 2020 for instance derived litter information from images taken at an altitude of 6 m with a spatial resolution of 0 2 cm per pixel consequently the authors were able to differentiate between water vegetation sand and litter in a first step and 12 specific litter classes e g canisters bottles polystyrene packaging etc in the second run wolf et al 2020 martin et al 2018 and 2021a were all able to retrieve information about litter item occurrence item class affiliation and object location information about object size or form have not been investigated the approaches by martin et al 2018 2021a further enabled the calculation of exact frequencies per category size and form characteristics have been analyzed by deng et al 2021 or kylili et al 2021 who benefitted from a very high spatial resolution too for a more generic litter detection a ground sampling distance between 0 43 and 0 82 cm has been confirmed to be a good guideline for achieving reliable results escobar sánchez et al 2021 fallati et al 2019 garcia garin et al 2021 gonçalves et al 2019 maharjan et al 2022 the output then confirms the occurrence of litter or plastic but neither the exact category present nor information about item counts sizes and forms can be derived even for lower resolutions litter or plastic detection is possible as can be seen in deidun et al 2018 within this analysis litter items e g rope wood plastic were detected by manual image screening andriolo et al 2020 on 30 m altitude images gsd of 1 cm pixel however a bias may occur as objects from the smallest size category of 2 5 5 0 cm might be underestimated moreover observation angles can add to this bias if parts of the beach or surface waters are shown in a higher resolution than others altogether rs techniques have proven to pose fewer restrictions in terms of achievable spatial coverage and temporal resolution in comparison to other approaches e g manual surveys trawl surveys or visual counting which are highly resource and time intensive in addition with the support of many rs instruments researchers have a high level of freedom in choosing a sensor a platform and an operating height according to the respective research questions and regions under investigation one issue arising from this freedom is a potential incompatibility and incomparability between research studies among the clear advantages of the rs approach is the persistence of data once documented the data can be repeatedly analyzed with various techniques furthermore data sets for training testing and validation of machine learning ml approaches can be enlarged step by step thereby continuously expanding originally small sets of training and validation data provided that the latter are compatible disadvantages include the inability to see during night time sensor dependent or far beyond the top layer of water or sand since water for instance can be murky and opaque to certain wavelengths however this also applies to the visual counting method environmental factors such as wind rain fog sun reflection waves or clouds might also impair data acquisition next to tides or currents moving macroplastics away from the sensor view andriolo et al 2022 in most of the plastic monitoring applications considered drones have so far been equipped with red green blue rgb sensors freitas et al 2021 fusing sensors by adding other sensors with different wavelength ranges spatial resolution or multi or hyperspectral capabilities could present another great benefit of rs based applications since the use of further spectral characteristics beyond rgb or a change in perspective might improve the recognition rate of macroplastic 2 2 spectral characteristics of macroplastics plastic materials consist of natural or synthetic polymers derived from fossil fuels or biomass these polymers usually have a share of carbon based units or chains and can be supplemented by additives to fit certain requirements unep 2015 thus plastics can be of any color transparent thick or thin soft pliable or rigid and more or less durable the list of potential additives in the eu contains several hundreds of substances these additives partly influence at which wavelength and with which probability an object can be identified by a sensor beigbeder et al 2013 they can be subdivided into functional additives e g flame retardants colorants fillers and reinforcements echa 2019 another crucial influencing factor on the spectral signature is the underlying plastic material itself upon closer inspection polymers are built up from certain functional atomic groups these molecules can be excited to oscillate and rotate by absorbing radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum the characteristic oscillations of functional groups correspond to the absorption bands hesse et al 2012 thus magnitude and shape of the spectral signature are key information for the discrimination between plastic objects and other materials in particular the nir and swir range 780 2500 nm plays an important role in the detection and identification of plastic materials the visual range from 380 to 780 nm is not redundant but insufficient for the unambiguous differentiation between plastic objects and other materials garaba et al 2021 among the vast group of plastics there are more and less potent reflectors white plastic samples such as styrofoam objects have a strong reflectance and are considered to be easier to find while carbon black samples reflect weakly acuña ruz et al 2018 beigbeder et al 2013 masoumi et al 2012 also transparent objects such as foils are hard to detect as less light is reflected from the object and spectral influences from the background might cause confusion garaba et al 2021 goddijn murphy and dufau 2018 in between the good and bad reflectors there are many uniquely shaped spectral signatures of medium magnitude in principle in the visual range the apparent color of the plastic object is indicated while an overall decrease of reflectance punctuated by several absorption features occurs in the nir garaba and dierssen 2018 fig 1 displays examples of the spectral signatures of polyethylene pe in different states next to a signature of water the functional groups of pe determining the absorption features are shown beside the corresponding wavelengths these absorption features originate from the first and second overtone of ch stretching vibrations of around 1700 and 1200 nm several other absorption bands are caused by different combinations of overtones of stretching vibrations and deformation vibrations dual peak absorption features can be caused by a different behaviour regarding oscillation symmetry cammann 2001 below 1200 nm a clear assignment of molecular oscillations to absorption features is difficult due to complex combinations of oscillations pelletier and pelletier 2010 in contrast to the recycling industry engaged in recycling plastic waste and differentiating various plastic materials in real time by utilizing artificial light and a controlled environment e g bonifazi et al 2019 masoumi et al 2012 moroni and mei 2020 zhu et al 2019 rs scientists and practitioners experience several difficulties in practice when aiming at detection and identification of macroplastics under natural lighting conditions among the reasons why unambiguous discrimination between plastics and other materials occurring naturally e g green vegetation wood sun glint or artificially e g lost or discarded cotton clothes paper or glass waste is so challenging are fluctuations in atmospheric transmission and ambient light conditions due to atmospheric absorption not all plastic related absorption features or diagnostic wavelengths can be utilized for the detection of plastic materials atmospheric water vapor oxygen and carbon dioxide are among the factors contributing to this absorption gao et al 1993 as seen in fig 2 the features at around 1215 and 1730 nm are utilized most frequently due to their measurability during daylight at around 1380 and 1880 nm the atmosphere is mostly impervious for incoming radiance and at around 940 and 1140 nm the atmosphere is partly impervious due to water absorption gao et al 2000 as a consequence measuring at natural daylight can be prone to errors if no calibration procedure or atmospheric correction is applied being closer to the target object during image acquisition means that there is less atmospheric influence on the signal measuring macroplastic reflectance in the laboratory with artificial light is clearly different from measuring the same in the field a first issue is the potential current entailing movements of objects on the water surface of rivers lakes or oceans in contrast to the static object in the laboratory or on the beach which can result in changing appearance because of light effects andriolo et al 2022 secondly especially on cloudy days light conditions can change rapidly which might repeatedly force sensor recalibration in order to get results of good quality eventually relative reflectance spectra giving an insight into the approximate magnitude and shape of the target might be gathered successfully whereas absolute reflectance values are almost impossible to acquire under natural light conditions aasen et al 2018 as a consequence it should be noted that features sampled under natural light conditions may appear less distinct despite the challenges of conducting measurements in the natural aquatic environment spectral properties of plastic materials in natural environments are increasingly investigated to the best of our knowledge spectral reflectance information of macroplastics or approaches to distinguish macroplastics spectrally in a natural context and with higher spatial resolution have so far been presented by acuña ruz et al 2018 balsi et al 2018 2021 cocking et al 2022 cortesi et al 2021 2022 freitas et al 2021 garaba and dierssen 2018 2020 garaba et al 2018 2021 goddijn murphy and dufaur 2018 goddijn murphy et al 2018 guffogg et al 2021 knaeps et al 2021 kremezi et al 2021 moshtaghi et al 2021 and tasseron et al 2021 in a range of 350 to 2500 nm therefore these studies do not only embed the color of samples into their work but also the chemical structure and physical properties of the object at hand fig 2 provides an overview over several papers and the respective wavelengths that have been observed utilized or recommended to detect or to identify macroplastics what all sources have in common is the use of hyperspectral sensors this comparison includes absorption features as well as other diagnostic wavelengths the term diagnostic wavelength refers to a wavelength which can be utilized to differentiate between two materials e g plastic and water due to a significantly different reflectance behavior fig 2 illustrates the relative position of these features within the spectrum as well as the frequency of occurrence particularly apparent are also polymer specific absorption features for high density polyethylene hdpe ldpe polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyethylene terephthalate pet polyvinyl chloride pvc polycarbonate pc and polyester a noticeable observation is that pe including ldpe and hdpe and pp are spectrally rather similar moreover pet ps and pc either miss the typical plastic absorption peak around 1215 nm or it is very weakly positioned due to being the second peak of a dual peak absorption feature balsi et al 2018 cammann 2001 tasseron et al 2021 these peculiarities within the spectral signature of the different polymer types portrayed in fig 2 indicate that one or two universally applicable wavelengths representing plastic specific absorption features might be insufficient in differentiating plastics from other materials as they do not cover all plastics in circulation concluding from fig 2 principal absorption features of aliphatic and aromatic macroplastics can be found roughly in the ranges 900 to 990 nm 1130 to 1260 nm 1380 to 1480 nm and 1660 to 1732 nm regarding the polymer type specific absorption features studies are often comparable despite slight variations from 1 to 23 nm in contrast spectral patterns below 1000 nm and above 1800 nm are less frequently reported garaba et al 2020 goddijn murphy and williamson 2019 both the slight variations in absorption feature location and the reduced occurrence of reported spectral patterns below 1000 and above 1800 nm can be caused by sensor specifics sensors can be equipped with different photodiodes the spectral responsivity of each sensor varies depending on the semiconductor material utilized theoretically silicon photodiodes can only depict the spectral region from 200 to 1050 nm while an indium gallium arsenide photodiode provides a range from 900 to 2 600 nm and indium arsenide or gallium arsenide photodiodes are sensitive within a range from 900 to 1700 nm adão et al 2017 the sensitivity of the sensor mainly determines what can be measured solutions for these spectral restrictions are found for instance in tasseron et al 2021 who gathered data with a double camera system covering the range from 400 to 1700 nm in addition sensors made up of more than one detector covering a range from 350 2500 nm could be utilized garaba et al 2021 moshtaghi et al 2021 another criterion is the spectral resolution which ranges from 1 to 12 nm in the reviewed studies broader bands undersample the available spectral information present which can lead to slight shifts in absorption feature position while narrow bands capture distinctive spectral signatures paoletti et al 2019 in contrast when acquiring rgb or multi spectral imagery the undersampling of spectral information leads to a point where this imagery offers less spectral information whereas the spatial resolution can be more precise recent studies have shown that hyperspectral pushbroom scanners can be utilized for monitoring plastic polymers under natural light conditions balsi et al 2021 cocking et al 2022 however plastic objects that are moving continuously and quickly due to water flow prevent their detection by such scanners balsi et al 2021 hyperspectral 2d imagers might provide a better solution to this issue aasen et al 2018 2 3 spectral delimitation of macroplastics in real world scenarios the surrounding environment has a big impact on the detection and identification of macroplastics external factors influencing the degree of reflectance of macroplastic objects are wetting submergence and weathering garaba et al 2021 garaba and dierssen 2018 moshtaghi et al 2021 their effects on the signal have not yet been investigated extensively moshtaghi et al 2021 so far it is known that the spectral reflectance of wet plastic items is lower than that of dry objects garaba et al 2021 garaba and dierssen 2018 however it is not yet fully understood how strong the decrease in reflectance is when items are being wetted or submerged furthermore this behavior is presumably linked to the respective polymer type and additives inherent of the plastic item as well as its hydrological behavior garaba et al 2021 moshtaghi et al 2021 also the type of water turbid clear artificial potentially containing a variety of water constituents e g total suspended matter colored dissolved organic matter phytoplankton and the type of wavelength play a role garaba and harmel 2022 knaeps et al 2021 moshtaghi et al 2021 therefore inherent material dependent and apparent on illumination and observation geometry dependent optical properties of water are important to consider mishra et al 2017 regarding the weathering processes ocean or natural harvested plastics have been analyzed several times for their spectral shape and magnitude balsi et al 2018 garaba et al 2021 garaba and dierssen 2018 leone et al 2022 moshtaghi et al 2021 weather and atmosphere can affect plastic by i temperature and ii humidity their variation respectively iii wind iv rain v atmospheric gases or pollutants as well as vi uv light photodegradation photodegradation causes chemical changes to the polymers and thus might impact spectral shape and magnitude of plastic samples the degree of chemical change is related to the additives contained in a sample that can improve or compromise the weathering performance mckeen 2019 due to the complexity of the weathering process moshtaghi et al 2021 observed less distinct features when investigating real weathered samples while garaba et al 2021 detected nearly identical spectral shapes as well as absorption features further research will be necessary to properly assess the impact of biofilm or different types and degrees of weathering on the spectral reflectivity of plastic objects the question of which wavelengths best define the present classes e g plastic vegetation wood can also depend on the study area it is more important to differentiate plastics from sun glint on the water in marine regions or vegetation in coastal regions than to separate plastic pixels or objects from classes or perturbations which most likely will not occur in the respective study area andriolo et al 2022 thereby diagnostic wavelengths can help during classification or detection in order to separate turbid or clear water from plastic goddijn murphy and dufaur 2018 goddijn murphy et al 2018 recommend the two wavelengths of 750 and 850 nm and moshtaghi et al 2021 the 850 900 nm region as well as the 1070 nm band plain water shows a low spectral reflectance at these bands while plastics tend to reflect stronger fig 1 according to moshtaghi et al 2021 up to slight submergence of 5 cm the 1070 nm band is usable for distinguishing between water and their plastic target nevertheless higher sediment concentrations and depths weaken the spectral signature and the spectral region below 1070 nm is better suited for detecting submerged plastics than the region beyond this is confirmed by garaba and harmel 2022 who set the borders of detectability from uv to 1200 nm moshtaghi et al 2021 further proposed the 1730 nm band to differentiate plastic from wood based on the fact that wood does not exhibit any absorption feature there while plastic does however diagnostic wavelengths facilitate the discrimination of plastic objects from water or wood only as long as the samples are dry clear differentiation is impeded as soon as a third fourth or fifth material class or look alikes appear moshtaghi et al 2021 in summary unambiguous differentiation of macroplastic from the natural environment or naturally occurring items let alone from other macroplastics in varying daylight conditions is a complex endeavor knaeps et al 2021 however first approaches with regard to separability of spectra either between plastic types or between plastic and background items e g wood have been presented in recently published literature on this basis and if inherent and apparent optical properties from a larger variety of naturally harvested macroplastics in a range from almost untouched over weathered biofilmed to severely damaged or in altered state is spectrally analysed it is very likely that discrimination accuracy can be further increased and analysis brought to a more complex level provided that appropriate methods will be applied for these tasks 3 possibilities and limitations of automated analysis of macroplastics a huge variety of methods has been applied to detect identify or quantify macroplastics in different aquatic environments next to computationally less intensive methods such as indices based approaches ml and deep learning dl methods are frequently utilized especially in the past five years approaches based on artificial intelligence were emerging kylili et al 2019 martin et al 2018 3 1 indices and further pixel based thresholding techniques macroplastic related indices as displayed in table 2 or proposed by goddijn murphy and dufaur 2018 goddijn murphy et al 2018 could enable simple affordable and fast differentiation between water and plastics kühn et al 2004 advantages consist in choosing an algorithm working in the nir or swir region where object coloration does not interfere with the classification goddijn murphy and dufaur 2018 moshtaghi et al 2021 and in the ability that these cope with radiance as well as reflectance data kühn et al 2004 despite their ability to provide some distinction between materials its applicability on highly complex environments is limited goddijn murphy and dufaur 2018 argue that their algorithm is plastic type specific depending on the items degree of opacity and volume and influenced by fluctuating accuracy under natural light conditions e g passing clouds the authors further highlight that one universal algorithm applicable to all marine plastic litter is not feasible and further information retrieved for instance by shape recognition techniques could complement the differentiation goddijn murphy and dufaur 2018 kühn et al 2004 implemented a hydrocarbon index hi by utilizing the absorption feature at around 1730 nm which is characteristic of hydrocarbons the authors were able to monitor hydrocarbon bearing materials such as oil contaminated sites artificial grass and plastic later garaba and dierssen 2018 adapted the algorithm for the absorption feature at 1210 nm the performance of the hi is strongly dependent on the choice of bands e g 1197 nm 1216 nm 1235 nm as well as the absorption feature position which is not uniform for all plastic objects due to the polymer specific absorption bands kühn et al 2004 according to this we hypothesize that it should be working best for pe and pp as the absorption features of these polymers are distinct in that wavelength region for pet and ps an adapted version of the index might be more suitable see fig 2 according to kühn et al 2004 methodological limits of the hi include that vegetated areas may appear noisy given that natural hydrocarbons or polymers can occur dark colored hydrocarbons are not detected reliably and misclassifications might occur since not all hydrocarbon bearing materials are plastics garaba and dierssen 2018 confirmed the efficiency of both hi with the one at 1730 nm having fewer false positives however both hi were mainly tested over land garaba and dierssen 2018 kühn et al 2004 an application over natural surface waters e g containing algae should be examined especially in situations when various materials are present and when aiming at a precise classification one single algorithm might be too error prone in this case multi criteria approaches as proposed by biermann et al 2020 come into focus the authors applied a floating debris index fdi next to the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to differentiate materials at hand into several complex classes including seaweed water timber and foam the fdi originates from the floating algae index but utilizes the red edge band at 740 nm instead of the red band in order to benefit from the difference between nir and baseline reflection of nir according to the authors this resulted in i the approach being more stable against atmospheric and observational changes and ii separating nir reflecting materials such as seaweed timber and spume from nir absorbing materials such as water however in many aquatic environments turbidity is too high for the algorithm to function efficiently biermann et al 2020 because with increasing sediment concentration the ndvi of the target class water is increasing as well due to higher reflectance in the nir band moshtaghi et al 2021 as biermann et al 2020 trains a naïve bayes algorithm for classification this blurring of classes in the feature space affects the accuracy of class assignment by the naïve bayes algorithm biermann et al 2020 moshtaghi et al 2021 have repeated this two variable analysis and concluded that plastic reflectance is much more diverse than so far presented by biermann et al 2020 the authors discovered that plastic sample color impacts the outcome of the combined approach using ndvi and fdi with blue plastic samples having higher ndvi and fdi values than red or yellow samples finally moshtaghi et al 2021 found wetting or submergence of samples to decrease fdi values thus impairing the classification result as well cortesi et al 2021 examined the suitability of the three indices displayed in table 2 for discriminating plastics in their workflow the normalized difference water index 2 ndwi2 the plastic index pi and the reversed ndvi rndvi however a histogram of pi values for plastic and non plastic pixels shows no distinctness between their classes besides the aforementioned indices based approaches color space based approaches also drew some attention to this day one can find this building block in various methods including ml approaches rgb and hue saturation value hsv are two different representations of the same data some tasks that may be difficult with one representation can become easy with another chollet 2018 this is the functional principle of color space based approaches wang et al 2015 recommended the hsv color space to assist in debris detection as it is assumed to be more robust to illumination changes and able to mitigate impacts of disturbances such as reflections in contrast kako et al 2010 utilized the lightness a function of rgb values for monitoring plastic litter this firstly resulted in a lack of detecting dark pixels due to a too high threshold and secondly gave rise to a set of false positives for example in the form of sun glare the need to designate a subjective threshold entails low comparability between days seasons and years as well as study regions owing to varying illumination conditions and litter items present this in turn negatively affects detectability and may lead to a bias in long term assessments some improvement was later reached with a similar approach presented by kataoka et al 2012 the authors proposed a methodology employing the cieluv color space which in contrast to the rgb color space integrates color differences in a perceptually uniform way consequently brighter and darker plastic pixels were more efficiently assessed and identified against the beach background with the exception of black plastic pixels on top of that a three day image composite technique was used to enhance false positive detection by considering pixels with constant values only while false positive detection was reduced some true positives e g plastics moved from winds remained unrecognized due to the composite technique despite these advancements the disadvantage of choosing a subjective threshold remains as it is static across time and imagery in kataoka and nihei 2020 the authors integrated the cieluv part of the approach by kataoka et al 2012 into their new approach which aimed at detecting and quantifying floating macro debris on river surfaces from video material the authors found that the cieluv color difference approach appears to be helpful in riverine regions as plastic pixels show a significantly high variation from the riverine background though beside the challenging threshold definition the approach is incapable of properly extracting further details such as plastic litter object categories or the plastic litter mass flux due to a missing third dimension or further spectral or object based information even if the approach was combined with hyperspectral image analysis as suggested by the authors more variety of plastic objects possibly occurring in rivers would have to be considered 3 2 object based approaches and machine learning ml approaches which also includes dl techniques are trained these approaches require image data samples relevant to a specific task e g detection of macroplastic whose statistical structure can be analysed in order to identify rules for automating the image classification detection or identification task chollet 2018 similar to color space based approaches ml algorithms utilize representations or transformations of data for these rules though the added value of ml approaches lies in the learning aspect the model therefore searches for the best representations or transformations from a predefined space of possibilities chollet 2018 in the field of macroplastic or litter detection and identification the most widely used ml algorithms excluding dl approaches in this case include random forest rf or support vector machine svm classifiers acuña ruz et al 2018 cortesi et al 2021 2022 freitas et al 2021 ge et al 2016 gonçalves et al 2019 martin et al 2018 methodological details of the case studies discussed are shown in table 3 martin et al 2018 for instance applied the histogram of oriented gradients hog feature descriptor proposed by dalal and triggs in 2005 to generate a feature space for the rf classifier while gonçalves et al 2019 used four color feature descriptors rgb hsv cielab and ycbcr to deduce 12 features for their rf classifier dalal and triggs 2005 in contrast to dl systems where no feature space must be predefined the approaches by martin et al 2018 and gonçalves et al 2019 are more subjective both gonçalves et al 2019 and martin et al 2018 assessed litter loads on beaches gonçalves et al 2019 2020a found that they outperformed the hog based approach by martin et al 2018 citing the f score as the reason this is controversial due to several reasons first martin et al 2018 go more into detail and attempt to differentiate not only between litter and the natural surrounding environment but mainly focus on the classification of either drink containers bottle caps or plastic bags second both authors have utilized their own but not the same data sets i e there is no standard for a fair comparison of methods duarte et al 2020 third the amount of training samples varied which also affects the result nevertheless questioning the utilized feature space is indispensable since it has a great influence on the performance of the object detector table 3 the hog feature descriptor is for example capable of detecting objects of different sizes but was actually proposed for pedestrian detection zou et al 2019 color feature descriptors on the contrary are limited in the recognition of transparent objects or objects similarly colored as the background haralick texture based features were excluded by gonçalves et al 2019 from the outset due to their low efficacy thus issues during processing such as large amounts of false positives can occur owing to a too small too large or unfit feature space which depends on the data analyst s knowledge apart from rf and svm classifiers a shallow neural network with only one hidden layer fed with color space based features was proposed by pinto et al 2021 who aimed at the detection of four plastic categories bottles fishing ropes octopus pots and fragments the authors stated that the detection performance was sufficient when classes with low inter class color variability were targeted however for categories with a high variance of intra class colors performance was poor moreover spectral angle mapping sam and spectral correlation mapping scm have been successfully explored on multi or hyperspectral data in order to discriminate plastic polymers or litter cocking et al 2022 gonçalves and andriolo 2022 during spectral angle mapping the spectral similarity of a samples spectrum is compared to reference spectra resulting in an angle describing the degree of similarity of materials here too an increasing diversity of targets might complicate determining an appropriate threshold angle cocking et al 2022 acuña ruz et al 2018 found after applying rf svm and linear discriminant analysis to multispectral world view 3 data that a digital classification for types of anthropogenic marine debris was only possible for their category styrofoam as it has unique spectral patterns in contrast to other classes thus all other types were classified into a generic plastic category although this work is not based on close range rs several aspects are transferable first styrofoam has been found to be distinctly detectable in contrast to other plastic objects bak et al 2019 wolf et al 2020 second the authors highlighted the dependence of predictive model performance on training and validation data further random subsampling of training and validation data was recommended for cross validation as it fostered the comparability between algorithms due to a more robust outcome acuña ruz et al 2018 yet most reviewed studies rely on a single hold out validation instead of a k fold validation freitas et al 2021 were among the first to acquire and analyze hyperspectral field data with rf and svm classifiers similarly to acuña ruz et al 2018 the approach is not based on close range rs but can entail promising results for the latter in their project the authors placed artificial targets on the marine water surface and captured hyperspectral data under natural light conditions on two days on day one training data were gathered on day two test data were collected while the authors did approximate realistic outdoor conditions a more disjoint collection of training and test data or a more diverse data acquisition campaign could have been conducted in order to achieve a more robust test of the learned algorithms consequently information on target pixels belonging to the classes orange plastic white plastic or ropes and non target pixels surroundings such as water and land in training and test data do not differ much this might result in an overestimation of the algorithms usefulness close range remote sensing based multi or hyperspectral analyses were conducted by balsi et al 2021 cortesi et al 2021 2022 and cocking et al 2022 these case studies show that additional spectral features in the feature space can contribute to plastic polymer type identification however cortesi et al 2021 has found that adding the pi rndvi and ndwi2 to their feature space did not result in significant improvements this emphasizes the importance but also the challenge of selecting suitable features a typical element of object based approaches is a rule set which is usually determined subjectively by the user this rule set is applied to object segments that have to be extracted in a first step examples of such an approach were presented by bao et al 2018 escobar sánchez et al 2021 or gonçalves et al 2020a within such approaches the segmentation of objects as well as the decision on which rules to implement significantly determine the quality of classification gonçalves et al 2020a a comparison of the given studies is difficult since different data sets features and validation parameters have been chosen bao et al 2018 for example solely based on color specifics to differentiate and segment litter from the natural background namely green and blue band histogram statistics by proceeding that way not only segmented litter items but natural items such as branches and leaves standing out from the yellowish and sandy background were highlighted once more misclassifications were thus unavoidable when spectral characteristics of objects overlapped e g footsteps riffles in the sand this has been similarly experienced by gonçalves et al 2020a who repeated the method all in all the feature space chosen by bao et al 2018 is too small and therefore not very suitable for a clear differentiation of litter from further beach debris in more complex environments gonçalves et al 2020a also spatio temporal variations remain unconsidered kako et al 2010 despite this the authors named an advantage of an object based approach which consists in a less fragmented result in contrast to pixel based classification techniques escobar sánchez et al 2021 attempted to distinguish between segments of macrolitter and the surrounding sandy beach vegetation shells algae and stones with support of the maximum likelihood svm and rf classifiers their main aim included a comparison of spatial ospar a macrolitter monitoring framework and the formerly mentioned more automated approach the authors concluded that their approach was not sufficiently accurate and rather recommend the utilization of dl approaches besides evaluating the time and cost efficiency the authors have criticized their low segment size chosen during segmentation thus large items could not be properly counted as the number of segments per item would lead to a significant overestimation of the actual litter count their comparison of the time required the costs and the outcomes result in the finding that their approach did not contribute much to the achievement of the set goal in summary the case studies have shown that in contrast to a visual census litter monitoring can be accelerated and automated extensively by utilizing rf based and svm based approaches or shallow cnns gonçalves et al 2019 martin et al 2018 on the other hand there are authors who criticise automated litter monitoring mainly arguing with the reliability and accuracy of model results escobar sánchez et al 2021 we have observed that only in a few cases the aim was differentiating between certain litter or plastic objects gonçalves et al 2020b martin et al 2018 pinto et al 2021 this could indicate a weakness in the methodology or utilized rgb data sets in that context to this date these approaches can hardly keep up with the currently existing visual monitoring approaches escobar sánchez et al 2021 gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 nevertheless the examples above further showed that in contrast to methods like indices or pixel based simple thresholding ml approaches tend to perform better the likely reason for this is that these approaches base their classification decision on more than just one or two manually selected feature s this makes a decisive contribution to a more precise discrimination between classes by virtue of the learning and optimization procedure ml algorithms qualify for more complex classification tasks the most crucial factor though remains the choice of the feature space color space based features are most frequently chosen however complementing those features with additional spectral bands in the nir or swir region or shape features might provide a stronger discrimination ability during ml classification pixel or object based image analysis as explored by cortesi et al 2021 cortesi et al 2022 or suggested by goddijn murphy and dufaur 2018 yet we argue that clear evidence for this is missing as no standards are adhered to in the comparison of methods which raises the question of framework conditions during analysis in order for automatic monitoring approaches to ever become competitive with visual approaches or field surveys a great deal of work still needs to be done in terms of category differentiation to assess the occurrence and frequency of litter or plastic items on a higher level and benchmarking ml models and algorithms 3 3 deep learning in contrast to ml dl is characterized by learning features from successive layers of increasingly meaningful representations which puts the depth of a model into focus chollet 2018 within the reviewed papers depths ranging from 3 to 284 layers have been observed kako et al 2020 kylili et al 2021 however due to a lack of transparency regarding the utilized architectures this observation is not exhaustive since dl models learn hidden and sophisticated features from these layers a user intervention in terms of manual feature engineering is unnecessary this independence from prespecifying features is one of the main strengths of dl with another one being that dl models have the ability to generalize knowledge paoletti et al 2019 a high generalization capability implies a good performance on data which is completely new to the model thus maximizing generalization is the aim when applying dl techniques chollet 2018 efforts to maximize generalization are often accompanied by overfitting overfitting occurs when a model is too tailored to the training data set an overfitted model is less capable of achieving a good performance on unseen data the best possible balance between optimization and generalization can be reached by modifying the model width or depth and lastly its capacity decreasing the model capacity reduces memorization capability but may also allow for underfitting enlarging the model capacity can positively support the pattern recognition as more low mid and high level features can be integrated among others at the same time issues such as overparameterization and overfitting increased computational expanse vanishing gradients or the degradation problem might occur and need to be considered chollet 2018 he et al 2015 furthermore adding dropout or weight regularization techniques could support an increase in generalization capability the intention to employ a well performing model sooner or later leads to the question of how deep or wide a cnn should be in addition several other decisions regarding cnn architecture e g resnet densenet vgg hyperparameters e g learning rate number of epochs or optimization strategies e g dropout regularization have to be made by the practitioners chollet 2018 as consequence of the large flexibility practitioners have in terms of architecture and model capacity targets training strategies or outcome e g object detection segmentation very different approaches have been tested and published with the aim to detect plastic litter or litter items within imagery some crucial points of these studies have been examined and are compared below unfortunately not all studies provide a full insight into their approach nor the data used this severely affects their reproducibility which would be important with a view to understanding and comparing different methods in all of the 28 deep learning approaches examined a tendency can be observed to discriminate not only plastic from natural materials but identify specific plastic items fig 3 shows which macroplastic litter object categories left and non plastic but anthropogenic litter categories right have been investigated so far bottles and plastic bags are the front runners in terms of identifying macroplastic items closely followed by fishing gear and ropes though in this context a holistic classification scheme is missing to date the dl based studies evaluate the occurrence location or mask of arbitrary 1 to 12 macroplastic target classes the median and average of observed categories amounts to 1 and 3 5 respectively visual observation or field surveys usually focus on a fuller range of macroplastics present in the natural environment and include 1 to 124 categories during investigation depending on the protocol used hanke et al 2013 helcom 2021 ryan et al 2019 here the median of used categories amounts to 29 beyond that several authors have mentioned that there are categories which are more likely to be detected by a model de vries et al 2021 politikos et al 2021 in addition to object size this also depends on the intra class variability therefore tharani et al 2020 proposed a log based attention layer which is supposed to improve performance particularly for small objects with the idea of dilated convolution deng et al 2021 suggested applying another potentially successful adaptation to improve the feature extraction ability for small objects by setting a certain dilation rate dilated convolution is capable of changing the receptive field size thereby increasing the resolution of intermediate feature maps this could result in better semantic and spatial information retrieval which as a consequence should affect object detection and instance segmentation accuracy the development of object detection strategies for certain plastic litter object categories has presumably been evoked by object based dl models such as region based cnn rcnn or you only look once yolo which have been introduced from 2014 on as well as advances in computing resources girshick et al 2014 paoletti et al 2019 redmon et al 2016 since then several updated or faster versions of these core algorithms have been presented with yolo v5 and mask rcnn being more recent updates he et al 2017 jocher et al 2020 these models make up almost half of the approaches used in this application field in this context yolo is a group of one stage detectors while the rcnns are multi stage detectors rcnns propose object candidate boxes using the selective search algorithm and later based on the extracted features of a box predict one object category for each region due to computation of redundant features on overlapping proposals the detection speed is slowed down although this drawback has been addressed and faster rcnn a successor performs better in terms of speed some computational redundancy still persists at detection stage eventually the advancement of r cnns has produced feature pyramid networks which are a basic building block of many latest detectors zou et al 2019 on the contrary yolo models are very fast these models divide the complete input image into regions and predict bounding boxes as well as class specific confidence scores per region simultaneously still yolo detectors have difficulties with localizing small objects redmon et al 2016 maharjan et al 2022 has compared the yolo detectors v2 to v5 and found that yolov5 is most useful for their plastic detection in rivers a similar conclusion was drawn by córdova et al 2022 who compared the yolov5 detector performance with other state of the art dl models e g faster and mask r cnn for litter detection the selection of only a few classes for training and prediction purposes is often justified with a limited amount of training data cnns are generally very flexible regarding the number of classes they can learn in addition they can deal very well with large amounts of data however an increase in the number of target classes and classification complexity requires qualitative unbiased and quantitatively balanced training data and at least a certain share of validation data such an amount of labelled data is not easily available in adequate quantities first solutions for working with such small data sets have been found in pre training the models using massive and annotated image data bases such as ms coco or imagenet or utilizing transfer learning deng et al 2009 lin et al 2014 transfer learning was applied by kylili et al 2019 while tharani et al 2020 or de vries et al 2021 employed pre training occasionally the term transfer learning is used in connection with pre training the difference is that in transfer learning both the network architecture e g vgg 16 resnet and weights are transferred while in case of pre training only the weights are reused pre training therefore allows more flexibility in terms of model architecture design shorten and khoshgoftaar 2019 the benefit of these techniques is supposed to be the prevention of overfitting and the achievement of a higher generalization ability as well as training speed shorten and khoshgoftaar 2019 zou et al 2019 critical voices argue that the effectiveness of pre training or transfer learning depends on the target task and on how well the pre trained knowledge can be transferred yosinski et al 2014 documented that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and the target task increases essentially efficiency in transfer depends on whether features from the bottom middle or top of the network are transferred the root cause for this is the change of features from being more specific than generic nonetheless the authors state that transferred features from a distant task can also perform better than random features on the contrary he et al 2019 completely questioned the paradigm of imagenet pre training the authors achieved competitive results when training models from scratch the only exception necessary included a higher number of training iterations to allow convergence while observing an accelerated convergence within pre trained models they did not necessarily improve the target task accuracy or reduced overfitting moreover he et al 2019 described training from random initialization as surprisingly robust if enough target data e g 10k exists hence collecting more annotations of target categories and increasing the number of training iterations instead of pre training could be beneficial however the actual amount of training data and available computational power are crucial factors he et al 2019 a second solution to the problem of limited training data is data augmentation data augmentation includes a number of techniques geometric transformations color space augmentations kernel filters etc to improve training data set size and quality when training a model with imbalanced classes the model would produce biased predictions towards the majority class similar to very simplified data sets imbalanced data sets can negatively affect accuracy by leveraging the fact that imbalanced classes can be equalized using data augmentation quality can be significantly enhanced by just changing the ratio between majority and minority classes however while data augmentation is indeed able to remedy some biases within the given data sets such as lighting scale or background others including poor diversity within data sets cannot be overcome diversity aspects should be considered during initial data acquisition furthermore extensively augmenting images with one type of augmentation algorithm could lead to a more biased data set than the original one thus the actual challenge of properly augmenting images lies in reducing biases the value of data augmentation is particularly evident if training and test data share the same distribution shorten and khoshgoftaar 2019 over and above that the data sets should be disjoint chollet 2018 a third option to enlarge a data set albeit tested in very few cases only is to use other published data sets on plastic litter table 4 displays different data sets as well as their type of annotations and size for the problem at hand this might not always be a proper solution as annotations can vary and practitioners might be dissatisfied with the quality nevertheless higher quality annotations such as bounding boxes or instance segmentations could be altered into simpler annotations e g tags the purpose of the insight into published data sets is to reinforce the argument that there are a lot of data available partly even in an annotated form but they are not always being accessed one of the reasons for this could be the fact that many of these are rather new despite the available data we do not want to invalidate the argument that few annotated data sets are available afterall deep cnns can handle massive amounts of data and need considerable amounts of labelled training data in theory ideal and unbiased training data for monitoring macroplastic in real world waters would cover the full range of i potential intra class variation within object categories ii illumination changes iii weather conditions iv scale changes and rotation v viewing angles vi degrees of occlusion submergence and object density vii background patterns and viii noise due to the limited amount of training data that practitioners have at their disposal each of the bullet points is hard to meet in case of dynamic water regions e g rivers oceans motion blur adds to the challenges zou et al 2019 tata et al 2021 for example rose to some visual challenges by putting a focus on sample diversity within their data set to better represent the harshness of marine environments tharani et al 2020 built an easy and a hard test set to address these difficulties wolf et al 2020 reported shadows and surface reflected glitter as problematic artefacts within their work and recommended either avoiding acquisition conditions which promote their appearance or utilizing filters to mitigate these influences for better model performance in the future with a rising complexity of the data set a weaker performance of the models can be expected córdova et al 2022 kylili et al 2021 among the reviewed papers major differences regarding the character of utilized data sets appeared besides authors who rather face the challenge of real world complex object detection scenarios there exists a range of works using artificially appearing and or very mildly polluted images kylili et al 2019 tata et al 2021 though reality can look very different the issue posed by utilizing simplified training data e g very low pollution one plastic item per image great illumination conditions etc consists in a potential misjudgement of model performance if a model has not learned diverse realistic and potentially complex visual patterns of plastic items in training data it will not be able to recognize them in the prediction phase this clearly affects its generalization ability if the test data are a more realistic data set maharjan et al 2022 the artificial creation of optimized conditions can therefore be undesirable for more complex real world applications in contrast including images with higher densities of objects objects in different states of their lifecycle or objects which were subject to weathering processes is necessary to build efficient real world applications moreover a positive side effect of enlarging the data set is the natural prevention of overfitting chollet 2018 in the training phase weights are ideally altered in a way that the loss on the training data is minimized in a bid to evaluate a model while parameters are still improved users have the option of a simple hold out validation k fold cross validation or an iterated k fold cross validation with shuffling experts recommend cross validation for rather small data sets to avoid high variance between validation splits which in this field is almost unavoidable for the time being chollet 2018 garcia garin et al 2021 while much effort has been put in coping with small amounts of data most practitioners let go of this opportunity to reliably evaluate their models and apply a simple hold out validation a reason for this could be the higher computational costs when testing their model on unseen data van lieshout et al 2020 have observed a decrease in performance that had originally been trained at just one location at new but similar locations this decrease was more pronounced the more the character of the new location differed from the original location however the authors also found that even if the model generalization ability was restricted on unseen data of new locations adding site specific training instances of 50 to 1800 images helped to improve the generalization ability this once again confirms the value of a large training data set the veracity of visual observation results cannot be re examined in all cases e g rivers nor corrected for possible errors caused by the human visual performance angelini et al 2019 contrarily cnn models can easily be evaluated for their performance using an unseen test data set for object detection tasks in general the most common evaluation criterion is the average precision ap zou et al 2019 this metric can either be evaluated for each category or over all categories map and describes the average detection precision under different recalls zou et al 2019 moreover the threshold based intersection over union can be applied to evaluate how well the predicted box matches the ground truth box for the reviewed studies no widely accepted evaluation criteria have been observed but the ap is used most frequently in the field in addition recall overall accuracy and f1 score have been used as performance measures several times in 10 7 of cases accuracy assessments were completely missing furthermore performance metrics of already existing cnns have been repeatedly compared to newly tested cnn performance metrics however accuracy assessments and comparisons between stand alone approaches hardly work as target categories and data sets often differed to ensure an appropriate level of comparability in a direct comparison of methods data sets and target classes would have to be equal lastly deep cnns can be designed to be inclusive to multi or hyperspectral data however to the best of our knowledge dl approaches which incorporate more than rgb images to detect or identify anthropogenic litter or macroplastic do not exist one reason for this could be the poor availability of image annotations to train validate and test a model according to the findings portrayed and discussed in chapter 2 2 an improvement of detectability could be reached if spectral bands in the range 800 1800 nm were included in the analysis this chapter has looked into and discussed methodological approaches to classify detect or segment macroplastics in waters the ml but particularly the dl assessments of macroplastic load in aquatic regions carried out have shown that the monitoring process can be efficiently automated spatial extents increased and its results qualitatively checked dl approaches better cope with larger numbers of plastics when for example in riverine regions 35 items min flow through the field of view on the river surface martin et al 2021a van lieshout et al 2020 from an accuracy and cost benefit perspective dl methods in particular have a great potential as far as more complex detection tasks should be implemented a case in point for such a complex task would be the detection and identification of several differently sized macroplastic categories within real world images however three factors are hindering a widespread use of dl techniques i the currently existing dl approaches are less comprehensive than visual counting assessments or field surveys regarding target classes ii image data sets with annotations are not sufficiently large and diversified yet besides higher level annotations bounding boxes or polygons are required to train the next generation of dl models efficiently which will then hopefully be able to outperform currently existing models in terms of accuracy iii the methodologies tested by different authors at the moment are not fairly comparable making it hard to justify the use of a particular dl method for this application a reference data set with predetermined categories serving as a basis to test models would significantly enhance comparability 4 from category detection to macroplastic monitoring close range rs based observations of the aquatic environment can contribute to a long term and large scale macroplastic monitoring while temporal assessments still find little attention spatial coverages have been enlarged martin et al 2021a for instance managed to conduct a national scale beach litter survey and van lieshout et al 2020 examined five river locations repeating such semi automated works year by year or season by season would create an unprecedented and solid data base about macroplastic pollution in aquatic environments which could enlighten some complex spatiotemporal variations in macroplastic transport dynamics van emmerik 2021 artificial intelligence based analysis provides four possible ways to gain information these are summarized in fig 4 classifying images a merely results in retrieving information about occurrence or absence of categories in images or image tiles examples of such an output have been presented by garcia garin et al 2021 or marin et al 2021 if semantic segmentation b is applied each pixel of an image will be assigned a categorial label wang et al 2018 as illustrated by bao et al 2018 jakovljevic et al 2020 or kataoka and nihei 2020 the semantic approach enables a calculation of the macroplastic category covered area if the images are georeferenced however precise object locations cannot be derived unless practitioners focus on object detection c which increases the level of evaluable data object detection has been accomplished by martin et al 2021a de vries et al 2021 and van lieshout et al 2020 and serves to document where and how many objects are located within the image e g items km2 object detection further enables an automated counting of those objects and creation of object rankings finally instance segmentation d retrieves the largest amount of information by predicting instance masks namely occurrence object location count size and form such outputs are displayed in kylili et al 2021 or deng et al 2021 with this information more precise quantities of litter categories could be calculated however the quality of such outcomes always depends on the performance of the model further factors that potentially influence the monitoring of macroplastics are extreme events and natural hazards such as floods or storms harsh realistic environmental conditions and vegetation the effect of those parameters on the automated monitoring process as well as the influence of measuring predominantly during daylight should be discussed in the future 5 conclusion detection and identification of macroplastics is essential to get an overall picture of the magnitude of socioeconomic and health related damage that plastic pollution brings along this is currently mostly being done with traditional monitoring methods such as manual surveys or visual counting which severely lack automation close range remote sensing combined with an artificial intelligence based analysis has the potential to remedy this and provide insight into pathways and distribution patterns of macroplastics within this work we have shown that the spatial and spectral resolution of images strongly influence which categories materials and size classes of plastics can realistically be evaluated using close range remote sensing thus depending on the data at hand more or less complex questions can be answered ranging from litter detection to precise category identification nonetheless given the big variety of macroplastic objects and their greatly varying spectral properties it is to be assumed that not all items can be successfully detected especially not with one universal algorithm however nir and swir data from 780 to 2500 nm crucially support an unambiguous detection and identification of macroplastic materials or objects apart from increasing spectral information shape recognition techniques provide discriminative ability too multi feature algorithms incorporating several spectral and or geometric parameters and learning based methodologies have therefore become an irreplaceable tool for a reasonable detection and identification of macroplastics today yet to date none of the discussed automated approaches is able to replace traditional macroplastic monitoring approaches such as visual counting or site surveys this is not least due to the challenges scientists and practitioners have been confronted with in the field essentially each area under investigation being it coastal marine or riverine waters has its own disturbing patterns such as macroplastic look alikes artefacts due to illumination or interfering environmental factors which complicate assessments despite these challenges the potential of an artificial intelligence based analysis of image data is growing while at the moment approaches are only programmed or trained to recognize one to an arbitrary number of classes this number will most likely increase in the future as soon as more ground truth annotated image data are available and published comprehensiveness is a key factor for a good monitoring procedure and particularly dl models have proven to cope well with predicting several hundreds of categories therefore framework conditions should be specially designed for close range remote sensing approaches monitoring macroplastics to create a basis for comparability and harmonization in the future almost all discussed ml or dl approaches must cope with handling small data sets although several data bases do exist which can be used to supplement proprietary training data availability and accessibility of image data with annotations is a bottleneck in order to build successful and automated monitoring applications much larger amounts of data will be required an important aim is the collection of unbiased data in addition challenges such as an equal consideration in detection of smaller objects or heavily weathered ones are being addressed but there is still room for improvement for example benchmark datasets could be created to test the ability of different dl approaches on detecting small objects to the best of our knowledge dl approaches incorporating multi or hyperspectral data sets and therefore improving classification detection or identification by leveraging from a larger and more diverse feature space do not exist such models fed with proven key features e g nir or swir absorption bands of macroplastics could support decision making processes within dl frameworks and increase generalization capabilities of models furthermore it is highly probable that with the support of dl approaches an upscaling of the current extent of macroplastic observation succeeds temporally as well as spatially we conclude that a proper object detection or semantic or instance based segmentation can most likely be achieved by combining multiple relevant spectral wavelengths geometric features and an automated and efficient deep learning based method to discriminate between the multitude of

15619,detection and identification of macroplastic debris in aquatic environments is crucial to understand and counter the growing emergence and current developments in distribution and deposition of macroplastics in this context close range remote sensing approaches revealing spatial and spectral properties of macroplastics are very beneficial to date field surveys and visual census approaches are broadly acknowledged methods to acquire information but since 2018 techniques based on remote sensing and artificial intelligence are advancing despite their proven efficiency speed and wide applicability there are still obstacles to overcome especially when looking at the availability and accessibility of data thus our review summarizes state of the art research about the visual recognition and identification of different sorts of macroplastics the focus is on both data acquisition techniques and evaluation methods including machine learning and deep learning but resulting products and published data will also be taken into account our aim is to provide a critical overview and outlook in a time where this research direction is thriving fast this study shows that most machine learning and deep learning approaches are still in an infancy state regarding accuracy and detail when compared to visual monitoring even though their results look very promising keywords

yolo you only look once object detection algorithm data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction approaches to monitor detect track and identify macroplastics or more generally spoken anthropogenic litter with support of visual techniques or remote sensing methods have become more diverse in the last decade biermann et al 2020 gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 kataoka et al 2012 kataoka and nihei 2020 kylili et al 2021 martin et al 2018 wolf et al 2020 a common denominator of these works is the advancement of knowledge about sources pathways sinks or quantities of anthropogenic litter in the natural environment while the water quality of european waters is regularly measured for several pollutants such as pesticides nutrients pharmaceuticals or phytoplankton innovative parameters such as macroplastics are to date less monitored although adverse effects of plastic are seen as one of the most pressing global environmental problems german environment agency 2017 loos et al 2018 the pathways of macroplastics in particular from the interior of a continent via rivers and lakes towards the sea is influenced by many barriers including sluices barrages or vegetation traps on top of that changing water levels may temporarily mobilize plastic debris from riverbanks or shores thus huge regional differences in abundance of plastic debris already occur in the river compartments because of these regional differences detailed investigations are essential to determine or improve plastic transfer rates towards marine regions gonzález fernández et al 2021 van emmerik et al 2022 in order to monitor these dynamics research in the field of macroplastic monitoring with a focus on automation and affordability is essential to grasp the real extent of macroplastic pollution in the respective environment however there are still many questions to be answered such as how to unambiguously monitor macroplastics using spectral information or how to automate the time and labor intensive plastic field surveys in a way that data can be collected more frequently with larger spatial scale and in a more harmonious way in the past a high number of surveys were conducted sometimes with the support of citizen science reporting numbers of litter abundance distribution measures or details about detected plastic or litter objects such as compositions or size ranges bergmann et al 2016 bui et al 2022 chambault et al 2018 kiessling et al 2019 tramoy et al 2019 vlachogianni et al 2018 nevertheless most of these studies lack in terms of spatial and temporal extent as well as in transferability if methods are tailored to specific aquatic regions owing to high needs of resources human labor as well as time but also because of various competing monitoring approaches provoking a lack of standards these studies have a limited potential in providing a fundamental understanding of sources pathways sinks or quantities of anthropogenic litter in aquatic environments vriend et al 2020 for riverine regions the visual monitoring approach proposed by gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 encouraged consistency and harmonization floating macro litter larger than 2 5 cm was counted and categorized during observation sessions with the jrc floating litter monitoring app in total 32 institutions implemented the monitoring scheme on several rivers in 15 eu and non eu countries thereby achieving a harmonization of data and metadata with repetition and incorporation into wider monitoring approaches for instance by van emmerik et al 2018 castro jiménez et al 2019 or crosti et al 2018 the first standard monitoring procedure for riverine regions was created to date this broadly applicable approach is a state of the art in the field of macroplastic load quantification in rivers however visual observation also has its disadvantages considering the observer bias produced the potentially disturbing environmental conditions the diverse characteristics of the macroplastic items and the low degree of automation gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 van emmerik et al 2018 the potential of remote sensing based approaches to detect identify and quantify the macroplastic load on beaches river surface waters at riverbanks or on marine water surfaces is growing while a wider area can be covered in a similar quality as with visual monitoring approaches there are options of automated and more objective evaluation saving time and human resources van lieshout et al 2020 successfully performed a semi automated evaluation of floating debris larger than 5 cm on the river water surface utilizing a camera and a convolutional neural network cnn similarly martin et al 2018 2021a presented semi automated approaches for beaches highlighting their efficiency in time and spatial scale garcia garin et al 2021 focused on automatic monitoring of floating marine macro litter moreover the potential of multi and hyperspectral sensors is investigated for beached and floating plastics balsi et al 2021 cocking et al 2022 cortesi et al 2022 these recent developments encourage the further rise of imaging sensor and ai based macroplastic monitoring techniques downsides inherent in such approaches but also in visual monitoring techniques are that deeper layers of water or subsoil can hardly be assessed with regard to the macroplastic or litter load due to missing sight high absorption or reflection of radiation wetting or submergence as well as weathering of items also negatively influence the litter detectability garaba and harmel 2022 moshtaghi et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge all of the currently existing close range remote sensing based studies focussing on the automatic evaluation of macroplastic or litter load in aquatic environments have in common that they evaluate the occurrence of one or a few object classes 12 only for a certain area and point in time one reason might be limited data availability which leads to a bottleneck in case of machine and deep learning approaches since a large amount of data is required for a robust model training this state is likely to remain unchanged unless more sensors are installed to systematically record data at one or several locations and over longer periods of time more limitations to the monitoring process are owed to the fact that the list of litter or plastic classification guidelines is long but the remote sensing perspective is not properly considered to date this affects both the compatibility and comparability of approaches furthermore in contrast to far range remote sensing the close range remote sensing view on macroplastic currently mostly focuses on the area of visible light only very few recent studies incorporate near infrared nir and shortwave infrared swir bands to quantify plastic load in aquatic environments balsi et al 2021 cortesi et al 2022 this review is intended to provide an insight into how remote sensing sensors can be deployed for detection identification and quantification of macroplastics a closer look is taken on the spectral and spatial properties of imaging sensors and its potential to portray macroplastics as well as to discriminate it from natural materials occurring in the field chapter 2 both the strengths and limits of the remote sensing based approaches are to be discussed in chapter 3 we review and assess evaluation procedures from pixel based approaches over object based segmentation and machine learning techniques to deep cnn based classifications finally chapter 4 clarifies how plastic quantities can be retrieved from images after an ai based analysis 2 potential of remote sensing sensors for the detection and identification of macroplastic litter 2 1 interrelations of spatial resolution coverage and macroplastic object details the aim of this chapter is to grasp the full range of macroplastics which can realistically be monitored and assessed using remote sensing rs tools this also includes highlighting the vanishing probability to detect smaller items in contrast to larger ones there are various macroplastic size definitions describing macroplastics as all plastic particles which either are larger than 25 mm and smaller than 1 m ryan et al 2019 ranging from 50 to 500 mm lebreton et al 2018 or exceeding the size of 5 mm garaba et al 2018 these definitions gain importance in the search for the optimal acquisition altitude in case of rs based applications the minimum observable macroplastic object size is largely determined by the spatial resolution achieved by the sensor a point that applies independently from any definition is that the bigger the macroplastic items are the higher are the chances for detection or identification as bigger objects contain more representative pixels andriolo et al 2022 tharani et al 2020 therefore adjusting the observation height to the macroplastic target class es can be beneficial for the subsequent data analysis in a bid to evaluate plastic pollution or litter in aquatic environments and along beaches several close range mid range and far distance rs sensing platforms have already been successfully tested these include satellites acuña ruz et al 2018 biermann et al 2020 kremezi et al 2021 topouzelis et al 2019 aircrafts garaba et al 2018 kataoka et al 2018 moy et al 2017 balloons kako et al 2012 nakashima et al 2011 ships papachristopoulou et al 2020 bridges or other elevated points kako et al 2010 van lieshout et al 2020 unmanned aerial vehicles andriolo et al 2020 balsi et al 2021 deidun et al 2018 escobar sánchez et al 2021 jakovljevic et al 2020 maharjan et al 2022 martin et al 2018 martin et al 2021a wolf et al 2020 or auvs fulton et al 2019 detecting either the occurrence of plastic or litter in general or of particular plastic or litter items table 1 describes the spatial resolutions that have been achieved when detecting macroplastic or litter objects from different altitudes and which areas have been covered lo et al 2020 have compared the impact of several parameters including acquisition altitude weather condition time of day and substrate characteristics and found that acquisition altitude is the only factor which significantly influences the accuracy of litter identification however in addition to platform height sensor specifics also determine the resulting spatial resolution an opposing factor namely the area coverage is also very decisive for many users hence many applications aim at a compromise between spatial resolution and coverable area deidun et al 2018 gonçalves et al 2019 martin et al 2018 wolf et al 2020 this review divides the existing rs based approaches used to monitor macroplastics or litter into three categories i far range ii mid range and iii close range rs approaches table 1 it primarily focusses on close range rs as defined in table 1 which also includes more permanently installed cameras on bridges or other elevated points martin et al 2018 aimed at distinguishing certain litter objects such as drink containers bottle caps and plastic bags to the best of our knowledge the authors were the first to define a clear item size boundary creating two distinct classes of objects that are more objects 4 cm or less objects 4 cm prone to misdetection gonçalves et al 2019 delimited their approach of detecting marine litter items a generic class to perform well for items between 2 and 1200 cm2 both studies have in common that they used a ground sampling distance gsd between 0 5 and 0 7 cm per pixel and fixed the threshold of detectability in the same region contrary to detection identification of specific macroplastic objects e g bottles bags straws requires a higher spatial detail due to the high variety of potential object categories present within the imagery the spatial resolution should resolve the visual differences between similar but different classes inter class variability deformations or scale variations wolf et al 2020 for instance derived litter information from images taken at an altitude of 6 m with a spatial resolution of 0 2 cm per pixel consequently the authors were able to differentiate between water vegetation sand and litter in a first step and 12 specific litter classes e g canisters bottles polystyrene packaging etc in the second run wolf et al 2020 martin et al 2018 and 2021a were all able to retrieve information about litter item occurrence item class affiliation and object location information about object size or form have not been investigated the approaches by martin et al 2018 2021a further enabled the calculation of exact frequencies per category size and form characteristics have been analyzed by deng et al 2021 or kylili et al 2021 who benefitted from a very high spatial resolution too for a more generic litter detection a ground sampling distance between 0 43 and 0 82 cm has been confirmed to be a good guideline for achieving reliable results escobar sánchez et al 2021 fallati et al 2019 garcia garin et al 2021 gonçalves et al 2019 maharjan et al 2022 the output then confirms the occurrence of litter or plastic but neither the exact category present nor information about item counts sizes and forms can be derived even for lower resolutions litter or plastic detection is possible as can be seen in deidun et al 2018 within this analysis litter items e g rope wood plastic were detected by manual image screening andriolo et al 2020 on 30 m altitude images gsd of 1 cm pixel however a bias may occur as objects from the smallest size category of 2 5 5 0 cm might be underestimated moreover observation angles can add to this bias if parts of the beach or surface waters are shown in a higher resolution than others altogether rs techniques have proven to pose fewer restrictions in terms of achievable spatial coverage and temporal resolution in comparison to other approaches e g manual surveys trawl surveys or visual counting which are highly resource and time intensive in addition with the support of many rs instruments researchers have a high level of freedom in choosing a sensor a platform and an operating height according to the respective research questions and regions under investigation one issue arising from this freedom is a potential incompatibility and incomparability between research studies among the clear advantages of the rs approach is the persistence of data once documented the data can be repeatedly analyzed with various techniques furthermore data sets for training testing and validation of machine learning ml approaches can be enlarged step by step thereby continuously expanding originally small sets of training and validation data provided that the latter are compatible disadvantages include the inability to see during night time sensor dependent or far beyond the top layer of water or sand since water for instance can be murky and opaque to certain wavelengths however this also applies to the visual counting method environmental factors such as wind rain fog sun reflection waves or clouds might also impair data acquisition next to tides or currents moving macroplastics away from the sensor view andriolo et al 2022 in most of the plastic monitoring applications considered drones have so far been equipped with red green blue rgb sensors freitas et al 2021 fusing sensors by adding other sensors with different wavelength ranges spatial resolution or multi or hyperspectral capabilities could present another great benefit of rs based applications since the use of further spectral characteristics beyond rgb or a change in perspective might improve the recognition rate of macroplastic 2 2 spectral characteristics of macroplastics plastic materials consist of natural or synthetic polymers derived from fossil fuels or biomass these polymers usually have a share of carbon based units or chains and can be supplemented by additives to fit certain requirements unep 2015 thus plastics can be of any color transparent thick or thin soft pliable or rigid and more or less durable the list of potential additives in the eu contains several hundreds of substances these additives partly influence at which wavelength and with which probability an object can be identified by a sensor beigbeder et al 2013 they can be subdivided into functional additives e g flame retardants colorants fillers and reinforcements echa 2019 another crucial influencing factor on the spectral signature is the underlying plastic material itself upon closer inspection polymers are built up from certain functional atomic groups these molecules can be excited to oscillate and rotate by absorbing radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum the characteristic oscillations of functional groups correspond to the absorption bands hesse et al 2012 thus magnitude and shape of the spectral signature are key information for the discrimination between plastic objects and other materials in particular the nir and swir range 780 2500 nm plays an important role in the detection and identification of plastic materials the visual range from 380 to 780 nm is not redundant but insufficient for the unambiguous differentiation between plastic objects and other materials garaba et al 2021 among the vast group of plastics there are more and less potent reflectors white plastic samples such as styrofoam objects have a strong reflectance and are considered to be easier to find while carbon black samples reflect weakly acuña ruz et al 2018 beigbeder et al 2013 masoumi et al 2012 also transparent objects such as foils are hard to detect as less light is reflected from the object and spectral influences from the background might cause confusion garaba et al 2021 goddijn murphy and dufau 2018 in between the good and bad reflectors there are many uniquely shaped spectral signatures of medium magnitude in principle in the visual range the apparent color of the plastic object is indicated while an overall decrease of reflectance punctuated by several absorption features occurs in the nir garaba and dierssen 2018 fig 1 displays examples of the spectral signatures of polyethylene pe in different states next to a signature of water the functional groups of pe determining the absorption features are shown beside the corresponding wavelengths these absorption features originate from the first and second overtone of ch stretching vibrations of around 1700 and 1200 nm several other absorption bands are caused by different combinations of overtones of stretching vibrations and deformation vibrations dual peak absorption features can be caused by a different behaviour regarding oscillation symmetry cammann 2001 below 1200 nm a clear assignment of molecular oscillations to absorption features is difficult due to complex combinations of oscillations pelletier and pelletier 2010 in contrast to the recycling industry engaged in recycling plastic waste and differentiating various plastic materials in real time by utilizing artificial light and a controlled environment e g bonifazi et al 2019 masoumi et al 2012 moroni and mei 2020 zhu et al 2019 rs scientists and practitioners experience several difficulties in practice when aiming at detection and identification of macroplastics under natural lighting conditions among the reasons why unambiguous discrimination between plastics and other materials occurring naturally e g green vegetation wood sun glint or artificially e g lost or discarded cotton clothes paper or glass waste is so challenging are fluctuations in atmospheric transmission and ambient light conditions due to atmospheric absorption not all plastic related absorption features or diagnostic wavelengths can be utilized for the detection of plastic materials atmospheric water vapor oxygen and carbon dioxide are among the factors contributing to this absorption gao et al 1993 as seen in fig 2 the features at around 1215 and 1730 nm are utilized most frequently due to their measurability during daylight at around 1380 and 1880 nm the atmosphere is mostly impervious for incoming radiance and at around 940 and 1140 nm the atmosphere is partly impervious due to water absorption gao et al 2000 as a consequence measuring at natural daylight can be prone to errors if no calibration procedure or atmospheric correction is applied being closer to the target object during image acquisition means that there is less atmospheric influence on the signal measuring macroplastic reflectance in the laboratory with artificial light is clearly different from measuring the same in the field a first issue is the potential current entailing movements of objects on the water surface of rivers lakes or oceans in contrast to the static object in the laboratory or on the beach which can result in changing appearance because of light effects andriolo et al 2022 secondly especially on cloudy days light conditions can change rapidly which might repeatedly force sensor recalibration in order to get results of good quality eventually relative reflectance spectra giving an insight into the approximate magnitude and shape of the target might be gathered successfully whereas absolute reflectance values are almost impossible to acquire under natural light conditions aasen et al 2018 as a consequence it should be noted that features sampled under natural light conditions may appear less distinct despite the challenges of conducting measurements in the natural aquatic environment spectral properties of plastic materials in natural environments are increasingly investigated to the best of our knowledge spectral reflectance information of macroplastics or approaches to distinguish macroplastics spectrally in a natural context and with higher spatial resolution have so far been presented by acuña ruz et al 2018 balsi et al 2018 2021 cocking et al 2022 cortesi et al 2021 2022 freitas et al 2021 garaba and dierssen 2018 2020 garaba et al 2018 2021 goddijn murphy and dufaur 2018 goddijn murphy et al 2018 guffogg et al 2021 knaeps et al 2021 kremezi et al 2021 moshtaghi et al 2021 and tasseron et al 2021 in a range of 350 to 2500 nm therefore these studies do not only embed the color of samples into their work but also the chemical structure and physical properties of the object at hand fig 2 provides an overview over several papers and the respective wavelengths that have been observed utilized or recommended to detect or to identify macroplastics what all sources have in common is the use of hyperspectral sensors this comparison includes absorption features as well as other diagnostic wavelengths the term diagnostic wavelength refers to a wavelength which can be utilized to differentiate between two materials e g plastic and water due to a significantly different reflectance behavior fig 2 illustrates the relative position of these features within the spectrum as well as the frequency of occurrence particularly apparent are also polymer specific absorption features for high density polyethylene hdpe ldpe polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyethylene terephthalate pet polyvinyl chloride pvc polycarbonate pc and polyester a noticeable observation is that pe including ldpe and hdpe and pp are spectrally rather similar moreover pet ps and pc either miss the typical plastic absorption peak around 1215 nm or it is very weakly positioned due to being the second peak of a dual peak absorption feature balsi et al 2018 cammann 2001 tasseron et al 2021 these peculiarities within the spectral signature of the different polymer types portrayed in fig 2 indicate that one or two universally applicable wavelengths representing plastic specific absorption features might be insufficient in differentiating plastics from other materials as they do not cover all plastics in circulation concluding from fig 2 principal absorption features of aliphatic and aromatic macroplastics can be found roughly in the ranges 900 to 990 nm 1130 to 1260 nm 1380 to 1480 nm and 1660 to 1732 nm regarding the polymer type specific absorption features studies are often comparable despite slight variations from 1 to 23 nm in contrast spectral patterns below 1000 nm and above 1800 nm are less frequently reported garaba et al 2020 goddijn murphy and williamson 2019 both the slight variations in absorption feature location and the reduced occurrence of reported spectral patterns below 1000 and above 1800 nm can be caused by sensor specifics sensors can be equipped with different photodiodes the spectral responsivity of each sensor varies depending on the semiconductor material utilized theoretically silicon photodiodes can only depict the spectral region from 200 to 1050 nm while an indium gallium arsenide photodiode provides a range from 900 to 2 600 nm and indium arsenide or gallium arsenide photodiodes are sensitive within a range from 900 to 1700 nm adão et al 2017 the sensitivity of the sensor mainly determines what can be measured solutions for these spectral restrictions are found for instance in tasseron et al 2021 who gathered data with a double camera system covering the range from 400 to 1700 nm in addition sensors made up of more than one detector covering a range from 350 2500 nm could be utilized garaba et al 2021 moshtaghi et al 2021 another criterion is the spectral resolution which ranges from 1 to 12 nm in the reviewed studies broader bands undersample the available spectral information present which can lead to slight shifts in absorption feature position while narrow bands capture distinctive spectral signatures paoletti et al 2019 in contrast when acquiring rgb or multi spectral imagery the undersampling of spectral information leads to a point where this imagery offers less spectral information whereas the spatial resolution can be more precise recent studies have shown that hyperspectral pushbroom scanners can be utilized for monitoring plastic polymers under natural light conditions balsi et al 2021 cocking et al 2022 however plastic objects that are moving continuously and quickly due to water flow prevent their detection by such scanners balsi et al 2021 hyperspectral 2d imagers might provide a better solution to this issue aasen et al 2018 2 3 spectral delimitation of macroplastics in real world scenarios the surrounding environment has a big impact on the detection and identification of macroplastics external factors influencing the degree of reflectance of macroplastic objects are wetting submergence and weathering garaba et al 2021 garaba and dierssen 2018 moshtaghi et al 2021 their effects on the signal have not yet been investigated extensively moshtaghi et al 2021 so far it is known that the spectral reflectance of wet plastic items is lower than that of dry objects garaba et al 2021 garaba and dierssen 2018 however it is not yet fully understood how strong the decrease in reflectance is when items are being wetted or submerged furthermore this behavior is presumably linked to the respective polymer type and additives inherent of the plastic item as well as its hydrological behavior garaba et al 2021 moshtaghi et al 2021 also the type of water turbid clear artificial potentially containing a variety of water constituents e g total suspended matter colored dissolved organic matter phytoplankton and the type of wavelength play a role garaba and harmel 2022 knaeps et al 2021 moshtaghi et al 2021 therefore inherent material dependent and apparent on illumination and observation geometry dependent optical properties of water are important to consider mishra et al 2017 regarding the weathering processes ocean or natural harvested plastics have been analyzed several times for their spectral shape and magnitude balsi et al 2018 garaba et al 2021 garaba and dierssen 2018 leone et al 2022 moshtaghi et al 2021 weather and atmosphere can affect plastic by i temperature and ii humidity their variation respectively iii wind iv rain v atmospheric gases or pollutants as well as vi uv light photodegradation photodegradation causes chemical changes to the polymers and thus might impact spectral shape and magnitude of plastic samples the degree of chemical change is related to the additives contained in a sample that can improve or compromise the weathering performance mckeen 2019 due to the complexity of the weathering process moshtaghi et al 2021 observed less distinct features when investigating real weathered samples while garaba et al 2021 detected nearly identical spectral shapes as well as absorption features further research will be necessary to properly assess the impact of biofilm or different types and degrees of weathering on the spectral reflectivity of plastic objects the question of which wavelengths best define the present classes e g plastic vegetation wood can also depend on the study area it is more important to differentiate plastics from sun glint on the water in marine regions or vegetation in coastal regions than to separate plastic pixels or objects from classes or perturbations which most likely will not occur in the respective study area andriolo et al 2022 thereby diagnostic wavelengths can help during classification or detection in order to separate turbid or clear water from plastic goddijn murphy and dufaur 2018 goddijn murphy et al 2018 recommend the two wavelengths of 750 and 850 nm and moshtaghi et al 2021 the 850 900 nm region as well as the 1070 nm band plain water shows a low spectral reflectance at these bands while plastics tend to reflect stronger fig 1 according to moshtaghi et al 2021 up to slight submergence of 5 cm the 1070 nm band is usable for distinguishing between water and their plastic target nevertheless higher sediment concentrations and depths weaken the spectral signature and the spectral region below 1070 nm is better suited for detecting submerged plastics than the region beyond this is confirmed by garaba and harmel 2022 who set the borders of detectability from uv to 1200 nm moshtaghi et al 2021 further proposed the 1730 nm band to differentiate plastic from wood based on the fact that wood does not exhibit any absorption feature there while plastic does however diagnostic wavelengths facilitate the discrimination of plastic objects from water or wood only as long as the samples are dry clear differentiation is impeded as soon as a third fourth or fifth material class or look alikes appear moshtaghi et al 2021 in summary unambiguous differentiation of macroplastic from the natural environment or naturally occurring items let alone from other macroplastics in varying daylight conditions is a complex endeavor knaeps et al 2021 however first approaches with regard to separability of spectra either between plastic types or between plastic and background items e g wood have been presented in recently published literature on this basis and if inherent and apparent optical properties from a larger variety of naturally harvested macroplastics in a range from almost untouched over weathered biofilmed to severely damaged or in altered state is spectrally analysed it is very likely that discrimination accuracy can be further increased and analysis brought to a more complex level provided that appropriate methods will be applied for these tasks 3 possibilities and limitations of automated analysis of macroplastics a huge variety of methods has been applied to detect identify or quantify macroplastics in different aquatic environments next to computationally less intensive methods such as indices based approaches ml and deep learning dl methods are frequently utilized especially in the past five years approaches based on artificial intelligence were emerging kylili et al 2019 martin et al 2018 3 1 indices and further pixel based thresholding techniques macroplastic related indices as displayed in table 2 or proposed by goddijn murphy and dufaur 2018 goddijn murphy et al 2018 could enable simple affordable and fast differentiation between water and plastics kühn et al 2004 advantages consist in choosing an algorithm working in the nir or swir region where object coloration does not interfere with the classification goddijn murphy and dufaur 2018 moshtaghi et al 2021 and in the ability that these cope with radiance as well as reflectance data kühn et al 2004 despite their ability to provide some distinction between materials its applicability on highly complex environments is limited goddijn murphy and dufaur 2018 argue that their algorithm is plastic type specific depending on the items degree of opacity and volume and influenced by fluctuating accuracy under natural light conditions e g passing clouds the authors further highlight that one universal algorithm applicable to all marine plastic litter is not feasible and further information retrieved for instance by shape recognition techniques could complement the differentiation goddijn murphy and dufaur 2018 kühn et al 2004 implemented a hydrocarbon index hi by utilizing the absorption feature at around 1730 nm which is characteristic of hydrocarbons the authors were able to monitor hydrocarbon bearing materials such as oil contaminated sites artificial grass and plastic later garaba and dierssen 2018 adapted the algorithm for the absorption feature at 1210 nm the performance of the hi is strongly dependent on the choice of bands e g 1197 nm 1216 nm 1235 nm as well as the absorption feature position which is not uniform for all plastic objects due to the polymer specific absorption bands kühn et al 2004 according to this we hypothesize that it should be working best for pe and pp as the absorption features of these polymers are distinct in that wavelength region for pet and ps an adapted version of the index might be more suitable see fig 2 according to kühn et al 2004 methodological limits of the hi include that vegetated areas may appear noisy given that natural hydrocarbons or polymers can occur dark colored hydrocarbons are not detected reliably and misclassifications might occur since not all hydrocarbon bearing materials are plastics garaba and dierssen 2018 confirmed the efficiency of both hi with the one at 1730 nm having fewer false positives however both hi were mainly tested over land garaba and dierssen 2018 kühn et al 2004 an application over natural surface waters e g containing algae should be examined especially in situations when various materials are present and when aiming at a precise classification one single algorithm might be too error prone in this case multi criteria approaches as proposed by biermann et al 2020 come into focus the authors applied a floating debris index fdi next to the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to differentiate materials at hand into several complex classes including seaweed water timber and foam the fdi originates from the floating algae index but utilizes the red edge band at 740 nm instead of the red band in order to benefit from the difference between nir and baseline reflection of nir according to the authors this resulted in i the approach being more stable against atmospheric and observational changes and ii separating nir reflecting materials such as seaweed timber and spume from nir absorbing materials such as water however in many aquatic environments turbidity is too high for the algorithm to function efficiently biermann et al 2020 because with increasing sediment concentration the ndvi of the target class water is increasing as well due to higher reflectance in the nir band moshtaghi et al 2021 as biermann et al 2020 trains a naïve bayes algorithm for classification this blurring of classes in the feature space affects the accuracy of class assignment by the naïve bayes algorithm biermann et al 2020 moshtaghi et al 2021 have repeated this two variable analysis and concluded that plastic reflectance is much more diverse than so far presented by biermann et al 2020 the authors discovered that plastic sample color impacts the outcome of the combined approach using ndvi and fdi with blue plastic samples having higher ndvi and fdi values than red or yellow samples finally moshtaghi et al 2021 found wetting or submergence of samples to decrease fdi values thus impairing the classification result as well cortesi et al 2021 examined the suitability of the three indices displayed in table 2 for discriminating plastics in their workflow the normalized difference water index 2 ndwi2 the plastic index pi and the reversed ndvi rndvi however a histogram of pi values for plastic and non plastic pixels shows no distinctness between their classes besides the aforementioned indices based approaches color space based approaches also drew some attention to this day one can find this building block in various methods including ml approaches rgb and hue saturation value hsv are two different representations of the same data some tasks that may be difficult with one representation can become easy with another chollet 2018 this is the functional principle of color space based approaches wang et al 2015 recommended the hsv color space to assist in debris detection as it is assumed to be more robust to illumination changes and able to mitigate impacts of disturbances such as reflections in contrast kako et al 2010 utilized the lightness a function of rgb values for monitoring plastic litter this firstly resulted in a lack of detecting dark pixels due to a too high threshold and secondly gave rise to a set of false positives for example in the form of sun glare the need to designate a subjective threshold entails low comparability between days seasons and years as well as study regions owing to varying illumination conditions and litter items present this in turn negatively affects detectability and may lead to a bias in long term assessments some improvement was later reached with a similar approach presented by kataoka et al 2012 the authors proposed a methodology employing the cieluv color space which in contrast to the rgb color space integrates color differences in a perceptually uniform way consequently brighter and darker plastic pixels were more efficiently assessed and identified against the beach background with the exception of black plastic pixels on top of that a three day image composite technique was used to enhance false positive detection by considering pixels with constant values only while false positive detection was reduced some true positives e g plastics moved from winds remained unrecognized due to the composite technique despite these advancements the disadvantage of choosing a subjective threshold remains as it is static across time and imagery in kataoka and nihei 2020 the authors integrated the cieluv part of the approach by kataoka et al 2012 into their new approach which aimed at detecting and quantifying floating macro debris on river surfaces from video material the authors found that the cieluv color difference approach appears to be helpful in riverine regions as plastic pixels show a significantly high variation from the riverine background though beside the challenging threshold definition the approach is incapable of properly extracting further details such as plastic litter object categories or the plastic litter mass flux due to a missing third dimension or further spectral or object based information even if the approach was combined with hyperspectral image analysis as suggested by the authors more variety of plastic objects possibly occurring in rivers would have to be considered 3 2 object based approaches and machine learning ml approaches which also includes dl techniques are trained these approaches require image data samples relevant to a specific task e g detection of macroplastic whose statistical structure can be analysed in order to identify rules for automating the image classification detection or identification task chollet 2018 similar to color space based approaches ml algorithms utilize representations or transformations of data for these rules though the added value of ml approaches lies in the learning aspect the model therefore searches for the best representations or transformations from a predefined space of possibilities chollet 2018 in the field of macroplastic or litter detection and identification the most widely used ml algorithms excluding dl approaches in this case include random forest rf or support vector machine svm classifiers acuña ruz et al 2018 cortesi et al 2021 2022 freitas et al 2021 ge et al 2016 gonçalves et al 2019 martin et al 2018 methodological details of the case studies discussed are shown in table 3 martin et al 2018 for instance applied the histogram of oriented gradients hog feature descriptor proposed by dalal and triggs in 2005 to generate a feature space for the rf classifier while gonçalves et al 2019 used four color feature descriptors rgb hsv cielab and ycbcr to deduce 12 features for their rf classifier dalal and triggs 2005 in contrast to dl systems where no feature space must be predefined the approaches by martin et al 2018 and gonçalves et al 2019 are more subjective both gonçalves et al 2019 and martin et al 2018 assessed litter loads on beaches gonçalves et al 2019 2020a found that they outperformed the hog based approach by martin et al 2018 citing the f score as the reason this is controversial due to several reasons first martin et al 2018 go more into detail and attempt to differentiate not only between litter and the natural surrounding environment but mainly focus on the classification of either drink containers bottle caps or plastic bags second both authors have utilized their own but not the same data sets i e there is no standard for a fair comparison of methods duarte et al 2020 third the amount of training samples varied which also affects the result nevertheless questioning the utilized feature space is indispensable since it has a great influence on the performance of the object detector table 3 the hog feature descriptor is for example capable of detecting objects of different sizes but was actually proposed for pedestrian detection zou et al 2019 color feature descriptors on the contrary are limited in the recognition of transparent objects or objects similarly colored as the background haralick texture based features were excluded by gonçalves et al 2019 from the outset due to their low efficacy thus issues during processing such as large amounts of false positives can occur owing to a too small too large or unfit feature space which depends on the data analyst s knowledge apart from rf and svm classifiers a shallow neural network with only one hidden layer fed with color space based features was proposed by pinto et al 2021 who aimed at the detection of four plastic categories bottles fishing ropes octopus pots and fragments the authors stated that the detection performance was sufficient when classes with low inter class color variability were targeted however for categories with a high variance of intra class colors performance was poor moreover spectral angle mapping sam and spectral correlation mapping scm have been successfully explored on multi or hyperspectral data in order to discriminate plastic polymers or litter cocking et al 2022 gonçalves and andriolo 2022 during spectral angle mapping the spectral similarity of a samples spectrum is compared to reference spectra resulting in an angle describing the degree of similarity of materials here too an increasing diversity of targets might complicate determining an appropriate threshold angle cocking et al 2022 acuña ruz et al 2018 found after applying rf svm and linear discriminant analysis to multispectral world view 3 data that a digital classification for types of anthropogenic marine debris was only possible for their category styrofoam as it has unique spectral patterns in contrast to other classes thus all other types were classified into a generic plastic category although this work is not based on close range rs several aspects are transferable first styrofoam has been found to be distinctly detectable in contrast to other plastic objects bak et al 2019 wolf et al 2020 second the authors highlighted the dependence of predictive model performance on training and validation data further random subsampling of training and validation data was recommended for cross validation as it fostered the comparability between algorithms due to a more robust outcome acuña ruz et al 2018 yet most reviewed studies rely on a single hold out validation instead of a k fold validation freitas et al 2021 were among the first to acquire and analyze hyperspectral field data with rf and svm classifiers similarly to acuña ruz et al 2018 the approach is not based on close range rs but can entail promising results for the latter in their project the authors placed artificial targets on the marine water surface and captured hyperspectral data under natural light conditions on two days on day one training data were gathered on day two test data were collected while the authors did approximate realistic outdoor conditions a more disjoint collection of training and test data or a more diverse data acquisition campaign could have been conducted in order to achieve a more robust test of the learned algorithms consequently information on target pixels belonging to the classes orange plastic white plastic or ropes and non target pixels surroundings such as water and land in training and test data do not differ much this might result in an overestimation of the algorithms usefulness close range remote sensing based multi or hyperspectral analyses were conducted by balsi et al 2021 cortesi et al 2021 2022 and cocking et al 2022 these case studies show that additional spectral features in the feature space can contribute to plastic polymer type identification however cortesi et al 2021 has found that adding the pi rndvi and ndwi2 to their feature space did not result in significant improvements this emphasizes the importance but also the challenge of selecting suitable features a typical element of object based approaches is a rule set which is usually determined subjectively by the user this rule set is applied to object segments that have to be extracted in a first step examples of such an approach were presented by bao et al 2018 escobar sánchez et al 2021 or gonçalves et al 2020a within such approaches the segmentation of objects as well as the decision on which rules to implement significantly determine the quality of classification gonçalves et al 2020a a comparison of the given studies is difficult since different data sets features and validation parameters have been chosen bao et al 2018 for example solely based on color specifics to differentiate and segment litter from the natural background namely green and blue band histogram statistics by proceeding that way not only segmented litter items but natural items such as branches and leaves standing out from the yellowish and sandy background were highlighted once more misclassifications were thus unavoidable when spectral characteristics of objects overlapped e g footsteps riffles in the sand this has been similarly experienced by gonçalves et al 2020a who repeated the method all in all the feature space chosen by bao et al 2018 is too small and therefore not very suitable for a clear differentiation of litter from further beach debris in more complex environments gonçalves et al 2020a also spatio temporal variations remain unconsidered kako et al 2010 despite this the authors named an advantage of an object based approach which consists in a less fragmented result in contrast to pixel based classification techniques escobar sánchez et al 2021 attempted to distinguish between segments of macrolitter and the surrounding sandy beach vegetation shells algae and stones with support of the maximum likelihood svm and rf classifiers their main aim included a comparison of spatial ospar a macrolitter monitoring framework and the formerly mentioned more automated approach the authors concluded that their approach was not sufficiently accurate and rather recommend the utilization of dl approaches besides evaluating the time and cost efficiency the authors have criticized their low segment size chosen during segmentation thus large items could not be properly counted as the number of segments per item would lead to a significant overestimation of the actual litter count their comparison of the time required the costs and the outcomes result in the finding that their approach did not contribute much to the achievement of the set goal in summary the case studies have shown that in contrast to a visual census litter monitoring can be accelerated and automated extensively by utilizing rf based and svm based approaches or shallow cnns gonçalves et al 2019 martin et al 2018 on the other hand there are authors who criticise automated litter monitoring mainly arguing with the reliability and accuracy of model results escobar sánchez et al 2021 we have observed that only in a few cases the aim was differentiating between certain litter or plastic objects gonçalves et al 2020b martin et al 2018 pinto et al 2021 this could indicate a weakness in the methodology or utilized rgb data sets in that context to this date these approaches can hardly keep up with the currently existing visual monitoring approaches escobar sánchez et al 2021 gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 nevertheless the examples above further showed that in contrast to methods like indices or pixel based simple thresholding ml approaches tend to perform better the likely reason for this is that these approaches base their classification decision on more than just one or two manually selected feature s this makes a decisive contribution to a more precise discrimination between classes by virtue of the learning and optimization procedure ml algorithms qualify for more complex classification tasks the most crucial factor though remains the choice of the feature space color space based features are most frequently chosen however complementing those features with additional spectral bands in the nir or swir region or shape features might provide a stronger discrimination ability during ml classification pixel or object based image analysis as explored by cortesi et al 2021 cortesi et al 2022 or suggested by goddijn murphy and dufaur 2018 yet we argue that clear evidence for this is missing as no standards are adhered to in the comparison of methods which raises the question of framework conditions during analysis in order for automatic monitoring approaches to ever become competitive with visual approaches or field surveys a great deal of work still needs to be done in terms of category differentiation to assess the occurrence and frequency of litter or plastic items on a higher level and benchmarking ml models and algorithms 3 3 deep learning in contrast to ml dl is characterized by learning features from successive layers of increasingly meaningful representations which puts the depth of a model into focus chollet 2018 within the reviewed papers depths ranging from 3 to 284 layers have been observed kako et al 2020 kylili et al 2021 however due to a lack of transparency regarding the utilized architectures this observation is not exhaustive since dl models learn hidden and sophisticated features from these layers a user intervention in terms of manual feature engineering is unnecessary this independence from prespecifying features is one of the main strengths of dl with another one being that dl models have the ability to generalize knowledge paoletti et al 2019 a high generalization capability implies a good performance on data which is completely new to the model thus maximizing generalization is the aim when applying dl techniques chollet 2018 efforts to maximize generalization are often accompanied by overfitting overfitting occurs when a model is too tailored to the training data set an overfitted model is less capable of achieving a good performance on unseen data the best possible balance between optimization and generalization can be reached by modifying the model width or depth and lastly its capacity decreasing the model capacity reduces memorization capability but may also allow for underfitting enlarging the model capacity can positively support the pattern recognition as more low mid and high level features can be integrated among others at the same time issues such as overparameterization and overfitting increased computational expanse vanishing gradients or the degradation problem might occur and need to be considered chollet 2018 he et al 2015 furthermore adding dropout or weight regularization techniques could support an increase in generalization capability the intention to employ a well performing model sooner or later leads to the question of how deep or wide a cnn should be in addition several other decisions regarding cnn architecture e g resnet densenet vgg hyperparameters e g learning rate number of epochs or optimization strategies e g dropout regularization have to be made by the practitioners chollet 2018 as consequence of the large flexibility practitioners have in terms of architecture and model capacity targets training strategies or outcome e g object detection segmentation very different approaches have been tested and published with the aim to detect plastic litter or litter items within imagery some crucial points of these studies have been examined and are compared below unfortunately not all studies provide a full insight into their approach nor the data used this severely affects their reproducibility which would be important with a view to understanding and comparing different methods in all of the 28 deep learning approaches examined a tendency can be observed to discriminate not only plastic from natural materials but identify specific plastic items fig 3 shows which macroplastic litter object categories left and non plastic but anthropogenic litter categories right have been investigated so far bottles and plastic bags are the front runners in terms of identifying macroplastic items closely followed by fishing gear and ropes though in this context a holistic classification scheme is missing to date the dl based studies evaluate the occurrence location or mask of arbitrary 1 to 12 macroplastic target classes the median and average of observed categories amounts to 1 and 3 5 respectively visual observation or field surveys usually focus on a fuller range of macroplastics present in the natural environment and include 1 to 124 categories during investigation depending on the protocol used hanke et al 2013 helcom 2021 ryan et al 2019 here the median of used categories amounts to 29 beyond that several authors have mentioned that there are categories which are more likely to be detected by a model de vries et al 2021 politikos et al 2021 in addition to object size this also depends on the intra class variability therefore tharani et al 2020 proposed a log based attention layer which is supposed to improve performance particularly for small objects with the idea of dilated convolution deng et al 2021 suggested applying another potentially successful adaptation to improve the feature extraction ability for small objects by setting a certain dilation rate dilated convolution is capable of changing the receptive field size thereby increasing the resolution of intermediate feature maps this could result in better semantic and spatial information retrieval which as a consequence should affect object detection and instance segmentation accuracy the development of object detection strategies for certain plastic litter object categories has presumably been evoked by object based dl models such as region based cnn rcnn or you only look once yolo which have been introduced from 2014 on as well as advances in computing resources girshick et al 2014 paoletti et al 2019 redmon et al 2016 since then several updated or faster versions of these core algorithms have been presented with yolo v5 and mask rcnn being more recent updates he et al 2017 jocher et al 2020 these models make up almost half of the approaches used in this application field in this context yolo is a group of one stage detectors while the rcnns are multi stage detectors rcnns propose object candidate boxes using the selective search algorithm and later based on the extracted features of a box predict one object category for each region due to computation of redundant features on overlapping proposals the detection speed is slowed down although this drawback has been addressed and faster rcnn a successor performs better in terms of speed some computational redundancy still persists at detection stage eventually the advancement of r cnns has produced feature pyramid networks which are a basic building block of many latest detectors zou et al 2019 on the contrary yolo models are very fast these models divide the complete input image into regions and predict bounding boxes as well as class specific confidence scores per region simultaneously still yolo detectors have difficulties with localizing small objects redmon et al 2016 maharjan et al 2022 has compared the yolo detectors v2 to v5 and found that yolov5 is most useful for their plastic detection in rivers a similar conclusion was drawn by córdova et al 2022 who compared the yolov5 detector performance with other state of the art dl models e g faster and mask r cnn for litter detection the selection of only a few classes for training and prediction purposes is often justified with a limited amount of training data cnns are generally very flexible regarding the number of classes they can learn in addition they can deal very well with large amounts of data however an increase in the number of target classes and classification complexity requires qualitative unbiased and quantitatively balanced training data and at least a certain share of validation data such an amount of labelled data is not easily available in adequate quantities first solutions for working with such small data sets have been found in pre training the models using massive and annotated image data bases such as ms coco or imagenet or utilizing transfer learning deng et al 2009 lin et al 2014 transfer learning was applied by kylili et al 2019 while tharani et al 2020 or de vries et al 2021 employed pre training occasionally the term transfer learning is used in connection with pre training the difference is that in transfer learning both the network architecture e g vgg 16 resnet and weights are transferred while in case of pre training only the weights are reused pre training therefore allows more flexibility in terms of model architecture design shorten and khoshgoftaar 2019 the benefit of these techniques is supposed to be the prevention of overfitting and the achievement of a higher generalization ability as well as training speed shorten and khoshgoftaar 2019 zou et al 2019 critical voices argue that the effectiveness of pre training or transfer learning depends on the target task and on how well the pre trained knowledge can be transferred yosinski et al 2014 documented that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and the target task increases essentially efficiency in transfer depends on whether features from the bottom middle or top of the network are transferred the root cause for this is the change of features from being more specific than generic nonetheless the authors state that transferred features from a distant task can also perform better than random features on the contrary he et al 2019 completely questioned the paradigm of imagenet pre training the authors achieved competitive results when training models from scratch the only exception necessary included a higher number of training iterations to allow convergence while observing an accelerated convergence within pre trained models they did not necessarily improve the target task accuracy or reduced overfitting moreover he et al 2019 described training from random initialization as surprisingly robust if enough target data e g 10k exists hence collecting more annotations of target categories and increasing the number of training iterations instead of pre training could be beneficial however the actual amount of training data and available computational power are crucial factors he et al 2019 a second solution to the problem of limited training data is data augmentation data augmentation includes a number of techniques geometric transformations color space augmentations kernel filters etc to improve training data set size and quality when training a model with imbalanced classes the model would produce biased predictions towards the majority class similar to very simplified data sets imbalanced data sets can negatively affect accuracy by leveraging the fact that imbalanced classes can be equalized using data augmentation quality can be significantly enhanced by just changing the ratio between majority and minority classes however while data augmentation is indeed able to remedy some biases within the given data sets such as lighting scale or background others including poor diversity within data sets cannot be overcome diversity aspects should be considered during initial data acquisition furthermore extensively augmenting images with one type of augmentation algorithm could lead to a more biased data set than the original one thus the actual challenge of properly augmenting images lies in reducing biases the value of data augmentation is particularly evident if training and test data share the same distribution shorten and khoshgoftaar 2019 over and above that the data sets should be disjoint chollet 2018 a third option to enlarge a data set albeit tested in very few cases only is to use other published data sets on plastic litter table 4 displays different data sets as well as their type of annotations and size for the problem at hand this might not always be a proper solution as annotations can vary and practitioners might be dissatisfied with the quality nevertheless higher quality annotations such as bounding boxes or instance segmentations could be altered into simpler annotations e g tags the purpose of the insight into published data sets is to reinforce the argument that there are a lot of data available partly even in an annotated form but they are not always being accessed one of the reasons for this could be the fact that many of these are rather new despite the available data we do not want to invalidate the argument that few annotated data sets are available afterall deep cnns can handle massive amounts of data and need considerable amounts of labelled training data in theory ideal and unbiased training data for monitoring macroplastic in real world waters would cover the full range of i potential intra class variation within object categories ii illumination changes iii weather conditions iv scale changes and rotation v viewing angles vi degrees of occlusion submergence and object density vii background patterns and viii noise due to the limited amount of training data that practitioners have at their disposal each of the bullet points is hard to meet in case of dynamic water regions e g rivers oceans motion blur adds to the challenges zou et al 2019 tata et al 2021 for example rose to some visual challenges by putting a focus on sample diversity within their data set to better represent the harshness of marine environments tharani et al 2020 built an easy and a hard test set to address these difficulties wolf et al 2020 reported shadows and surface reflected glitter as problematic artefacts within their work and recommended either avoiding acquisition conditions which promote their appearance or utilizing filters to mitigate these influences for better model performance in the future with a rising complexity of the data set a weaker performance of the models can be expected córdova et al 2022 kylili et al 2021 among the reviewed papers major differences regarding the character of utilized data sets appeared besides authors who rather face the challenge of real world complex object detection scenarios there exists a range of works using artificially appearing and or very mildly polluted images kylili et al 2019 tata et al 2021 though reality can look very different the issue posed by utilizing simplified training data e g very low pollution one plastic item per image great illumination conditions etc consists in a potential misjudgement of model performance if a model has not learned diverse realistic and potentially complex visual patterns of plastic items in training data it will not be able to recognize them in the prediction phase this clearly affects its generalization ability if the test data are a more realistic data set maharjan et al 2022 the artificial creation of optimized conditions can therefore be undesirable for more complex real world applications in contrast including images with higher densities of objects objects in different states of their lifecycle or objects which were subject to weathering processes is necessary to build efficient real world applications moreover a positive side effect of enlarging the data set is the natural prevention of overfitting chollet 2018 in the training phase weights are ideally altered in a way that the loss on the training data is minimized in a bid to evaluate a model while parameters are still improved users have the option of a simple hold out validation k fold cross validation or an iterated k fold cross validation with shuffling experts recommend cross validation for rather small data sets to avoid high variance between validation splits which in this field is almost unavoidable for the time being chollet 2018 garcia garin et al 2021 while much effort has been put in coping with small amounts of data most practitioners let go of this opportunity to reliably evaluate their models and apply a simple hold out validation a reason for this could be the higher computational costs when testing their model on unseen data van lieshout et al 2020 have observed a decrease in performance that had originally been trained at just one location at new but similar locations this decrease was more pronounced the more the character of the new location differed from the original location however the authors also found that even if the model generalization ability was restricted on unseen data of new locations adding site specific training instances of 50 to 1800 images helped to improve the generalization ability this once again confirms the value of a large training data set the veracity of visual observation results cannot be re examined in all cases e g rivers nor corrected for possible errors caused by the human visual performance angelini et al 2019 contrarily cnn models can easily be evaluated for their performance using an unseen test data set for object detection tasks in general the most common evaluation criterion is the average precision ap zou et al 2019 this metric can either be evaluated for each category or over all categories map and describes the average detection precision under different recalls zou et al 2019 moreover the threshold based intersection over union can be applied to evaluate how well the predicted box matches the ground truth box for the reviewed studies no widely accepted evaluation criteria have been observed but the ap is used most frequently in the field in addition recall overall accuracy and f1 score have been used as performance measures several times in 10 7 of cases accuracy assessments were completely missing furthermore performance metrics of already existing cnns have been repeatedly compared to newly tested cnn performance metrics however accuracy assessments and comparisons between stand alone approaches hardly work as target categories and data sets often differed to ensure an appropriate level of comparability in a direct comparison of methods data sets and target classes would have to be equal lastly deep cnns can be designed to be inclusive to multi or hyperspectral data however to the best of our knowledge dl approaches which incorporate more than rgb images to detect or identify anthropogenic litter or macroplastic do not exist one reason for this could be the poor availability of image annotations to train validate and test a model according to the findings portrayed and discussed in chapter 2 2 an improvement of detectability could be reached if spectral bands in the range 800 1800 nm were included in the analysis this chapter has looked into and discussed methodological approaches to classify detect or segment macroplastics in waters the ml but particularly the dl assessments of macroplastic load in aquatic regions carried out have shown that the monitoring process can be efficiently automated spatial extents increased and its results qualitatively checked dl approaches better cope with larger numbers of plastics when for example in riverine regions 35 items min flow through the field of view on the river surface martin et al 2021a van lieshout et al 2020 from an accuracy and cost benefit perspective dl methods in particular have a great potential as far as more complex detection tasks should be implemented a case in point for such a complex task would be the detection and identification of several differently sized macroplastic categories within real world images however three factors are hindering a widespread use of dl techniques i the currently existing dl approaches are less comprehensive than visual counting assessments or field surveys regarding target classes ii image data sets with annotations are not sufficiently large and diversified yet besides higher level annotations bounding boxes or polygons are required to train the next generation of dl models efficiently which will then hopefully be able to outperform currently existing models in terms of accuracy iii the methodologies tested by different authors at the moment are not fairly comparable making it hard to justify the use of a particular dl method for this application a reference data set with predetermined categories serving as a basis to test models would significantly enhance comparability 4 from category detection to macroplastic monitoring close range rs based observations of the aquatic environment can contribute to a long term and large scale macroplastic monitoring while temporal assessments still find little attention spatial coverages have been enlarged martin et al 2021a for instance managed to conduct a national scale beach litter survey and van lieshout et al 2020 examined five river locations repeating such semi automated works year by year or season by season would create an unprecedented and solid data base about macroplastic pollution in aquatic environments which could enlighten some complex spatiotemporal variations in macroplastic transport dynamics van emmerik 2021 artificial intelligence based analysis provides four possible ways to gain information these are summarized in fig 4 classifying images a merely results in retrieving information about occurrence or absence of categories in images or image tiles examples of such an output have been presented by garcia garin et al 2021 or marin et al 2021 if semantic segmentation b is applied each pixel of an image will be assigned a categorial label wang et al 2018 as illustrated by bao et al 2018 jakovljevic et al 2020 or kataoka and nihei 2020 the semantic approach enables a calculation of the macroplastic category covered area if the images are georeferenced however precise object locations cannot be derived unless practitioners focus on object detection c which increases the level of evaluable data object detection has been accomplished by martin et al 2021a de vries et al 2021 and van lieshout et al 2020 and serves to document where and how many objects are located within the image e g items km2 object detection further enables an automated counting of those objects and creation of object rankings finally instance segmentation d retrieves the largest amount of information by predicting instance masks namely occurrence object location count size and form such outputs are displayed in kylili et al 2021 or deng et al 2021 with this information more precise quantities of litter categories could be calculated however the quality of such outcomes always depends on the performance of the model further factors that potentially influence the monitoring of macroplastics are extreme events and natural hazards such as floods or storms harsh realistic environmental conditions and vegetation the effect of those parameters on the automated monitoring process as well as the influence of measuring predominantly during daylight should be discussed in the future 5 conclusion detection and identification of macroplastics is essential to get an overall picture of the magnitude of socioeconomic and health related damage that plastic pollution brings along this is currently mostly being done with traditional monitoring methods such as manual surveys or visual counting which severely lack automation close range remote sensing combined with an artificial intelligence based analysis has the potential to remedy this and provide insight into pathways and distribution patterns of macroplastics within this work we have shown that the spatial and spectral resolution of images strongly influence which categories materials and size classes of plastics can realistically be evaluated using close range remote sensing thus depending on the data at hand more or less complex questions can be answered ranging from litter detection to precise category identification nonetheless given the big variety of macroplastic objects and their greatly varying spectral properties it is to be assumed that not all items can be successfully detected especially not with one universal algorithm however nir and swir data from 780 to 2500 nm crucially support an unambiguous detection and identification of macroplastic materials or objects apart from increasing spectral information shape recognition techniques provide discriminative ability too multi feature algorithms incorporating several spectral and or geometric parameters and learning based methodologies have therefore become an irreplaceable tool for a reasonable detection and identification of macroplastics today yet to date none of the discussed automated approaches is able to replace traditional macroplastic monitoring approaches such as visual counting or site surveys this is not least due to the challenges scientists and practitioners have been confronted with in the field essentially each area under investigation being it coastal marine or riverine waters has its own disturbing patterns such as macroplastic look alikes artefacts due to illumination or interfering environmental factors which complicate assessments despite these challenges the potential of an artificial intelligence based analysis of image data is growing while at the moment approaches are only programmed or trained to recognize one to an arbitrary number of classes this number will most likely increase in the future as soon as more ground truth annotated image data are available and published comprehensiveness is a key factor for a good monitoring procedure and particularly dl models have proven to cope well with predicting several hundreds of categories therefore framework conditions should be specially designed for close range remote sensing approaches monitoring macroplastics to create a basis for comparability and harmonization in the future almost all discussed ml or dl approaches must cope with handling small data sets although several data bases do exist which can be used to supplement proprietary training data availability and accessibility of image data with annotations is a bottleneck in order to build successful and automated monitoring applications much larger amounts of data will be required an important aim is the collection of unbiased data in addition challenges such as an equal consideration in detection of smaller objects or heavily weathered ones are being addressed but there is still room for improvement for example benchmark datasets could be created to test the ability of different dl approaches on detecting small objects to the best of our knowledge dl approaches incorporating multi or hyperspectral data sets and therefore improving classification detection or identification by leveraging from a larger and more diverse feature space do not exist such models fed with proven key features e g nir or swir absorption bands of macroplastics could support decision making processes within dl frameworks and increase generalization capabilities of models furthermore it is highly probable that with the support of dl approaches an upscaling of the current extent of macroplastic observation succeeds temporally as well as spatially we conclude that a proper object detection or semantic or instance based segmentation can most likely be achieved by combining multiple relevant spectral wavelengths geometric features and an automated and efficient deep learning based method to discriminate between the multitude of objects potentially floating on the surface of water or washed ashore credit authorship contribution statement nina gnann writing original draft visualization björn baschek writing review editing
