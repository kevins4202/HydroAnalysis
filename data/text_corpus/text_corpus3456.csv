17280,nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo is a crucial link between carbon and nitrogen cycles in estuarine and coastal ecosystems however the factors that affect the heterogeneous variability in n damo microbial abundance and activity across estuarine and intertidal wetlands remain unclear this study examined the spatiotemporal variations in n damo microbial abundance and associated activity in different estuarine and intertidal habitats via quantitative pcr and 13c stable isotope experiments the results showed that candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera m oxyfera like damo bacteria and candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens m nitroreducens like damo archaea cooccurred in estuarine and intertidal wetlands with a relatively higher abundance of the m oxyfera like bacterial pmoa gene 4 0 106 7 6 107 copies g 1 dry sediment than the m nitroreducens like archaeal mcra gene 4 5 105 9 4 107 copies g 1 dry sediment the abundance of the m oxyfera like bacterial pmoa gene was closely associated with sediment ph and ammonium p 0 05 while no significant relationship was detected between m nitroreducens like archaeal mcra gene abundance and the measured environmental parameters p 0 05 high n damo microbial activity was observed which varied between 0 2 and 84 3 nmol 13co2 g 1 dry sediment day 1 for nitrite damo bacteria and between 0 4 and 32 6 nmol 13co2 g 1 dry sediment day 1 for nitrate damo archaea the total n damo potential tended to be higher in the warm season and in the upstream freshwater and low salinity estuarine habitats and was significantly related to sediment ph total organic carbon fe ii and fe iii contents p 0 05 in addition to acting as an important methane ch4 sink n damo microbes had the potential to consume a substantial amount of reactive n in estuarine and intertidal environments with estimated nitrogen elimination rates of 0 5 224 7 nmol n g 1 dry sediment day 1 overall our investigation reveals the distribution pattern and controlling factors of n damo bioprocesses in estuarine and intertidal marshes and gains a better understanding of the coupling mechanisms between carbon and nitrogen cycles graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic methane oxidation nitrate nitrite nitrogen elimination intertidal sediment yangtze estuary 1 introduction atmospheric methane ch4 is the second most powerful greenhouse gas ghg following carbon dioxide co2 and has contributed approximately 17 to the total radiative forcing by long lived ghgs since preindustrial times butler et al 2019 according to the world meteorological organization wmo greenhouse gas bulletin 2019 the current concentration of ch4 in the atmosphere 1869 2 ppb in 2018 has reached a maximum over the past 2000 years which represents 259 of preindustrial level ch4 has a 34 times stronger warming effect than that of co2 over a century time scale bastviken et al 2011 currently the contribution of ch4 to the global greenhouse effect is estimated to be approximately 22 which will further increase with continuously rising ch4 concentrations in the atmosphere myhre et al 2013 dean et al 2018 wang et al 2019 ch4 production and consumption are thus a significant component of the global carbon c cycling and have been attracting an increasing amount of attention worldwide in the context of global climate change microbially mediated oxidation of ch4 has an important role in regulating global warming it is estimated that approximately 60 of annual global ch4 production is oxidized by microbes which counteracts a large amount of biological ch4 production and release into the air knittel and boetius 2009 in addition to the process of aerobic ch4 oxidation which is catalyzed by aerobic methanotrophs ch4 can also be anaerobically oxidized by anaerobic methanotrophs using electron acceptors such as nitrite no2 nitrate no3 ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 manganese iron oxides beal et al 2009 sulfate so4 2 knittel and boetius 2009 and humic substances valenzuela et al 2017 2019 table s1 previous studies have evidenced the important role of anaerobic oxidation of ch4 aom using sulfate sulfate driven aom in reducing ch4 emissions in marine ecosystems hinrichs et al 1999 nevertheless in environments where no3 no2 and so4 2 coexist nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane n damo is more likely to occur than the sulfate driven aom strous and jetten 2004 as no3 no2 are more thermodynamically favored electron acceptors for aom than so4 2 liu et al 2014 table s1 recently the process of n damo was discovered and considered a critical link between global nitrogen n and c cycles ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera m oxyfera was the first microbe that was discovered to catalyze nitrite damo which has the dual functions of n removal converting no2 to n2 and ch4 oxidation converting ch4 to co2 which is much less efficient at trapping heat ettwig et al 2010 this functional nitrite damo bacterium belongs to the nc10 phylum ettwig et al 2010 nitrate damo was determined to be carried out by the anme 2d archaea candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens m nitroreducens haroon et al 2013 m nitroreducens employs a reverse methanogenesis pathway to oxidize ch4 while it transforms no3 into no2 that may be further employed by nitrite damo bacteria haroon et al 2013 recent studies have reported the occurrence and activity of nitrite damo bacteria in natural environments such as freshwater wetlands hu et al 2014 wang et al 2017 mangrove sediments zhang et al 2018 groundwater vigneron et al 2017 permafrost winkel et al 2018 acidic forest soils meng et al 2016 and paddy soils wang et al 2012 shen et al 2014a vaksmaa et al 2017b conversely knowledge about the existence of nitrate damo archaea is still very limited in natural environments and their ch4 oxidation potential also remains under investigation especially in estuarine and intertidal environments estuarine and intertidal wetlands as typical complex ecotones among rivers land and seas are important sources of atmospheric ch4 hou et al 2013 segarra et al 2013 moreover these wetlands are greatly influenced by intensive human activities and consequently encounter a series of environmental problems such as anthropogenic reactive n pollution kintisch 2013 therefore estuarine and intertidal sediment is hypothesized to be an important habitat for n damo which may have a crucial ecological role by coupling reactive n removal with ch4 oxidation recently the occurrence of nitrite damo and nitrate damo was reported in estuarine and coastal wetlands wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 which suggests that the n damo process comprised a previously overlooked ch4 sink in these environments however the spatial and temporal variations in the abundance and potential role of n damo microbes along estuarine and intertidal ecosystems and associated driving factors remain unclear largely because of complex environmental conditions under the intensive interaction of land and sea hence the targets of this research are 1 to evaluate the potential role and relative importance of nitrite damo and nitrate damo processes in ch4 oxidation in estuarine and intertidal wetlands 2 to investigate the spatial and temporal alterations in the abundance and potential activity of n damo microbes along the environmental gradient of estuarine and intertidal ecosystems and 3 to explore the environmental factors that control the role of n damo microbes in regulating ch4 oxidation and n removal across estuarine and intertidal habitats this study is helpful for improving our understanding of the function and controlling mechanism of carbon nitrogen coupling n damo processes in estuarine and intertidal ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the yangtze estuary is the largest estuary in china has a subtropical monsoon climate fig 1 and covers an area of approximately 8500 km2 with a width of approximately 90 km and a length of approximately 250 km because the yangtze estuary is located in one of the most densely populated and highly industrialized regions in china it has been receiving an increasing load of anthropogenic n which has caused serious environmental issues such as eutrophication and frequent harmful algal blooms hou et al 2013 in this study seven sites were selected along the yangtze estuary including xp lhk wsk blg dxg yy and lc according to the overlying water salinity measured in situ by a ysi model 30 salinity meter ysi yellow springs instrument these sampling sites were divided into three groups freshwater sites xp and lhk low salinity sites wsk blg and summer dxg and high salinity sites yy lc and winter dxg fig 1 surface 0 5 cm sediment samples of each site were collected with sterile stainless steel shovels from at least six plots 50 cm 50 cm during the ebb periods in january winter and july summer of 2019 after collection these samples were stored in a cooler 4 c and transported to the laboratory within 4 6 hours subsequently site sediment samples were homogenized in nitrogen conditions and separated into two parts the first part was employed for immediate measurements of n damo rates and sediment physicochemical properties and the second part was preserved at 20 c for subsequent molecular analyses 2 2 determination of sediment physicochemical factors sediment salinity and ph were measured by a ysi model 30 salinity meter ysi yellow springs instrument and ph meter mettler toledo switzerland respectively after sediment was mixed with co2 free deionized water at a volume ratio of 1 2 5 hou et al 2013 the sediment temperature was measured in situ using a digital temperature meter iq150 iq scientific instrument usa the sediment water content was estimated based on weight loss before and after drying total organic carbon toc in sediments was measured using the potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 oxidation method zheng et al 2020 the soil particle size was determined by a laser particle size analyzer master sizer 2000 uk and classified into clay 2 μm silt 2 20 μm and sand 20 μm martins et al 2011 ammonium nh4 no2 and no3 in sediments were extracted with 2 m kcl and determined by a continuous flow analyzer skalar san netherlands the sulfate content was analyzed by ion chromatography dionex ics 2100 thermo scientific japan with a dionex ionpac as22 column briefly sediments were dried at 40 c and mixed with deionized water at a weight ratio of 1 5 the mixtures were then stirred and filtered after 1 day and the filtrates were utilized for sulfate determination by ion chromatography yang et al 2013 the sulfide concentration was measured using orion sure flow combined silver sulfide electrodes thermo scientific orion hou et al 2012 total extractable fe was extracted from 0 5 g of fresh sediment with 30 ml of 0 5 m anoxic hcl for 1 hour the total extracted fe was then measured via a 1 10 phenanthroline and 1 w v hydroxylamine hydrochloride method followed by fe ii via a 1 10 phenanthroline assay wallmann et al 1993 haese et al 1997 zheng et al 2020 fe iii was calculated by the difference between the total fe and fe ii ch4 concentration in sediment porewater was determined on a gas chromatography gc 2014 shimadzu japan following the procedure described by winkel et al 2018 and zheng et al 2020 2 3 potential n damo activity measurements potential n damo rates were determined with the 13c stable isotope method wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 fig s1 briefly slurries made from approximately 7 g of fresh sediments and 20 ml of he degassed artificial seawater with in situ overlying water salinity were transferred into a series of 120 ml he purged vials these vials were sealed immediately with aluminum silicone rubber pads and then preincubated in the dark at near in situ sediment temperatures preincubation was conducted for at least 30 hours to remove ambient oxygen and nox including no3 and no2 the vials were subsequently separated into 3 different treatment groups a 13ch4 99 9 13c sigma de b 13ch4 no2 and c 13ch4 no3 twenty microliters of he purged stock solutions of nano2 and nano3 were injected into each vial in group b with a final no2 concentration of 0 5 mm and group c with a final no3 concentration of 5 mm respectively moreover 100 μl of 13ch4 were injected into each vial in groups a b and c to achieve a final headspace 13ch4 concentration of approximately 1 v v the vials without any addition were selected as the control in addition extra vials were sacrificed after preincubation to measure dissolved oxygen using an oxygen needle sensor ox n unisense to ensure completely anaerobic conditions before n damo activity measurements after the vials were incubated at near in situ sediment temperature for 1 day hu et al 2014 the incubation was inhibited by injecting 100 μl of 50 zncl2 solution the incubation time was set as 1 day because the production of 13co2 increased linearly during the 24 hours of incubation fig s2 the total co2 concentration and production of 13co2 were measured on a gas chromatography gc 2014 shimadzu japan and isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific germany respectively potential rates of total n damo nitrate damo and nitrite damo were quantified according to the production of 13co2 during incubation supplementary text 1 as described previously wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 all these treatments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 dna extraction and quantitative pcr total genomic dna from each sampling site was extracted in triplicate from approximately 0 25 g fresh sediment using powersoiltm dna isolation kits mobio usa subsequently the abundance of m oxyfera like nitrite damo bacteria was quantified based on the alpha subunit of the particulate methane monooxygenase gene pmoa with primers cmo182 cmo568 luesken et al 2011 and the abundance of m nitroreducens like nitrate damo archaea was quantified based on the alpha subunit of the methyl coenzyme m reductase gene mcra with primers mcra159f mcra345r vaksmaa et al 2017a table s2 quantitative pcr qpcr was conducted on the abi7500 fast real time pcr system standard curves employed for calculation of gene copy numbers were constructed based on tenfold dilutions of the standard plasmid that carries the targeted pmoa gene or mcra gene with known gene copy numbers during qpcr negative controls without any dna addition were performed in addition the specificity of the qpcr amplification was determined by gel electrophoreses and melting curve analyses in this study qpcr results with only one melting curve peak an amplification efficiency from 90 105 and correlation coefficients above 0 98 were employed table s3 furthermore during the construction of standard plasmids that carry the targeted pmoa gene or mcra gene the specificity of the primer sets was also confirmed by sequencing supplementary text 2 and table s4 2 5 statistical analysis spss 19 0 spss inc chicago illinois usa and origin 2020 were employed for general statistical analyses and graphing of experimental data the correlations of environmental properties with n damo microbial abundance and activity were explored with pearson s correlation a one way analysis of variance anova was performed to compare any potential spatial and seasonal variations all analyses were performed at the significance level of 5 3 results 3 1 environmental parameters in the yangtze estuary sediment salinity gradually increased from the upper estuary to the lower estuary which ranged from 0 1 to 14 8 fig s3 significant salinity variations were detected among the freshwater habitat 0 1 low salinity habitat 0 8 1 5 and high salinity habitat 6 2 14 8 p 0 05 sediment ph in the range of 7 29 8 59 also tended to increase from the upper estuary to the lower estuary with an increase in salinity p 0 05 fig s3 the sediment temperature in winter with an average of 3 1 c was much lower than that in summer with an average of 32 1 c p 0 01 sediments along the salinity gradient were mainly composed of silt 50 04 93 36 with smaller amounts of clay 1 04 3 60 and sand 5 61 47 72 fig s4 sediment water contents ranged from 27 to 39 in summer and from 27 to 62 in winter ch4 concentrations in sediment pore water were higher at the saline sites 5 3 11 3 μmol l 1 than at the freshwater sites 1 3 3 9 μmol l 1 in summer while they did not show a significant spatial variation in winter with values of 2 7 7 6 μmol l 1 p 0 05 fig s3 nh4 contents ranged between 190 0 and 1658 1 μmol n kg 1 dry weight similarly hereinafter and the maximum was observed at site dxg the no2 contents remained relatively low 0 3 2 7 μmol n kg 1 in the study area the no3 contents ranged between 5 7 and 95 8 μmol n kg 1 and the highest value was detected at freshwater site xp in summer similarly sediment toc decreased gradually from the freshwater habitat 0 8 1 6 to the high salinity habitat 0 1 0 8 with a significant spatial variation p 0 05 sediment fe ii contents 15 2 45 2 mmol kg 1 were generally higher at the freshwater sites while fe iii contents 1 8 22 3 mmol kg 1 were generally higher at the high salinity sites sulfide concentrations in sediment porewater varied from 10 0 to 170 0 μmol l 1 with high spatial and temporal heterogeneity p 0 05 the contents of the sulfate in sediments ranged between 0 3 and 10 3 mmol kg 1 with relatively greater values at the high salinity sites 3 2 abundance of n damo microbes qpcr results illustrated the cooccurrence of m oxyfera like damo bacteria and m nitroreducens like damo archaea at all the sampling sites along the yangtze estuary fig 2 a the abundance of m oxyfera like bacterial pmoa gene and m nitroreducens like archaeal mcra gene varied between 4 0 106 and 7 6 107 copies g 1 dry weight the same hereinafter and between 4 5 105 and 9 4 107 copies g 1 respectively fig 2a the pmoa gene abundance had a maximal value at the freshwater site lhk 7 6 107 copies g 1 and then showed a decreasing trend toward the mouth of the estuary where the salinity was high fig 2a however no significant spatial variation was observed among the freshwater low salinity and high salinity habitats p 0 05 fig 2b the mcra gene abundance peaked at the low salinity site blg 9 4 107 copies g 1 fig 2a similarly no significant spatial variation in mcra gene abundance was observed among the different salinity habitats p 0 05 fig 2b in addition no significant seasonal variation was detected for either pmoa gene abundance or mcra gene abundance p 0 05 fig 2c the abundance of pmoa gene generally tended to be higher than that of mcra gene in the study sediments with average values of 2 7 107 copies g 1 for pmoa gene and 1 6 107 copies g 1 for mcra gene fig 2d the ratio of pmoa gene abundance to mcra gene abundance was unevenly distributed from the estuarine upstream to downstream regions but no significant spatial or seasonal variation was observed p 0 05 fig 2e 3 3 potential n damo rates potential rates of anaerobic ch4 oxidation by n damo microbes were determined via 13c stable isotope experiments during the incubation injected with 13ch4 only no significant production of 13co2 was detected at any sampling site fig s5 which suggests that oxygen no3 no2 and other possible electron acceptors e g so4 2 manganese iron oxides and humic substances in the sediment slurries were not available after preincubation the results showed that potential rates of both nitrite damo and nitrate damo along the environmental gradient of the yangtze estuary ranged from 0 2 84 3 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 dry weight the same hereinafter and 0 4 32 6 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 respectively fig 3 a total n damo rates were significantly greater in summer than in winter p 0 05 fig 3b in summer nitrite damo rates peaked at site wsk 84 3 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 fig 3a where the highest abundance of nitrite damo bacteria was also recorded in addition nitrite damo rates in summer were significantly greater at the freshwater and low salinity sites than at the high salinity sites p 0 05 fig 3c conversely winter nitrite damo rates were relatively lower though not significant p 0 05 fig 3d and had no significant spatial variation fig 3c nitrate damo rates in summer were generally higher in the freshwater habitat than in the low salinity and high salinity habitats p 0 05 fig 3e with the highest value 32 6 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 measured at site lhk significantly lower nitrate damo rates were detected in winter p 0 05 fig 3f but no significant spatial variation in nitrate damo rates was observed in this cold season p 0 05 fig 3e the nitrite damo process was observed to be more important than the nitrate damo process in ch4 oxidation at most of the examined sites fig s6 furthermore it was estimated that the n elimination potential by n damo bacteria was in the range of 0 5 224 7 nmol n g 1 day 1 along the environmental gradient of the study area according to the stoichiometric ratio of ch4 to no2 3 8 in the damo reaction table s1 3 4 potential factors controlling n damo process potential relationships of sediment properties with n damo microbial abundance and activity were analyzed table 1 the abundance of m oxyfera like bacterial pmoa gene was negatively associated with sediment ph and positively correlated with sediment nh4 p 0 05 however there were no significant associations between damo archaeal mcra gene abundance and measured environmental factors p 0 05 potential nitrite damo rates were positively and significantly associated with sediment toc and fe ii whereas they were negatively related to sediment ph and fe iii p 0 05 potential nitrate damo rates were positively correlated with sediment temperature no3 toc and fe ii and negatively related to sediment ph p 0 05 the total ch4 oxidation potential by n damo microbes was positively correlated with sediment toc and fe ii but negatively correlated with sediment fe iii and ph p 0 05 however there was no significant association between the potential activity and abundance of n damo microbes p 0 05 4 discussion in this work molecular and 13ch4 tracer experiments demonstrated the cooccurrence and potential role of n damo microbes in different habitats of the yangtze estuary the results showed that the copy numbers of the m oxyfera like bacterial pmoa gene along the environmental gradient of the yangtze estuary varied between 4 0 106 and 7 6 107 copies g 1 fig 2a which were similar to those in mangrove wetland sediments 2 1 106 to 3 4 107 copies g 1 zhang et al 2018 table s5 in addition a similar range of copy numbers of nitrite damo bacteria on the basis of the 16s rrna gene was also reported in the xixi wetland 1 7 106 to 1 0 107 copies g 1 hu et al 2014 xiazhuhu wetland 3 0 106 to 3 2 107 copies g 1 hu et al 2014 qiantang river 1 32 106 to 1 03 107 copies g 1 shen et al 2014b and hangzhou bay 5 4 106 to 5 0 107 copies g 1 shen et al 2016 table s5 these results indicated that the abundance of nitrite damo bacteria quantified with the pmoa gene was in consistence with that quantified based on the 16s rrna gene the abundance of the m nitroreducens like archaeal mcra gene varied between 4 5 105 and 9 4 107 copies g 1 along the environmental gradient of the yangtze estuary fig 2a which was relatively higher than that in marine sediments 2 5 104 copies g 1 vaksmaa et al 2017a and river sediments 3 0 104 to 4 4 105 copies g 1 vaksmaa et al 2017a table s5 our qpcr data also suggested that the n damo bacteria and archaea might be intimate symbiotic partners in the estuarine and intertidal marshes as they were always present together however there was no significant relationship between the abundance of pmoa and mcra genes p 0 05 table 1 which suggests that in addition to nitrate damo archaea additional no2 providers such as ammonia oxidizers and denitifiers discussed below exist to support the growth of nitrite damo bacteria in estuarine and intertidal marshes fig 4 high rates of both nitrite damo and nitrate damo were detected along the environmental gradient of the yangtze estuary fig 3 which indicate that n damo processes are important ch4 sinks in estuarine intertidal wetlands here the measured potential activity of nitrite damo varied from 0 2 84 3 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 fig 3a which was similar to a previous report for riverbed sediments 0 4 61 nmol 13co2 g 1 dry soil day 1 shen et al 2019 but greater than that documented in paddy soils 0 2 2 1 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 shen et al 2014a and freshwater wetlands 0 31 5 43 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 hu et al 2014 shen et al 2015 however the detected nitrite damo potential in this study was lower than that measured in mangrove wetland sediments 25 9 704 1 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 zhang et al 2018 table s6 the potential activity of nitrate damo in this study ranged from 0 4 32 6 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 fig 3a which was greater than that detected in the qiantang river estuary 0 1 57 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 table s6 wang et al 2019 the rate of nitrite damo inclined to be greater than the nitrate damo rate in the intertidal marshes of the yangtze estuary figs 3 and s6 which indicates that nitrite damo bacteria might be more important during ch4 oxidation than nitrate damo archaea in estuarine and intertidal environments consistent with this finding the abundance of pmoa gene also tended to be higher than that of mcra gene fig 2d further suggesting the dominant role of nitrite damo bacteria which was consistent with previous reports for freshwater wetlands shen et al 2017 2020 the potential rates of n damo were greater in summer than in winter and positive correlations were detected between n damo rates and temperature fig 3 and table 1 however the seasonal variation in n damo microbial abundance was not significant p 0 05 and its correlation with temperature was also not significant which indicates that relatively high temperatures might accelerate the cell specific activity of n damo microbes but not their cell numbers he et al 2015 in addition the abundance and potential activity of n damo microbes were heterogeneously distributed across different salinity habitats of the yangtze estuary the n damo microbial abundance tended to be higher at the freshwater and low salinity sites fig 2 similarly the potential rates of nitrite damo and nitrate damo inclined to be greater at the freshwater and low salinity sites while relatively low rates occurred at the high salinity sites fig 3 however the negative correlations of sediment salinity with the abundance and potential activity of n damo microbes were not significant p 0 05 table 1 the pmoa gene abundance correlated well with the nh4 content p 0 05 furthermore a significant positive association of the nitrite damo bacterial abundance with nh4 was also reported in river sediments long et al 2017 this relationship might suggest metabolic cooperation between nitrite damo bacteria and aerobic ammonia oxidizing microorganisms shen et al 2014b no2 contents remained quite low in sediment samples fig s3 likely because it is very unstable in nature and can quickly react with other compounds based on our previous study high abundance and activity of ammonia oxidizers were detected at the sampling sites of this study zheng et al 2014 which could convert nh4 to no2 in the surface aerobic microenvironment and then provide the no2 substrate for nitrite damo bacteria in the inner anaerobic environment fig 4 a significant positive correlation was observed between nitrification and nitrite damo rates in the study sediments p 0 01 fig s7a these results imply that the sediment water interface of the intertidal marshes as a typical oxic anoxic interface might provide an ideal site for cooperation between aerobic ammonia oxidizers and n damo microbes in addition no2 used by nitrite damo bacteria can also be provided by no3 reducers such as denitrifiers and nitrate damo archaea in estuarine and intertidal wetlands fig 4 however the abundance and activity of nitrite damo bacteria were not significantly related to no3 contents p 0 05 table 1 the relationship between denitrification and nitrite damo rates was also not significant p 0 05 fig s7b which suggests that no3 reduction by denitrifiers might play a less important role than ammonia oxidizers in providing no2 for nitrite damo bacteria although a significant relationship was observed between nitrate damo rates and nitrite damo rates p 0 01 fig s7c no2 produced by nitrate damo archaea was inadequate for supporting the nitrite damo reaction because of the low nitrate damo rates figs 3 s6 and s7 in addition no3 contents were considerably lower than those of nh4 p 0 01 which was the dominant form of inorganic n in estuarine and intertidal sediments fig s3 these results suggest that nh4 oxidation rather than no3 reduction might be the major source of no2 for nitrite damo bacteria in estuarine and intertidal wetlands however more studies should be conducted to verify these statements as the electron acceptor for nitrate damo archaea to oxidize ch4 no3 was observed to be positively and significantly correlated with nitrate damo rates p 0 05 table 1 however there was no significant relationship of the nitrate damo archael abundance with no3 in this study p 0 05 this result might support the hypothesis that diverse electron acceptors in addition to no3 such as fe iii and so4 2 can be employed by nitrate damo archaea during the anaerobic ch4 oxidation process ettwig et al 2016 shen et al 2019 weber et al 2017 recently it was demonstrated that m nitroreducens like damo archaea could oxidize ch4 with fe iii ettwig et al 2016 and the fe iii addition could stimulate the expression of mcra gene of damo archaea shen et al 2019 however no significant positive relationship was observed between the abundance of nitrate damo archaea and fe iii in this study p 0 05 table 1 which suggests that fe iii might not be the main electron acceptor to support the growth of nitrate damo archaea in estuarine and intertidal marshes moreover anme 2d archaea were shown to be associated with sulfate driven aom in lake sediments weber et al 2017 additionally the possibility that nitrate damo archaea can anaerobically oxidize ch4 with natural organic matter in estuarine and intertidal marshes cannot be excluded valenzuela et al 2017 2019 however there were no remarkable relationships of the nitrate damo archaeal abundance with sulfate and toc contents p 0 05 table 1 these findings suggested that different electron acceptors might cosupport the growth and metabolism of nitrate damo archaea however further studies are still required to determine whether these possible electron acceptors can be utilized by nitrate damo archaea to oxidize ch4 in estuarine and intertidal wetlands organic carbon can be employed by methanogens to produce ch4 and then facilitate the activity of n damo microbes in anoxic conditions wang et al 2012 shen et al 2014b chen et al 2020 fig 4 although no significant relationship was observed between n damo microbial abundance and toc in this work the activity of n damo microbes was significantly and positively related to toc in the study sediments p 0 01 table 1 a significant negative relationship was detected between the abundance of nitrite damo bacteria and ph p 0 05 like most kinds of microorganisms the suitable ph for n damo microbes is approximately 7 0 8 0 raghoebarsing et al 2006 ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 he et al 2015 however when the ph exceeded 7 6 the n damo reaction rate was reported to decrease with an increase in ph he et al 2015 consistent with this finding the nitrite damo rate was also negatively related to ph table 1 most of which was higher than 7 6 in this study fig s3 p 0 05 in addition a strong negative association was also detected between nitrate damo rates and ph which suggests that although n damo microbes prefer slightly alkaline conditions relatively higher ph 7 6 might have an adverse effect on their growth and activity he et al 2015 actually the charge on the cell membrane of n damo microbes is related to ph which could affect the substrate consumption capacity activity and stability of enzymes and intracellular biochemical reactions li et al 2020 however note that even though the activity and abundance of n damo microbes were closely related to ph their distribution pattern along the environmental gradient of the estuarine and intertidal wetlands was the comprehensive result of all environmental factors further studies are needed to explore the effects of individual parameters on the dynamics of n damo microbes in complex estuarine and intertidal ecotones a link was expected between the abundance of n damo microbes and potential n damo rates however their correlations were not significant p 0 05 table 1 this result might be attributed to the notion that microbial activity cannot be fully reflected by gene abundance at the dna level shan et al 2016 quantitative studies at the gene transcriptional level based on mrna need to be employed in further studies additionally no2 or no3 can also be utilized by some aerobic methanotrophs to oxidize ch4 and contribute to the n damo potential in oxygen limited conditions kits et al 2015 which might also cause a discrepancy between n damo microbial abundance and potential n damo rates during the process of nitrite damo the responsible bacteria can convert no2 to n2 and thus achieve reactive n removal as denitrifiers and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria can ettwig et al 2010 fig 4 in this study the estimated n removal potential of nitrite damo bacteria 0 5 to 224 7 nmol n g 1 day 1 was comparable to that of the anammox process 22 6 158 6 nmol n g 1 day 1 but lower than that of denitrification 319 2 1610 4 nmol n g 1 day 1 in the studied sediments hou et al 2013 fig s8 these data suggest that the nitrite damo process 0 1 14 6 contributed as much as anammox 5 9 12 8 to n loss however the remainder was attributed to denitrification 77 3 92 4 the contribution of the nitrite damo process to n removal showed an identical spatial distribution pattern in both summer and winter which tended to be higher in freshwater and low salinity habitats fig s9 which suggests that nitrite damo bacteria had a more important role in attenuating ch4 emissions and reducing reactive n loading from human activities in the upper estuary 5 conclusions in this study the cooccurrence and important role of m oxyfera like damo bacteria and m nitroreducens like damo archaea in reducing ch4 emissions was evidenced across different salinity habitats of the yangtze estuary the abundance of n damo microbes showed a decreasing trend from the upper estuarine region to the lower estuarine region which was correlated with sediment ph and nh4 contents the potential rates of ch4 oxidation by n damo microbes were relatively higher in the warm season and in the upstream freshwater and low salinity habitats which were significantly related to sediment ph toc fe ii and fe iii contents compared with nitrate damo archaea nitrite damo bacteria tended to be more important in ch4 oxidation in estuarine and intertidal marshes moreover the n damo process was a crucial pathway for n elimination in estuarine and intertidal wetlands and its n removal potential was comparable to that of the anammox process overall this investigation contributes to an understanding of the role of the n damo process in the coupled n and c

17280,nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo is a crucial link between carbon and nitrogen cycles in estuarine and coastal ecosystems however the factors that affect the heterogeneous variability in n damo microbial abundance and activity across estuarine and intertidal wetlands remain unclear this study examined the spatiotemporal variations in n damo microbial abundance and associated activity in different estuarine and intertidal habitats via quantitative pcr and 13c stable isotope experiments the results showed that candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera m oxyfera like damo bacteria and candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens m nitroreducens like damo archaea cooccurred in estuarine and intertidal wetlands with a relatively higher abundance of the m oxyfera like bacterial pmoa gene 4 0 106 7 6 107 copies g 1 dry sediment than the m nitroreducens like archaeal mcra gene 4 5 105 9 4 107 copies g 1 dry sediment the abundance of the m oxyfera like bacterial pmoa gene was closely associated with sediment ph and ammonium p 0 05 while no significant relationship was detected between m nitroreducens like archaeal mcra gene abundance and the measured environmental parameters p 0 05 high n damo microbial activity was observed which varied between 0 2 and 84 3 nmol 13co2 g 1 dry sediment day 1 for nitrite damo bacteria and between 0 4 and 32 6 nmol 13co2 g 1 dry sediment day 1 for nitrate damo archaea the total n damo potential tended to be higher in the warm season and in the upstream freshwater and low salinity estuarine habitats and was significantly related to sediment ph total organic carbon fe ii and fe iii contents p 0 05 in addition to acting as an important methane ch4 sink n damo microbes had the potential to consume a substantial amount of reactive n in estuarine and intertidal environments with estimated nitrogen elimination rates of 0 5 224 7 nmol n g 1 dry sediment day 1 overall our investigation reveals the distribution pattern and controlling factors of n damo bioprocesses in estuarine and intertidal marshes and gains a better understanding of the coupling mechanisms between carbon and nitrogen cycles graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic methane oxidation nitrate nitrite nitrogen elimination intertidal sediment yangtze estuary 1 introduction atmospheric methane ch4 is the second most powerful greenhouse gas ghg following carbon dioxide co2 and has contributed approximately 17 to the total radiative forcing by long lived ghgs since preindustrial times butler et al 2019 according to the world meteorological organization wmo greenhouse gas bulletin 2019 the current concentration of ch4 in the atmosphere 1869 2 ppb in 2018 has reached a maximum over the past 2000 years which represents 259 of preindustrial level ch4 has a 34 times stronger warming effect than that of co2 over a century time scale bastviken et al 2011 currently the contribution of ch4 to the global greenhouse effect is estimated to be approximately 22 which will further increase with continuously rising ch4 concentrations in the atmosphere myhre et al 2013 dean et al 2018 wang et al 2019 ch4 production and consumption are thus a significant component of the global carbon c cycling and have been attracting an increasing amount of attention worldwide in the context of global climate change microbially mediated oxidation of ch4 has an important role in regulating global warming it is estimated that approximately 60 of annual global ch4 production is oxidized by microbes which counteracts a large amount of biological ch4 production and release into the air knittel and boetius 2009 in addition to the process of aerobic ch4 oxidation which is catalyzed by aerobic methanotrophs ch4 can also be anaerobically oxidized by anaerobic methanotrophs using electron acceptors such as nitrite no2 nitrate no3 ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 manganese iron oxides beal et al 2009 sulfate so4 2 knittel and boetius 2009 and humic substances valenzuela et al 2017 2019 table s1 previous studies have evidenced the important role of anaerobic oxidation of ch4 aom using sulfate sulfate driven aom in reducing ch4 emissions in marine ecosystems hinrichs et al 1999 nevertheless in environments where no3 no2 and so4 2 coexist nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane n damo is more likely to occur than the sulfate driven aom strous and jetten 2004 as no3 no2 are more thermodynamically favored electron acceptors for aom than so4 2 liu et al 2014 table s1 recently the process of n damo was discovered and considered a critical link between global nitrogen n and c cycles ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera m oxyfera was the first microbe that was discovered to catalyze nitrite damo which has the dual functions of n removal converting no2 to n2 and ch4 oxidation converting ch4 to co2 which is much less efficient at trapping heat ettwig et al 2010 this functional nitrite damo bacterium belongs to the nc10 phylum ettwig et al 2010 nitrate damo was determined to be carried out by the anme 2d archaea candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens m nitroreducens haroon et al 2013 m nitroreducens employs a reverse methanogenesis pathway to oxidize ch4 while it transforms no3 into no2 that may be further employed by nitrite damo bacteria haroon et al 2013 recent studies have reported the occurrence and activity of nitrite damo bacteria in natural environments such as freshwater wetlands hu et al 2014 wang et al 2017 mangrove sediments zhang et al 2018 groundwater vigneron et al 2017 permafrost winkel et al 2018 acidic forest soils meng et al 2016 and paddy soils wang et al 2012 shen et al 2014a vaksmaa et al 2017b conversely knowledge about the existence of nitrate damo archaea is still very limited in natural environments and their ch4 oxidation potential also remains under investigation especially in estuarine and intertidal environments estuarine and intertidal wetlands as typical complex ecotones among rivers land and seas are important sources of atmospheric ch4 hou et al 2013 segarra et al 2013 moreover these wetlands are greatly influenced by intensive human activities and consequently encounter a series of environmental problems such as anthropogenic reactive n pollution kintisch 2013 therefore estuarine and intertidal sediment is hypothesized to be an important habitat for n damo which may have a crucial ecological role by coupling reactive n removal with ch4 oxidation recently the occurrence of nitrite damo and nitrate damo was reported in estuarine and coastal wetlands wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 which suggests that the n damo process comprised a previously overlooked ch4 sink in these environments however the spatial and temporal variations in the abundance and potential role of n damo microbes along estuarine and intertidal ecosystems and associated driving factors remain unclear largely because of complex environmental conditions under the intensive interaction of land and sea hence the targets of this research are 1 to evaluate the potential role and relative importance of nitrite damo and nitrate damo processes in ch4 oxidation in estuarine and intertidal wetlands 2 to investigate the spatial and temporal alterations in the abundance and potential activity of n damo microbes along the environmental gradient of estuarine and intertidal ecosystems and 3 to explore the environmental factors that control the role of n damo microbes in regulating ch4 oxidation and n removal across estuarine and intertidal habitats this study is helpful for improving our understanding of the function and controlling mechanism of carbon nitrogen coupling n damo processes in estuarine and intertidal ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the yangtze estuary is the largest estuary in china has a subtropical monsoon climate fig 1 and covers an area of approximately 8500 km2 with a width of approximately 90 km and a length of approximately 250 km because the yangtze estuary is located in one of the most densely populated and highly industrialized regions in china it has been receiving an increasing load of anthropogenic n which has caused serious environmental issues such as eutrophication and frequent harmful algal blooms hou et al 2013 in this study seven sites were selected along the yangtze estuary including xp lhk wsk blg dxg yy and lc according to the overlying water salinity measured in situ by a ysi model 30 salinity meter ysi yellow springs instrument these sampling sites were divided into three groups freshwater sites xp and lhk low salinity sites wsk blg and summer dxg and high salinity sites yy lc and winter dxg fig 1 surface 0 5 cm sediment samples of each site were collected with sterile stainless steel shovels from at least six plots 50 cm 50 cm during the ebb periods in january winter and july summer of 2019 after collection these samples were stored in a cooler 4 c and transported to the laboratory within 4 6 hours subsequently site sediment samples were homogenized in nitrogen conditions and separated into two parts the first part was employed for immediate measurements of n damo rates and sediment physicochemical properties and the second part was preserved at 20 c for subsequent molecular analyses 2 2 determination of sediment physicochemical factors sediment salinity and ph were measured by a ysi model 30 salinity meter ysi yellow springs instrument and ph meter mettler toledo switzerland respectively after sediment was mixed with co2 free deionized water at a volume ratio of 1 2 5 hou et al 2013 the sediment temperature was measured in situ using a digital temperature meter iq150 iq scientific instrument usa the sediment water content was estimated based on weight loss before and after drying total organic carbon toc in sediments was measured using the potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 oxidation method zheng et al 2020 the soil particle size was determined by a laser particle size analyzer master sizer 2000 uk and classified into clay 2 μm silt 2 20 μm and sand 20 μm martins et al 2011 ammonium nh4 no2 and no3 in sediments were extracted with 2 m kcl and determined by a continuous flow analyzer skalar san netherlands the sulfate content was analyzed by ion chromatography dionex ics 2100 thermo scientific japan with a dionex ionpac as22 column briefly sediments were dried at 40 c and mixed with deionized water at a weight ratio of 1 5 the mixtures were then stirred and filtered after 1 day and the filtrates were utilized for sulfate determination by ion chromatography yang et al 2013 the sulfide concentration was measured using orion sure flow combined silver sulfide electrodes thermo scientific orion hou et al 2012 total extractable fe was extracted from 0 5 g of fresh sediment with 30 ml of 0 5 m anoxic hcl for 1 hour the total extracted fe was then measured via a 1 10 phenanthroline and 1 w v hydroxylamine hydrochloride method followed by fe ii via a 1 10 phenanthroline assay wallmann et al 1993 haese et al 1997 zheng et al 2020 fe iii was calculated by the difference between the total fe and fe ii ch4 concentration in sediment porewater was determined on a gas chromatography gc 2014 shimadzu japan following the procedure described by winkel et al 2018 and zheng et al 2020 2 3 potential n damo activity measurements potential n damo rates were determined with the 13c stable isotope method wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 fig s1 briefly slurries made from approximately 7 g of fresh sediments and 20 ml of he degassed artificial seawater with in situ overlying water salinity were transferred into a series of 120 ml he purged vials these vials were sealed immediately with aluminum silicone rubber pads and then preincubated in the dark at near in situ sediment temperatures preincubation was conducted for at least 30 hours to remove ambient oxygen and nox including no3 and no2 the vials were subsequently separated into 3 different treatment groups a 13ch4 99 9 13c sigma de b 13ch4 no2 and c 13ch4 no3 twenty microliters of he purged stock solutions of nano2 and nano3 were injected into each vial in group b with a final no2 concentration of 0 5 mm and group c with a final no3 concentration of 5 mm respectively moreover 100 μl of 13ch4 were injected into each vial in groups a b and c to achieve a final headspace 13ch4 concentration of approximately 1 v v the vials without any addition were selected as the control in addition extra vials were sacrificed after preincubation to measure dissolved oxygen using an oxygen needle sensor ox n unisense to ensure completely anaerobic conditions before n damo activity measurements after the vials were incubated at near in situ sediment temperature for 1 day hu et al 2014 the incubation was inhibited by injecting 100 μl of 50 zncl2 solution the incubation time was set as 1 day because the production of 13co2 increased linearly during the 24 hours of incubation fig s2 the total co2 concentration and production of 13co2 were measured on a gas chromatography gc 2014 shimadzu japan and isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific germany respectively potential rates of total n damo nitrate damo and nitrite damo were quantified according to the production of 13co2 during incubation supplementary text 1 as described previously wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 all these treatments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 dna extraction and quantitative pcr total genomic dna from each sampling site was extracted in triplicate from approximately 0 25 g fresh sediment using powersoiltm dna isolation kits mobio usa subsequently the abundance of m oxyfera like nitrite damo bacteria was quantified based on the alpha subunit of the particulate methane monooxygenase gene pmoa with primers cmo182 cmo568 luesken et al 2011 and the abundance of m nitroreducens like nitrate damo archaea was quantified based on the alpha subunit of the methyl coenzyme m reductase gene mcra with primers mcra159f mcra345r vaksmaa et al 2017a table s2 quantitative pcr qpcr was conducted on the abi7500 fast real time pcr system standard curves employed for calculation of gene copy numbers were constructed based on tenfold dilutions of the standard plasmid that carries the targeted pmoa gene or mcra gene with known gene copy numbers during qpcr negative controls without any dna addition were performed in addition the specificity of the qpcr amplification was determined by gel electrophoreses and melting curve analyses in this study qpcr results with only one melting curve peak an amplification efficiency from 90 105 and correlation coefficients above 0 98 were employed table s3 furthermore during the construction of standard plasmids that carry the targeted pmoa gene or mcra gene the specificity of the primer sets was also confirmed by sequencing supplementary text 2 and table s4 2 5 statistical analysis spss 19 0 spss inc chicago illinois usa and origin 2020 were employed for general statistical analyses and graphing of experimental data the correlations of environmental properties with n damo microbial abundance and activity were explored with pearson s correlation a one way analysis of variance anova was performed to compare any potential spatial and seasonal variations all analyses were performed at the significance level of 5 3 results 3 1 environmental parameters in the yangtze estuary sediment salinity gradually increased from the upper estuary to the lower estuary which ranged from 0 1 to 14 8 fig s3 significant salinity variations were detected among the freshwater habitat 0 1 low salinity habitat 0 8 1 5 and high salinity habitat 6 2 14 8 p 0 05 sediment ph in the range of 7 29 8 59 also tended to increase from the upper estuary to the lower estuary with an increase in salinity p 0 05 fig s3 the sediment temperature in winter with an average of 3 1 c was much lower than that in summer with an average of 32 1 c p 0 01 sediments along the salinity gradient were mainly composed of silt 50 04 93 36 with smaller amounts of clay 1 04 3 60 and sand 5 61 47 72 fig s4 sediment water contents ranged from 27 to 39 in summer and from 27 to 62 in winter ch4 concentrations in sediment pore water were higher at the saline sites 5 3 11 3 μmol l 1 than at the freshwater sites 1 3 3 9 μmol l 1 in summer while they did not show a significant spatial variation in winter with values of 2 7 7 6 μmol l 1 p 0 05 fig s3 nh4 contents ranged between 190 0 and 1658 1 μmol n kg 1 dry weight similarly hereinafter and the maximum was observed at site dxg the no2 contents remained relatively low 0 3 2 7 μmol n kg 1 in the study area the no3 contents ranged between 5 7 and 95 8 μmol n kg 1 and the highest value was detected at freshwater site xp in summer similarly sediment toc decreased gradually from the freshwater habitat 0 8 1 6 to the high salinity habitat 0 1 0 8 with a significant spatial variation p 0 05 sediment fe ii contents 15 2 45 2 mmol kg 1 were generally higher at the freshwater sites while fe iii contents 1 8 22 3 mmol kg 1 were generally higher at the high salinity sites sulfide concentrations in sediment porewater varied from 10 0 to 170 0 μmol l 1 with high spatial and temporal heterogeneity p 0 05 the contents of the sulfate in sediments ranged between 0 3 and 10 3 mmol kg 1 with relatively greater values at the high salinity sites 3 2 abundance of n damo microbes qpcr results illustrated the cooccurrence of m oxyfera like damo bacteria and m nitroreducens like damo archaea at all the sampling sites along the yangtze estuary fig 2 a the abundance of m oxyfera like bacterial pmoa gene and m nitroreducens like archaeal mcra gene varied between 4 0 106 and 7 6 107 copies g 1 dry weight the same hereinafter and between 4 5 105 and 9 4 107 copies g 1 respectively fig 2a the pmoa gene abundance had a maximal value at the freshwater site lhk 7 6 107 copies g 1 and then showed a decreasing trend toward the mouth of the estuary where the salinity was high fig 2a however no significant spatial variation was observed among the freshwater low salinity and high salinity habitats p 0 05 fig 2b the mcra gene abundance peaked at the low salinity site blg 9 4 107 copies g 1 fig 2a similarly no significant spatial variation in mcra gene abundance was observed among the different salinity habitats p 0 05 fig 2b in addition no significant seasonal variation was detected for either pmoa gene abundance or mcra gene abundance p 0 05 fig 2c the abundance of pmoa gene generally tended to be higher than that of mcra gene in the study sediments with average values of 2 7 107 copies g 1 for pmoa gene and 1 6 107 copies g 1 for mcra gene fig 2d the ratio of pmoa gene abundance to mcra gene abundance was unevenly distributed from the estuarine upstream to downstream regions but no significant spatial or seasonal variation was observed p 0 05 fig 2e 3 3 potential n damo rates potential rates of anaerobic ch4 oxidation by n damo microbes were determined via 13c stable isotope experiments during the incubation injected with 13ch4 only no significant production of 13co2 was detected at any sampling site fig s5 which suggests that oxygen no3 no2 and other possible electron acceptors e g so4 2 manganese iron oxides and humic substances in the sediment slurries were not available after preincubation the results showed that potential rates of both nitrite damo and nitrate damo along the environmental gradient of the yangtze estuary ranged from 0 2 84 3 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 dry weight the same hereinafter and 0 4 32 6 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 respectively fig 3 a total n damo rates were significantly greater in summer than in winter p 0 05 fig 3b in summer nitrite damo rates peaked at site wsk 84 3 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 fig 3a where the highest abundance of nitrite damo bacteria was also recorded in addition nitrite damo rates in summer were significantly greater at the freshwater and low salinity sites than at the high salinity sites p 0 05 fig 3c conversely winter nitrite damo rates were relatively lower though not significant p 0 05 fig 3d and had no significant spatial variation fig 3c nitrate damo rates in summer were generally higher in the freshwater habitat than in the low salinity and high salinity habitats p 0 05 fig 3e with the highest value 32 6 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 measured at site lhk significantly lower nitrate damo rates were detected in winter p 0 05 fig 3f but no significant spatial variation in nitrate damo rates was observed in this cold season p 0 05 fig 3e the nitrite damo process was observed to be more important than the nitrate damo process in ch4 oxidation at most of the examined sites fig s6 furthermore it was estimated that the n elimination potential by n damo bacteria was in the range of 0 5 224 7 nmol n g 1 day 1 along the environmental gradient of the study area according to the stoichiometric ratio of ch4 to no2 3 8 in the damo reaction table s1 3 4 potential factors controlling n damo process potential relationships of sediment properties with n damo microbial abundance and activity were analyzed table 1 the abundance of m oxyfera like bacterial pmoa gene was negatively associated with sediment ph and positively correlated with sediment nh4 p 0 05 however there were no significant associations between damo archaeal mcra gene abundance and measured environmental factors p 0 05 potential nitrite damo rates were positively and significantly associated with sediment toc and fe ii whereas they were negatively related to sediment ph and fe iii p 0 05 potential nitrate damo rates were positively correlated with sediment temperature no3 toc and fe ii and negatively related to sediment ph p 0 05 the total ch4 oxidation potential by n damo microbes was positively correlated with sediment toc and fe ii but negatively correlated with sediment fe iii and ph p 0 05 however there was no significant association between the potential activity and abundance of n damo microbes p 0 05 4 discussion in this work molecular and 13ch4 tracer experiments demonstrated the cooccurrence and potential role of n damo microbes in different habitats of the yangtze estuary the results showed that the copy numbers of the m oxyfera like bacterial pmoa gene along the environmental gradient of the yangtze estuary varied between 4 0 106 and 7 6 107 copies g 1 fig 2a which were similar to those in mangrove wetland sediments 2 1 106 to 3 4 107 copies g 1 zhang et al 2018 table s5 in addition a similar range of copy numbers of nitrite damo bacteria on the basis of the 16s rrna gene was also reported in the xixi wetland 1 7 106 to 1 0 107 copies g 1 hu et al 2014 xiazhuhu wetland 3 0 106 to 3 2 107 copies g 1 hu et al 2014 qiantang river 1 32 106 to 1 03 107 copies g 1 shen et al 2014b and hangzhou bay 5 4 106 to 5 0 107 copies g 1 shen et al 2016 table s5 these results indicated that the abundance of nitrite damo bacteria quantified with the pmoa gene was in consistence with that quantified based on the 16s rrna gene the abundance of the m nitroreducens like archaeal mcra gene varied between 4 5 105 and 9 4 107 copies g 1 along the environmental gradient of the yangtze estuary fig 2a which was relatively higher than that in marine sediments 2 5 104 copies g 1 vaksmaa et al 2017a and river sediments 3 0 104 to 4 4 105 copies g 1 vaksmaa et al 2017a table s5 our qpcr data also suggested that the n damo bacteria and archaea might be intimate symbiotic partners in the estuarine and intertidal marshes as they were always present together however there was no significant relationship between the abundance of pmoa and mcra genes p 0 05 table 1 which suggests that in addition to nitrate damo archaea additional no2 providers such as ammonia oxidizers and denitifiers discussed below exist to support the growth of nitrite damo bacteria in estuarine and intertidal marshes fig 4 high rates of both nitrite damo and nitrate damo were detected along the environmental gradient of the yangtze estuary fig 3 which indicate that n damo processes are important ch4 sinks in estuarine intertidal wetlands here the measured potential activity of nitrite damo varied from 0 2 84 3 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 fig 3a which was similar to a previous report for riverbed sediments 0 4 61 nmol 13co2 g 1 dry soil day 1 shen et al 2019 but greater than that documented in paddy soils 0 2 2 1 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 shen et al 2014a and freshwater wetlands 0 31 5 43 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 hu et al 2014 shen et al 2015 however the detected nitrite damo potential in this study was lower than that measured in mangrove wetland sediments 25 9 704 1 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 zhang et al 2018 table s6 the potential activity of nitrate damo in this study ranged from 0 4 32 6 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 fig 3a which was greater than that detected in the qiantang river estuary 0 1 57 nmol 13co2 g 1 day 1 table s6 wang et al 2019 the rate of nitrite damo inclined to be greater than the nitrate damo rate in the intertidal marshes of the yangtze estuary figs 3 and s6 which indicates that nitrite damo bacteria might be more important during ch4 oxidation than nitrate damo archaea in estuarine and intertidal environments consistent with this finding the abundance of pmoa gene also tended to be higher than that of mcra gene fig 2d further suggesting the dominant role of nitrite damo bacteria which was consistent with previous reports for freshwater wetlands shen et al 2017 2020 the potential rates of n damo were greater in summer than in winter and positive correlations were detected between n damo rates and temperature fig 3 and table 1 however the seasonal variation in n damo microbial abundance was not significant p 0 05 and its correlation with temperature was also not significant which indicates that relatively high temperatures might accelerate the cell specific activity of n damo microbes but not their cell numbers he et al 2015 in addition the abundance and potential activity of n damo microbes were heterogeneously distributed across different salinity habitats of the yangtze estuary the n damo microbial abundance tended to be higher at the freshwater and low salinity sites fig 2 similarly the potential rates of nitrite damo and nitrate damo inclined to be greater at the freshwater and low salinity sites while relatively low rates occurred at the high salinity sites fig 3 however the negative correlations of sediment salinity with the abundance and potential activity of n damo microbes were not significant p 0 05 table 1 the pmoa gene abundance correlated well with the nh4 content p 0 05 furthermore a significant positive association of the nitrite damo bacterial abundance with nh4 was also reported in river sediments long et al 2017 this relationship might suggest metabolic cooperation between nitrite damo bacteria and aerobic ammonia oxidizing microorganisms shen et al 2014b no2 contents remained quite low in sediment samples fig s3 likely because it is very unstable in nature and can quickly react with other compounds based on our previous study high abundance and activity of ammonia oxidizers were detected at the sampling sites of this study zheng et al 2014 which could convert nh4 to no2 in the surface aerobic microenvironment and then provide the no2 substrate for nitrite damo bacteria in the inner anaerobic environment fig 4 a significant positive correlation was observed between nitrification and nitrite damo rates in the study sediments p 0 01 fig s7a these results imply that the sediment water interface of the intertidal marshes as a typical oxic anoxic interface might provide an ideal site for cooperation between aerobic ammonia oxidizers and n damo microbes in addition no2 used by nitrite damo bacteria can also be provided by no3 reducers such as denitrifiers and nitrate damo archaea in estuarine and intertidal wetlands fig 4 however the abundance and activity of nitrite damo bacteria were not significantly related to no3 contents p 0 05 table 1 the relationship between denitrification and nitrite damo rates was also not significant p 0 05 fig s7b which suggests that no3 reduction by denitrifiers might play a less important role than ammonia oxidizers in providing no2 for nitrite damo bacteria although a significant relationship was observed between nitrate damo rates and nitrite damo rates p 0 01 fig s7c no2 produced by nitrate damo archaea was inadequate for supporting the nitrite damo reaction because of the low nitrate damo rates figs 3 s6 and s7 in addition no3 contents were considerably lower than those of nh4 p 0 01 which was the dominant form of inorganic n in estuarine and intertidal sediments fig s3 these results suggest that nh4 oxidation rather than no3 reduction might be the major source of no2 for nitrite damo bacteria in estuarine and intertidal wetlands however more studies should be conducted to verify these statements as the electron acceptor for nitrate damo archaea to oxidize ch4 no3 was observed to be positively and significantly correlated with nitrate damo rates p 0 05 table 1 however there was no significant relationship of the nitrate damo archael abundance with no3 in this study p 0 05 this result might support the hypothesis that diverse electron acceptors in addition to no3 such as fe iii and so4 2 can be employed by nitrate damo archaea during the anaerobic ch4 oxidation process ettwig et al 2016 shen et al 2019 weber et al 2017 recently it was demonstrated that m nitroreducens like damo archaea could oxidize ch4 with fe iii ettwig et al 2016 and the fe iii addition could stimulate the expression of mcra gene of damo archaea shen et al 2019 however no significant positive relationship was observed between the abundance of nitrate damo archaea and fe iii in this study p 0 05 table 1 which suggests that fe iii might not be the main electron acceptor to support the growth of nitrate damo archaea in estuarine and intertidal marshes moreover anme 2d archaea were shown to be associated with sulfate driven aom in lake sediments weber et al 2017 additionally the possibility that nitrate damo archaea can anaerobically oxidize ch4 with natural organic matter in estuarine and intertidal marshes cannot be excluded valenzuela et al 2017 2019 however there were no remarkable relationships of the nitrate damo archaeal abundance with sulfate and toc contents p 0 05 table 1 these findings suggested that different electron acceptors might cosupport the growth and metabolism of nitrate damo archaea however further studies are still required to determine whether these possible electron acceptors can be utilized by nitrate damo archaea to oxidize ch4 in estuarine and intertidal wetlands organic carbon can be employed by methanogens to produce ch4 and then facilitate the activity of n damo microbes in anoxic conditions wang et al 2012 shen et al 2014b chen et al 2020 fig 4 although no significant relationship was observed between n damo microbial abundance and toc in this work the activity of n damo microbes was significantly and positively related to toc in the study sediments p 0 01 table 1 a significant negative relationship was detected between the abundance of nitrite damo bacteria and ph p 0 05 like most kinds of microorganisms the suitable ph for n damo microbes is approximately 7 0 8 0 raghoebarsing et al 2006 ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 he et al 2015 however when the ph exceeded 7 6 the n damo reaction rate was reported to decrease with an increase in ph he et al 2015 consistent with this finding the nitrite damo rate was also negatively related to ph table 1 most of which was higher than 7 6 in this study fig s3 p 0 05 in addition a strong negative association was also detected between nitrate damo rates and ph which suggests that although n damo microbes prefer slightly alkaline conditions relatively higher ph 7 6 might have an adverse effect on their growth and activity he et al 2015 actually the charge on the cell membrane of n damo microbes is related to ph which could affect the substrate consumption capacity activity and stability of enzymes and intracellular biochemical reactions li et al 2020 however note that even though the activity and abundance of n damo microbes were closely related to ph their distribution pattern along the environmental gradient of the estuarine and intertidal wetlands was the comprehensive result of all environmental factors further studies are needed to explore the effects of individual parameters on the dynamics of n damo microbes in complex estuarine and intertidal ecotones a link was expected between the abundance of n damo microbes and potential n damo rates however their correlations were not significant p 0 05 table 1 this result might be attributed to the notion that microbial activity cannot be fully reflected by gene abundance at the dna level shan et al 2016 quantitative studies at the gene transcriptional level based on mrna need to be employed in further studies additionally no2 or no3 can also be utilized by some aerobic methanotrophs to oxidize ch4 and contribute to the n damo potential in oxygen limited conditions kits et al 2015 which might also cause a discrepancy between n damo microbial abundance and potential n damo rates during the process of nitrite damo the responsible bacteria can convert no2 to n2 and thus achieve reactive n removal as denitrifiers and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria can ettwig et al 2010 fig 4 in this study the estimated n removal potential of nitrite damo bacteria 0 5 to 224 7 nmol n g 1 day 1 was comparable to that of the anammox process 22 6 158 6 nmol n g 1 day 1 but lower than that of denitrification 319 2 1610 4 nmol n g 1 day 1 in the studied sediments hou et al 2013 fig s8 these data suggest that the nitrite damo process 0 1 14 6 contributed as much as anammox 5 9 12 8 to n loss however the remainder was attributed to denitrification 77 3 92 4 the contribution of the nitrite damo process to n removal showed an identical spatial distribution pattern in both summer and winter which tended to be higher in freshwater and low salinity habitats fig s9 which suggests that nitrite damo bacteria had a more important role in attenuating ch4 emissions and reducing reactive n loading from human activities in the upper estuary 5 conclusions in this study the cooccurrence and important role of m oxyfera like damo bacteria and m nitroreducens like damo archaea in reducing ch4 emissions was evidenced across different salinity habitats of the yangtze estuary the abundance of n damo microbes showed a decreasing trend from the upper estuarine region to the lower estuarine region which was correlated with sediment ph and nh4 contents the potential rates of ch4 oxidation by n damo microbes were relatively higher in the warm season and in the upstream freshwater and low salinity habitats which were significantly related to sediment ph toc fe ii and fe iii contents compared with nitrate damo archaea nitrite damo bacteria tended to be more important in ch4 oxidation in estuarine and intertidal marshes moreover the n damo process was a crucial pathway for n elimination in estuarine and intertidal wetlands and its n removal potential was comparable to that of the anammox process overall this investigation contributes to an understanding of the role of the n damo process in the coupled n and c cycles and its controlling mechanisms in estuarine and intertidal wetlands declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

knowledge studies conducted to investigate the pollution of phczs in coastal china are still limited marine sediment is an important place for the return and agglomeration of phczs in the ocean

grounds for many fishery resources having an important role in maintaining the marine fishery in the east china sea fan et al 2014 owing to the rapid development in industry and increase in population the marine environmental pollution has become increasingly serious considering the reported bioaccumulation and biomagnification of phczs from sediments to top predators wu et al 2017b more attention

and sample extraction surface seawater and sediment top 0 3 cm samples were collected from the east china sea in may 2019 using fishing boats all sampling sites site 01 48 are shown in the fig 1 sampling points were selected in order to accurately reflect the actual occurrence of cz and phczs in east china sea hence sampling sites were evenly distributed trying to cover the whole zhejiang coast in east china sea secondly sampling points were chosen only when both seawater and sediment samples could be collected since in some small areas sediment samples can not be collected mainly due to the rocky bottom sediment samples were freeze dried overnight using vacuum freeze dryers labconco corporation mo america and then homogenized sieved 0 5 mm and stored at 20 c until extraction seawater samples were extracted using dcm in brief 1 0 l of seawater spiked with internal standards 5 ng was completely mixed with 80 ml of dcm in glassware the glassware was shaken in a mixer for 20

the figure s1 si data acquisition and processing were carried out using the agilent masshunter workstation software sediment seawater partitioning coefficients partitioning of cz or phczs between

using the method of ahrens et al 2011 results showed that the f oc of collected sediment was in the range of 0 23 1 1 mean 0 66 qa qc the stock standard solutions of cz and phczs were prepared in cyclohexane and were stored in the dark at 4 c these stock solutions were diluted with cyclohexane to prepare a mixed standard solution at concentrations of 100 μg l for both cz and phczs calibration standard solutions were freshly prepared by diluting the mixed standard solution with cyclohexane to the required concentrations a typical chromatogram of a standard mixture containing cz and phczs is shown in the figure s1 a procedural blank was processed along with every ten samples none of the target cz and phczs was detected in procedural blanks the extraction recoveries of target analysts in

frequently detected than other brominated phczs in seawater seawater concentrations of cz mean 1 9 ng l lod 9 5 ng l were significantly p 0 05 higher than that of 36 ccz 1 1 ng l lod 3 4 ng l to our knowledge this is the first study reporting the occurrence of cz and nine phczs in seawater the phcz composition pattern in seawater here was similar to that in sediments from the saginaw bay rivers coastal north sea and san francisco bay in which 36 ccz was consistently the predominant phcz congener chen et al 2016 wu et al 2016 wu et al 2017b phczs detected in wild animals e g fishes and seals from the san francisco bay and laurentian great lakes were also dominated by 36 ccz wu et al 2017b wu et al 2018 the electrophilic aromatic substitution pattern favors halogen substitution happened at the ortho and para positions compared with the nitrogen on cz which may explain the abundance of 36 ccz observed in various environmental samples bonesi and erra balsells 1997 enzymatic synthesis of phczs using carbazoles also predominantly results in products with halogen substitutions at the 3 3 ccz and 3 6 position 36 ccz while 36 ccz had a stronger environmental stability than 3 ccz mumbo et al 2013 this may also lead to the abundance of 36 ccz in environmental samples here concentrations of phczs in sediment in sediment both cz and phczs were more frequently detected than that in seawater table 1 for example all sediment samples contained cz with the concentrations of 0 14 1 6 ng g mean 0 46 ng g totally 11 phczs were detected in sediment with the concentrations of phczs ranged from 0 34 to 2 0 ng g mean 1 0 ng g cz 3 ccz 3 bcz 36 ccz 27 bcz and 36 bcz were measurable in all sediment samples comparatively 1368 bcz 1 b 36 ccz 2367 ccz 1368 ccz and 136 bcz were less frequently detected consistently 36 ccz was the predominant phcz 0 47 ng g 0 025 1 1 ng g followed by 1368 bcz 0 16 ng g lod 0 29 ng g and 3 bcz 0 11 ng g 0 016 0 33 ng g brominated carbazoles were much less frequently detected and less abundant than chlorinated congeners more enzymatic synthesis of chlorocarbazoles than bromocarbazoles by chloroperoxidase from marine fungus caldariomyces fumago may contribute to the abundance of chlorinated carbazoles mumbo et al 2013 in addition chloroanilide a widely used herbicide can be biotransformed to 3 ccz and 36 ccz in the environment after application possibly serving as an important source of chlorinated carbazoles lin et al 2016 roberts et al 1993 more studies are still needed to elucidate the reasons of elevated chlorinated carbazoles than brominated congeners in the east china sea 3 bcz and 1368 bcz exhibited relatively higher levels than other bromine containing carbazoles in sediment here the predominance of 36 ccz observed here is consistent with that in the saginaw river wu et al 2016 and sanmen bay qiu et al 2019a many studies had reported the occurrence of phczs in sediments from global watersheds indicating their wide spread in the environment the median sediment concentration of phczs in the east china sea 0 96 ng g was much lower than those reported in the lake tai china 1 5 ng g wu et al 2017a saginaw river basin usa 19 ng g chen et al 2016 and great lakes usa 38 ng g guo et al 2017 but higher than that reported in north sea estuary germany 0 23 ng g wu et al 2016 several phczs had also been semi quantified in sediment core samples from the lake michigan usa and ontario river canada pena abaurrea et al 2014 zhu and hites 2005 the sediment concentrations of phczs r s 0 31 p 0 041 and cz r s 0 35 p 0 018 in east china sea were both significantly correlated with toc of sediments consistently wu et al 2017b had observed significant relationship between phcz concentrations and toc in the san francisco bay a significant r s 0 71 p 0 01 correlation was also shown between cz and phcz concentrations in sediment samples here this suggests that phczs may originate from the halogenation of carbazole as well as that they possibly had similar sources for example halogenated indigo dyes are possibly the common sources of 1368 bcz and several phczs parette et al 2015 overall we observed the relative abundance of 36 ccz in both seawater and sediment here this may be due to its synthesis reactions and its resistance to degradation compared with other phcz congeners mumbo et al 2013 had reported that enzymatic synthesis of phczs using carbazole resulted in a dominance of 36 ccz with chlorine substitution at the 3 and 6 positions of carbazole 36 ccz has the enhanced stability because of the high charge density at the para position bonesi and errabalsells 1997 further studies are still needed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their environmental sources sediment seawater distribution coefficients for the first time this study calculated the field based log k oc values for cz and phczs in marine environment mean log k oc calculated in east china sea ranged from 2 0 to 2 8 for cz and phczs table 2 and si figure s2 in detail cz mean 2 8 range 1 4 3 6 had the highest log k oc value followed by 36 ccz 2 7 1 7 3 8 1 b 36 ccz 2 7 2 3 3 1 and 36 bcz 2 5 2 2 2 9 27 bcz had the lowest log k oc value mean 2 0 range 1 6 2 8 this means that chlorine and bromine substituting decreased the binding affinity of cz with sediment further 36 ccz and 36 bcz had higher log k oc values than 3 ccz mean 2 4 range 1 5 3 3 and 3 bcz 2 4 1 6 3 1 this suggests that phczs with two halogen substituents had higher log k oc values than that with one halogen substituent the position of substituent also has influence on the binding affinity of phczs with sediment as evidenced by the higher log k oc of 36 bcz than 27 bcz the field based log k oc could be affected by many other factors such as the nature of sediment and hydrologic conditions of seawater moreover no significant relationships between log k oc and log k ow were found for cz and phczs si figure s3 this may suggest that the nonspecific hydrophobic interaction was not the major factor governing the partitioning between various phczs and sediment overall more studies are warranted to better understand the partitioning of cz and phczs between different environmental matrices 4 conclusion in this study we investigated the occurrence and concentration profiles of cz and phcz congeners in seawater and sediment from east china sea the results showed wide distribution of cz and phczs in the seawater and sediment samples in seawaters cz 3 ccz 1368 ccz and 36 ccz had detection frequencies higher than 50 among phczs 36 ccz mean 1 1 ng l had the highest mean seawater concentration accounting for mean 60 of phczs followed by 3 ccz 0 51 ng l and 1368 ccz 0 19 ng l in sediments cz 3 ccz 3 bcz 36 ccz 27

from ontario canada with the concentrations of 1 8 dibromo 3 6 dichlorocarbazole 18 b 36 ccz in the range of 0 19 4 7 ng g pena abaurrea et al 2014 until now varying types of phczs with different halogen substitution patterns mainly including br2 br5 clbr2 clbr3 clbr4 clbr3i br4i and br3i2 had been found in the sediments of great lakes with the total concentrations of the 26 phczs ranged from 1 0 to 440 ng g guo et al 2014 guo et al 2017 additionally a variety of phczs had been reported to occur in aquatic sediments from around the world with concentrations up to several thousand ng g chen et al 2016 wu et al 2016 wu et al 2017a these findings suggest a broad distribution of phczs in the global environment the widespread presence of phczs has sparked considerable interest in tracking their origins qiu et al 2019b zhou et al 2019 existing evidence suggests that phczs may originate from both natural and anthropogenic sources mumbo et al 2013 qiu et al 2019a wu et al 2018 halogenated indigo dyes are considered as possible sources of 1368 bcz 18 b 36 ccz and 1368 ccz parette et al 2015 carbazoles with an iodol substituent may be present as impurities in dye formulations for example 1368 bcz 1368 ccz and 18 b 36 ccz had been found in a historical synthetic 7 7 dibromo 5 5 dichloroindigo produced by basf parette et al 2015 however synthesized indigo dye samples obtained from sigma aldrich did not contain phczs riddell et al 2015 in recent years 3 6 dibromocarbazole 36 bcz 2 7 dibromocarbazole 27 bcz and 3 6 diiodocarbazole 36 icz have been utilized as raw materials in light

chlorocarbazole 3 ccz and 3 6 dichlorocarbazole 36 ccz parette et al 2016 trobs et al 2011 the enzymatic synthesis of phczs and photo degradation of diclofenac occurred under natural conditions are considered the natural sources chen et al 2018 mumbo et al 2013 however to date confirmative evidence on congener specific sources for phczs is still lacking moreover it is still necessary to study the occurrence and environmental behaviors of phczs in oceans wu et al 2017a had measured the levels of phczs in sediment from tai lake which is the third largest freshwater lake in china to our knowledge studies conducted to investigate the pollution of phczs in coastal china are still limited marine sediment is an important place for the return and agglomeration of phczs in the ocean environment therefore it is of great significance to study the occurrence and distribution of phczs in marine waters and sediments from china zhejiang coastal areas are important spawning and feeding grounds for many fishery resources having an important role in maintaining the marine fishery in the east china sea fan et al 2014 owing to the rapid development in industry and increase in population the marine environmental pollution has become increasingly serious considering the reported bioaccumulation and biomagnification of phczs from sediments to top predators wu et al 2017b more attention should be paid to investigate the occurrence and distribution of phczs in seawater and sediment from east china sea in this study paired seawater n 48 and surface sediment samples n 48 were collected from east china sea and analyzed for carbazole cz and 11 phczs the main objectives of this study were to investigate the occurrence and spatial distribution of cz and phczs in seawater and sediment and to explore the partitioning behaviors of cz and phczs between seawater and sediment to our knowledge this is the first study reporting the concentrations of phczs in seawater and marine sediment

and sample extraction surface seawater and sediment top 0 3 cm samples were collected from the east china sea in may 2019 using fishing boats all sampling sites site 01 48 are shown in the fig 1 sampling points were selected in order to accurately reflect the actual occurrence of cz and phczs in east china sea hence sampling sites were evenly distributed trying to cover the whole zhejiang coast in east china sea secondly sampling points were chosen only when both seawater and sediment samples could be collected since in some small areas sediment samples can not be collected mainly due to the rocky bottom sediment samples were freeze dried overnight using vacuum freeze dryers labconco corporation mo america and then homogenized sieved 0 5 mm and stored at 20 c until extraction seawater samples were extracted using dcm in brief 1 0 l of seawater spiked with internal standards 5 ng was completely mixed with 80 ml of dcm in glassware the glassware was shaken in a mixer for 20 min at 60 rpm and then centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min the supernatants were reserved and transferred into a new glassware the residual seawater was extracted again with 80 ml of dcm both supernatants were combined and evaporated in an evaporator the residues were reconstituted in 100 μl of n hexane extraction of phczs in sediments was performed following the method of wu et al 2016 but with modifications briefly 2 0 g of freeze dried sediments were spiked with 5 ng of each internal standard and then subjected to accelerated solvent extraction dionex ase 150 sunnyvale ca usa with dichloromethane dcm after sulfur removal with activated copper the extract was purified by auto gel permeation chromatography gpc and concentrator unit lctech gmbh dorfen germany which was equipped

temperature of the transfer line ion source and quadrupole were maintained at 260 c 230 c and 150 c respectively cz and phczs were analyzed in selective ion monitoring mode for quantitative determination of the target compounds the retention time and selected ions for the quantification of cz and phczs are shown in the table s1 si the typical chromatograms of phczs and cz are provided in the figure s1 si data acquisition and processing were carried out using the agilent masshunter workstation software sediment seawater partitioning coefficients partitioning of cz or phczs between seawater and sediment were evaluated based on their sediment seawater partitioning coefficients k oc l kg which was calculated using the following equation k o c 100 c s c w f o c where c s and c w indicate the concentrations of detected analysts in collected sediment ng kg and seawater ng l respectively the f oc indicates the total organic carbon toc content in the sediment which was measured using the method of ahrens et al 2011 results showed that the f oc of collected sediment was in the range of 0 23 1 1 mean 0 66 qa qc the stock standard solutions of cz and phczs were prepared in cyclohexane and were stored in the dark at 4 c these stock solutions were diluted with cyclohexane to prepare a mixed standard solution at concentrations of 100 μg l for both cz and phczs calibration standard solutions were freshly prepared by diluting the mixed standard solution with cyclohexane to the required concentrations a typical chromatogram of a standard mixture containing cz and phczs is shown in the figure s1 a procedural blank was processed along with every ten samples none of the target cz and phczs was detected in procedural blanks the extraction recoveries of target analysts in

spearman s correlation r s analysis were performed using the spss software statistics 23 0 ibm co usa a significance level of p 0 05 was applied in this study 3 results and discussion concentrations of phczs in seawater cz and nine phczs were detected in seawater samples from east china sea table 1 the concentrations of phczs ranged from 0 21 to 11 ng l mean 2 7 ng l cz 94 3 ccz 89 1368 ccz 65 and 36 ccz 57 had detection frequencies dfs higher than 50 the dfs of remaining detected phczs were in the range of 13 136 bcz 36 36 bcz among phczs 36 ccz mean 1 1 ng l had the highest mean seawater concentration accounting for mean 60 of phczs fig 2 followed by 3 ccz 0 51 ng l p 0 01 and 1368 ccz 0 19 ng l p 0 01 bromine containing phczs were less abundant than chlorinated phczs with 36 bcz more frequently detected than other brominated phczs in seawater seawater concentrations of cz mean 1 9 ng l lod 9 5 ng l were significantly p 0 05 higher than that of 36 ccz 1 1 ng l lod 3 4 ng l to our knowledge this is the first study reporting the occurrence of cz and nine phczs in seawater the phcz composition pattern in seawater here was similar to that in sediments from the saginaw bay rivers coastal north sea and san francisco bay in which 36 ccz was consistently the predominant phcz congener chen et al 2016 wu et al 2016 wu et al 2017b phczs detected in wild animals e g fishes and seals from the san francisco bay and laurentian great lakes were also dominated by 36 ccz wu et al 2017b wu et al 2018 the electrophilic aromatic substitution pattern favors halogen substitution happened at the ortho and para positions compared with the nitrogen on cz which may explain the abundance of 36 ccz observed in various environmental samples bonesi and erra balsells 1997 enzymatic synthesis of phczs using carbazoles also predominantly results in products with halogen substitutions at the 3 3 ccz and 3 6 position 36 ccz while 36 ccz had a stronger environmental stability than 3 ccz mumbo et al 2013 this may also lead to the abundance of 36 ccz in environmental samples here concentrations of phczs in sediment in sediment both cz and phczs were more frequently detected than that in seawater table 1 for example all sediment samples contained cz with the concentrations of 0 14 1 6 ng g mean 0 46 ng g totally 11 phczs were detected in sediment with the concentrations of phczs ranged from 0 34 to 2 0 ng g mean 1 0 ng g cz 3 ccz 3 bcz 36 ccz 27 bcz and 36 bcz were measurable in all sediment samples comparatively 1368 bcz 1 b 36 ccz 2367 ccz 1368 ccz and 136 bcz were less frequently detected consistently 36 ccz was the predominant phcz 0 47 ng g 0 025 1 1 ng g followed by 1368 bcz 0 16 ng g lod 0 29 ng g and 3 bcz 0 11 ng g 0 016 0 33 ng g brominated carbazoles were much less frequently detected and less abundant than chlorinated congeners more enzymatic synthesis of chlorocarbazoles than bromocarbazoles by chloroperoxidase from marine fungus caldariomyces fumago may contribute to the abundance of chlorinated carbazoles mumbo et al 2013 in addition chloroanilide a widely used herbicide can be biotransformed to 3 ccz and 36 ccz in the environment after application possibly serving as an important source of chlorinated carbazoles lin et al 2016 roberts et al 1993 more studies are still needed to elucidate the reasons of elevated chlorinated carbazoles than brominated congeners in the east china sea 3 bcz and 1368 bcz exhibited relatively higher levels than other bromine containing carbazoles in sediment here the predominance of 36 ccz observed here is consistent with that in the saginaw river wu et al 2016 and sanmen bay qiu et al 2019a many studies had reported the occurrence of phczs in sediments from global watersheds indicating their wide spread in the environment the median sediment concentration of phczs in the east china sea 0 96 ng g was much lower than those reported in the lake tai china 1 5 ng g wu et al 2017a saginaw river basin usa 19 ng g chen et al 2016 and great lakes usa 38 ng g guo et al 2017 but higher than that reported in north sea estuary germany 0 23 ng g wu et al 2016 several phczs had also been semi quantified in sediment core samples from the lake michigan usa and ontario river canada pena abaurrea et al 2014 zhu and hites 2005 the sediment concentrations of phczs r s 0 31 p 0 041 and cz r s 0 35 p 0 018 in east china sea were both significantly correlated with toc of sediments consistently wu et al 2017b had observed significant relationship between phcz concentrations and toc in the san francisco bay a significant r s 0 71 p 0 01 correlation was also shown between cz and phcz concentrations in sediment samples here this suggests that phczs may originate from the halogenation of carbazole as well as that they possibly had similar sources for example halogenated indigo dyes are possibly the common sources of 1368 bcz and several phczs parette et al 2015 overall we observed the relative abundance of 36 ccz in both seawater and sediment here this may be due to its synthesis reactions and its resistance to degradation compared with other phcz congeners mumbo et al 2013 had reported that enzymatic synthesis of phczs using carbazole resulted in a dominance of 36 ccz with chlorine substitution at the 3 and 6 positions of carbazole 36 ccz has the enhanced stability because of the high charge density at the para position bonesi and errabalsells 1997 further studies are still needed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their environmental sources sediment seawater distribution coefficients for the first time this study calculated the field based log k oc values for cz and phczs in marine environment mean log k oc calculated in east china sea ranged from 2 0 to 2 8 for cz and phczs table 2 and si figure s2 in detail cz mean 2 8 range 1 4 3 6 had the highest log k oc value followed by 36 ccz 2 7 1 7 3 8 1 b 36 ccz 2 7 2 3 3 1 and 36 bcz 2 5 2 2 2 9 27 bcz had the lowest log k oc value mean 2 0 range 1 6 2 8 this means that chlorine and bromine substituting decreased the binding affinity of cz with sediment further 36 ccz and 36 bcz had higher log k oc values than 3 ccz mean 2 4 range 1 5 3 3 and 3 bcz 2 4 1 6 3 1 this suggests that phczs with two halogen substituents had higher log k oc values than that with one halogen substituent the position of substituent also has influence on the binding affinity of phczs with sediment as evidenced by the higher log k oc of 36 bcz than 27 bcz the field based log k oc could be affected by many other factors such as the nature of sediment and hydrologic conditions of seawater moreover no significant relationships between log k oc and log k ow were found for cz and phczs si figure s3 this may suggest that the nonspecific hydrophobic interaction was not the major factor governing the partitioning between various phczs and sediment overall more studies are warranted to better understand the partitioning of cz and phczs between different environmental matrices 4 conclusion in this study we investigated the occurrence and concentration profiles of cz and phcz congeners in seawater and sediment from east china sea the results showed wide distribution of cz and phczs in the seawater and sediment samples in seawaters cz 3 ccz 1368 ccz and 36 ccz had detection frequencies higher than 50 among phczs 36 ccz mean 1 1 ng l had the highest mean seawater concentration accounting for mean 60 of phczs followed by 3 ccz 0 51 ng l and 1368 ccz 0 19 ng l in sediments cz 3 ccz 3 bcz 36 ccz 27 bcz and 36 bcz were detected in all sediment samples consistently 36 ccz was the predominant phcz 0 47 ng g 0 025 1 1 ng g followed by 1368 bcz 0 16 ng g lod 0 29 ng g and 3 bcz 0 11 ng g 0 016 0 33 ng g this study first reports the field based log k oc values for cz and phczs in marine environment with the highest log k oc value observed for cz followed by 36 ccz 1 b 36 ccz and 36 bcz the 27 bcz and 1368 ccz had relatively lower log k oc values these data contribute to the better understanding of the environmental occurrence and behaviors of these chemicals declaration of competing interest

17282,nitrous oxide n2o and noy nitrous acid hono nitric oxide no nitrogen dioxide no2 are released as byproducts or obligate intermediates during aerobic ammonia oxidation and further influence global warming and atmospheric chemistry the ammonia oxidation process is catalyzed by groups of globally distributed ammonia oxidizing microorganisms which are playing a major role in atmospheric n2o and noy emissions yet little is known about hono and no2 production by the recently discovered widely distributed complete ammonia oxidizers comammox able to individually perform the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite here we examined the n2o and noy production patterns by comammox bacterium nitrospira inopinata during aerobic ammonia oxidation in comparison to its canonical ammonia converting counterparts representatives of the ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob our findings i show low yield noy production by the comammox bacterium compared to aob ii highlight the role of the no reductase in the biological formation of n2o based on results from nh2oh inhibition assays and its stimulation during archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidations iii postulate that the lack of hydroxylamine nh2oh and no transformation enzymatic activities may lead to a buildup of nh2oh no which can abiotically react to n2o iv collectively confirm restrained n2o

activities involved in n2o and noy production the mechanisms and regulations of n2o and noy formation as well as environmental factors controlling their flux is necessary to counteract related environmental issues the two step nitrification process was classically thought to be mediated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa that oxidize ammonia nh3 to nitrite no2 via hydroxylamine nh2oh and subsequently nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob catalyzing nitrite oxidation to nitrate no3 kuypers et al 2018 regarding n2o emissions both aoa and aob contribute to hybrid n2o formation through the abiotic reaction of the intermediate nh2oh with no2 poth and focht 1985 stieglmeier et al 2014 this process dominates at atmospheric oxygen levels while nitrifier denitrification enzymatic no2 reduction to n2o via no was only attributed to aob kozlowski et al 2016b stieglmeier et al 2014 and occurs mostly at low o2 availability poth and focht 1985 schmidt et al 2004 wrage monnig et al 2018 only very recently the biotic conversion of nh2oh to n2o under anoxic conditions through the cytochrome p460 protein also called cytl was characterized caranto et al 2016 moreover hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao activity results in the production of no rather than the previously considered no2 under oxic and anoxic conditions caranto and lancaster 2017 caranto et al 2016 regarding the yield of n2o production previous work on activities of marine and terrestrial cultures and microcosms suggested that aoa produce relatively less n2o compared to aob n2o consumed nh4 ratio during aerobic ammonia oxidation hink et al 2018 hink et al 2017 jung et al 2014 stieglmeier et al 2014 recently the previously postulated two microorganism nitrification process was proven to be possible within one single organism the complete ammonia oxidizing comammox organisms are individually able to oxidize ammonia to nitrate via nitrite daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 so far all identified comammox bacteria are phylogenetically affiliated to phylogenetic lineage ii nitrospira which also contains globally distributed canonical nob daims et al 2016 comammox genomes harbor

gao et al 2016 palomo et al 2018 pjevac et al 2017 van kessel et al 2015 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 yu et al 2018 furthermore the comammox organism nitrospira inopinata produces no as an intermediate of ammonia oxidation and this produced no cannot be further denitrified to n2o kits et al 2017 as a consequence of this the yield of n2o is relatively low compared to aob as n2o originates rather from the abiotic conversion of nh2oh a further intermediate of ammonia oxidation by comammox bacteria kits et al 2019 liu et al 2017 soil hono emission was firstly reported in 1985 kubota and asami 1985 and in recent years concerns have been raised due to its effects on air quality su et al 2011 a dry peak and a wet peak of hono and no production were found at low 0 40 water holding capacity whc and high 70 140 whc soil water content respectively oswald et al 2013 wu et al 2019 the underlying drivers of this dry peak have been suggested as the chemical equilibrium between soil nitrite and protons su et al 2011 the surface acidity promoted gas emissions donaldson et al 2014 kim and or 2019 and the direct release through aob oswald et al 2013 the wet peak was found to be associated with increased nitrate reduction by nitrate reducers wu et al 2019 a recent study showed that surface abiotic reactions of nh2oh with h2o significantly contributed to the hono release from drying soil with a maximum conversion yield of nh2oh to hono of 9 ermel et al 2018 considering low concentrations of nh2oh in soils and other environments the large amount of hono emission during ammonia oxidation remains hard to explain soil hono emissions are directly related to net nitrification rates as the emission can be experimentally reduced through the addition of nitrification inhibitors mushinski et al 2019 scharko et al 2015 as the nitrogen turnover rates of aob are significantly higher than those of aoa and comammox daims et al 2015 it can be expected that hono emissions from aob are equally higher ermel et al 2018 yet there is no study reporting whether hono can be emitted from comammox bacteria and if so to what extent a comprehensive overview of the so far known n2o and noy production pathways upon nitrification is illustrated in fig 1 to extend our mechanistic knowledge of the nitrogen cycle we here aim at gaining insights in the so far understudied n2o and noy production patterns by comammox bacterium n inopinata during aerobic ammonia oxidation in comparison to its canonical ammonia converting counterparts representatives of aoa and aob in this study we use highly enriched and pure ammonia oxidizing cultures of aoa aob and comammox bacteria to 1 quantify the production and compare the yields of n2o and noy from these cultures 2 determine the biotic abiotic pathways contributing to potential n2o production from these organisms by using a combination of batch cultivation nh2oh inhibition dynamic chamber flux measurements n2o isotope analysis and comparative genomics we demonstrate that n2o and noy production is restrained in comammox n inopinata with activity of no reductase nor being critical in differentiating high and low n2o production among aob and comammox strains during aerobic ammonia oxidation 2 materials and methods 2 1 studied ammonia oxidizing microbes strains included in this study include the complete ammonia

concentrations were determined by a gas chromatograph fitted with electron capture detector shimadu gc 2014b japan headspace gas was collected from the schott bottles with gas tight syringes after cultivation the detection range of n2o concentration is between 0 and 10 ppm and dilutions were made according to the tested concentrations sodium hydroxide was added into the bottle when co2 concentrations were high the δ15nbulk δ18o and sp values from gas samples were analyzed by a delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms thermo fisher scientific china which is equipped with five cups to analyze both m z 44 14n14n16o 45 14n15n16o 15n14n16o 14n14n17o and 46 14n14n18o of n2o molecules and m z 30 14n16o and 31 15n16o of no fragments the scrambling factor in the ion source of this irms 0 085 was determined by a series of ᵝn labelled n2o as röckmann et al rockmann et al 2003 reported the calibration of laboratory n2o working standards was performed by two standards kindly offered by dr reinhard well well et al 2008 typical analytical precision for δ15nbulk δ18o and sp in this irms were 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 respectively the δ15nα δ15nbulk and sp were calculated according to equation 1 and 2 toyoda and yoshida 1999 the difference between the isotopomer ratios of n δ15nα δ15nβ is referred to as 15n site preference sp in 1 δ 15 n bulk δ 15 n α δ 15 n β 2 2 sp δ 15 n α δ 15 n β 2 8 flux measurement of noy emissions of reactive nitrogen gases hono no and no2 from the cultures were measured by a dynamic chamber system which has been described in detail elsewhere wu et al 2019 wu et al 2020 for all cultures 500 ml of active cells were harvested washed and resuspended with 250 ml aom and then split into three parts one for the hono measurement one after heat treatment for the sterile control and one in parallel maintained in the incubator for positive activity control briefly 80 ml of the cell culture were transferred into a glass beaker inner diameter 50 cm which contained 40 g of sterilized glass beads 0 35 0 50 mm asone japan then 80 or 40 µl of 1 m nh4cl solution were added to the beaker thus the initial nh4 concentration was 1 or 0 5 mm for the aob aoa and comammox cultures table s5 the beaker containing the cell cultures and substrate were placed into a teflon chamber 10 l and measured in the dark at 46 c for aoa n gargensis 28 c for aob n europaea 37 c for aob n nitrosa 18 3d 42 c for ca n uzonensis 5a and n inopinata respectively the chamber was flushed with purified dry air without cxhy hono nox o3 etc at a constant flow rate of 6 l min 1 mixing ratios of hono in the headspace were continuously monitored by a stripping coil coupled with high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 based on the reaction of sulfanilamide and n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride huang et al 2002 the time resolution and lower detection limit were 6 min and 4 ppt respectively nox o3 co2 and h2o were measured by a chemiluminescence analyzer thermo model 42i tl usa an ozone analyzer thermo model 49i usa and a li cor li cor 840a usa respectively the flux of hono and nox were calculated according to equation 3 3 f q a 1 v m χ o u t where f is the flux of hono or nox ng m 2 s 1 in terms of nitrogen which is the same as follows q is the purging flow rate m3 s 1 a is the area of culture solution m2 vm is the molar volume of air m3 mol 1 and χout is the headspace mixing ratio at the outlet of the chamber ppb the sterilized background was measured with 80 ml of sterilized cell culture which was mixed with 80 or 40 µl of a 1 m nano2 stock solution thus the initial no2 concentration was 1 or 0 5 mm for the aoa and aob sterilized background and 0 0025 mm for comammox bacteria the latter concentration of 0 0025 mm was determined at the time point of hono flux peak in the corresponding living culture experiment and represents the maximum no2 concentration produced by the comammox bacteria table s5 the ph of the sterilized background was regulated to the same as the corresponding cell cultures to avoid any ph effects on hono emissions then hono and nox emission from the sterilized background was quantified by the dynamic chamber system as described in detail above total emissions of hono no and no2 mg m 2 during a full wetting drying experiment from the cultures were calculated according to equation 4 4 e n t 0 t m a x f t d t where e n is the total emissions of hono no or no2 mg m 2 f t is the noy gases flux at the measurement time t in order to minimize the effects of nitrification rate on noy emissions we also calculated ratio of the maximum noy flux with nitrification rate and compared the results among different cultures 3 results and discussion 3 1 n2o production during aerobic ammonia oxidation to compare the production yields of n2o during aerobic nh4 oxidation we normalized the initial cell numbers of the five cultures to obtain comparable nh4 turnover rates table s2 for all incubations here experiments were performed under aerobic conditions and hypoxia which could stimulate hypoxic nitrite reduction wrage monnig et al 2018 was never reached during incubation since the tested aoa strains are relatively sensitive to elevated levels of nh4 initial nh4 concentrations of 0 5 1 2 mm and 0 5 2 5 mm were applied to the ca n uzonensis 5a strain kits et al 2017 and n gargensis palatinszky et al 2015 respectively the two aob strains n nitrosa 18 3d and n europaea as well as the comammox bacterium n inopinata were fed with 2 5 and 10 mm nh4 n2o production was synchronized with ammonia oxidation fig 2 confirming that n2o was formed as a byproduct of aerobic archaeal or bacterial ammonia oxidation based on the final n2o concentration the yield per added converted ammonia n2o nh3 was calculated while oxidizing the same amount of nh3 aob n europaea generated the most n2o followed by comammox n inopinata aoa n gargensis aoa ca n uzonensis 5a and the aob n nitrosa 18 3d fig 2 with increasing amount of substrate the n2o yield increased for the two aoa strains while it decreased for the aob and comammox strains table s2 these results are generally consistent with previous findings where yields of n2o during aerobic ammonia oxidation for aob were reaching levels of up to 0 51 and those for aoa range from 0 068 to 0 158 hink et al 2017 stieglmeier et al 2014 aob generate more n2o than aoa in various ecosystems hink et al 2018 hink et al 2017 meinhardt et al 2018 comammox n inopinata in this study exhibited different n2o nh3 yields 0 2 compared to previous work 0 07 kits et al 2019 this can be a result of different initial substrate concentrations 2 mm nh4cl this study and 0 25 mm nh4cl in previous work and different time spans of the performed experiments 100 hours in this study and 2 hours in previous work in addition the initial density and acitivy of the n inopinata cultures could also matter when supplying 5 or 10 mm nh4cl to n inopinata the n2o nh3 yields 0 1 were indeed similar to what was reported previously 0 07 kits et al 2019 collectively this study confirmed the range of n2o nh3 yields by n inopinata under various substrate and cell density conditions the here observed lowest yield for aob n nitrosa 18 3d is the sole exception to this pattern it is speculated that the lack of nor that enzymatically produces n2o table s1 might explain why n nitrosa 18 3d produces the lowest yield of n2o in this study comammox n inopinata equally lacking the nor enzyme kits et al 2019 also produced much less n2o low yield than aob which are harboring nor genes however the observed significant difference in n2o yields between the nor lacking bacteria n nitrosa 18 3d and comammox n inopinata deserves further investigation both abiotic and enzymatic processes underlying the generation of n2o in these two ammonia oxidizing strains need to be taken into account 3 2 high noy emissions from aob but not comammox and aoa when testing the different strains emissions of noy during nh4 oxidation large amounts of hono no and no2 were emitted from aob cultures n nitrosa 18 3d and n europaea fig 3 and fig s2 compared with the sterilized background 31 23 and 36 ng m 2 s 1 respectively the maximum flux f max of hono no and no2 measured in the presence of aob n nitrosa 18 3d increased by 200 85 and 350 fold respectively fig 3a the maximum hono no and no2 flux from aob n europaea equally increased to 1 5 4 fold higher than in the sterilized background however if nitrification rate was taken into account the f max nitrification rate of hono and no2 for aob n nitrosa 18 3d was lower than that of aob n europaea fig 3c the maximum hono emissions from aoa n gargensis 1680 ng m 2 s 1 and comammox n inopinata 57 ng m 2 s 1 was also higher than the sterilized background 1115 and 31 ng m 2 s 1 no emissions from aoa ca n uzonensis 5a were observed aob emitting much more hono than aoa in here is consistent with previous studies ermel et al 2018 mushinski et al 2019 although aoa have the theoretical potential to be dominant hono producers under certain conditions such as low soil ph scharko et al 2015 we here show that the comammox culture can also emit hono but with an absolute flux much smaller than that observed for either aob and aoa 100 250 and 20 fold lower the most likely explanation is the lower nitrification rate of comammox which was reported to be correlated with noy flux mushinski et al 2019 scharko et al 2015 overall aob n europaea was the most efficient organism in converting ammonia to noy gases while comammox n inopinata was the least fig 3c similar to the maximum flux total noy emission e n from aob n nitrosa 18 3d aob n europaea and comammox n inopinata was significantly higher than in the sterilized background but its contribution to total noy emission was relatively small compared to aob and aoa contrary for aoa n gargensis and aoa ca n uzonensis 5a no such effect could be observed fig 3b among the three parts of noy no2 n accounted for more than 50 of the produced noy by the tested organisms aob n nitrosa 18 3d aob n europaea aoa n gargensis and aoa ca n uzonensis 5a and their corresponding sterilized backgrounds for comammox n inopinata the contributions of hono n no n and no2 n were similar while no n dominated in the sterilized background we also normalized the ratio of e n to nitrification rate which was the highest for aob n europaea and the lowest for comammox n inopinata fig 3d taken together with the flux data comammox might cause the release of certain amounts of noy gases but their contribution to total noy emission are relatively small compared to aob in environmental context the abundance of comammox nitrospira in forest and paddy soils can be comparable to aoa and aob wang et al 2019 the activity of comammox nitrospira was comparably higher under low nitrogen concentration than high nitrogen concentration shi et al 2018 wang et al 2019 3 3 pathways controlling n2o production to obtain information on the pathways leading to n2o production in all tested organisms n2o was harvested from the headspace of batch yield experiments performed under various substrate levels we then determined the site preference sp δ15n sp defined as δ15nα δ15nβ within the linear n2o molecule nβ nα o since the sp values of generated n2o indicate its initial source either from hydroxylamine oxidation high sp or nitrifier denitrification low sp with the exception of n europaea all cultures exhibited sp values around or above 20 indicating that the major source of n2o was hydroxylamine oxidation conversion table s2 consistent with previous reports jung et al 2014 kits et al 2019 santoro et al 2011 sutka et al 2004 according to a previous study where the sp value of n europaea was 2 3 1 9 for hydroxylamine oxidation sutka et al 2003 the sp values of around 0 for n europaea here may indicate that the formed n2o could also originate from hydroxylamine oxidation by nor converting nh2oh to n2o with an upregulation of nor fig 4 and fig 5 rather than aerobic nitrifier denitrification through nor kozlowski et al 2014 interestingly the aoa n gargensis exhibited decreasing sp values with increasing substrate concentrations suggesting the nitrifier denitrification mechanism to play a potentially increased role under high ammonia pressure this links to a recent study revealing enzymatic denitrification to n2o via a putative cytochrome p450 no reductase at low ph in an aoa strain jung et al 2019 the p450 gene is also present in n gargensis but not in ca n uzonensis 5a and might hence explain the changing n2o production pathways under elevated ammonium pressure for only this specific aoa we further tested a second n2o formation pathway by aob n nitrosa 18 3d aob n europaea and comammox n inopinata from nh2oh 0 1 mm oxidation aoa strains were not included in this part of the study due to their much higher sensitivity to nh2oh as compared to aob and comammox nitrospira fig s4 since nh2oh is not stable and can react with various chemicals oxidants to form n2o and or no2 we in parallel included heat inactived biomass and medium only abiotic controls for comparison within 24 hours the concentrations of generated n2o no2 and no3 remained stable fig s3 indicating completion of biological or chemical reactions with nh2oh the yields of n2o no2 or no3 to added converted nh2oh fig s4 table s4 were compared within different treatments and among the three cultures all heat inactived biomass except n europaea and aom medium only exhibited small statistically similar n2o n2o nh2oh yields one way anova test p 0 05 n europaea generated much more n2o 7 63 0 25 n2o nh2oh than its heat inactived and abiotic controls and the other tested strains revealing that n europaea can enzymatically convert nh2oh to n2o under oxic conditions we observed n2o yields n2o nh2oh of 2 17 0 22 and 0 63 0 05 for n nitrosa 18 3d and n inopinata respectively indicating that n nitrosa 18 3d may biologically convert nh2oh to n2o via the enzyme cytl p460 under aerobic condition or through a yet unknown mechanism while for n inopinata the transformation of nh2oh to n2o was insignificantly different to the heat inactived and abiotic controls and thus majorly based on abiotic chemical reactions 3 4 roles of nitric oxide reductases nor and nh2oh no transforming enzymes in n2o formation it is interesting to see that 1 the previous reported low n2o yield producing comammox bacteria kits et al 2019 in this study generated more n2o than the aob n nitrosa 18 3d and 2 the two aob cultures performed significantly different regarding yield and sp character of formed n2o by screening the genome of aob n nitrosa 18 3d no typical genes encoding for the nitrifier denitrification pathway including the nor encoding gene were found table s1 while that specific genetic repertoire is present in the model aob strain n europaea in addition it was earlier reported that nor is heavily involved in the n2o producing pathways in n europaea kozlowski et al 2014 and that aob lacking nor performed differently than nor positive strains regarding the release of no and n2o kozlowski et al 2016a furthermore the above described n2o sp values support the hydroxylamine oxidation pathway resulting in n2o formation for most of the studied cultures hydroxylamine can be partially enzymatically transformed to n2o and the remaining hydroxylamine can then abiotically react to form additional n2o it has been previously reported that n2o formed by n inopinata originated exclusively from abiotic hydroxylamine conversion kits et al 2019 that would mean negligible enzymatic activities on hydroxylamine conversions to n2o by n inopinata as nh2oh is an intermediate metabolite yet at high levels a toxin to living cells we tested the effects of a wide range of nh2oh levels on archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidation by calculating the half maximal effective concentrations ec50 of nh2oh on the ammonia oxidizing culture we found aoa are most sensitive to nh2oh ec50 11 2 and 5 1 μm for ca n uzonensis 5a and n gargensis respectively followed by comammox n inopinata ec50 126 4 μm the two aob strains are much more tolerant to nh2oh with ec50 819 0 and 879 5 μm for n nitrosa 18 3d and n europaea respectively although nh2oh has been proven as an intermediate for archaeal ammonia oxidation the subsequent nh2oh oxidizing enzymes have not been identified thus making it impossible to fully explain the extraordinarily high sensitivity of aoa to nh2oh yet despite comammox n inopinata harboring similar nh2oh dehydrogenase encoding genes hao as aob it lacks the cytochrome p460 encoding gene cytl kits et al 2019 that was hypothesized to function by detoxifying nh2oh to n2o under anoxic conditions caranto et al 2016 nevertheless cytochrome c beta cyts postulated to having a similar function as cytl is present in the genome of n inopinata daims et al 2015 besides hao cytl and cyts the no reductase nor is also involved in hydroxylamine oxidation by reducing no to n2o here we screened the genomes of n nitrosa 18 3d this study n europaea chain et al 2003 and n inopinata daims et al 2015 for genes encoding hao cytl cyts and nor and designed specific primers targeting these genes table s3 allowing us to record the transcriptional responses to nh2oh upon stimulation with 0 1 mm nh2oh fig 5 among all genes and strains exclusively the norb gene of n europaea was significantly upregulated by 1 order of magnitude upon nh2oh stimulation worth noticing is that despite not being upregulated the expression of hao 2 and cytl 2 in n nitrosa 18 3d is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of hao and cyts in n inopinata this can explain the higher tolerance of n nitrosa 18 3d to nh2oh fig s4 as it might constitutively express these nh2oh transforming detoxifying enzymes although neither hao nor cytl was upregulated or constitutively highly expressed upon nh2oh stimulation the upregulation and relative high expression of norb in n europaea may explain its low sensitivity high tolerance to nh2oh fig s4 as nh2oh can quickly be enzymatically converted by the no reductase indirectly through no moreover the upregulation of the norb gene associated well with the above observed high n2o yield from nh2oh by n europaea taken together the no reductase is the key enzyme differentiating the aerobic hydroxylamine oxidation to n2o among aob and comammox nitrospira bacteria further the highly constitutively expressed nh2oh no transforming enzymes hao and cytl in n nitrosa 18 3d may alleviate the accumulation of nh2oh which otherwise would only be abiotically converted to n2o thus producing less n2o than n inopinata 3 5 potential mechanisms controlling n2o and noy production from aob aoa and comammox few studies have compared hono emissions from comammox bacteria with different aob and aoa with insights into the mechanisms controlling noy and n2o production yields remaining under discussion we here systematically tested these and comprehensively summarized potential mechanisms responsible for n2o hono no and no2 production fig 6 biotic conversion of nh2oh to no by hao caranto and lancaster 2017 and hono and no2 by unknown enzyme are high yield processes in aob while hono production through chemical equilibrium between no2 and h remains at low yield recent studies also showed that contributions from aob or nitrate reducers might be more important than chemical production of hono oswald et al 2013 wu et al 2019 ermel et al 2018 suggested the surface reaction of nh2oh with h2o as a hono source from n europaea which might explain the high hono production by aob fig 6 but for aoa and comammox the yield of noy production is very low or even zero which might be related to nitrification or nitrogen turnover rates mushinski et al 2019 scharko et al 2015 high yields of n2o were found to be related with the no reductase in aob fig 5 while abiotic reactions of nh2oh or biotic production by cytochrome p460 cytl are low yield processes 4 conclusion nitrification is considered a significant source of atmospheric n2o hono no and no2 lipschultz et al 1981 oswald et al 2013 the estimated global nox no no2 emission from agriculture and soils under natural vegetation are 3 7 and 7 3 tg n yr 1 while global n2o emissions from agriculture oceans and soils under natural vegetation are 4 1 3 8 and 6 6 tg n yr 1 respectively ciais et al 2014 recent studies found that soil hono emissions are in the same order of magnitude of no emissions oswald et al 2013 wu et al 2019 which indicate that global soil hono emissions are 5 tg n yr 1 if we assume 50 of soil n2o and noy emissions are originating from nitrification the contributions of aob and aoa are significant as both of them could dominate soil nitrification rate di et al 2009 prosser and nicol 2008 comammox is recognized as having an oligotrophic lifestyle but recent study showed that it can also be active in nitrogen rich soils li et al 2019 shedding light on potential roles of comammox in global nitrogen cycling based on this study we speculate that n2o and noy produced by comammox should contribute 3 15 compared to those of aob and aoa suggesting comammox as an unneglectable but minor player in

17282,nitrous oxide n2o and noy nitrous acid hono nitric oxide no nitrogen dioxide no2 are released as byproducts or obligate intermediates during aerobic ammonia oxidation and further influence global warming and atmospheric chemistry the ammonia oxidation process is catalyzed by groups of globally distributed ammonia oxidizing microorganisms which are playing a major role in atmospheric n2o

o2 concentration as well as other environmental factors ciais et al 2014 pilegaard 2013 prosser et al 2020 the contribution of chemolithoautotrophic aerobic nitrification is significant in soils wastewater treatment oceans and rivers duan et al 2017 farías et al 2009 garnier et al 2006 liu et al 2016 tortoso and hutchinson 1990 zehr and ward 2002 thus understanding the microbial players and activities involved in n2o and noy production the mechanisms and regulations of n2o and noy formation as well as environmental factors controlling their flux is necessary to counteract related environmental issues the two step nitrification process was classically thought to be mediated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa that oxidize ammonia nh3 to nitrite no2 via hydroxylamine nh2oh and subsequently nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob catalyzing nitrite oxidation to nitrate no3 kuypers et al 2018 regarding n2o emissions both aoa and aob contribute to hybrid n2o formation through the abiotic reaction of the intermediate nh2oh with no2 poth and focht 1985 stieglmeier et al 2014 this process dominates at atmospheric oxygen levels while nitrifier denitrification enzymatic no2 reduction to n2o via no was only attributed to aob kozlowski et al 2016b stieglmeier et al 2014 and occurs mostly at low o2 availability poth and focht 1985 schmidt et al 2004 wrage monnig et al 2018 only very recently the biotic conversion of nh2oh to n2o under anoxic conditions through the cytochrome p460 protein also called cytl was characterized caranto et al 2016 moreover hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao activity results in the production of no rather than the previously considered no2 under oxic and anoxic conditions caranto and lancaster 2017 caranto et al 2016 regarding the yield of n2o production previous work on activities of marine and terrestrial cultures and microcosms suggested that aoa produce relatively less n2o compared to aob n2o consumed nh4 ratio during aerobic ammonia oxidation hink et al 2018 hink et al 2017 jung et al 2014 stieglmeier et al 2014 recently the previously postulated two microorganism nitrification process was proven to be possible within one single organism the complete ammonia oxidizing comammox organisms are individually able to oxidize ammonia to nitrate via nitrite daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 so far all identified comammox bacteria are phylogenetically affiliated to phylogenetic lineage ii nitrospira which also contains globally distributed canonical nob daims et al 2016 comammox genomes harbor the entire genetic repertory needed for ammonia and nitrite oxidation ammonia monooxygenase amo hao the hydroxylamine ubiquinone reduction module hurm and nitrite oxidoreductase nxr camejo et al 2017 daims et al 2015 palomo et al 2018 van kessel et al 2015 comammox nitrospira are widely distributed and have been detected in various environments including agricultural soils freshwater habitats drinking water treatment systems aquaculture biofilters hot groundwater tidal sediments wastewater treatment plants and atmospheric fine particulate matter pm2 5 bartelme et al 2017 daims et al 2015 gao et al 2016 palomo et al 2018 pjevac et al 2017 van kessel et al 2015 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 yu et al 2018 furthermore the comammox organism nitrospira inopinata produces no as an intermediate of ammonia oxidation and this produced no cannot be further denitrified to n2o kits et al 2017 as a consequence of this the yield of n2o is relatively low compared to aob as n2o originates rather from the abiotic conversion of nh2oh a further intermediate of ammonia oxidation by comammox bacteria kits et al 2019 liu et al 2017 soil hono emission was firstly reported in 1985 kubota and asami 1985 and in recent years concerns have been raised due to its effects on air quality su et al 2011 a dry peak and a wet peak of hono and no production were found at low 0 40 water holding capacity whc and high 70 140 whc soil water content respectively oswald et al 2013 wu et al 2019 the underlying drivers of this dry peak have been suggested as the chemical equilibrium between soil nitrite and protons su et al 2011 the surface acidity promoted gas emissions donaldson et al 2014 kim and or 2019 and the direct release through aob oswald et al 2013 the wet peak was found to be associated with increased nitrate reduction by nitrate reducers wu et al 2019 a recent study showed that surface abiotic reactions of nh2oh with h2o significantly contributed to the hono release from drying soil with a maximum conversion yield of nh2oh to hono of 9 ermel et al 2018 considering low concentrations of nh2oh in soils and other environments the large amount of hono emission during ammonia oxidation remains hard to explain soil hono emissions are directly related to net nitrification rates as the emission can be experimentally reduced through the addition of nitrification inhibitors mushinski et al 2019 scharko et al 2015 as the nitrogen turnover rates of aob are significantly higher than those of aoa and comammox daims et al 2015 it can be expected that hono emissions from aob are equally higher ermel et al 2018 yet there is no study reporting whether hono can be emitted from comammox bacteria and if so to what extent a comprehensive overview of the so far known n2o and noy production pathways upon nitrification is illustrated in fig 1 to extend our mechanistic knowledge of the nitrogen cycle we here aim at gaining insights in the so far understudied n2o and noy production patterns by comammox bacterium n inopinata during aerobic ammonia oxidation in comparison to its canonical ammonia converting counterparts representatives of aoa and aob in this study we use highly enriched and pure ammonia oxidizing cultures of aoa aob and comammox bacteria to 1 quantify the production and compare the yields of n2o and noy from these cultures 2 determine the biotic abiotic pathways contributing to potential n2o production from these organisms by using a combination of batch cultivation nh2oh inhibition dynamic chamber flux measurements n2o isotope analysis and comparative genomics we demonstrate that n2o and noy production is restrained in comammox n inopinata with activity of no reductase nor being critical in differentiating high and low n2o production among aob and comammox strains during aerobic ammonia oxidation 2 materials and methods 2 1 studied ammonia oxidizing microbes strains included in this study include the complete ammonia

curve between the non inhibited control and the cultures exposed to the various concentrations of nh2oh half maximal effective concentrations ec50 of nh2oh on the ammonia oxidizing cultures were calculated using the software origin 8 2 6 transcriptional analyses upon nh2oh stimulation active cells of n nitrosa 18 3d n europaea or n inopinata were harvested from the suspension without caco3 by

concentrations were determined by a gas chromatograph fitted with electron capture detector shimadu gc 2014b japan headspace gas was collected from the schott bottles with gas tight syringes after cultivation the detection range of n2o concentration is between 0 and 10 ppm and dilutions were made according to the tested concentrations sodium hydroxide was added into the bottle when co2 concentrations were high the δ15nbulk δ18o and sp values from gas samples were analyzed by a delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms thermo fisher scientific china which is equipped with five cups to analyze both m z 44 14n14n16o 45 14n15n16o 15n14n16o 14n14n17o and 46 14n14n18o of n2o molecules and m z 30 14n16o and 31 15n16o of no fragments the scrambling factor in the ion source of this irms 0 085 was determined by a series of ᵝn labelled n2o as röckmann et al rockmann et al 2003 reported the calibration of laboratory n2o working standards was performed by two standards kindly offered by dr reinhard well well et al 2008 typical analytical precision for δ15nbulk δ18o and sp in this irms were 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 respectively the δ15nα δ15nbulk and sp were calculated according to equation 1 and 2 toyoda and yoshida 1999 the difference between the isotopomer ratios of n δ15nα δ15nβ is referred to as 15n site preference sp in 1 δ 15 n bulk δ 15 n α δ 15 n β 2 2 sp δ 15 n α δ 15 n β 2 8 flux measurement of noy emissions of reactive nitrogen gases hono no and no2 from the cultures were measured by a dynamic chamber system which has been described in detail elsewhere wu et al 2019 wu et al 2020 for all cultures 500 ml of active cells were harvested washed and resuspended with 250 ml aom and then split into three parts one for the hono measurement one after heat treatment for the sterile control and one in parallel maintained in the incubator for positive activity control briefly 80 ml of the cell culture were transferred into a glass beaker inner diameter 50 cm which contained 40 g of sterilized glass beads 0 35 0 50 mm asone japan then 80 or 40 µl of 1 m nh4cl solution were added to the beaker thus the initial nh4 concentration was 1 or 0 5 mm for the aob aoa and comammox cultures table s5 the beaker containing the cell cultures and substrate were placed into a teflon chamber 10 l and measured in the dark at 46 c for aoa n gargensis 28 c for aob n europaea 37 c for aob n nitrosa 18 3d 42 c for ca n uzonensis 5a and n inopinata respectively the chamber was flushed with purified dry air without cxhy hono nox o3 etc at a constant flow rate of 6 l min 1 mixing ratios of hono in the headspace were continuously monitored by a stripping coil coupled with high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 based on the reaction of sulfanilamide and n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride huang et al 2002 the time resolution and lower detection limit were 6 min and 4 ppt respectively nox o3 co2 and h2o were measured by a chemiluminescence analyzer thermo model 42i tl usa an ozone analyzer thermo model 49i usa and a li cor li cor 840a usa respectively the flux of hono and nox were calculated according to equation 3 3 f q a 1 v m χ o u t where f is the flux of hono or nox ng m 2 s 1 in terms of nitrogen which is the same as follows q is the purging flow rate m3 s 1 a is the area of culture solution m2 vm is the molar volume of air m3 mol 1 and χout is the headspace mixing ratio at the outlet of the chamber ppb the sterilized background was measured with 80 ml of sterilized cell culture which was mixed with 80 or 40 µl of a 1 m nano2 stock solution thus the initial no2 concentration was 1 or 0 5 mm for the aoa and aob sterilized background and 0 0025 mm for comammox bacteria the latter concentration of 0 0025 mm was determined at the time point of hono flux peak in the corresponding living culture experiment and represents the maximum no2 concentration produced by the comammox bacteria table s5 the ph of the sterilized background was regulated to the same as the corresponding cell cultures to avoid any ph effects on hono emissions then hono and nox emission from the sterilized background was quantified by the dynamic chamber system as described in detail above total emissions of hono no and no2 mg m 2 during a full wetting drying experiment from the cultures were calculated according to equation 4 4 e n t 0 t m a x f t d t where e n is the total emissions of hono no or no2 mg m 2 f t is the noy gases flux at the measurement time t in order to minimize the effects of nitrification rate on noy emissions we also calculated ratio of the maximum noy flux with nitrification rate and compared the results among different cultures 3 results and discussion 3 1 n2o production during aerobic ammonia oxidation to compare the production yields of n2o during aerobic nh4 oxidation we normalized the initial cell numbers of the five cultures to obtain comparable nh4 turnover rates table s2 for all incubations here experiments were performed under aerobic conditions and hypoxia which could stimulate hypoxic nitrite reduction wrage monnig et al 2018 was never reached during incubation since the tested aoa strains are relatively sensitive to elevated levels of nh4 initial nh4 concentrations of 0 5 1 2 mm and 0 5 2 5 mm were applied to the ca n uzonensis 5a strain kits et al 2017 and n gargensis palatinszky et al 2015 respectively the two aob strains n nitrosa 18 3d and n europaea as well as the comammox bacterium n inopinata were fed with 2 5 and 10 mm nh4 n2o production was synchronized with ammonia oxidation fig 2 confirming that n2o was formed as a byproduct of aerobic archaeal or bacterial ammonia oxidation based on the final n2o concentration the yield per added converted ammonia n2o nh3 was calculated while oxidizing the same amount of nh3 aob n europaea generated the most n2o followed by comammox n inopinata aoa n gargensis aoa ca n uzonensis 5a and the aob n nitrosa 18 3d fig 2 with increasing amount of substrate the n2o yield increased for the two aoa strains while it decreased for the aob and comammox strains table s2 these results are generally consistent with previous findings where yields of n2o during aerobic ammonia oxidation for aob were reaching levels of up to 0 51 and those for aoa range from 0 068 to 0 158 hink et al 2017 stieglmeier et al 2014 aob generate more n2o than aoa in various ecosystems hink et al 2018 hink et al 2017 meinhardt et al 2018 comammox n inopinata in this study exhibited different n2o nh3 yields 0 2 compared to previous work 0 07 kits et al 2019 this can be a result of different initial substrate concentrations 2 mm nh4cl this study and 0 25 mm nh4cl in previous work and different time spans of the performed experiments 100 hours in this study and 2 hours in previous work in addition the initial density and acitivy of the n inopinata cultures could also matter when supplying 5 or 10 mm nh4cl to n inopinata the n2o nh3 yields 0 1 were indeed similar to what was reported previously 0 07 kits et al 2019 collectively this study confirmed the range of n2o nh3 yields by n inopinata under various substrate and cell density conditions the here observed lowest yield for aob n nitrosa 18 3d is the sole exception to this pattern it is speculated that the lack of nor that enzymatically produces n2o table s1 might explain why n nitrosa 18 3d produces the lowest yield of n2o in this study comammox n inopinata equally lacking the nor enzyme kits et al 2019 also produced much less n2o low yield than aob which are harboring nor genes however the observed significant difference in n2o yields between the nor lacking bacteria n nitrosa 18 3d and comammox n inopinata deserves further investigation both abiotic and enzymatic processes underlying the generation of n2o in these two ammonia oxidizing strains need to be taken into account 3 2 high noy emissions from aob but not comammox and aoa when testing the different strains emissions of noy during nh4 oxidation large amounts of hono no and no2 were emitted from aob cultures n nitrosa 18 3d and n europaea fig 3 and fig s2 compared with the sterilized background 31 23 and 36 ng m 2 s 1 respectively the maximum flux f max of hono no and no2 measured in the presence of aob n nitrosa 18 3d increased by 200 85 and 350 fold respectively fig 3a the maximum hono no and no2 flux from aob n europaea equally increased to 1 5 4 fold higher than in the sterilized background however if nitrification rate was taken into account the f max nitrification rate of hono and no2 for aob n nitrosa 18 3d was lower than that of aob n europaea fig 3c the maximum hono emissions from aoa n gargensis 1680 ng m 2 s 1 and comammox n inopinata 57 ng m 2 s 1 was also higher than the sterilized background 1115 and 31 ng m 2 s 1 no emissions from aoa ca n uzonensis 5a were observed aob emitting much more hono than aoa in here is consistent with previous studies ermel et al 2018 mushinski et al 2019 although aoa have the theoretical potential to be dominant hono producers under certain conditions such as low soil ph scharko et al 2015 we here show that the comammox culture can also emit hono but with an absolute flux much smaller than that observed for either aob and aoa 100 250 and 20 fold lower the most likely explanation is the lower nitrification rate of comammox which was reported to be correlated with noy flux mushinski et al 2019 scharko et al 2015 overall aob n europaea was the most efficient organism in converting ammonia to noy gases while comammox n inopinata was the least fig 3c similar to the maximum flux total noy emission e n from aob n nitrosa 18 3d aob n europaea and comammox n inopinata was significantly higher than in the sterilized background but its contribution to total noy emission was relatively small compared to aob and aoa contrary for aoa n gargensis and aoa ca n uzonensis 5a no such effect could be observed fig 3b among the three parts of noy no2 n accounted for more than 50 of the produced noy by the tested organisms aob n nitrosa 18 3d aob n europaea aoa n gargensis and aoa ca n uzonensis 5a and their corresponding sterilized backgrounds for comammox n inopinata the contributions of hono n no n and no2 n were similar while no n dominated in the sterilized background we also normalized the ratio of e n to nitrification rate which was the highest for aob n europaea and the lowest for comammox n inopinata fig 3d taken together with the flux data comammox might cause the release of certain amounts of noy gases but their contribution to total noy emission are relatively small compared to aob in environmental context the abundance of comammox nitrospira in forest and paddy soils can be comparable to aoa and aob wang et al 2019 the activity of comammox nitrospira was comparably higher under low nitrogen concentration than high nitrogen concentration shi et al 2018 wang et al 2019 3 3 pathways controlling n2o production to obtain information on the pathways leading to n2o production in all tested organisms n2o was harvested from the headspace of batch yield experiments performed under various substrate levels we then determined the site preference sp δ15n sp defined as δ15nα δ15nβ within the linear n2o molecule nβ nα o since the sp values of generated n2o indicate its initial source either from hydroxylamine oxidation high sp or nitrifier denitrification low sp with the exception of n europaea all cultures exhibited sp values around or above 20 indicating that the major source of n2o was hydroxylamine oxidation conversion table s2 consistent with previous reports jung et al 2014 kits et al 2019 santoro et al 2011 sutka et al 2004 according to a previous study where the sp value of n europaea was 2 3 1 9 for hydroxylamine oxidation sutka et al 2003 the sp values of around 0 for n europaea here may indicate that the formed n2o could also originate from hydroxylamine oxidation by nor converting nh2oh to n2o with an upregulation of nor fig 4 and fig 5 rather than aerobic nitrifier denitrification through nor kozlowski et al 2014 interestingly the aoa n gargensis exhibited decreasing sp values with increasing substrate concentrations suggesting the nitrifier denitrification mechanism to play a potentially increased role under high ammonia pressure this links to a recent study revealing enzymatic denitrification to n2o via a putative cytochrome p450 no reductase at low ph in an aoa strain jung et al 2019 the p450 gene is also present in n gargensis but not in ca n uzonensis 5a and might hence explain the changing n2o production pathways under elevated ammonium pressure for only this specific aoa we further tested a second n2o formation pathway by aob n nitrosa 18 3d aob n europaea and comammox n inopinata from nh2oh 0 1 mm oxidation aoa strains were not included in this part of the study due to their much higher sensitivity to nh2oh as compared to aob and comammox nitrospira fig s4 since nh2oh is not stable and can react with various chemicals oxidants to form n2o and or no2 we in parallel included heat inactived biomass and medium only abiotic controls for comparison within 24 hours the concentrations of generated n2o no2 and no3 remained stable fig s3 indicating completion of biological or chemical reactions with nh2oh the yields of n2o no2 or no3 to added converted nh2oh fig s4 table s4 were compared within different treatments and among the three cultures all heat inactived biomass except n europaea and aom medium only exhibited small statistically similar n2o n2o nh2oh yields one way anova test p 0 05 n europaea generated much more n2o 7 63 0 25 n2o nh2oh than its heat inactived and abiotic controls and the other tested strains revealing that n europaea can enzymatically convert nh2oh to n2o under oxic conditions we observed n2o yields n2o nh2oh of 2 17 0 22 and 0 63 0 05 for n nitrosa 18 3d and n inopinata respectively indicating that n nitrosa 18 3d may biologically convert nh2oh to n2o via the enzyme cytl p460 under aerobic condition or through a yet unknown mechanism while for n inopinata the transformation of nh2oh to n2o was insignificantly different to the heat inactived and abiotic controls and thus majorly based on abiotic chemical reactions 3 4 roles of nitric oxide reductases nor and nh2oh no transforming enzymes in n2o formation it is interesting to see that 1 the previous reported low n2o yield producing comammox bacteria kits et al 2019 in this study generated more n2o than the aob n nitrosa 18 3d and 2 the two aob cultures performed significantly different regarding yield and sp character of formed n2o by screening the genome of aob n nitrosa 18 3d no typical genes encoding for the nitrifier denitrification pathway including the nor encoding gene were found table s1 while that specific genetic repertoire is present in the model aob strain n europaea in addition it was earlier reported that nor is heavily involved in the n2o producing pathways in n europaea kozlowski et al 2014 and that aob lacking nor performed differently than nor positive strains regarding the release of no and n2o kozlowski et al 2016a furthermore the above described n2o sp values support the hydroxylamine oxidation pathway resulting in n2o formation for most of the studied cultures hydroxylamine can be partially enzymatically transformed to n2o and the remaining hydroxylamine can then abiotically react to form additional n2o it has been previously reported that n2o formed by n inopinata originated exclusively from abiotic hydroxylamine conversion kits et al 2019 that would mean negligible enzymatic activities on hydroxylamine conversions to n2o by n inopinata as nh2oh is an intermediate metabolite yet at high levels a toxin to living cells we tested the effects of a wide range of nh2oh levels on archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidation by calculating the half maximal effective concentrations ec50 of nh2oh on the ammonia oxidizing culture we found aoa are most sensitive to nh2oh ec50 11 2 and 5 1 μm for ca n uzonensis 5a and n gargensis respectively followed by comammox n inopinata ec50 126 4 μm the two aob strains are much more tolerant to nh2oh with ec50 819 0 and 879 5 μm for n nitrosa 18 3d and n europaea respectively although nh2oh has been proven as an intermediate for archaeal ammonia oxidation the subsequent nh2oh oxidizing enzymes have not been identified thus making it impossible to fully explain the extraordinarily high sensitivity of aoa to nh2oh yet despite comammox n inopinata harboring similar nh2oh dehydrogenase encoding genes hao as aob it lacks the cytochrome p460 encoding gene cytl kits et al 2019 that was hypothesized to function by detoxifying nh2oh to n2o under anoxic conditions caranto et al 2016 nevertheless cytochrome c beta cyts postulated to having a similar function as cytl is present in the genome of n inopinata daims et al 2015 besides hao cytl and cyts the no reductase nor is also involved in hydroxylamine oxidation by reducing no to n2o here we screened the genomes of n nitrosa 18 3d this study n europaea chain et al 2003 and n inopinata daims et al 2015 for genes encoding hao cytl cyts and nor and designed specific primers targeting these genes table s3 allowing us to record the transcriptional responses to nh2oh upon stimulation with 0 1 mm nh2oh fig 5 among all genes and strains exclusively the norb gene of n europaea was significantly upregulated by 1 order of magnitude upon nh2oh stimulation worth noticing is that despite not being upregulated the expression of hao 2 and cytl 2 in n nitrosa 18 3d is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of hao and cyts in n inopinata this can explain the higher tolerance of n nitrosa 18 3d to nh2oh fig s4 as it might constitutively express these nh2oh transforming detoxifying enzymes although neither hao nor cytl was upregulated or constitutively highly expressed upon nh2oh stimulation the upregulation and relative high expression of norb in n europaea may explain its low sensitivity high tolerance to nh2oh fig s4 as nh2oh can quickly be enzymatically converted by the no reductase indirectly through no moreover the upregulation of the norb gene associated well with the above observed high n2o yield from nh2oh by n europaea taken together the no reductase is the key enzyme differentiating the aerobic hydroxylamine oxidation to n2o among aob and comammox nitrospira bacteria further the highly constitutively expressed nh2oh no transforming enzymes hao and cytl in n nitrosa 18 3d may alleviate the accumulation of nh2oh which otherwise would only be abiotically converted to n2o thus producing less n2o than n inopinata 3 5 potential mechanisms controlling n2o and noy production from aob aoa and comammox few studies have compared hono emissions from comammox bacteria with different aob and aoa with insights into the mechanisms controlling noy and n2o production yields remaining under discussion we here systematically tested these and comprehensively summarized potential mechanisms responsible for n2o hono no and no2 production fig 6 biotic conversion of nh2oh to no by hao caranto and lancaster 2017 and hono and no2 by unknown enzyme are high yield processes in aob while hono production through chemical equilibrium between no2 and h remains at low yield recent studies also showed that contributions from aob or nitrate reducers might be more important than chemical production of hono oswald et al 2013 wu et al 2019 ermel et al 2018 suggested the surface reaction of nh2oh with h2o as a hono source from n europaea which might explain the high hono production by aob fig 6 but for aoa and comammox the yield of noy production is very low or even zero which might be related to nitrification or nitrogen turnover rates mushinski et al 2019 scharko et al 2015 high yields of n2o were found to be related with the no reductase in aob fig 5 while abiotic reactions of nh2oh or biotic production by cytochrome p460 cytl are low yield processes 4 conclusion nitrification is considered a significant source of atmospheric n2o hono no and no2 lipschultz et al 1981 oswald et al 2013 the estimated global nox no no2 emission from agriculture and soils under natural vegetation are 3 7 and 7 3 tg n yr 1 while global n2o emissions from agriculture oceans and soils under natural vegetation are 4 1 3 8 and 6 6 tg n yr 1 respectively ciais et al 2014 recent studies found that soil hono emissions are in the same order of magnitude of no emissions oswald et al 2013 wu et al 2019 which indicate that global soil hono emissions are 5 tg n yr 1 if we assume 50 of soil n2o and noy emissions are originating from nitrification the contributions of aob and aoa are significant as both of them could dominate soil nitrification rate di et al 2009 prosser and nicol 2008 comammox is recognized as having an oligotrophic lifestyle but recent study showed that it can also be active in nitrogen rich soils li et al 2019 shedding light on potential roles of comammox in global nitrogen cycling based on this study we speculate that n2o and noy produced by comammox should contribute 3 15 compared to those of aob and aoa suggesting comammox as an unneglectable but minor player in

17283,dissolved organic matter dom plays a crucial role in the photochemical transformation of organic contaminants in natural aquatic systems the present study focuses on the characterization of a specific effect previously observed for electron rich phenols consisting in an acceleration of the dom photosensitized transformation of target compounds at low concentrations 1 µm this effect was hypothesized to be caused by dom derived long lived photooxidants llpo pseudo first order rate constants for the transformation of several phenols anilines sulfonamide antibiotics and phenylureas photosensitized by suwannee river fulvic acid were determined under steady state irradiation using the uva and visible wavelengths from a medium pressure mercury lamp a significant enhancement by a factor of 2 4 16 of the first order transformation rate constant of various electron rich target compounds was observed for an initial concentration of 0 1 μm compared to 5 μm this effect points to a relevant reactivity of these compounds with llpo for phenols and anilines the enhancement effect occurred only above certain standard one electron oxidation potentials from these data series the standard one electron reduction potential of llpo was estimated to be in the range of 1 0 1 3 v versus the standard hydrogen electrode llpo are proposed to mainly consist of phenoxyl radicals formed by photooxidation of electron poor phenolic moieties of the dom the plausibility of this hypothesis was successfully tested by studying the photosensitized transformation kinetics of 3 4

canonica 2016 vione et al 2014 zafiriou et al 1984 ppri are produced through absorption of sunlight especially its ultraviolet uv portion by chromophoric constituents of the dom the so called cdom rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 sharpless and blough 2014 and contribute to the transformation of many aquatic contaminants in sunlit surface waters richard and canonica 2005 ppri derived from cdom irradiation comprise well defined chemical entities such as the hydroxyl radical carbonate radical or singlet oxygen as well as excited states or radical species that are often elusive to precise chemical identification because they are derived from and still attached to the dom richard and canonica 2005 sharpless and blough 2014 vione et al 2014 excited triplet states of the cdom 3cdom have been recognized as pivotal photooxidants affecting the fate of organic contaminants in surface waters canonica 2007 canonica et al 1995 mcneill and canonica 2016 besides 3cdom the existence of dom derived photooxidants having longer lifetimes than 3cdom and therefore termed long lived photooxidants llpo was postulated canonica and freiburghaus 2001 canonica and hoigné 1995 this assumption was used to explain the observed increase in pseudo first order cdom photosensitized transformation rate constants of electron rich phenols i e phenols bearing electron donating substituents with decreasing initial phenol concentrations in the range of 10 6 10 7 m canonica and freiburghaus 2001 canonica and hoigné 1995 kawaguchi 1993 this observation is highly relevant since concentrations of many organic contaminants in natural surface waters are even lower than this concentration range moschet et al 2014 ruff et al 2015 so far 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp canonica and freiburghaus 2001 kawaguchi 1993 4 methoxyphenol canonica and hoigné 1995 3 4 dimethoxylphenol dmop canonica and freiburghaus 2001 canonica and hoigné 1995 and n n dimethylaniline canonica and freiburghaus 2001 were reported to undergo this effect while for 4 methylphenol the effect was absent at the lowest investigated initial concentration of 10 7 m canonica and freiburghaus 2001 a conceptual model and corresponding kinetic equations were developed to explain the observed increase in pseudo first order transformation rate constants with decreasing initial concentration of the target compound canonica and hoigné 1995 canonica and freiburghaus 2001 an updated version of this model is visualized in fig 1 two pools of cdom derived photooxidants in aerated aqueous solution are assumed for the first pool the presence of a target compound at concentrations 5 10 6 m does not significantly affect the steady state concentration of the photooxidants with the current knowledge on cdom photochemistry and using target compounds that are not significantly transformed by singlet oxygen these photooxidants are assumed to mainly represent 3cdom for the second pool the presence of a target compound at concentrations in the range of 1 10 7 5 10 6 m significantly affects the steady state concentration of the photooxidants the increasing steady state concentration of this pool of photooxidants with decreasing target compound concentration results in an increasing pseudo first order rate constant for the transformation of the target compound assuming a maximum second order rate constant of 3 109 m 1 s 1 for the reaction of these photooxidants with a target compound and a reduction in steady state concentration of the photooxidants by at least 50 upon addition of a target compound at 5 10 6 m concentration the photooxidants of this second pool can be estimated to have on average lifetimes longer than 67 μs see the supplementary information si text s1 for a detailed calculation an estimation made in the original study lead to lifetimes in the order of 100 μs canonica and hoigné 1995 this lifetime is much longer than estimates for 3cdom in aerated water 1 6 6 3 μs see si text s2 which justifies the use of the term long lived photooxidants llpo in the present paper the knowledge on the deactivation pathways and rate constants of 3cdom has been substantially improving during the last decade golanoski et al 2012 schmitt et al 2017 sharpless 2012 yielding the aforementioned average lifetimes of 3cdom in aerated water at 25 c that match well with the early lifetime estimate of 2 μs zepp et al 1985 the main groups of reactions of 3cdom with organic contaminants namely one electron oxidation and triplet triplet energy transfer and the energetics of such reactions are also fairly well understood mcneill and canonica 2016 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 in contrast during the last twenty years no substantial advances in the characterization of the hypothesized llpo were made despite their potentially decisive contribution to the phototransformation of some aquatic organic contaminants in surface waters which may even override the contribution of 3cdom due to the often very low concentrations of these contaminants since llpo are formed in an oxic environment and are capable of oxidizing electron rich phenols they are expected to be oxidizing radicals that are part of the photochemically transformed dom these radicals possibly include peroxyl radicals mill et al 1980 or phenoxyl radicals which are plausible due to abundance of phenolic moieties in the dom ritchie and perdue 2003 and could result from a one electron oxidation of these moieties by 3cdom llpo have been suggested to have a higher selectivity than 3cdom in their reaction with phenols canonica and hoigné 1995 and therefore assuming one electron oxidation of the phenols or any other compound in both cases llpo should have lower standard one electron reduction potentials e red 1 0 than 3cdom note that in the following all potentials are given vs standard hydrogen electrode she the reduction potentials of the latter were estimated to lie in the range of 1 36 1 90 v vs she canonica et al 2000 and more recently 1 6 1 8 v vs she parker and mitch 2016 the reduction potentials of various substituted phenoxyl radicals have been measured and cover a wide range jonsson et al 1993 lind et al 1990 which extends from values near zero for very electron rich species to 1 22 v for the 4 nitrophenoxyl radical lind et al 1990 with the unsubstituted phenoxyl radical having 0 79 v lind et al 1990 moreover estimations of e red 1 0 are available for alkyl peroxyl radicals roo 0 71 0 83 v and alkyl percarboxyl radicals rc o oo 1 05 1 19 v merényi et al 1994 considering the estimated standard one electron oxidation potentials e ox 1 0 of electron rich phenols in their undissociated form 1 17 v for dmop and 1 22 v for tmp canonica et al 2000 both electron poor phenoxyl radicals and rc o oo would be efficient oxidants of these phenols and therefore plausible candidates for llpo the primary goal of this study was to evaluate the propensity of several organic compounds belonging to various chemical classes to undergo photosensitized transformation induced by llpo to this end the pseudo first rate constants for the dom photosensitized transformation of each target compound at initial concentrations of 1 0 10 7 m and 5 0 10 6 m were measured the lower initial concentration was designated to allow precise quantification of the rate constants without the need of sample pre concentration and to be consistent with a previous study canonica and freiburghaus 2001 the resulting rate constant difference was interpreted in terms of llpo reactivity for substituted phenols and anilines as target compounds their reactivity with llpo was related to the standard one electron oxidation potentials of the compounds for estimating the reduction potential of llpo using dmop as an llpo probe compound the dependence of llpo reactivity on dom type and concentration was investigated finally a chemical model system consisting of a photosensitizer and an electron poor phenol i e a phenol bearing electron withdrawing substituents was employed to mimic the effect of dom derived llpo on the pseudo first order transformation rate

phosphate buffer stock solutions 50 mm ph 7 76 were prepared in ultrapure water by dissolving appropriate amounts of na2hpo4 2h2o and nah2po4 h2o dom isolates stock solutions 50 or 100 mgc l 1 were made in ultrapure water by dissolving an estimated target amount of the hygroscopic isolates all solutions were stored in the dark at 4 c 2 2 irradiation experiments solutions to be irradiated were prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of the aforementioned stock solutions and 16 ml thereof were transferred to quartz tubes 18 mm external diameter 15 mm internal diameter 250 mm height sealed with glass stoppers the final concentration of phosphate buffer was 5 mm resulting in a ph of 8 0 0 1 the quartz tubes were shaken by hand and placed in a water bath at 25 0 c for 15 minutes thereafter irradiations were performed using a temperature controlled dema hans mangels gmbh bornhein roisdorf germany model 125 merry go round photoreactor equipped with a heraeus noblelight model tq718 medium pressure mercury lamp the latter was positioned in a borosilicate cooling jacket and operated with an input power of 500 w the geometry of the photoreactor was described in detail elsewhere wegelin et al 1994 light from the mercury lamp was filtered by the double wall of the cooling jacket and additionally by a 0 15 m sodium nitrate filter solution which was recirculated in the photoreactor to maintain a constant temperature of 25 0 0 2 c this resulted in a cut off filter transmitting light with wavelength λ 320 nm total irradiation times varied in the range of 3 minutes to 8 hours depending on the rates of transformation of the various target compounds and 360 μl samples were withdrawn from the quartz tubes at six equidistant time intervals the photon fluence rate in the quartz tubes was checked weekly by chemical actinometry using an aqueous solution of 4 nitroanisole 5 0 10 6 m and pyridine 1 0 10 2 m laszakovits et al 2017 leresche et al 2016 it was determined for the relevant wavelength band of 334 436 nm using the methods detailed by leresche et al 2016 and found to vary in the range of 4 1 5 6 10 3 einstein m 2 s 1 over the duration of the whole study 2 3 analytical methods concentrations of the target compounds were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using an agilent 1100 hplc system equipped with a quaternary low pressure mixing gradient pump a photodiode array detector and a fluorescence detector agilent 1200 series or an analogous dionex 3000 ultimate system the photodiode array detector was mainly used to analyze samples taken from solutions with 5 0 μm initial target compound concentration for solutions with 0 1 μm initial target compound concentration the fluorescence detector was often preferred to the photodiode array detector because of the higher sensitivity that could be achieved for the analysis of some target compounds typically duplicate injections of 100 μl samples were performed a reverse phase c18 column cosmosil 5c18 ms ii was used details on hplc analytical conditions are described in the si table s1 the ph of the samples was measured before and after each irradiation experiment using a ph meter either a metrohm model 605 equipped with a metrohm ph electrode model 6 02341 110 or a thermo scientific model orion star a111 equipped with a thermo scientific ph electrode model orion 8115bnuwp ross ultra typically a small ph decrease 0 1 ph units was observed during the irradiation experiment concentrations of dom stock solutions were measured after appropriate dilution using a shimadzu toc l csh total organic carbon toc analyzer limit of quantification 0 5 mgc l 1 accuracy 0 2 mgc l 1 measuring range 0 5 30 mgc l 1 an agilent cary 100 uv vis spectrophotometer was used to measure absorption spectra of the dom isolates and to calculate light screening factors 2 4 determination of rate constants pseudo first order rate constants k obs for the transformation of a given target compound were determined using the following relationship 1 ln tc t tc 0 k obs t where tc t and tc 0 are the target compound concentrations at irradiation time t and before irradiation respectively for dom containing samples light screening corrections were performed according to the si text s3 to determine the net contribution of dom photosensitization to the transformation of tcs the observed rate constants measured for dom containing solutions were further corrected when applicable by subtracting the pseudo first order rate constant obtained for the corresponding blank experiments i e for dom free solutions this correction compensates for the possible contributions of direct phototransformation or other effects of the water matrix all corrected rate constants are termed k obs c details of the calculation are given in the si text s4 2 5 determination of the enhancement factor for the representation of the enhancement in k obs c observed for the transformation of target compounds at the low initial concentration of 1 0 10 7 m 0 1 μm compared to the high initial concentration of 5 0 10 6 m 5 0 μm an enhancement factor ef was defined as 2 ef k 0 1 obs c k 5 0 obs c where the subscripts of the rate constants indicate the initial tc concentration in μm 2 6 kinetic models and simulations the software kintecus ianni 2017 was employed to simulate the photosensitized transformation kinetics of 3 4 dimethoxyphenol in solutions containing 2 acetonaphthone as a model photosensitizer and 4 cyanophenol as a model electron poor phenol details of these simulations are given in the si text s6 and table s7 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of target compounds potentially subject to llpo induced transformation based on a literature review organic target compounds were selected for a screening study according to the following criteria 1 indirect phototransformation photosensitized by cdom is or is expected to be their dominant photochemical transformation pathway 2 excited triplet states of the cdom 3cdom acting as photooxidants play or are expected to play a major role in their indirect phototransformation under the employed irradiation conditions λ 320 nm 3 llpo are known to or might significantly contribute to their cdom photosensitized transformation a few target compounds not satisfying the third criterion were also investigated as negative controls the selected target compounds potentially fulfilling the above criteria see table 1 belong to four distinct chemical classes namely phenols anilines sulfonamides and phenylureas the experimental rate constant data for all investigated target compounds are summarized in table s4 si and represented in fig 2 utilizing the enhancement factor ef eq 2 for the sulfonamides and 4 acetylaniline the determination of ef was not possible because direct photolysis appeared to dominate their transformation see si text s4 and table s4 for six target compounds ef was 1 within the experimental accuracy meaning that there is no enhancement in the rate constant by reducing the initial target compound concentration this is interpreted as a negligible impact of llpo on the phototransformation of these target compounds for all other compounds including tmp dmop trolox aniline 4 methylaniline and dmp ef was 1 meaning that at the low initial target compound concentration a significantly higher rate constant was determined compared to the higher initial target compound concentration for these compounds the enhancement in the rate constants at the low initial concentration is attributed to the effect of llpo the compounds with ef 1 belonging to the phenols anilines and phenylureas are among the most electron rich representatives of each class as can be deduced from their oxidation potentials or hammett substituent constants see table 1 the three electron rich phenols tmp dmop and trolox exhibit by far the highest ef values which lie in the range of 6 16 for anilines and phenylureas ef values do not exceed 2 6 3 2 estimation of the reduction potential of llpo the above ef data for phenols and anilines for which standard one electron oxidation potentials e ox 1 0 are known see table 1 can be used to evaluate the oxidative character of llpo in particular the standard one electron reduction potential e red 1 0 fig 3 displays ef values for these two compound classes as from fig 2 as a function of the corresponding oxidation potentials for the phenols ef is close to unity up to a value of e ox 1 0 1 38 v and increases steadily with e ox 1 0 above this value the onset of ef 1 is located between 1 38 and 1 22 v for the anilines the change in ef as a function of e ox 1 0 follows a similar trend as for the phenols with ef 1 for e ox 1 0 1 32 v and an onset of ef 1 located between 1 32 and 1 02 v these onset ranges overlap from 1 32 to 1 22 v but the onset range for the anilines is shifted by 0 2 v towards higher oxidation potentials compared to the phenols assuming a pure one electron transfer reaction of llpo with anilines it can be concluded that the maximum e red 1 0 values for llpo lie in the range of 1 02 1 32 v the case of phenols is more complex to evaluate since phenols are known to undergo proton coupled electron transfer reactions sjödin et al 2006 warren et al 2010 weinberg et al 2012 which may lower the potential required for their oxidation compared to a pure electron transfer reaction therefore we consider that the range of maximum e red 1 0 values for llpo that can be deduced from the phenol series 1 22 1 38 v overestimates the actual maximum reduction potential of llpo at the experimental ph a small fraction of the phenols between 1 2 for phenol and 0 013 for trolox as can be calculated from their pk a values is present as phenoxide ion the latter which has a standard one electron reduction potential that is on average about 0 7 v higher compared to the corresponding undissociated phenol is expected to react with llpo at a very high rate the fact that neither 4 methylphenol nor phenol exhibit an llpo effect demonstrates that the reaction of phenoxide ions with llpo can be neglected in the frame of the present experiments 3 3 dependence of enhancement effect on type and concentration of dom using dmop as a target compound its photosensitized transformation kinetics at the two initial concentrations of 1 0 10 7 and 5 0 10 6 m was measured in the presence of various concentrations of the three selected dom isolates fig 4 displays the dom concentration dependence of the corrected pseudo first order rate constants k obs c and the enhancement factors ef derived from these rate constants for the three isolates a suwannee river fulvic acid b suwannee river humic acid and c pony lake fulvic acid at dmop 0 5 0 10 6 m and for all three dom isolates k obs c is always much lower than for dmop 0 1 0 10 7 m and increases proportionally with increasing dom concentrations this indicates that up to dom 10 mgc l 1 dom does not significantly quench the photooxidants responsible for the transformation of dmop this conclusion concurs with the assumption that the photooxidants are mainly 3cdom which in analogy to the excited triplet states of model aromatic ketones wenk et al 2013 are expected to be free from quenching by dom at these dom concentration levels moreover for dmop 0 5 0 10 6 m all three dom isolates exhibit similar rate constants at equal dom concentration for the lower initial dmop concentration plfa exhibit a linear increase in k obs c with increasing dom concentrations while for srfa and srha the initially linear increase in k obs c tends to level off at dom 5 mgc l 1 for increasing dom concentrations the enhancement factors tend to decrease for srfa and srha and to remain constant for plfa for plfa ef is essentially independent of the dom concentration with an average value of 2 1 which is significantly lower than the values determined for srfa and srha the lower ef is interpreted as lower impact of llpo in the transformation of dmop interestingly the suwannee river dom isolates also have a higher aromaticity phenolic content and electron donating capacity than plfa aeschbacher et al 2012 senesi et al 1989 the fact that the llpo effect is positively correlated with the concentration of phenolic moieties in the dom supports the hypothesis that llpo include phenoxyl radicals of the dom formed during photoinduced oxidation of the corresponding phenolic moieties of the dom the decrease in ef observed at the higher srfa and srha concentrations also revealed by the linear fit line slopes of 0 4 0 1 and 0 29 0 05 l mgc 1 respectively is attributed to partial llpo scavenging by dom itself such a scavenging coincides with the higher concentration of electron donating moieties for the two suwannee river dom isolates compared to plfa 3 4 chemical model systems to mimic dom derived llpo model aromatic ketones and quinones have been widely used in aquatic photochemistry to mimic the reactivity of 3cdom with an oxidative character canonica et al 2006 canonica et al 2000 canonica et al 1995 canonica and laubscher 2008 carena et al 2019 maurino et al 2008 minella et al 2018 werner et al 2005 moreover phenol and phenolic compounds bearing electron donating substituents have been utilized as model antioxidants in combination with dom or model photosensitizers to investigate the dual role of dom as a photosensitizer and inhibitor of 3cdom induced oxidations of aquatic organic contaminants bahnmüller et al 2014 leresche et al 2016 wenk and canonica 2012 here we use a model photosensitizer sens in combination with a model electron poor phenol r phohep to photogenerate both oxidizing excited triplet states 3sens and electron poor phenoxyl radicals r phoep which are formed upon one electron oxidation of the model phenol by 3sens in such model systems with well defined chemicals see fig 5 3sens and r phoep are used to mimic 3cdom and llpo respectively as in the case of irradiated cdom both short lived excited triplet states and longer lived radicals coexist under irradiation in these model systems irradiation experiments were performed using aqueous solutions buffered at ph 8 0 and containing 2 an 1 5 10 6 m as sens 4 cn phoh 5 0 10 6 m as an electron poor phenol r phohep and dmop as a target compound at different initial concentrations in the range of 1 0 10 7 m 5 0 10 6 m the photosensitized transformation kinetics of dmop was found to slow down with increasing initial concentration of dmop between 1 0 10 7 and 1 0 10 6 m while it remained constant above the latter concentration fig 6 a first order fitting of the kinetic data yielded pseudo first order rate constants that increased by a factor of 3 4 and 10 for initial dmop concentrations of 5 0 10 7 m 2 5 10 7 m and 1 0 10 7 m respectively see fig 6b compared to the average rate constant observed for the higher initial dmop concentrations 1 0 5 0 10 6 m the decrease in the first order rate constant with increasing initial concentrations of the target phenol is analogous to the one observed in the original study in which dom was used as a photosensitizer canonica and hoigné 1995 this indicates that the model system is able to qualitatively reproduce the kinetic effect attributed to llpo the concentrations of 2 an and 4 cn phoh were also monitored during these experiments and found to be essentially constant see si text s5 and fig s1 kinetic modelling was used to rationalize the observed dmop transformation kinetics for the different initial concentrations of dmop the reactions considered in the model correspond to those represented in fig 5 the primary reaction eq 3 consists in the excitation of 2 an by photons of uv light to form its excited triplet state 32 an note that this reaction includes several elementary photophysical steps see e g rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 which do not have to be considered in detail because they occur on a very short time scale compared to the lifetime of 32 an a second reaction eq 4 describes the deactivation of 32 an in the absence of a target compound or an electron poor phenol this is also a lumped reaction comprising unimolecular deactivation and quenching by oxygen but an overall deactivation rate constant can be employed because the oxygen concentration remains constant during the irradiation experiments further relevant reactions of 32 an involve dmop eq 5 leading to an oxidation product of dmop dmopox and 4 cn pho eq 6 which is present at ph 8 0 at equimolar concentration compared to the undissociated form of 4 cn phoh leading to the formation of the phenoxyl radical of the latter 4 cn pho both reactions also lead to ground state 2 an the reaction of 32 an with the undissociated form of 4 cn phoh was neglected because it is too slow canonica et al 2000 finally 4 cn pho reacts with dmop leading to 4 cn pho and dmopox eq 7 note that for simplicity no distinction was made between the oxidation products of dmop from eqs 5 and 7 3 2 an h ν 3 2 an 4 3 2 an 2 an 5 3 2 an dmop 2 an dmop ox 6 3 2 an 4 cn pho 2 an 4 cn pho 7 4 cn pho dmop 4 cn pho dmop ox kinetic modelling was performed using the rate constants presented in text s6 and table s7 si kinetic simulations based on the above five reactions failed to reproduce adequately the experimental data shown in fig 6a also the inclusion of an additional first order deactivation reaction of 4 cn pho in the kinetic model was not able to mimic the observed kinetics for dmop in the micromolar range finally the inclusion of a reaction of 4 cn pho with dmopox note that for simplicity no distinction was made between various generations of oxidation products eq 8 lead to a satisfactory reproduction of the experimental kinetics see simulation results in fig 6a 8 4 cn pho dmop ox 4 cn pho dmop ox the fractions of dmop transformed by the individual reactive species after the whole irradiation periods were also estimated utilizing the kinetic simulations for dmop 0 5 0 10 6 m 86 of the initial dmop is transformed by 32 an while for dmop 0 1 0 10 7 m 89 of dmop is transformed by 4 cn pho to better understand the role of dmop 0 for the kinetics of dmop transformation the concentrations of the key reactive species namely 32 an and 4 cn pho obtained from kinetic simulations are represented in fig 6c as a function of irradiation time for the highest and lowest dmop 0 values 5 0 10 6 m and 1 0 10 7 m respectively for the duration of the dmop transformation experiments both 32 an and 4 cn pho exhibit a constant steady state concentration this steady state condition can be used to express the pseudo first order rate constant for the transformation of dmop as the sum of the individual contributions of each reactive species eq 9 9 k dmop obs k 3 2 an dmop r 3 2 an ss k 4 cn pho dmop r 4 cn pho ss where the second order rate constants k r refer to the reactions of the species indicated in the subscripts leading to a transformation of dmop and the subscript ss stands for steady state the simulation results show that while 32 an ss has essentially the same value for both initial dmop concentrations 4 cn pho ss for dmop 0 1 0 10 7 m is 50 times higher than for dmop 0 5 0 10 6 m suggesting an inverse proportionality between 4 cn pho ss and dmop 0 i e 4 cn pho ss 1 dmop 0 utilizing this relationship eq 9 can be expressed as 10 k dmop obs k 3 2 an dmop obs β 4 cn pho dmop r dmop 0 where the factor k 3 2 an dmop obs k 3 2 an dmop r 3 2 an ss is the pseudo first order rate constant for the transformation of dmop in the absence of 4 cn phoh and β 4 cn pho dmop r is an inverse proportionality factor related the reaction of 4 cn pho with dmop both factors are independent of the dmop concentration eq 10 has a similar form as the original equation developed to explain the kinetic effect attributed to llpo canonica and hoigné 1995 a non linear fitting of the k dmop obs vs dmop 0 data to eq 10 was successful see fig 6b yielding k 3 2 an dmop obs 7 25 0 07 10 4 s 1 β 4 cn pho dmop r 1 23 0 03 10 9 m s 1 and a determination coefficient of 0 98 4 conclusions this study provides new insights into the kinetics of transformation of several target compounds and actual or potential aquatic contaminants photosensitized by cdom the principal objective of the study was to show that an enhancement of such a photosensitized transformation may occur at target compound concentrations of 1 10 7 m compared to concentrations of a few 10 6 m a concentration of 1 10 7 m is closer to actual concentrations of contaminants occurring in sunlit surface waters compared to the concentrations used in the great majority of the studies in literature the main outcomes of this study are electron rich compounds belonging to the chemical classes of phenols anilines and phenylureas showed an enhanced cdom photosensitized transformation at 1 10 7 m initial concentration compared to 5 10 6 m for phenols enhancement factors ef are 10 in some cases while for the other compound classes maximum ef of 2 6 were observed the enhancement effect was attributed to dom derived long lived photooxidants llpo using the enhancement effect of selected anilines and phenols which was shown to increase with oxidation potential of the compounds the one electron reduction potential of llpo derived from suwannee river fulvic acid was estimated to be in the range of 1 02 1 32 v vs she using 3 4 dimethoxyphenol as llpo probe compound the highly aromatic and phenolic rich suwannee river humic and fulvic acids exhibited a much higher llpo effect than pony lake fulvic acid which has a significantly lower aromaticity and phenolic content the same probe compound exhibited an analogous enhancement effect in a model system consisting of the photosensitizer 2 acetonaphthone and the electron poor phenol 4 cyanophenol the results from this model system support the hypothesis that llpo comprise electron poor phenoxyl radicals photochemically produced from dom this conclusion is corroborated by the aforementioned correlation between the llpo effect and the phenolic content of different dom types the findings of this study call for a reexamination of the predictions concerning the rates of indirect photochemical transformation of electron rich aquatic contaminants such as several phenols and anilines since such predictions are mostly based on laboratory irradiation experiments with spiked contaminants it is recommended that future experiments are performed using various initial concentrations of the target compounds in the range 1 10 6 m declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17283,dissolved organic matter dom plays a crucial role in the photochemical transformation of organic contaminants in natural aquatic systems the present study focuses on the characterization of a specific effect previously observed for electron rich phenols consisting in an acceleration of the dom photosensitized transformation of target compounds at low concentrations 1 µm this effect was hypothesized to be caused by dom derived long lived photooxidants llpo pseudo first order rate constants for the transformation of several phenols anilines sulfonamide antibiotics and phenylureas photosensitized by suwannee river fulvic acid were determined under steady state irradiation using the uva and visible wavelengths from a medium pressure mercury lamp a significant enhancement by a factor of 2 4 16 of the first order transformation rate constant of various electron rich target compounds was observed for an initial concentration of 0 1 μm compared to 5 μm this effect points to a relevant reactivity of these compounds with llpo for phenols and anilines the enhancement effect occurred only above certain standard one electron oxidation potentials from these data series the standard one electron reduction potential of llpo was estimated to be in the range of 1 0 1 3 v versus the standard hydrogen electrode llpo are proposed to mainly consist of phenoxyl radicals formed by photooxidation of electron poor phenolic moieties of the dom the plausibility of this hypothesis was successfully tested by studying the photosensitized transformation kinetics of 3 4

irradiation comprise well defined chemical entities such as the hydroxyl radical carbonate radical or singlet oxygen as well as excited states or radical species that are often elusive to precise chemical identification because they are derived from and still attached to the dom richard and canonica 2005 sharpless and blough 2014 vione et al 2014 excited triplet states of the cdom 3cdom have been recognized as pivotal photooxidants affecting the fate of organic contaminants in surface waters canonica 2007 canonica et al 1995 mcneill and canonica 2016 besides 3cdom the existence of dom derived photooxidants having longer lifetimes than 3cdom and therefore termed long lived photooxidants llpo was postulated canonica and freiburghaus 2001 canonica and hoigné 1995 this assumption was used to explain the observed increase in pseudo first order cdom photosensitized transformation rate constants of electron rich phenols i e phenols bearing electron donating substituents with decreasing initial phenol concentrations in the range of 10 6 10 7 m canonica and freiburghaus 2001 canonica and hoigné 1995 kawaguchi 1993 this observation is highly relevant since concentrations of many organic contaminants in natural surface waters are even lower than this concentration range moschet et al 2014 ruff et al 2015 so far 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp canonica and freiburghaus 2001 kawaguchi 1993 4 methoxyphenol canonica and hoigné 1995 3 4 dimethoxylphenol dmop canonica and freiburghaus 2001 canonica and hoigné 1995 and n n dimethylaniline canonica and freiburghaus 2001 were reported to undergo this effect while for 4 methylphenol the effect was absent at the lowest investigated initial concentration of 10 7 m canonica and freiburghaus 2001 a conceptual model and corresponding kinetic equations were developed to explain the observed increase in pseudo first order transformation rate constants with decreasing initial concentration of the target compound canonica and hoigné 1995 canonica and freiburghaus 2001 an updated version of this model is visualized in fig 1 two pools of cdom derived photooxidants in aerated aqueous solution are assumed for the first pool the presence of a target compound at concentrations 5 10 6 m does not significantly affect the steady state concentration of the photooxidants with the current knowledge on cdom photochemistry and using target compounds that are not significantly transformed by singlet oxygen these photooxidants are assumed to mainly represent 3cdom for the second pool the presence of a target compound at concentrations in the range of 1 10 7 5 10 6 m significantly affects the steady state concentration of the photooxidants the increasing steady state concentration of this pool of photooxidants with decreasing target compound concentration results in an increasing pseudo first order rate constant for the transformation of the target compound assuming a maximum second order rate constant of 3 109 m 1 s 1 for the reaction of these photooxidants with a target compound and a reduction in steady state concentration of the photooxidants by at least 50 upon addition of a target compound at 5 10 6 m concentration the photooxidants of this second pool can be estimated to have on average lifetimes longer than 67 μs see the supplementary information si text s1 for a detailed calculation an estimation made in the original study lead to lifetimes in the order of 100 μs canonica and hoigné 1995 this lifetime is much longer than estimates for 3cdom in aerated water 1 6 6 3 μs see si text s2 which justifies the use of the term long lived photooxidants llpo in the present paper the knowledge on the deactivation pathways and rate constants of 3cdom has been substantially improving during the last decade golanoski et al 2012 schmitt et al 2017 sharpless 2012 yielding the aforementioned average lifetimes of 3cdom in aerated water at 25 c that match well with the early lifetime estimate of 2 μs zepp et al 1985 the main groups of reactions of 3cdom with organic contaminants namely one electron oxidation and triplet triplet energy transfer and the energetics of such reactions are also fairly well understood mcneill and canonica 2016 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 in contrast during the last twenty years no substantial advances in the characterization of the hypothesized llpo were made despite their potentially decisive contribution to the phototransformation of some aquatic organic contaminants in surface waters which may even override the contribution of 3cdom due to the often very low concentrations of these contaminants since llpo are formed in an oxic environment and are capable of oxidizing electron rich phenols they are expected to be oxidizing radicals that are part of the photochemically transformed dom these radicals possibly include peroxyl radicals mill et al 1980 or phenoxyl radicals which are plausible due to abundance of phenolic moieties in the dom ritchie and perdue 2003 and could result from a one electron oxidation of these moieties by 3cdom llpo have been suggested to have a higher selectivity than 3cdom in their reaction with phenols canonica and hoigné 1995 and therefore assuming one electron oxidation of the phenols or any other compound in both cases llpo should have lower standard one electron reduction potentials e red 1 0 than 3cdom note that in the following all potentials are given vs standard hydrogen electrode she the reduction potentials of the latter were estimated to lie in the range of 1 36 1 90 v vs she canonica et al 2000 and more recently 1 6 1 8 v vs she parker and mitch 2016 the reduction potentials of various substituted phenoxyl radicals have been measured and cover a wide range jonsson et al 1993 lind et al 1990 which extends from values near zero for very electron rich species to 1 22 v for the 4 nitrophenoxyl radical lind et al 1990 with the unsubstituted phenoxyl radical having 0 79 v lind et al 1990 moreover estimations of e red 1 0 are available for alkyl peroxyl radicals roo 0 71 0 83 v and alkyl percarboxyl radicals rc o oo 1 05 1 19 v merényi et al 1994 considering the estimated standard one electron oxidation potentials e ox 1 0 of electron rich phenols in their undissociated form 1 17 v for dmop and 1 22 v for tmp canonica et al 2000 both electron poor phenoxyl radicals and rc o oo would be efficient oxidants of these phenols and therefore plausible candidates for llpo the primary goal of this study was to evaluate the propensity of several organic compounds belonging to various chemical classes to undergo photosensitized transformation induced by llpo to this end the pseudo first rate constants for the dom photosensitized transformation of each target compound at initial concentrations of 1 0 10 7 m and 5 0 10 6 m were measured the lower initial concentration was designated to allow precise quantification of the rate constants without the need of sample pre concentration and to be consistent with a previous study canonica and freiburghaus 2001 the resulting rate constant difference was interpreted in terms of llpo reactivity for substituted phenols and anilines as target compounds their reactivity with llpo was related to the standard one electron oxidation potentials of the compounds for estimating the reduction potential of llpo using dmop as an llpo probe compound the dependence of llpo reactivity on dom type and concentration was investigated finally a chemical model system consisting of a photosensitizer and an electron poor phenol i e a phenol bearing electron withdrawing substituents was employed to mimic the effect of dom derived llpo on the pseudo first order transformation rate

phosphate buffer stock solutions 50 mm ph 7 76 were prepared in ultrapure water by dissolving appropriate amounts of na2hpo4 2h2o and nah2po4 h2o dom isolates stock solutions 50 or 100 mgc l 1 were made in ultrapure water by dissolving an estimated target amount of the hygroscopic isolates all solutions were stored in the dark at 4 c 2 2 irradiation experiments solutions to be irradiated were prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of the aforementioned stock solutions and 16 ml thereof were transferred to quartz tubes 18 mm external diameter 15 mm internal diameter 250 mm height sealed with glass stoppers the final concentration of phosphate buffer was 5 mm resulting in a ph of 8 0 0 1 the quartz tubes were shaken by hand and placed in a water bath at 25 0 c for 15 minutes thereafter irradiations were performed using a temperature controlled dema hans mangels gmbh bornhein roisdorf germany model 125 merry go round photoreactor equipped with a heraeus noblelight model tq718 medium pressure mercury lamp the latter was positioned in a borosilicate cooling jacket and operated with an input power of 500 w the geometry of the photoreactor was described in detail elsewhere wegelin et al 1994 light from the mercury lamp was filtered by the double wall of the cooling jacket and additionally by a 0 15 m sodium nitrate filter solution which was recirculated in the photoreactor to maintain a constant temperature of 25 0 0 2 c this resulted in a cut off filter transmitting light with wavelength λ 320 nm total irradiation times varied in the range of 3 minutes to 8 hours depending on the rates of transformation of the various target compounds and 360 μl samples were withdrawn from the quartz tubes at six equidistant time intervals the photon fluence rate in the quartz tubes was checked weekly by chemical actinometry using an aqueous solution of 4 nitroanisole 5 0 10 6 m and pyridine 1 0 10 2 m laszakovits et al 2017 leresche et al 2016 it was determined for the relevant wavelength band of 334 436 nm using the methods detailed by leresche et al 2016 and found to vary in the range of 4 1 5 6 10 3 einstein m 2 s 1 over the duration of the whole study 2 3 analytical methods concentrations of the target compounds were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using an agilent 1100 hplc system equipped with a quaternary low pressure mixing gradient pump a photodiode array detector and a fluorescence detector agilent 1200 series or an analogous dionex 3000 ultimate system the photodiode array detector was mainly used to analyze samples taken from solutions with 5 0 μm initial target compound concentration for solutions with 0 1 μm initial target compound concentration the fluorescence detector was often preferred to the photodiode array detector because of the higher sensitivity that could be achieved for the analysis of some target compounds typically duplicate injections of 100 μl samples were performed a reverse phase c18 column cosmosil 5c18 ms ii was used details on hplc analytical conditions are described in the si table s1 the ph of the samples was measured before and after each irradiation experiment using a ph meter either a metrohm model 605 equipped with a metrohm ph electrode model 6 02341 110 or a thermo scientific model orion star a111 equipped with a thermo scientific ph electrode model orion 8115bnuwp ross ultra typically a small ph decrease 0 1 ph units was observed during the irradiation experiment concentrations of dom stock solutions were measured after appropriate dilution

used to measure absorption spectra of the dom isolates and to calculate light screening factors 2 4 determination of rate constants pseudo first order rate constants k obs for the transformation of a given target compound were determined using the following relationship 1 ln tc t tc 0 k obs t where tc t and tc 0 are the target compound concentrations at irradiation time t and before irradiation respectively for dom containing samples light screening corrections were performed according to the si text s3 to determine the net contribution of dom photosensitization to the transformation of tcs the observed rate constants measured for dom containing solutions were further corrected when applicable by subtracting the pseudo first order rate constant obtained for the corresponding blank experiments i e for dom free solutions this correction compensates for the possible contributions of direct phototransformation or other effects of the water matrix all corrected rate constants are termed k obs c details of the calculation are given in the si text s4 2 5 determination of the enhancement factor for the representation of the enhancement in k obs c observed for the transformation of target compounds at the low initial concentration of 1 0 10 7 m 0 1 μm compared to the high initial concentration of 5 0 10 6 m 5 0 μm an enhancement factor ef was defined as 2 ef k 0 1 obs c k 5 0 obs c where the subscripts of the rate constants indicate the initial tc concentration in μm 2 6 kinetic models and simulations the software kintecus ianni 2017 was employed to simulate the photosensitized transformation kinetics of 3 4 dimethoxyphenol in solutions containing 2 acetonaphthone as a model photosensitizer and 4 cyanophenol as a model electron poor phenol details of these simulations are given in the si text s6 and table s7 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of target compounds potentially subject to llpo induced transformation based on a literature review organic target compounds were selected for a screening study according to the following criteria 1 indirect phototransformation photosensitized by cdom is or is expected to be their dominant photochemical transformation pathway 2 excited triplet states of the cdom 3cdom acting as photooxidants play or are expected to play a major role in their indirect phototransformation under the employed irradiation conditions λ 320 nm 3 llpo are known to or might significantly contribute to their cdom photosensitized transformation a few target compounds not satisfying the third criterion were also investigated as negative controls the selected target compounds potentially fulfilling the above criteria see table 1 belong to four distinct chemical classes namely phenols anilines sulfonamides and phenylureas the experimental rate constant data for all investigated target compounds are summarized in table s4 si and represented in fig 2 utilizing the enhancement factor ef eq 2 for the sulfonamides and 4 acetylaniline the determination of ef was not possible because direct photolysis appeared to dominate their transformation see si text s4 and table s4 for six target compounds ef was 1 within the experimental accuracy meaning that there is no enhancement in the rate constant by reducing the initial target compound concentration this is interpreted as a negligible impact of llpo on the phototransformation of these target compounds for all other compounds including tmp dmop trolox aniline 4 methylaniline and dmp ef was 1 meaning that at the low initial target compound concentration a significantly higher rate constant was determined compared to the higher initial target compound concentration for these compounds the enhancement in the rate constants at the low initial concentration is attributed to the effect of llpo the compounds with ef 1 belonging to the phenols anilines and phenylureas are among the most electron rich representatives of each class as can be deduced from their oxidation potentials or hammett substituent constants see table 1 the three electron rich phenols tmp dmop and trolox exhibit by far the highest ef values which lie in the range of 6 16 for anilines and phenylureas ef values do not exceed 2 6 3 2 estimation of the reduction potential of llpo the above ef data for phenols and anilines for which standard one electron oxidation potentials e ox 1 0 are known see table 1 can be used to evaluate the oxidative character of llpo in particular the standard one electron reduction potential e red 1 0 fig 3 displays ef values for these two compound classes as from fig 2 as a function of the corresponding oxidation potentials for the phenols ef is close to unity up to a value of e ox 1 0 1 38 v and increases steadily with e ox 1 0 above this value the onset of ef 1 is located between 1 38 and 1 22 v for the anilines the change in ef as a function of e ox 1 0 follows a similar trend as for the phenols with ef 1 for e ox 1 0 1 32 v and an onset of ef 1 located between 1 32 and 1 02 v these onset ranges overlap from 1 32 to 1 22 v but the onset range for the anilines is shifted by 0 2 v towards higher oxidation potentials compared to the phenols assuming a pure one electron transfer reaction of llpo with anilines it can be concluded that the maximum e red 1 0 values for llpo lie in the range of 1 02 1 32 v the case of phenols is more complex to evaluate since phenols are known to undergo proton coupled electron transfer reactions sjödin et al 2006 warren et al 2010 weinberg et al 2012 which may lower the potential required for their oxidation compared to a pure electron transfer reaction therefore we consider that the range of maximum e red 1 0 values for llpo that can be deduced from the phenol series 1 22 1 38 v overestimates the actual maximum reduction potential of llpo at the experimental ph a small fraction of the phenols between 1 2 for phenol and 0 013 for trolox as can be calculated from their pk a values is present as phenoxide ion the latter which has a standard one electron reduction potential that is on average about 0 7 v higher compared to the corresponding undissociated phenol is expected to react with llpo at a very high rate the fact that neither 4 methylphenol nor phenol exhibit an llpo effect demonstrates that the reaction of phenoxide ions with llpo can be neglected in the frame of the present experiments 3 3 dependence of enhancement effect on type and concentration of dom using dmop as a target compound its photosensitized transformation kinetics at the two initial concentrations of 1 0 10 7 and 5 0 10 6 m was measured in the presence of various concentrations of the three selected dom isolates fig 4 displays the dom concentration dependence of the corrected pseudo first order rate constants k obs c and the enhancement factors ef derived from these rate constants for the three isolates a suwannee river fulvic acid b suwannee river humic acid and c pony lake fulvic acid at dmop 0 5 0 10 6 m and for all three dom isolates k obs c is always much lower than for dmop 0 1 0 10 7 m and increases proportionally with increasing dom concentrations this indicates that up to dom 10 mgc l 1 dom does not significantly quench the photooxidants responsible for the transformation of dmop this conclusion concurs with the assumption that the photooxidants are mainly 3cdom which in analogy to the excited triplet states of model aromatic ketones wenk et al 2013 are expected to be free from quenching by dom at these dom concentration levels moreover for dmop 0 5 0 10 6 m all three dom isolates exhibit similar rate constants at equal dom concentration for the lower initial dmop concentration plfa exhibit a linear increase in k obs c with increasing dom concentrations while for srfa and srha the initially linear increase in k obs c tends to level off at dom 5 mgc l 1 for increasing dom concentrations the enhancement factors tend to decrease for srfa and srha and to remain constant for plfa for plfa ef is essentially independent of the dom concentration with an average value of 2 1 which is significantly lower than the values determined for srfa and srha the lower ef is interpreted as lower impact of llpo in the transformation of dmop interestingly the suwannee river dom isolates also have a higher aromaticity phenolic content and electron donating capacity than plfa aeschbacher et al 2012 senesi et al 1989 the fact that the llpo effect is positively correlated with the concentration of phenolic moieties in the dom supports the hypothesis that llpo include phenoxyl radicals of the dom formed during photoinduced oxidation of the corresponding phenolic moieties of the dom the decrease in ef observed at the higher srfa and srha concentrations also revealed by the linear fit line slopes of 0 4 0 1 and 0 29 0 05 l mgc 1 respectively is attributed to partial llpo scavenging by dom itself such a scavenging coincides with the higher concentration of electron donating moieties for the two suwannee river dom isolates compared to plfa 3 4 chemical model systems to mimic dom derived llpo model aromatic ketones and quinones have been widely used in aquatic photochemistry to mimic the reactivity of 3cdom with an oxidative character canonica et al 2006 canonica et al 2000 canonica et al 1995 canonica and laubscher 2008 carena et al 2019 maurino et al 2008 minella et al 2018 werner et al 2005 moreover phenol and phenolic compounds bearing electron donating substituents have been utilized as model antioxidants in combination with dom or model photosensitizers to investigate the dual role of dom as a photosensitizer and inhibitor of 3cdom induced oxidations of aquatic organic contaminants bahnmüller et al 2014 leresche et al 2016 wenk and canonica 2012 here we use a model photosensitizer sens in combination with a model electron poor phenol r phohep to photogenerate both oxidizing excited triplet states 3sens and electron poor phenoxyl radicals r phoep which are formed upon one electron oxidation of the model phenol by 3sens in such model systems with well defined chemicals see fig 5 3sens and r phoep are used to mimic 3cdom and llpo respectively as in the case of irradiated cdom both short lived excited triplet states and longer lived radicals coexist under irradiation in these model systems irradiation experiments were performed using aqueous solutions buffered at ph 8 0 and containing 2 an 1 5 10 6 m as sens 4 cn phoh 5 0 10 6 m as an electron poor phenol r phohep and dmop as a target compound at different initial concentrations in the range of 1 0 10 7 m 5 0 10 6 m the photosensitized transformation kinetics of dmop was found to slow down with increasing initial concentration of dmop between 1 0 10 7 and 1 0 10 6 m while it remained constant above the latter concentration fig 6 a first order fitting of the kinetic data yielded pseudo first order rate constants that increased by a factor of 3 4 and 10 for initial dmop concentrations of 5 0 10 7 m 2 5 10 7 m and 1 0 10 7 m respectively see fig 6b compared to the average rate constant observed for the higher initial dmop concentrations 1 0 5 0 10 6 m the decrease in the first order rate constant with increasing initial concentrations of the target phenol is analogous to the one observed in the original study in which dom was used as a photosensitizer canonica and hoigné 1995 this indicates that the model system is able to qualitatively reproduce the kinetic effect attributed to llpo the concentrations of 2 an and 4 cn phoh were also monitored during these experiments and found to be essentially constant see si text s5 and fig s1 kinetic modelling was used to rationalize the observed dmop transformation kinetics for the different initial concentrations of dmop the reactions considered in the model correspond to those represented in fig 5 the primary reaction eq 3 consists in the excitation of 2 an by photons of uv light to form its excited triplet state 32 an note that this reaction includes several elementary photophysical steps see e g rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 which do not have to be considered in detail because they occur on a very short time scale compared to the lifetime of 32 an a second reaction eq 4 describes the deactivation of 32 an in the absence of a target compound or an electron poor phenol this is also a lumped reaction comprising unimolecular deactivation and quenching by oxygen but an overall deactivation rate constant can be employed because the oxygen concentration remains constant during the irradiation experiments further relevant reactions of 32 an involve dmop eq 5 leading to an oxidation product of dmop dmopox and 4 cn pho eq 6 which is present at ph 8 0 at equimolar concentration compared to the undissociated form of 4 cn phoh leading to the formation of the phenoxyl radical of the latter 4 cn pho both reactions also lead to ground state 2 an the reaction of 32 an with the undissociated form of 4 cn phoh was neglected because it is too slow canonica et al 2000 finally 4 cn pho reacts with dmop leading to 4 cn pho and dmopox eq 7 note that for simplicity no distinction was made between the oxidation products of dmop from eqs 5 and 7 3 2 an h ν 3 2 an 4 3 2 an 2 an 5 3 2 an dmop 2 an dmop ox 6 3 2 an 4 cn pho 2 an 4 cn pho 7 4 cn pho dmop 4 cn pho dmop ox kinetic modelling was performed using the rate constants presented in text s6 and table s7 si kinetic simulations based on the above five reactions failed to reproduce adequately the experimental data shown in fig 6a also the inclusion of an additional first order deactivation reaction of 4 cn pho in the kinetic model was not able to mimic the observed kinetics for dmop in the micromolar range finally the inclusion of a reaction of 4 cn pho with dmopox note that for simplicity no distinction was made between various generations of oxidation products eq 8 lead to a satisfactory reproduction of the experimental kinetics see simulation results in fig 6a 8 4 cn pho dmop ox 4 cn pho dmop ox the fractions of dmop transformed by the individual reactive species after the whole irradiation periods were also estimated utilizing the kinetic simulations for dmop 0 5 0 10 6 m 86 of the initial dmop is transformed by 32 an while for dmop 0 1 0 10 7 m 89 of dmop is transformed by 4 cn pho to better understand the role of dmop 0 for the kinetics of dmop transformation the concentrations of the key reactive species namely 32 an and 4 cn pho obtained from kinetic simulations are represented in fig 6c as a function of irradiation time for the highest and lowest dmop 0 values 5 0 10 6 m and 1 0 10 7 m respectively for the duration of the dmop transformation experiments both 32 an and 4 cn pho exhibit a constant steady state concentration this steady state condition can be used to express the pseudo first order rate constant for the transformation of dmop as the sum of the individual contributions of each reactive species eq 9 9 k dmop obs k 3 2 an dmop r 3 2 an ss k 4 cn pho dmop r 4 cn pho ss where the second order rate constants k r refer to the reactions of the species indicated in the subscripts leading to a transformation of dmop and the subscript ss stands for steady state the simulation results show that while 32 an ss has essentially the same value for both initial dmop concentrations 4 cn pho ss for dmop 0 1 0 10 7 m is 50 times higher than for dmop 0 5 0 10 6 m suggesting an inverse proportionality between 4 cn pho ss and dmop 0 i e 4 cn pho ss 1 dmop 0 utilizing this relationship eq 9 can be expressed as 10 k dmop obs k 3 2 an dmop obs β 4 cn pho dmop r dmop 0 where the factor k 3 2 an dmop obs k 3 2 an dmop r 3 2 an ss is the pseudo first order rate constant for the transformation of dmop in the absence of 4 cn phoh and β 4 cn pho dmop r is an inverse proportionality factor related the reaction of 4 cn pho with dmop both factors are independent of the dmop concentration eq 10 has a similar form as the original equation developed to explain the kinetic effect attributed to llpo canonica and hoigné 1995 a non linear fitting of the k dmop obs vs dmop 0 data to eq 10 was successful see fig 6b yielding k 3 2 an dmop obs 7 25 0 07 10 4 s 1 β 4 cn pho dmop r 1 23 0 03 10 9 m s 1 and a determination coefficient of 0 98 4 conclusions this study provides new insights into the kinetics of transformation of several target compounds and actual or potential aquatic contaminants photosensitized by cdom the principal objective of the study was to show that an enhancement of such a photosensitized transformation may occur at target compound concentrations of 1 10 7 m compared to concentrations of a few 10 6 m a concentration of 1 10 7 m is closer to actual concentrations of contaminants occurring in sunlit surface waters compared to the concentrations used in the great majority of the studies in literature the main outcomes of this study are electron rich compounds belonging to the chemical classes of phenols anilines and phenylureas showed an enhanced cdom photosensitized transformation at 1 10 7 m initial concentration compared to 5 10 6 m for phenols enhancement factors ef are 10 in some cases while for the other compound classes maximum ef of 2 6 were observed the enhancement effect was attributed to dom derived long lived photooxidants llpo using the enhancement effect of selected anilines and phenols which was shown to increase with oxidation potential of the compounds the one electron reduction potential of llpo derived from suwannee river fulvic acid was estimated to be in the range of 1 02 1 32 v vs she using 3 4 dimethoxyphenol as llpo probe compound the highly aromatic and phenolic rich suwannee river humic and fulvic acids exhibited a much higher llpo effect than pony lake fulvic acid which has a significantly lower aromaticity and phenolic content the same probe compound exhibited an analogous enhancement effect in a model system consisting of the photosensitizer 2 acetonaphthone and the electron poor phenol 4 cyanophenol the results from this model system support the hypothesis that llpo comprise electron poor phenoxyl radicals photochemically produced from dom this conclusion is corroborated by the aforementioned correlation between the llpo effect and the phenolic content of different dom types the findings of this study call for a reexamination of the predictions concerning the rates of indirect photochemical transformation of electron rich aquatic contaminants such as several phenols and anilines since such predictions are mostly based on laboratory irradiation experiments with spiked contaminants it is recommended that future experiments are performed using various initial concentrations of the target compounds in the range 1 10 6 m declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17284,sodium silicates have been used in drinking water treatment for decades as sequestrants and corrosion inhibitors for the latter purpose they are poorly understood which presents a potential public health risk we investigated a common sodium silicate formulation as a treatment for lead release and compared it to orthophosphate a well established lead corrosion control treatment we also compared the size distributions of colloids generated in silicate and orthophosphate treated systems using field flow fractionation with multielement detection at a moderate dose of 24 mg sio2 l sodium silicate yielded a median lead release of 398 µg l while orthophosphate yielded 67 µg pb l at an elevated dose of 48 mg sio2 l sodium silicate dispersed corrosion scale in cast iron pipe sections and lead service lines resulting in a substantial release of colloidal iron and lead in the silicate treated system a silicon rich coating occurred at the lead water interface but lead carbonate remained the major corrosion product and appeared to control lead levels these data suggest that as a corrosion control treatment for lead sodium silicate is inferior to orthophosphate in circumneutral ph water with low alkalinity and as with polyphosphate excess silicate can be highly detrimental to controlling lead release graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lead drinking water sodium silicate colloid iron phosphate 1 introduction sodium silicates have been used by water utilities as corrosion inhibitors and sequestrants for decades li et al 2019 robinson et al 1992 viglione 2019 orthophosphate is much more widely used for lead control bae et al 2020 2019 brandhuber 2018 but silicates are regarded as a legitimate lead control treatment health canada 2019 nsf 2020 newark new jersey for instance used a sodium silicate to control lead release from the mid 1990s until 2019 when it switched to orthophosphate in response to high lead levels lytle et al 2020 viglione 2019 yi 2019 limited data however mean that the mechanisms by which silicates might act to limit lead release are still unclear they may form a thin silicate based film on the internal surface of lead pipes scheetz et al 1997 thompson et al 1997 or contribute to formation of low solubility corrosion scale kogo et al 2017 mishrra et al 2020 but little evidence exists to support either possibility and the effect of silicates on lead is often confounded with the increase in ph that silicates cause hosseinibalajadeh 2018 lintereur et al 2010 schock et al 2005 tang et al 2006 thompson et al 1997 limited understanding of silicate lead interactions leaves water systems that use silicates vulnerable to lead contamination silicates are better known as sequestrants and they are widely used to solve aesthetic issues caused by iron and manganese dart and foley 1972 li et al 2019 mcneill and edwards 2001 robinson et al 1992 but given the role of polyphosphate another popular sequestrant in exacerbating lead release cantor et al 2000 edwards and mcneill 2002 holm and shock 1991 careful evaluation of silicates effect on lead is warranted while silicates impacts on iron oxidation jones et al 2014 kinsela et al 2016 and particle size distribution li et al 2019 have been described previously silicates effect on the distribution system as a whole is poorly characterized previous work indicates that particulate iron and manganese may increase lead release knowles et al 2015 masters and edwards 2015 trueman et al 2019a 2019b 2017a trueman and gagnon 2016a and given the dispersive effects of silicates on these metals study of the interplay between iron manganese lead and silicate species is important to avoid future water quality problems here we evaluated lead release control using a common sodium silicate formulation comparing it against orthophosphate a standard corrosion control treatment for circumneutral ph water with low alkalinity edwards and mcneill 2002 lytle et al 2009 masten et al 2016 mcneill and edwards 2002 we used a model distribution system with new lead pipes and cast iron or pvc water mains to address three primary objectives 1 the effect of sodium silicate on lead release from full and partial lead service lines lsls 2 its effect on colloidal metals release from both lsls and water mains and 3 lsl scale formation in the

distribution system detailed descriptions of the pilot scale model distribution system are available elsewhere gagnon and doubrough 2011 trueman and gagnon 2016a woszczynski et al 2013 and the relevant modifications are described here given the limited data on silicate lead interactions in a drinking water context we chose to use new lead pipe because it yields repeatable results avoiding the peculiarities of recovered lead pipe that would have limited our ability to generalize the study findings the model system fig 1 a comprised six independent distribution main pipe loops three pvc

the six pipe loops was discharged to six independent 68 l reservoirs and pumped through the lsls for 5 minutes each day at an approximate flow rate of 2 l min this resulted in a daily stagnation

the remaining volume of each effluent sample was preserved in the original bottle and held for a minimum of 24 h afterwards a 10 ml aliquot from each was decanted to a polypropylene tube for total

fractionation cuss et al 2017 gora et al 2020 lesher et al 2009 poda et al 2011 podzimek 2011 samples were filtered at 0 45 µm with a cellulose nitrate membrane immediately before analysis and details of the method are described elsewhere trueman et al 2019a to estimate the molecular weight of colloids we calibrated the system using bromophenol blue 0 69 kda tannic acid 1 7 kda ovalbumin 44 kda ferritin 440 kda and blue dextran 2000 kda linear decay of the cross flow necessitated a quadratic fit to the data log10 m 6 2 1 11 v r 0 05 v r 2 where v r is the retention volume and m is the

2019 along with a collection of widely used contributed packages lawlor 2019 wickham 2016 wickham et al 2019 wilke 2019 wood 2017 we fit an additive model wood 2017 to the lsl effluent data describing lead release as a smooth non parametric function of effluent iron concentration a thin plate regression spline we modeled lsl type full or partial and inhibitor type as parametric effects and we estimated the model using restricted maximum likelihood to account for the differences in length of lead pipe between full and partial lsls lead release was expressed as mass released per unit length of lead pipe µg pb cm this quantity is a function of the lead concentration in lsl effluent the volume of water contained within the lsl section and the length of lead pipe autocorrelation was modeled for each lsl section as a continuous time first order autoregressive process car 1 figure s5d pinheiro and bates 2006 simpson 2018 the basic form of the model is described in pedersen et al 2019 model

meaning that f l o g fe is the sum of four cubic polynomials equation 2 is explained in figure s9 s10 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of sodium silicate on lead release from lsls sodium silicate performed worse than either orthophosphate or zinc orthophosphate in mitigating lead release due to uniform full lsl corrosion fig 2 figure s3 at 24 mg sio2 l median lead in full lsl effluent was 398 µg l n 54 in the presence of orthophosphate or zinc orthophosphate 1 mg po4 3 l it was much lower 67 µg l n 78 and 53 µg l n 78 respectively lead levels at 1 mg po4 3 l were comparable to peak lead levels in homes with lsls in the distribution system we modeled trueman et al 2018 and this system also maintains 1 mg po4 3 l sodium silicate did not protect against galvanic corrosion either at least in comparison with the other two treatments here galvanic effects were estimated as the difference in median lead release between full and partial lsls receiving the same water type lead release from partial lsls treated with 24 mg sio2 l median 578 µg l n 54 was greater by 180 µg l while the effect of galvanic corrosion in the other two systems was relatively minor lead release from partial lsls was greater by just 2 median 69 µg l n 78 and 15 µg l median 68 µg l n 77 in the orthophosphate and zinc orthophosphate treated systems respectively these effects are consistent with previous reports that in galvanic systems sodium silicate performs poorly in comparison with orthophosphate kogo et al 2017 woszczynski et al 2015 3 2 galvanic corrosion and lead release while sodium silicate was ineffective relative to orthophosphate in controlling lead release due to galvanic corrosion orthophosphate did not inhibit charge transfer between copper and lead fig 3 instead it appeared to promote scale formation in the presence of sodium silicate each additional µa of current accompanied 94 µg pb l fig 3 r2 0 89 in the presence of either orthophosphate or zinc orthophosphate each additional µa accompanied much less between 7 4 and 8 7 µg pb l fig 3 moreover the relationship between galvanic current and lead release in the presence of orthophosphate was generally weak with r2 ranging from 0 16 0 20 these findings are consistent with previous work describing immobilization in scale of lead released due to galvanic corrosion cartier et al 2012 kogo et al 2017 nguyen et al 2010 triantafyllidou and edwards 2011 zhou et al 2015 the failure of sodium silicate compared with orthophosphate to immobilize lead is discussed mechanistically below see section 3 4 dispersion of colloidal metals by sodium silicate and section 3 5 scale morphology structure and elemental composition 3 3 role of iron release in the presence of sodium silicate lsls supplied by unlined iron released much more lead than those supplied by pvc with a median difference of 358 µg l over the experiment given the strong prior evidence that iron is a driver for lead release camara et al 2013 deshommes et al 2010 masters and edwards 2015 trueman and gagnon 2016a trueman et al 2017b we modeled observed lead mass loss as a smooth non parametric function of iron concentration where the relationship between the two variables was dictated by the data not by a user selected parameter table 1 fig 4 and figure s5 the relationship between iron and lead was statistically significant p 0 001 suggesting that iron particles represent a significant mobile sink for lead the other experimental factors lsl type and inhibitor were incorporated into the model as parametric effects partial lsls released an estimated 101 9 more lead per unit length of lead pipe than full lsls p 0 001 which is consistent with previous data cartier et al 2012 doré et al 2019 hu et al 2012 and the differences between lead release from full and parial lsls summarized above see section 3 1 effect of sodium silicate on lead release from lsls the additive model as described in equation 1 2 and in the supporting information explained 84 4 r2 of the variation in lead release relative to orthophosphate sodium silicate accompanied 697 0 more lead release p 0 001 which is also consistent with the differences summarized above zinc orthophosphate treatment resulted in 34 3 more lead p 0 004 fig 4 table 1 and while this difference is not apparent in fig 2 the model controls for the positive effect of iron but the figure does not iron was higher in cast iron effluent treated with non zinc orthophosphate and excluding lsls supplied by cast iron zinc orthophosphate treatment resulted in a median of 23 µg l more lead release than orthophosphate treatment 3 4 dispersion of colloidal metals by sodium silicate while the additive model describes variation in lead release as a function of inhibitor type it does not account for variation in the dose of sodium silicate except implicitly through covariation in iron concentrations when the silicate dose was doubled from 24 to 48 mg sio2 in the final twelve weeks of the study figs 1b and s1d lead and iron increased dramatically fig 5 this cannot be explained by effluent ph which was held constant throughout the experiment at 24 mg sio2 l lead levels in full lsl effluent were relatively stable with median values of 589 and 297 µg l in cast iron and pvc systems respectively fig 5a at 48 mg l median lead in full lsl effluent increased to 1234 and 425 µg l and partial lsl effluent exhibited a similar trend figures s3 with the increase in silicate dose median iron increased from 18 to 130 and 7 to 37 µg l in cast iron and pvc distribution main effluent that is in the influent to lsl sections figs 5b and s4 similar observations have been reported elsewhere schock et al 2005 in hopkinton ma silicate addition 25 55 mg sio2 l without ph control accompanied an increase in iron although seasonality and variable well use may have been factors in this case silicate treatment also accompanied a temporary increase in lead schock et al 2005 here increases in iron and lead are likely due at least in part to colloidal dispersion of metals originating either from corrosion scale or from iron deposits on pvc the dispersive properties of sodium silicate have been highlighted in previous work where silicate has been linked with formation of colloidal polymeric ferric iron browman et al 1989 and dose dependent dispersion of particulate colloidal iron li et al 2019 the negative surface charge imparted to iron oxide particles by sodium silicate kinsela et al 2016 li et al 2019 may play an important role in the elevated iron observed here and silicate s negative effect on the rate of ferrous iron oxidation may also be relevant jones et al 2014 kinsela et al 2016 the dispersive effects of sodium silicate on iron and lead are apparent in the fractograms representing the dissolved 0 45 µm fraction of full and partial lsl effluent figs 6 and s6 respectively these element specific size distributions show a substantial concentration of colloids in the presence of 48 mg sio2 l and a negligible concentration in the presence of zinc orthophosphate colloidal iron was much greater in lsls supplied by cast iron compared with pvc which is consistent with the higher levels of iron observed in cast iron pipe effluent fig 6 the elevated lead levels in lsls supplied by cast iron are probably explained by partitioning of lead to colloidal iron which provides additional capacity beyond the limits of equilibrium solubility for water to transport lead gora et al 2020 trueman et al 2019a trueman and gagnon 2016b silicate addition may also disperse lead from lsl corrosion scale directly but further study is needed to explore this possibility a similar effect has been observed in the presence of excess orthophosphate or natural organic matter species which also disperse particulate lead by imparting a negative surface charge korshin and liu 2019 zhao et al 2018 colloidal iron and lead occurred in lsls supplied by pvc as well albeit in a smaller size range in the cast iron system maximum colloid retention occurred at approximately 1 mda whereas in the pvc system it was closer to 100 kda the size distribution of uv254 absorbance tracked those of iron and lead closely this is may be due to colloids scattering light latimer and pyle 1972 but it may also represent absorbing species including natural organic matter colloids in lsl effluent also contained copper due to low levels in source water or the copper pipe in partial lsls figure s6 manganese present at low levels in source water and aluminum due to alum coagulation these metals have also been reported to co occur with lead in previous work knowles et al 2015 pan et al 2019 schock et al 2014 trueman et al 2019b 3 5 scale

hydrocerussite godelitsas et al 2003 korshin et al 2005 lower et al 1998 quartz sio2 was also identified by xrd but crystalline lead silicate solids e g pbsio3 were not these findings are consistent with model predictions that a lead carbonate phase will dominate under the experimental conditions regardless of the influence of silicate schock et al 1996 weaver 1994 in the presence of orthophosphate with or without zinc hyroxylpyromorphite pb5 po4 3 oh was the dominant crystalline phase fig 7b c accordingly scale exposed to orthophosphate exhibited a clustered needle like morphology characteristic of hydroxylpyromorphite kwaśniak kominek et al 2017 lower et al 1998 quartz litharge cerussite pbco3 and metallic lead were identified as minor phases by xrd sodium silicate did result in corrosion scale with greater silicon content 3 4 0 1 wt by eds than orthophosphate with or without zinc figs 8 and s7 lead was also relatively abundant 16 3 0 9 wt by eds in the silicate treated system while calcium chlorine iron and manganese were more abundant in the presence of orthophosphate and zinc orthophosphate these findings are consistent with the strong dispersive action of sodium silicate figs 5 and 6 that is colloidal dispersion by sodium silicate may have prevented these elements from accumulating on the surface of lead pipes resulting in higher levels of suspended colloidal metals in the water phase 3 6 xps analysis of lsl surface chemistry while silicate did not alter scale in any way that would clearly diminish lead release the methods we employed xrd sem eds provide information up to a depth of several micrometers krost and bläsing 2009 onoue and tsuji 2013 rades et al 2014 however a nanometer thick silica coating has been proposed as a possible mechanism for corrosion control due to silicate in previous studies scheetz et al 1997 thompson et al 1997 since such a coating would be difficult to detect via xrd and sem eds scheetz et al 1997 we used xps to characterize the scale water interface to a depth of several nanometers hajati et al 2008 scheetz et al 1997 tougaard 1996 sodium silicate did promote formation of a thin silicon rich layer at the surface the silicon lead ratio of atomic percentages was 42 6 0 6 and 3 3 in the silicate orthophosphate and zinc orthophosphate treated systems according to the xps survey scan consistent with sem eds results fig 8b silicon si 2p occurred in all systems due either to naturally occurring or added silicate fig 9 d the pb 4f intensity was relatively low in the presence of sodium silicate fig 9a and carbonate 289 ev was not detected at the scale surface the c 1s peak occurred instead at 285 0 ev this peak is attributable to adventitious carbon from air exposure and was used to calibrate the other binding energies fig 9b greczynski and hultman 2017 as expected phosphorus was not detected in scale exposed to added sodium silicate whereas in the presence of orthophosphate it was relatively abundant fig 9c p 2s given the complex environment at the scale water interface there are many possible sources of oxygen e g metal oxides hydroxides or carbonate in the presence of sodium silicate the o 1s photoline occurred at 532 4 ev previous work suggests that o 1s due to metal oxides and hydroxides occurs between 530 9 and 531 5 ev dupin et al 2000 while the non bridging oxygen of silica compounds occurs at higher binding energies e g o 1s due to sio2 533 1 533 3 ev guittet et al 2001 hochella jr and brown jr 1988 thus non bridging oxygen e g silica tetrahedra appears to be relatively abundant in the sodium silicate treated system in the presence of orthophosphate the o 1s peak occurred at a lower binding energy 531 5 ev fig 9e o1s which may be due to the oxygen in phosphate and hydroxide from hydroxyprymorphite reported elsewhere at 531 3 ev mallet et al 2013 together the identification of lead carbonate hydrocerussite by xrd as the dominant phase the weak lead pb 4f signal the weak carbonate signal c 1s at 289 ev the strong silica signal si 2p and the high o 1s binding energy suggest that the lead carbonate surface was covered by a thin silicate rich layer this agrees with previous results scheetz et al 1997 but we found no evidence that the nanometer thick coating inhibited lead release especially compared to orthophosphate treatment 3 7 implications for corrosion control this study eliminated the effect of ph that has confounded several previous studies on silicate corrosion control and while silicate treatment might have reduced lead release relative to an inhibitor free system it fared poorly against even a moderate dose of orthophosphate providing relatively little protection against either uniform or galvanic corrosion nevertheless the benefit of sodium silicate as a ph control additive may be important at low to moderate dic an increase in ph predicts a significant decrease in lead carbonate solubility schock et al 1996 figure s8 it is also possible that this study was not long enough to capture the benefits of silicate treatment here the model system was operated for 500 days at a low to moderate silicate dose 12 or 24 mg sio2 l and 90 days at a high dose 48 mg sio2 l this time frame may not capture slow processes that eventually exert significant effects but if the time to achieve the benefits of silicate addition is long relative to orthophosphate silicate treatment is inherently less useful and regardless of the potential long term benefits the short term impacts identified here need to be carefully evaluated when silicate treatment is initiated chief among them is the potential for sodium silicate to disperse metal rich colloids in this study high levels of sodium silicate dispersed colloidal lead and iron increasing the concentrations of these metals considerably dispersion may be especially important in lsls supplied by iron distribution mains and these lsls are already at high risk for elevated lead release camara et al 2013 trueman and gagnon 2016a trueman et al 2017a moreover point of use filters may be poorly suited to removing highly dispersed colloidal lead lytle et al 2020 viglione 2019 although this might be less of an issue in systems with high hardness robinson et al 1987 4 conclusions despite decades of use significant knowledge gaps concerning sodium silicates remain especially in the context of corrosion control we compared sodium silicate with orthophosphate at a constant ph and our results suggest the following 1 relative to orthophosphate sodium silicate did not control lead release due to either uniform full lsl or galvanic partial lsl corrosion hydrocerussite a lead carbonate dominated corrosion scale in the presence of sodium silicate although a thin nm silicon rich coating did occur at the scale water interface 2 sodium silicate dispersed colloidal iron and lead highlighting a significant risk when silicate is used as a drinking water additive water systems with unlined iron or lead pipe should exercise particular care in dosing sodium silicate 3 corrosion inhibition due to direct lead silicate interactions appears unlikely but investigating the impact of silicate on recovered lead pipes with a complex multi layered corrosion scale may still be valuable future work should focus on silicate based diffusion barriers that might form due to interaction

17284,sodium silicates have been used in drinking water treatment for decades as sequestrants and corrosion inhibitors for the latter purpose they are poorly understood which presents a potential public health risk we investigated a common sodium silicate formulation as a treatment for lead release and compared it to orthophosphate a well established lead corrosion control treatment we also compared the size distributions of colloids generated in silicate and orthophosphate treated systems using field flow fractionation with multielement detection at a moderate dose of 24 mg sio2 l sodium silicate yielded a median lead release of 398 µg l while orthophosphate yielded 67 µg pb l at an elevated dose of 48 mg sio2 l sodium silicate dispersed corrosion scale in cast iron pipe sections and lead service lines resulting in a substantial release of colloidal iron and lead in the silicate treated system a silicon rich coating occurred at the lead water interface but lead carbonate remained the major corrosion product and appeared to control lead levels these data suggest that as a corrosion control treatment for lead sodium silicate is inferior to orthophosphate in circumneutral ph water with low alkalinity and as with polyphosphate excess silicate can be highly detrimental to controlling lead release graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lead

viglione 2019 yi 2019 limited data however mean that the mechanisms by which silicates might act to limit lead release are still unclear they may form a thin silicate based film on the internal surface of lead pipes scheetz et al 1997 thompson et al 1997 or contribute to formation of low solubility corrosion scale kogo et al 2017 mishrra et al 2020 but little evidence exists to support either possibility and the effect of silicates on lead is often confounded with the increase in ph that silicates cause hosseinibalajadeh 2018 lintereur et al 2010 schock et al 2005 tang et al 2006 thompson et al 1997 limited understanding of silicate lead interactions leaves water systems that use silicates vulnerable to lead contamination silicates are better known as sequestrants and they are widely used to solve aesthetic issues caused by iron and manganese dart and foley 1972 li et al 2019 mcneill and edwards 2001 robinson et al 1992 but given the role of polyphosphate another popular sequestrant in exacerbating lead release cantor et al 2000 edwards and mcneill 2002 holm and shock 1991 careful evaluation of silicates effect on lead is warranted while silicates impacts on iron oxidation jones et al 2014 kinsela et al 2016 and particle size distribution li et al 2019 have been described previously silicates effect on the distribution system as a whole is poorly characterized previous work indicates that particulate iron and manganese may increase lead release knowles et al 2015 masters and edwards 2015 trueman et al 2019a 2019b 2017a trueman and gagnon 2016a and given the dispersive effects of silicates on these metals study of the interplay between iron manganese lead and silicate species is important to avoid future water quality problems here we evaluated lead

2002 lytle et al 2009 masten et al 2016 mcneill and edwards 2002 we used a model distribution system with new lead pipes and cast iron or pvc water mains to address three primary objectives 1 the effect of sodium silicate on lead release from full and partial lead service lines lsls 2 its effect on colloidal metals release from both lsls and water mains and 3 lsl scale formation in the presence of sodium silicate this work provides new insight into silicate corrosion control and sequestration especially for systems with legacy iron and lead pipes 2 materials and methods 2 1 model distribution system detailed descriptions of the pilot scale model distribution system are available elsewhere gagnon and doubrough 2011 trueman and gagnon 2016a woszczynski et al 2013 and the relevant modifications are described here given the limited data on silicate lead interactions in a drinking water context we chose to use new lead pipe because it yields repeatable results avoiding the peculiarities of recovered lead pipe that would have limited our ability to generalize the study findings the model system fig 1 a comprised six independent distribution main pipe loops three pvc

the six pipe loops was discharged to six independent 68 l reservoirs and pumped through the lsls for 5 minutes each day at an approximate flow rate of 2 l min this resulted in a daily stagnation

the remaining volume of each effluent sample was preserved in the original bottle and held for a minimum of 24 h afterwards a 10 ml aliquot from each was decanted to a polypropylene tube for total metals analysis 2 4 3 field flow fractionation fff we characterized colloidal metals in lsl effluent from the silicate and zinc orthophosphate treated systems by asymmetric flow field flow fractionation cuss et al 2017 gora et al 2020 lesher et al 2009 poda et al 2011 podzimek 2011 samples were filtered at 0 45 µm with a cellulose nitrate membrane immediately before analysis and details of the method are described elsewhere trueman et al 2019a to estimate the molecular weight of colloids we calibrated the system using bromophenol blue 0 69 kda tannic acid 1 7 kda ovalbumin 44 kda ferritin 440 kda and blue dextran 2000 kda linear decay of the cross flow necessitated a quadratic fit to the data log10 m 6 2 1 11 v r 0 05 v r 2 where v r is the retention volume and m is the

2019 along with a collection of widely used contributed packages lawlor 2019 wickham 2016 wickham et al 2019 wilke 2019 wood 2017 we fit an additive model wood 2017 to the lsl effluent data describing lead release as a smooth non parametric function of effluent iron concentration a thin plate regression spline we modeled lsl type full or partial and inhibitor type as parametric effects and we estimated the model using restricted maximum likelihood to account for the differences in length of lead pipe between full and partial lsls lead release was expressed as mass released per unit length of lead pipe µg pb cm this quantity is a function of the lead concentration in lsl effluent the volume of water contained within the lsl section and the length of lead pipe autocorrelation was modeled for each lsl section as a continuous time first order autoregressive process car 1 figure s5d pinheiro and bates 2006 simpson 2018 the basic form of the model is described in pedersen et al 2019 model

performed worse than either orthophosphate or zinc orthophosphate in mitigating lead release due to uniform full lsl corrosion fig 2 figure s3 at 24 mg sio2 l median lead in full lsl effluent was 398 µg l n 54 in the presence of orthophosphate or zinc orthophosphate 1 mg po4 3 l it was much lower 67 µg l n 78 and 53 µg l n 78 respectively lead levels at 1 mg po4 3 l were comparable to peak lead levels in homes with lsls in the distribution system we modeled trueman et al 2018 and this system also maintains 1 mg po4 3 l sodium silicate did not protect against galvanic corrosion either at least in comparison with the other two treatments here galvanic effects were estimated as the difference in median lead release between full and partial lsls receiving the same water type lead release from partial lsls treated with 24 mg sio2 l median 578 µg l n 54 was greater by 180 µg l while the effect of galvanic corrosion in the other two systems was relatively minor lead release from partial lsls was greater by just 2 median 69 µg l n 78 and 15 µg l median 68 µg l n 77 in the orthophosphate and zinc orthophosphate treated systems respectively these effects are consistent with previous reports that in galvanic systems sodium silicate performs poorly in comparison with orthophosphate kogo et al 2017 woszczynski et al 2015 3 2 galvanic corrosion and lead release while sodium silicate was ineffective relative to orthophosphate in controlling lead release due to galvanic corrosion orthophosphate did not inhibit charge transfer between copper and lead fig 3 instead it appeared to promote scale formation in the presence of sodium silicate each additional µa of current accompanied 94 µg pb l fig 3 r2 0 89 in the presence of either orthophosphate or zinc orthophosphate each additional µa accompanied much less between 7 4 and 8 7 µg pb l fig 3 moreover the relationship between galvanic current and lead release in the presence of orthophosphate was generally weak with r2 ranging from 0 16 0 20 these findings are consistent with previous work describing immobilization in scale of lead released due to galvanic corrosion cartier et al 2012 kogo et al 2017 nguyen et al 2010 triantafyllidou and edwards 2011 zhou et al 2015 the failure of sodium silicate compared with orthophosphate to immobilize lead is discussed mechanistically below see section 3 4 dispersion of colloidal metals by sodium silicate and section 3 5 scale morphology structure and elemental composition 3 3 role of iron release in the presence of sodium silicate lsls supplied by unlined iron released much more lead than those supplied by pvc with a median difference of 358 µg l over the experiment given the strong prior evidence that iron is a driver for lead release camara et al 2013 deshommes et al 2010 masters and edwards 2015 trueman and gagnon 2016a trueman et al 2017b we modeled observed lead mass loss as a smooth non parametric function of iron concentration where the relationship between the two variables was dictated by the data not by a user selected parameter table 1 fig 4 and figure s5 the relationship between iron and lead was statistically significant p 0 001 suggesting that iron particles represent a significant mobile sink for lead the other experimental factors lsl type and inhibitor were incorporated into the model as parametric effects partial lsls released an estimated 101 9 more lead per unit length of lead pipe than full lsls p 0 001 which is consistent with previous data cartier et al 2012 doré et al 2019 hu et al 2012 and the differences between lead release from full and parial lsls summarized above see section 3 1 effect of sodium silicate on lead release from lsls the additive model as described in equation 1 2 and in the supporting information explained 84 4 r2 of the variation in lead release relative to orthophosphate sodium silicate accompanied 697 0 more lead release p 0 001 which is also consistent with the differences summarized above zinc orthophosphate treatment resulted in 34 3 more lead p 0 004 fig 4 table 1 and while this difference is not apparent in fig 2 the model controls for the positive effect of iron but the figure does not iron was higher in cast iron effluent treated with non zinc orthophosphate and excluding lsls supplied by cast iron zinc orthophosphate treatment resulted in a median of 23 µg l more lead release than orthophosphate treatment 3 4 dispersion of colloidal metals by sodium silicate while the additive model describes variation in lead release as a function of inhibitor type it does not account for variation in the dose of sodium silicate except implicitly through covariation in iron concentrations when the silicate dose was doubled from 24 to 48 mg sio2 in the final twelve weeks of the study figs 1b and s1d lead and iron increased dramatically fig 5 this cannot be explained by effluent ph which was held constant throughout the experiment at 24 mg sio2 l lead levels in full lsl effluent were relatively stable with median values of 589 and 297 µg l in cast iron and pvc systems respectively fig 5a at 48 mg l median lead in full lsl effluent increased to 1234 and 425 µg l and partial lsl effluent exhibited a similar trend figures s3 with the increase in silicate dose median iron increased from 18 to 130 and 7 to 37 µg l in cast iron and pvc distribution main effluent that is in the influent to lsl sections figs 5b and s4 similar observations have been reported elsewhere schock et al 2005 in hopkinton ma silicate addition 25 55 mg sio2 l without ph control accompanied an increase in iron although seasonality and variable well use may have been factors in this case silicate treatment also accompanied a temporary increase in lead schock et al 2005 here increases in iron and lead are likely due at least in part to colloidal dispersion of metals originating either from corrosion scale or from iron deposits on pvc the dispersive properties of sodium silicate have been highlighted in previous work where silicate has been linked with formation of colloidal polymeric ferric iron browman et al 1989 and dose dependent dispersion of particulate colloidal iron li et al 2019 the negative surface charge imparted to iron oxide particles by sodium silicate kinsela et al 2016 li et al 2019 may play an important role in the elevated iron observed here and silicate s negative effect on the rate of ferrous iron oxidation may also be relevant jones et al 2014 kinsela et al 2016 the dispersive effects of sodium silicate on iron and lead are apparent in the fractograms representing the dissolved 0 45 µm fraction of full and partial lsl effluent figs 6 and s6 respectively these element specific size distributions show a substantial concentration of colloids in the presence of 48 mg sio2 l and a negligible concentration in the presence of zinc orthophosphate colloidal iron was much greater in lsls supplied by cast iron compared with pvc which is consistent with the higher levels of iron observed in cast iron pipe effluent fig 6 the elevated lead levels in lsls supplied by cast iron are probably explained by partitioning of lead to colloidal iron which provides additional capacity beyond the limits of equilibrium solubility for water to transport lead gora et al 2020 trueman et al 2019a trueman and gagnon 2016b silicate addition may also disperse lead from lsl corrosion scale directly but further study is needed to explore this possibility a similar effect has been observed in the presence of excess orthophosphate or natural organic matter species which also disperse particulate lead by imparting a negative surface charge korshin and liu 2019 zhao et al 2018 colloidal iron and lead occurred in lsls supplied by pvc as well albeit in a smaller size range in the cast iron system maximum colloid retention occurred at approximately 1 mda whereas in the pvc system it was closer to 100 kda the size distribution of uv254 absorbance tracked those of iron and lead closely this is may be due to colloids scattering light latimer and pyle 1972 but it may also represent absorbing species including natural organic matter colloids in lsl effluent also contained copper due to low levels in source water or the copper pipe in partial lsls figure s6 manganese present at low levels in source water and aluminum due to alum coagulation these metals have also been reported to co occur with lead in previous work knowles et al 2015 pan et al 2019 schock et al 2014 trueman et al 2019b 3 5 scale morphology structure and elemental composition lsl corrosion scale formed in the presence of sodium silicate yielded an x ray diffraction pattern dominated by hydrocerussite pb3 co3 2 oh 2 fig 7 a massicot β pbo litharge α pbo and metallic lead pb were present as minor phases consistent with the diffraction data corrosion scale in this system exhibited a platy crystalline morphology typical of hydrocerussite godelitsas et al 2003 korshin et al 2005 lower et al 1998 quartz sio2 was also identified by xrd but crystalline lead silicate solids e g pbsio3 were not these findings are consistent with model predictions that a lead carbonate phase will dominate under the experimental conditions regardless of the influence of silicate schock et al 1996 weaver 1994 in the presence of orthophosphate with or without zinc hyroxylpyromorphite pb5 po4 3 oh was the dominant crystalline phase fig 7b c accordingly scale exposed to orthophosphate exhibited a clustered needle like morphology characteristic of hydroxylpyromorphite kwaśniak kominek et al 2017 lower et al 1998 quartz litharge cerussite pbco3 and metallic lead were identified as minor phases by xrd sodium silicate did result in corrosion scale with greater silicon content 3 4 0 1 wt by eds than orthophosphate with or without zinc figs 8 and s7 lead was also relatively abundant 16 3 0 9 wt by eds in the silicate treated system while calcium chlorine iron and manganese were more abundant in the presence of orthophosphate and zinc orthophosphate these findings are consistent with the strong dispersive action of sodium silicate figs 5 and 6 that is colloidal dispersion by sodium silicate may have prevented these elements from accumulating on the surface of lead pipes resulting in higher levels of suspended colloidal metals in the water phase 3 6 xps analysis of lsl surface chemistry while silicate did not alter scale in any way that would clearly diminish lead release the methods we employed xrd sem eds provide information up to a depth of several micrometers krost and bläsing 2009 onoue and tsuji 2013 rades et al 2014 however a nanometer thick silica coating has been proposed as a possible mechanism for corrosion control due to silicate in previous studies scheetz et al 1997 thompson et al 1997 since such a coating would be difficult to detect via xrd and sem eds scheetz et al 1997 we used xps to characterize the scale water interface to a depth of several nanometers hajati et al 2008 scheetz et al 1997 tougaard 1996 sodium silicate did promote formation of a thin silicon rich layer at the surface the silicon lead ratio of atomic percentages was 42 6 0 6 and 3 3 in the silicate orthophosphate and zinc orthophosphate treated systems according to the xps survey scan consistent with sem eds results fig 8b silicon si 2p occurred in all systems due either to naturally occurring or added silicate fig 9 d the pb 4f intensity was relatively low in the presence of sodium silicate fig 9a and carbonate 289 ev was not detected at the scale surface the c 1s peak occurred instead at 285 0 ev this peak is attributable to adventitious carbon from air exposure and was used to calibrate the other binding energies fig 9b greczynski and hultman 2017 as expected phosphorus was not detected in scale exposed to added sodium silicate whereas in the presence of orthophosphate it was relatively abundant fig 9c p 2s given the complex environment at the scale water interface there are many possible sources of oxygen e g metal oxides hydroxides or carbonate in the presence of sodium silicate the o 1s photoline occurred at 532 4 ev previous work suggests that o 1s due to metal oxides and hydroxides occurs between 530 9 and 531 5 ev dupin et al 2000 while the non bridging oxygen of silica compounds occurs at higher binding energies e g o 1s due to sio2 533 1 533 3 ev guittet et al 2001 hochella jr and brown jr 1988 thus non bridging oxygen e g silica tetrahedra appears to be relatively abundant in the sodium silicate treated system in the presence of orthophosphate the o 1s peak occurred at a lower binding energy 531 5 ev fig 9e o1s which may be due to the oxygen in phosphate and hydroxide from hydroxyprymorphite reported elsewhere at 531 3 ev mallet et al 2013 together the identification of lead carbonate hydrocerussite by xrd as the dominant phase the weak lead pb 4f signal the weak carbonate signal c 1s at 289 ev the strong silica signal si 2p and the high o 1s binding energy suggest that the lead carbonate surface was covered by a thin silicate rich layer this agrees with previous results scheetz et al 1997 but we found no evidence that the nanometer thick coating inhibited lead release especially compared to orthophosphate treatment 3 7 implications for corrosion control this study eliminated the effect of ph that has confounded several previous studies on silicate corrosion control and while silicate treatment might have reduced lead release relative to an inhibitor free system it fared poorly against even a moderate dose of orthophosphate providing relatively little protection against either uniform or galvanic corrosion nevertheless the benefit of sodium silicate as a ph control additive may be important at low to moderate dic an increase in ph predicts a significant decrease in lead carbonate solubility schock et al 1996 figure s8 it is also possible that this study was not long enough to capture the benefits of silicate treatment here the model system was operated for 500 days at a low to moderate silicate dose 12 or 24 mg sio2 l and 90 days at a high dose 48 mg sio2 l this time frame may not capture slow processes that eventually exert significant effects but if the time to achieve the benefits of silicate addition is long relative to orthophosphate silicate treatment is inherently less useful and regardless of the potential long term benefits the short term impacts identified here need to be carefully evaluated when silicate treatment is initiated chief among them is the potential for sodium silicate to disperse metal rich colloids in this study high levels of sodium silicate dispersed colloidal lead and iron increasing the concentrations of these metals considerably dispersion may be especially important in lsls supplied by iron distribution mains and these lsls are already at high risk for elevated lead release camara et al 2013 trueman and gagnon 2016a trueman et al 2017a moreover point of use filters may be poorly suited to removing highly dispersed colloidal lead lytle et al 2020 viglione 2019 although this might be less of an issue in systems with high hardness robinson et al 1987 4 conclusions despite decades of use significant knowledge gaps concerning sodium silicates remain especially in the context of corrosion control we compared sodium silicate with orthophosphate at a constant ph and our results suggest the following 1 relative to orthophosphate sodium silicate did not control lead release due to either uniform full lsl or galvanic partial lsl corrosion hydrocerussite a lead carbonate dominated corrosion scale in the presence of sodium silicate although a thin nm silicon rich coating did occur at the scale water interface 2 sodium silicate dispersed colloidal iron and lead highlighting a significant risk when silicate is used as a drinking water additive water systems with unlined iron or lead pipe should exercise particular care in dosing sodium silicate 3 corrosion inhibition due to direct lead silicate interactions appears unlikely but investigating the impact of silicate on recovered lead pipes with a complex multi layered corrosion scale may still be valuable future work should focus on silicate based diffusion barriers that might form due to interaction with non lead species e g aluminosilicate quartz and other silicate minerals declaration of competing interest we wish to draw the attention of the editor to the following facts which may be
