call for clean and renewable alternative energy sources chu and majumdar 2012 panwar et al 2011 among these renewable energy sources osmotic energy is an emerging green power with a global potential of approximately 2 tw logan and elimelech 2012 osmotic energy derives from the salt concentration difference between two aqueous solutions of different salinities such as that between river water and seawater for this reason it is also commonly known as salinity gradient power sgp panwar et al 2011 post et al 2007 a variety of technologies such as pressure retarded osmosis pro achilli et al 2009 loeb et al 1976 tiraferri et al 2011 reverse electrodialysis red mei and tang 2018 post et al 2010 and capacitive mixing capmix rica et al 2013 have been actively developed in recent years in spite of its existing controversy in practical application potential for seawater river system straub et al 2016 yip and elimelech 2014 pro has been preliminarily confirmed to have a strong ability of extracting sustainable energy from a variety of salinity gradients with highly attractive power densities and significantly mitigated membrane fouling especially in some bench scale pro hybrid experiments using reverse osmosis ro or membrane distillation md engineered hypersaline wastewater di water system thorsen and holt 2009 pro can be considered as the reverse process of reverse osmosis ro she et al 2016a according to the applied hydraulic pressure difference δ p and effective osmosis pressure difference δπ eff across the semi permeable membrane membrane processes could be divided into reverse osmosis ro δπ eff δ p pressure retarded osmosis pro 0 δ p δπ eff forward osmosis fo δ p 0 and pressure assisted osmosis pao δ p 0 fig 1 also see she et al 2016a in ro and pao hydraulic pressure is relied on to push water through the membrane and thereby mechanical energy is consumed fo does not consume mechanical energy due to its lack of hydraulic pressure in contrast power generation can be achieved in pro as water permeates against the pressure gradient from the low salinity feed solution into the pressurized high salinity draw solution this pressurized water can be utilized to generate electricity e g by using it to drive a turbine see fig 2 and logan and elimelech 2012 one of the most critical components in pro is the semi permeable membrane that largely determines the power density of the pro process and thus its commercial viability hickenbottom et al 2016 madsen et al 2017 maisonneuve et al 2016 various pro membranes with precisely tuned structures and morphologies as well as novel materials have been the research focuses in the field of pro in recent ten years fig 3 which prompt us to critically evaluate the recent progress in pro membranes and materials in spite of annually published two or three review papers on pro topic in recent years fig 3a achilli and childress 2010 helfer et al 2014 klaysom et al 2013 they often focus on the process aspects draw solution and applications with pro membranes not mentioned or only briefly summarized for example helfer et al provided a brief overview of membrane materials in one of the sections of their 2014 review helfer et al 2014 similarly the development of pro membranes as one of the concerned topics is briefly reviewed by alsvik et al in 2013 alsvik and hägg 2013 and han et al in 2015 han et al 2015a recently straub et al reviewed the potential and ultimate viability of three systems of pro process such as controllable mixing where rivers meet the sea high concentration gradients available from hypersaline solutions and hybrid pro incorporated into ro desalination plants to reduce electricity requirements straub et al 2016 due to the lack of comprehensive reviews on the latest development in pro membranes particular in last five years this review attempts to summarize recent development performance breakthroughs key performance limiting challenges design principles and fabrication modification methods of pro membranes this review starts with a brief historical development of pro highlighting the important milestones with respect to theory materials processes and engineering applications the critical performance indicators of pro membranes including water flux and power density are briefly summarized then the performance limiting factors of hindering practical applications are discussed in details including concentration polarization reverse solute diffusion membrane fouling and mechanical stability design rationales fabrication and modification techniques are systematically provided to show how to reasonably fabricate and modify pro membranes to obtain high performance and to fully address these performance limiting factors finally future development needs and perspectives are also highlighted 2 historical development of pro this section provides a brief overview of the critical milestones of pro technology with particular emphasis on the development and engineering application of pro membranes see fig 4 gerstandt et al 2008 the osmosis phenomenon was discovered nearly 300 years ago but the concept of pro was introduced until 1975 by loeb et al 1975 for the first time they demonstrated the feasibility of pro process for power generation with a u shaped hollow fiber cellulose acetate ca membrane however the water permeability was much lower than expected due to internal concentration polarization icp which is a major issue for extensive applications cadotte et al 1981 mehta and loeb 1978 subsequent pro studies were carried out based on ro membranes which also exhibited poor water flux and power density due to the thick substrates thus causing severe icp thorsen and holt 2009 for this reason the development of pro technique had been hampered until late 2000s statkraft norwegian constructed the first pro plant porotype in norway 2009 which proved the applicability of pro for energy generation in addition several pilot scale pro hybrid research projects such as mega ton project japan and global mvp project korea have also been acknowledged the feasibility of the hybrid processes to recovery energy from ro brine and wastewater effluent system kurihara and hanakawa 2013 skilhagen et al 2008 though statkraft announced to halt osmotic power investments in 2013 a more recent water desalination report demonstrated the potential of improving the cost effective saltpower plant with a co2 neutral heat supply by working with higher salinity gradients than statkraft the test showed 10 to 20 kw of electricity depending on the salinities of the waters with toyobo s hollow fine fiber cta membrane that could be operated at a pressure of up to about 70 bars pankratz 2020 cellulose based fo membranes with reduced icp were developed by hydration technologies inc hti albany or due to the thinner and more hydrophilic cellulosic substrates unfortunately these cellulose based fo membranes could not withstand high pressure in pro process nevertheless all these existing issues promoted us to explore ideal pro membranes with novel materials and specially designed structures in recent years the thin film composite tfc fo membranes have become more popular due to their advantages such as structurally adjustable support layer and simple fabrication process for both support and active layers yip et al 2010 as reported by statkraft it is suggested that the applied pressure may increase up to 13 5 bar thus meeting the commercial basis 5 w m 2 however the weak mechanical strength of tfc fo membranes inevitably resulted in compaction and deformation problems under high pressure in pro process compared to flat sheet membranes tfc pro hollow fiber membranes exhibit superior mechanical strength and higher water flux chou et al 2012 ma et al 2012 wang et al 2012 more recently thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes have attracted great increase of interest with competitive superiorities such as excellent separation performance and easy scaling up while the concept of tfn was originally developed in the context of ro membranes jeong et al 2007 it has been increasingly used in fo and pro membranes to achieve higher water permeability and or reduced structural parameter amini et al 2013 lau et al 2015 in addition the incorporation of novel materials such as graphene oxide go carbon nanotubes cnts and metal organic frameworks mofs into selectively active layer also greatly enhances pro membrane permeability and mechanical strength while maintaining its good integrity amini et al 2013 dixon and kim hak 2015 ma et al 2017 song et al 2013 for example tian et al fabricated a novel tfn membrane consisting of an ultrathin pa layer on the reinforced pei support with functionalized carbon nanotubes f cnts the obtained membrane performed an excellent mechanical strength with stable power density 17 3 w m 2 at 16 9 bar tian et al 2015 3 critical performance indicators for evaluating pro membranes the most important performance indicators of pro include water flux and power density water flux is one of the most important parameters in pro for a semi permeable membrane that is permeable to water but completely rejects solutes its ideal water flux jw l m 2 h 1 in the absence of concentration polarization is proportional to driving force i e the difference between the effective transmembrane osmotic pressure δ π eff bar and the transmembrane hydraulic pressure δ p bar 1 j w a δ π e f f δ p where a m s 1 pa 1 is the water permeability coefficient of the pro membrane in reality the water flux of a real pro membrane is also affected by concentration polarization as well as the permeability of solutes through the membrane both of which tend to reduce the actual available water flux lee et al 1981 2 j w a π d m 1 c f b c d m exp j w k 1 b j w exp j w k 1 δ p where π d m bar is the osmotic pressure difference between draw solution and membrane b m s 1 is the solute permeability coefficient cf b g l 1 is the salt concentration of the bulk feed solution and cd m g l 1 is the salt concentration of the draw solution at the membrane surface the solute resistivity for diffusion within the porous support layer k s m 1 is defined by 3 k t τ d ε where t m τ and ε are the thickness tortuosity and porosity of the support layer respectively k can be used to determine the influence of internal concentration polarization power density w is another critical parameter that largely determines the commercial viability of pro process while early types of pro membranes often have low power density of 1 w m 2 a much higher power density 5 w m 2 is required to make pro commercially attractive lee et al 1981 by neglecting the losses in energy conversion and pumping the gross power density is giver by 4 w j w δ p under ideal conditions without the presence of concentration polarization the maximum power density can be obtained of δp 0 5δπm fig 1c nevertheless for a membrane subject to severe concentration polarization or mechanical deformation the optional pressure can differ significantly from 0 5δπm water permeability coefficient a and solute permeability coefficient b m s 1 are usually used to characterize the separation properties of the active layer of a pro membrane while icp in a support layer is reflected by structure parameter s μm which is dependent on the support layer thickness ts tortuosity τ and porosity ε 5 s t s τ ε decreasing membrane thickness and tortuosity and increasing porosity all facilitate diffusion of solutes across the support layer and into the bulk solution thereby reducing icp akther et al 2015 kim et al 2015 lee and kim 2016 in general high membrane water permeability coefficient a reduces the frictional resistance of water through the membrane active layer and thereby favors a higher power density tiraferri et al 2011 low b and small s values are also required to mitigate the negative effects of reverse solute diffusion and internal concentration polarization thorsen and holt 2009 tiraferri et al 2011 meanwhile antifouling pro membranes are needed to avoid severe loss of water flux power density and membrane integrity over time the various performance limiting factors will be further discussed in section 4 icp in section 4 1 4 performance limiting factors for pro membranes pro membranes suffer from some key challenges that severely prevent the feasibility of wide practical applications and hinder their commercialization due to performance limiting factors including icp reverse solute diffusion membrane fouling and mechanical stability strategies for overcoming these critical issues to achieve higher power density are further presented in section 5 where novel materials and fabrication modification methods are reviewed for rational design of high performance substrates and active layers 4 1 internal concentration polarization icp concentration polarization cp can severely limit pro performance and thus is a major obstacle for large scale pro applications cp refers to the concentration gradients near the membrane solution interface as a result of the selective transport of solutes through a membrane in the context of osmotically driven membrane processes cp can be further classified as icp that occurs within the membrane substrate and external concentration polarization ecp that occurs in the feed and draw solutions i e concentrative ecp and dilutive ecp respectively both icp and ecp reduce the available osmosis driving force across the membrane active layer resulting in decreased water flux and power density qin et al 2010 xu et al 2017 zhao and zou 2011 nevertheless it is commonly agreed that icp plays a more dominating role over ecp in limiting the flux and power performance of pro membranes klaysom et al 2013 for pro application a mode of active layer facing to draw solution al ds is most often employed where more challenging concentrative icp occurs within a support layer resulting in severe performance degradation mccutcheon and elimelech 2007 mccutcheon et al 2006 in some of the early studies that use commercial ro membranes in pro processes low water fluxes of or 1 l m 2 h 1 are often reported which is largely ascribed to the occurrence of severe concentrative icp in their relative thick and tortuous support layers the key to reduce concentrative icp is to reduce the structural parameter s by designing membrane substrates with high porosity low thickness low tortuosity and excellent hydrophilicity rahimpour and madaeni 2007 yaroshchuk 2015 recently increased substrate hydrophilicity has also been shown to mitigate concentrative icp due to enhanced connectivity of water pathways in substrates i e the avoidance of air pockets that prevent effective diffusion of solutes emadzadeh et al 2014 liu et al 2016b puguan et al 2014 the detailed design and fabrication of pro membrane substrates are presented in section 5 3 1 inherently icp is affected by solute diffusivity and substrate properties for pro process in addition unfavorable occurrence of reverse solute diffusion further accelerates the negative effect of icp resulting in the lowering of driving force and consequently membrane performance such as flux she et al 2016a the negative effects of reverse solute diffusion are further discussed in section 4 2 in addition to its direct effect on water flux and power density icp can also affect pro performance directly by promoting more severe fouling in pro applications the porous substrate is exposed to the feed solution the icp of foulants and foulant precursors in the substrates can cause greatly accelerated fouling for example zhang et al reported a complete loss of water flux due to icp induced gypsum scaling in the substrate zhang et al 2014a 4 2 reverse solute diffusion rsd membrane selectivity plays a critical role in determining the power performance of pro process a pro membrane with relatively low retention i e high b value can cause severe leakage of draw solutes into the feed water a phenomenon known as reverse solute diffusion in general reverse solute diffusion results in the loss of draw solutes and leads to more serious icp which consequently decreases pro water flux and power density she et al 2012 touati and tadeo 2016 at the module and plant levels the leaked draw solutes accumulate in the feed water causing increased salinity and osmotic pressure in the feed solution xiao et al 2012 xiao et al 2011 furthermore the leakage of fouling precursors such as ca2 mg2 so4 2 etc from the draw solution into the feed may promote severe membrane fouling e g by forming organic ca2 mg2 bridging caso4 scaling etc she et al 2016a zhang et al 2014a although replenishment of draw solutes is generally not required for typical pro applications using seawater or brine as draw solution it can impose significant additional cost for some close looped pro processes such as pro based osmotic heat engines in the latter case the cost of draw solutes replenishment is governed by the ratio of reverse solute diffusion over the water flux js jw han et al 2015b loeb 1998 reverse solute diffusion occurs with water permeation simultaneously the js jw ratio is closely related with the selectivity of the membrane active layer according to classical solution diffusion theory this ratio is given by 6 j s j w b a β r g t 1 a δ p j w where β is the van t hoff coefficient and is a constant if the concentration and osmotic pressure of the solution follow a linear relationship rg 0 083145 l bar mol 1 k 1 is the universal gas constant and t k is absolute temperature the positive js jw m indicates the direction of solute diffusion is opposite to that of water permeation in reality the selectivity parameter b a can be significantly affected by the applied pressure a subject that will be further discussed in section 4 3 4 3 membrane fouling compared to ro and fo pro tends to have much more severe membrane fouling and requires more frequent cleaning and more intensive maintenance she et al 2012 yip and elimelech 2013 therefore fouling control is one of the most important aspects in pro operation in some cases where di water without any foulants is used as feed solution no membrane fouling occurs as expected enabling much higher power densities in contrast for foulant containing feed solutions severe membrane fouling would be a more challenging issue that foulants can easily enter porous substrates but are subsequently retained by active later consequently causing severe internal pore blocking and external fouling foulants can easily enter the substrate but are subsequently retained by the active later causing internal severe pore blocking in addition to the development of external fouling han et al 2016b for example yip et al demonstrated the impact of organic fouling on power generation and their results showed that fouling of porous substrate nearly halved the water flux yip and elimelech 2013 furthermore the accumulation of foulant precursors in the porous layer can result in elevated concentrations for example icp of ca2 inside the substrate can potentially promote organic fouling biofouling as well as inorganic scaling zhang et al reported an extreme case of complete loss of flux due to severe pro scaling by caso4 indeed even when the feed water contains little or no ca2 or so4 2 the reverse diffusion of these solutes and or their icp inside the porous substrate can still lead to severe gypsum scaling zhang et al 2014a icp of feed and draw solutes can also lead to increased salt concentration inside the substrate which may weaken the electrostatic repulsion between colloidal particles and promote their aggregation kim et al 2016a in general pro fouling can be mitigated by improved membrane structure and materials properties optimized operational conditions and effective pretreatment and cleaning strategies for example han et al combined feed pretreatment by utilizing the anti foulants such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp and alkaline cleaning methods to maintain high water flux and power density over several operation cycles in pro process han et al 2016b pro fouling can also be moderated by using reduced water flux and proper control of solution chemistry for example wang et al demonstrated effective reduction of silica scaling by ph adjustment in the feed and or draw solutions e g ph wang et al 2017 aside from the optimization of operational conditions pretreatment and cleaning proper design of membrane structure and tuning membrane physiochemical properties can effectively mitigate pro fouling detailed discussion on membrane design and fabrication can be found in section 5 4 4 mechanical stability in pro process a hydraulic pressure is applied to the draw solution side to achieve optimum power density this pressure is typically on the same order of half of the osmotic pressure of the draw solution e g 10 bar when seawater is used therefore compared to fo process that involved no or little hydraulic pressure mechanical stability is a key consideration for pro process the membrane stability is further complicated by the membrane configuration for flat fleet pro membranes spacers are used in the feed channels the wide unsupported span can cause severe deformation of membranes resulting in loss of rejection she et al 2012 the common mechanical failure issue in lab environment has been also similarly observed at pilot scale in some recent reports where much poorer performance was shown than expected using commercial spiral wound modules due to deformation of the membranes and spacer filled channels inside the modules im et al 2018 kim et al 2017 kook et al 2018 lee et al 2017 lee et al demonstrated the viability of mitigating membrane deformation via a combined configuration with feed spacer on tricot spacer thus obtaining lower selectivity loss and channel pressure drop under pressurization lee et al 2020 in contrast hollow fiber pro membranes are self supported and do not require the use of spacer nevertheless draw solution is often circulated in the lumen side of hollow fibers and the high applied pressure can cause the burst of the fibers chen et al 2016 further discussion on membrane configuration can be found in section 5 2 unsatisfactory mechanical stability of pro membranes can lead to structural deformation and ever destruction under high pressure operation li et al 2015b furthermore deformation of active layer is detrimental to membrane selectivity resulting in more severe reverse solute diffusion section 4 2 and often more severe membrane fouling section 4 3 these factors may severely hinder the large scale development of pro technology the development of pro membranes with desired mechanical strength is thus a high research priority in addition pro membranes with high strength offer greater room for the optimization of power density for example for highly permeable pro membranes the optimal pressure could be 0 5 δπm at higher applied pressure both icp and fouling can be reduced due to the lower water flux leading to more stable pro operation she et al 2012 in general the mechanical stability of a pro membrane is determined by its structure e g thickness and pore structure in addition to the inherent strength of membrane material membranes with lower porosity and greater thickness can provide improved mechanical stability yet often at the expense of increased structural parameter s and more severe icp sections 3 and 4 1 in the case of hollow fiber membranes smaller fiber diameter can result in greater mechanical stability but at the same time greater hydraulic resistance and pressure drop in the lumen side these trade off relationships need to be carefully considered for membrane optimization although some breakthroughs have been made in development of pro membranes there is still a wide gap existing in high performance membrane between experimental researches and actual applications for example the produced net energy of pro membranes rapidly drops to only slightly above or even below the economically viable value for long term practical operation due to icp effects membrane deformation and membrane fouling thus it is important to continue studying the emerging advanced strategies on how to improve water flux to overcome its limitations through rationally designing and fabricating high performance pro membranes 5 rational design of pro membranes with enhanced performances based on the above discussion rational structure design fabrication and modification of pro membranes is very important in order to achieve high key performance to overcome key practical challenges in this section more detailed discussions will be made about what kinds of structures and materials substrate and active layer are more suitable for development of high performance pro membranes based on design principle as well as fabrication and modification techniques 5 1 membrane design rationales membrane design by systemically considering materials structures and configurations is important to achieve excellent performance by employing advanced fabrication and modification techniques one of the most critical consideration is the choice of substrate due to its critical influence on icp mechanical stability and fouling achieving a low s value requires substrates with small thickness high porosity and or low tortuosity of the substrate however conventional finger like pore structure often adopted for fo membranes is not suitable due to its weak mechanical stability this type of pore structure usually results in severe membrane deformation and destruction fig 5 a in contrast substrates with sponge like structure and smaller pore size provide better mechanical strength fig 5b a more extreme case is the commercial toyobo pro membrane that adopts a dense structure for the entire membrane to withstand high pressure operation whereas its thin membrane thickness mitigates icp in addition to pore structure hydrophilicity of substrates is important to reduce icp and fouling propensity of pro membranes in view of the critical trade off relationship between icp and mechanical strength novel substrates formed by high strength metal or ceramic based materials could have potential advantages for the simultaneous enhancement in pro power density and mechanical stability chen et al 2020 dong et al 2007 dong et al 2008 fu et al 2019 li et al 2015a liu et al 2016a lü et al 2014 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 these hydrophilic substrates are also expected to impart better antifouling performance similarly incorporating nanomaterials into the substrate can potentially mitigate icp reduce membrane fouling and improve mechanical stability simultaneously lu et al 2020 son et al 2016 improving pro power performance also requires the use of rejection layers with high water permeability a value and high selectivity a b value high selectivity of the active layer can mitigate reverse solute diffusion thus reduce icp and membrane fouling yang et al 2018 at the same time membrane water permeability is essential in determining the pro water flux and thus power density in this respect there is great rooms for advanced membrane fabrication methods for example thin film nanocomposite membranes incorporating nano materials such as go mof and cnts or including an interlayer material can potentially offer simultaneously improved membrane water permeance and selectivity yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 5 2 membrane configurations with the rapid development of advanced techniques for water treatment and energy extraction applications researchers have been trying to design and prepare pro membranes with enhanced properties and performance generally two common configurations can be classified including flat sheet and hollow fiber membranes see table 1 the details are presented as follows in the early stage of fo development commercial flat sheet ro membranes were employed however severe icp caused the unsatisfactory salt rejection and water flux due to the membrane structure with the subsequent progress of fo membranes moderate enhancement of water flux was obtained as a result of relatively thin substrates of flat sheet cellulose triacetate cta membranes developed by hti albany or achilli et al 2009 akther et al 2015 kim et al reported the membrane performance of hti flat sheet cta membrane for the 2m nacl feed solution and 0 5m nacl draw solution scheme obtaining the water flux of 13 9 l m 2 h 1 and power density of 4 7 w m 2 at the hydraulic pressure of 12 5 bar kim and elimelech 2013 since 2010 flat sheet tfc membranes have achieved superior performance in permeability and power density than cta membranes straub et al investigated the pro performance of hti flat sheet tfc membrane for concentrate 3m nacl draw solution with a high power density of 60 w m 2 at hydraulic pressure of 48 bar straub et al 2014b however flat sheet membranes often need a feed channel spacer to maintain the feed channel geometry in pro process where the spacers inevitably lead to the energy loss of hydraulic pressure and pro membrane deformation under high pressure she et al observed that membrane deformation caused the severe reverse solute diffusion when using commercial cta flat sheet membranes under higher hydraulic pressure subsequently an unfavorable rsd enhanced icp resulted in the decrease of water flux and power density she et al 2012 similarly kim et al observed a dramatic deviation between actual water flux and the predicted values when using commercial flat sheet membranes at high hydraulic pressure kim and elimelech 2012 nevertheless feed spacers at high pressure induced the deformation and blocked the membrane area for water permeation and the phenomenon was referred to shadow effect which drastically increased the solute permeability coefficient overall careful design and employment of suitable spacers is quite critical to develop effective flat sheet pro membrane modules for further practical scaling up applications due to its proneness to mechanical damage and low packing density flat sheet configuration is no longer considered to take priority for pro process by comparison hollow fiber pro membranes offer high membrane surface area per volume and no shadow effects with self support structure cheng et al 2016 zhang et al 2014b tables 2 and table 3 summarize these key parameters for flat sheet and hollow fiber pro membranes respectively as shown in fig 6 hollow fiber composite pro membranes with thin and highly porous but mechanically stronger substrates could achieve the higher power density while withstanding the high operation pressure indicating the tremendous potential for practical pro process kurihara et al prepared a 10 inch hollow fiber membrane module in a prototype pro plant obtaining the maximum power density of 13 5 w m 2 kurihara et al 2016 similar to fabricating tfc flat sheet membrane tfc hollow fiber membranes have been successfully synthesized on porous support by interfacial polymerization ip method pa selective layer could be formed on either inner or outer side or both inner and outer sides of porous support layer fu et al 2015 2013 zhao et al 2012 the outer selective pro hollow fiber membrane with the best performance can withstand hydraulic pressures up to 22 bar and achieve a maximum power density of 10 05 w m 2 using 1 m nacl and deionized water as draw solution and feed solution respectively cheng et al 2017 compared with inner selective pro membrane however many studies have reported the superior advantages of outer selective pro hollow fiber membrane due to the higher membrane area easier cleaning and less pressure drop sun and chung 2013 but a major problem of outer selective pro hollow fiber membrane is the multiple and complicated fabrication processes compared to the inner selective counterparts due to its proneness of defect formation during ip process 5 3 performance improved strategies 5 3 1 substrate layer with reduced icp generally pro substrate materials mainly consist of polysulfone psf polyethersulfone resin pes polyacrylonitrile pan polyamide imine pai polyetherimide pei and polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp among them pes and pan can fully meet the pressure capacity requirements of pro membranes with advantages of low cost good mechanical thermal and chemical stability tsai et al 2005 psf and pes are the most widely used substrate materials for tfc membranes due to several advantages such as wide temperature resistant range excellent acid and alkali resistance and fairly good chlorine resistance however in the osmotically driven membrane process the hydrophilicity of psf and pes substrates is not so satisfactory which results in nonsufficient wetting of support layers thus increasing icp and reducing water flux geise et al 2014 tiraferri et al 2011 over the past decade some other novel substrates have been emerging li et al developed a series of tfc pa membranes with p84 co polyimide support and subsequently tested the membrane performance such as water flux power density and mechanical strength under various conditions the inter selective membrane achieved excellent properties in both mechanical property tensile strength up to 5 mpa and power density up to 12 w m 2 at 21 bar using water and 1 m nacl as feed solution and draw solution respectively li and chung 2014 han et al fabricated a novel tfc membrane using superhydrophilic sulfonatedpolyphenylenesulfone sppsu as substrate material comparing to commercial tfc membrane the obtained membrane exhibited approximately 2 times higher water flux indicating less icp effect existed within the superhydrophilic substrate han et al 2016a it is well known that a low substrate structure parameter is favorable to reduce icp effect consequently the substrates should be rationally designed to facilitate solute diffusion with low tortuosity high porosity and low thickness su and chung 2011 tiraferri et al 2011 to date although some asymmetric membranes were shown to exhibit a high performance thin film composite tfc membranes have exhibited a lot of advantages such as lower fabrication costs and higher stability regardless of the feed quality and composition non solvent induced phase separation nips method is widely used to prepare an asymmetric membrane comprised of a dense top layer and porous substrate however the dense top layer may lead to a severe icp as a result of high mass transport resistance lin et al 2006 liu and ng 2014 though subsequent studies have reported some multi layer structured membranes with a less flux decline and better pressure tolerance it is difficult to simultaneously control the morphology of active layer and substrate via phase inversion method fu et al 2015 su et al fabricated the double skinned ca hollow fiber membranes by phase inversion method the prepared membranes achieved a high water flux up to 17 1 l m 2 h 1 using 2 m mgcl2 draw solution and di water feed solution however the results showed a high reverse solute flux which could lead to unsatisfactory membrane fouling su et al 2010 a recent study investigated the performance of ca based hollow fiber membranes prepared by thermally assisted nips method t nip for pro process compared to conventional nips based substrates the obtained membranes showed thinner selective skin layer higher porosity and higher mechanical strength in addition the higher power density of 5 5 w m 2 was achieved at 16 bar compared to conventional ca membranes cho et al 2019 recently different strategies have been explored to develop more suitable substrates to reduce icp extent for tfc fo membranes fu et al 2013 han et al 2013a xiao et al developed a sacrificial pei layer approach to prepare psf support via co casting method the obtained support exhibited the lower s value 167 μ m vs 241 μ m with thinner skin layer and higher porosity compared to pristine psf support xiao et al 2015 compared to nips based substrates thermally induced phase separation tips based substrates with macrovoid free structure are more suitable for tfc fo membranes due to their higher mechanical strength and higher porosity liang et al developed a vertically oriented porous pvdf substrate with excellent water permeability and lower s value thus reducing the icp effect the water flux of up to 93 6 l m 2 h 1 of the developed tfc membranes was obtained in fo process using 2 m nacl as draw solution liang et al 2017 however the selective layer formation is limited by the cooling rate in tips process which largely determines the pore size of membranes consequently it is still difficult to prepare the salt selective layer with suitable pore size via tips for osmotic process klok et al 1998 compared to phase inversion method electro spinning technology is a novel method in fabricating nanofiber membrane with higher porosity specific surface area and more adjustable thickness which also promotes the development of novel thin film nanofiber membranes bui et al 2011 bui and mccutcheon 2014 li et al 2016b pan et al 2017 shi et al 2016 however the high porosity of substrates can compromise the mechanical strength which might not be suitable for high operation pressure in pro process park et al reported an interconnected highly porous pes support via electro spinning process combined post co solvent treatment although the obtained support is favorable to effectively reduce icp the open size must be reduced as much as possible to withstand the high applied pressure without causing deformation in pro park et al 2016 kim et al prepared a robust thermally rearranged nanofiber polymer substrate via converting hydroxypolyimide hpi to polybenzoxazole co imide pboi compared to the reported nanofiber supports such as pvdf and pes the pboi substrate exhibited excellent chemical stability because pboi would not dissolve in any organic solvent or acid solutions the maximum power density up to 10 9 w m 2 was obtained at 15 bar using 1 m nacl as draw solution kim et al 2018 nevertheless there is still much room in developing the high mechanically strong substrates that could withstand the high pressure in pro process improving hydrophilicity of substrates could be of great help with mitigating icp effect and to improve membrane anti fouling properties thus enhancing water permeability some studies found that sufficient wetting of substrate layer not only significantly reduced icp but also facilitated water continuity within the membrane thereby providing the pathways for rapid water transport fan et al prepared a hollow fiber hydrophilic cnts based pa membrane via wetting spinning method the unique cnts support showed a much higher porosity of 93 than that of the polymeric hollow fibers 60 80 due to its low icp the cnts pa membrane showed a high flux 80 l m 2 h 1 which was 3 6 times higher than that of commercial cta membrane fan et al 2018 puguan et al fabricated a hydrophilic pva nanofibrous substrate via electrospinning method compared to fo commercial membranes the obtained membrane with lower s which resulted in lower icp effect exhibited 7 fold water flux in fo process puguan et al 2014 similarly aiba et al reported that the cross linking of pbi with n butylsufonate significantly improved water flux from 1 88 l m 2 h 1 to 22 1 l m 2 h 1 due to the advantages of pbi such as high water absorbability outstanding mechanical properties and thermal stability aiba et al 2016 5 3 2 substrate layer with enhanced mechanical stability nowadays one of the main obstacles in pro practical applications is the unsatisfactory membrane mechanical property usually resulting in harmful membrane structure deformation destruction and even severe performance degradation under high applied hydraulic pressure furthermore membrane deformation will increase reverse solute diffusion that will further increase icp therefore much more methods have to be carefully considered to avoid the damage of pro membrane in pro process chung et al 2012 as a summary the important progress of various promising strategies of investigating main mechanical properties of pro membranes in the recent decade are shown in table 4 such as elongation at break tensile strength young s modulus and burst pressure excellent mechanical properties not only effectively avoid unnecessary membrane deformation in practical operation but improve the performance such as power density great efforts to improve mechanical properties of conventional pro membranes have been focused on rational membrane structural design and various investigations of employing stronger membrane materials that can be used to achieve high pressure resistant pro membranes rational design of membrane structure i e substrate structure is an important strategy for enhancing the whole mechanical strength of pro membranes wei et al 2016 generally the substrate layer provides the majority of mechanical integrity for pro membrane a sponge like dominant structure of substrate layer plays an important role in enhancing mechanical strength zhang et al investigated two different structures from finger like macrovoids to sponge like of pes substrate by controlling water content in the polymer dope increasing from 0 wt to 6 4 wt via a wet wet spinning process with an advanced co extrusion technology showing the highest burst pressure 22 bar with the thickest skin layer 630 nm and uniform surface pores showing a narrow distribution zhang et al 2014b also han et al fabricated different pro hollow fiber membranes by varying the composition and flow rate of the dope suspension and obtained the highest tensile stress up to 10 mpa they demonstrated that the excellent mechanical strength might attribute to a high membrane stretch resistance but low ductility han and chung 2014 apart from rational membrane structure design it is important to pay attention to reasonable selection of mechanically stronger membrane substrate materials to increase the mechanical stability of whole pro membranes for instance a stronger pro membrane material with formed dominant sponge like structure and hollow fiber configuration could be utilized to effectively increase the mechanical stability lim et al 2018 a robust polymeric pro membrane consisting of pes substrate and pa active layer performed an astonish burst pressure up to 9 5 bar and could withstand a hydraulic pressure of 9 bar chou et al 2012 furthermore reasonable addition of special additives or modification agents also plays a positive role in enhancing mechanical strength for instance tian et al reported a novel tfn pei membrane by blending multi walled cnts into support which provided a great increase in mechanical strength withstanding high hydraulic pressure as high as 24 bar tian et al 2015 by introducing inorganic salts cacl2 licl or mgcl2 to the dope solution wan and coworkers fabricated a tfc pes hollow fiber membrane exhibiting a good tensile strength and burst pressure up to 5 8 mpa and 33 bar respectively finally achieving a high operating pressure as high as 30 bar wan et al 2018 she et al fabricated a tricot fabric reinforced flat sheet pro membrane with significantly enhanced mechanical resistance to the tensile stretching with an effective applied pressure of 18 4 bar which possessed the fair good structure integrity and unaltered separation performance in the pro process she et al 2016b in general physical modifications such as pre compression are used to achieve better performance and mechanical reinforcement based on various practical operation requirements li et al showed the effects of morphology on enhancing the mechanical property of pai pro membrane substrate they found pre compression could eliminate weak micro regions and effectively improve membrane mechanical stability li et al 2013 in addition post treatment has been considered to play an important role in physical modification organic solvents are reported with moderate effect on enhancing porosity and mechanical strength such as n n dimethylformamide dmf and dimethylsulfoxide dmso tian et al 2015 preferably the post treatment of membrane substrate could be conducted in advance of forming selective active layer contributing to well maintain the structure and geometry of pro membrane compared with other post treatment techniques thermal post treatment is usually used to improve membrane selectivity of pro membrane active layer by reasonably reducing pore size su et al 2010 tsai et al 2011 conditions of post treatment should be carefully considered and systematically optimized according to different membrane types and practical operation requirements since they could either strengthen or weaken membrane performance chen et al 2016 5 3 3 active layer with mitigated rsd until now almost all pro membranes are still composed of pa active layer as shown in fig 3 d for the first time ekiner et al developed non cellulose asymmetric membrane made of aromatic pa in 1991 ekiner and hayes 1991 generally the active layer is prepared with aromatic pa monomers such as m phenylenediamine mpd and more aromatic polyhalides such as trimesoyl chloride tmc among the polyamides tmc mpd processed pa active layer possesses excellent permeability and selectivity and is the most available for pro membrane fabrication in general interfacial polymerization conditions and curing process such as different combinations of amine and acid chloride monomer concentrations and reaction time need to be carefully optimized to improve pro membrane performance such as selectivity of pa layer water transport properties and interfacial robustness between pa layer and substrate ghosh et al investigated the effect of various organic solvents reaction and curing conditions on the formation of pa layer the results showed that membrane permeability increased with curing time due to the complete removal of organic solvents ghosh et al 2008 the formation of active layer morphology thickness and roughness greatly determines tfc membranes performance hermans et al 2015 soroush et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 some studies have demonstrated that pda modification effectively improved the toughness of pa layer and the smoother membrane surface was favorable to form pa layer with suitable pore size and pore size distribution ingole et al 2014 li et al 2013 yang et al prepared a more ordered hydrophilic and thinner pa layer on a tannic acid ta fe nano scaffold interlayer via ip method the ta fe interlayer not only served as a more defined reaction interface but avoided the blocking of the protuberances inside the substrate pores which were beneficial to water permeability and selectivity overcoming the trade off between permeability and selectivity yang et al 2018 excellent membrane properties can be ascribed to the as formed ultrathin pa layer with no defects which endows the satisfied separation performance due to its high cross linking density good chain stiffness and excellent chain packing do et al 2012 gai et al 2014 gu et al 2012 for this reason the developed composite pro membranes offer many advantages such as high water flux low structure parameter and high salinity selectivity addition of different components into pa layer is another method to overcome the formation of the defects of original membrane material and to effectively utilize the synergism between new components and membrane matrix to enhance composite membrane performance the addition of various novel nanomaterials such as silica nanoparticles or aquaporin can optimize the physicochemical properties of the membrane and provide special water channels to improve water permeability while maintaining salt rejection jeong et al 2007 yin et al 2012 a more recent study illustrated that the incorporation of cnts into solvent n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp via spin coating method also moderately improved water permeability of pbi based nanocomposite membranes the well dispersed cnts in the pbi improved the water permeability by 1 7 times without scarifying the salt rejection zhang et al 2018 some studies have also reported that the incorporation of hydrophilic nanoparticles can greatly enhance the water permeability of tfn membranes however the contradictory results declined water flux and rejection were also reported which might be attributed to the poorly understood mechanism chae et al 2015 yang et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 yang et al prepared the psf tfn membranes incorporating ag nanoparticles into pa layer via ip method the formation of selective nano channels induced by ag nanoparticles greatly facilitated water transport and nearly tripled water flux with increased rejection which overcame the conventional trade off between selectivity and permeability yang et al 2019 han and coworkers reported a post treatment procedure on the pa layer of tfc pan membrane via immersing in naocl and nahco3 aqueous solutions respectively obtaining an ultrahigh water flux up to 5 30 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 which is 4 times as high as that of the pristine membrane the satisfactory results may attribute to increasing free volume of membrane reducing the thickness of active layer and the overall mass transfer resistance han et al 2013b surfactants are also advantageous to the performance enhancement of selective active layer of tfc membranes via ip method kang et al 2007 mansourpanah et al 2009 mansourpanah et al fabricated tfc pes nanofiltration membranes by adding different surfactants cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab non ionic triton x 100 and anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate sds into the dimethylacetamide dmac organic phase and the aqueous phase the enhancement of mgcl2 rejection was due to the amphiphilic nature of the surfactant accelerating the effective contact between membrane and solution mansourpanah et al 2009 cui et al added sodium dodecyl sulfate sds into the amine ip solution to fabricate commercial polyimide polymer pro membranes and then the fabricated tfc membrane was post treated by the dmf solution the combination of sds and dmf treatments enhanced water permeability 2 7 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 vs 1 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and power density from 8 65 w m 2 to 18 09 w m 2 without sacrificing the selectivity and the robustness of the membranes cui et al 2014 more recently as shown in fig 7 a novel nanoscale turing type pa membrane for water purification has been reported by tan et al via interfacial polymerization in which this turing type pa layer 20 nm or less is two times thinner than that of traditional pa membranes the water permeability was 3 4 times higher than that of desalination nf membranes with the rejection 99 for the solutes of na2so4 or mgso4 surpassing the water salt separation upper bound line tan et al 2018 since pa membrane plays a dominant role in pro ro and nf processes rational design of novel structure and morphologies is important to achieve extended applications although this novel turing type pa was only applied in nf process its protocol and design principle possibly give us some inspirations of extending applications in pro process if pa based pro membranes can be fabricated using the same materials but different fabrication technique similarly novel 3d printing of thinner and smoother pa layer inspires us to prepare the novel pro membrane with great potential in enhanced permeability and anti fouling ability chowdhury et al 2018 these two studies also give us some new insights into the fundamental understanding between pa membrane performance and pa morphology and or surface chemistry which is important for pro application 5 3 4 fouling control strategies membrane fouling in pro is more complicated and more challenging to control with substrates facing to the feed water while foulants could block the pores of the substrates and or deposit on the surface of the active layer tiraferri et al 2012 despite the low a value of toyobo s hollow fine fiber cta membranes the commercial membranes offer excellent mechanical strength and superior resistance to chlorine compared to polyamide compared to porous substrates solutes and foulants cannot easily enter cta hollow fiber membranes thus mitigating negative fouling and icp effects fujiwara et al 1994 in addition membrane fouling can also be effectively eliminated in the closed loop pro configuration where solution chemistries with high purity solution such as di water could be controlled thus avoiding the frequent chemical cleaning or membrane backwashing chemical modification could effectively enhance water flux and fouling resistance with different additives such as co solvent proton acceptors and surfactants it could sufficiently alter surface hydrophilicity and charge consequently accelerating water permeability as shown in fig 8 a kim et al prepared a commercial tfc membrane from hti modified by hydrophilic tio2 nanoparticles via a facile spray coating method offering a significantly enhanced water flux from 21 l m 2 h 1 to 26 l m 2 h 1 while reverse salt flux was reduced by 50 kim et al 2016b zhao et al designed a carbon quantum dots modified pro membrane by grafting a polydopamine layer on the pes substrate fig 8 b zhao et al 2017 as illustrated in fig 8 c by embedding cnts within the pes support the porosity and hydrophilicity of support presented a significant increase which in turn greatly enhanced water flux son et al 2016 as shown in fig 8 d kim et al reported a thermally rearranged tfc polymer membrane with a porous and robust support and a polyamide active layer combined with a thermally rearranged polymer particularly cnts have attracted great attentions of many groups kim et al 2018 recently grafting has been widely applied for pro membrane modification rana and matsuura 2010 a recent study reported the peg grafted tfc membrane via the reaction between rich amine groups and poly ethylene glycol peg the organic fouling results showed weaker membrane foulant interaction for the peg functionalized surface with the flux decline 7 2 vs 15 7 compared to pristine tfc membranes romero vargas castrillón et al 2014 electrostatically inducing zwitterionic materials into membrane surface could perform outstanding hydrophilicity thus inhibiting the adsorption of foulants lieu le et al 2017 han et al grafted zwitterionic copolymer comprising 2 methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine mpc and 2 amino ethyl methacrylate aema via free radical polymerization onto the surface of tfc pes hollow fiber membrane the grafted membrane performed superior resistance of organic foulants alginate organic fouling and inorganic scaling caso4 and cahpo4 scaling compared to the unmodified membrane a lower flux decline 37 vs 61 was achieved when using a real wastewater brine comprising multi foulants as the feed solution han et al 2018 however the unfavorable effects of grafting method may cause the reduction of porosity even the block of the pores of substrates thus increasing the s value zhang et al demonstrated the great potential of aminosilane 3 aminopropyltri methoxysilane aptms to be grafted for preparing the anti fouling pro membranes after aptms grafting no increase in s value of the pei substrate was observed with same porosity 83 compared to pristine tfc pei membrane the grafted membrane exhibited about half fouling index and a higher water flux recovery 98 vs 80 however the unfavorable increased salt leakage with a decreased salt rejection from 86 to 83 was also observed zhang et al 2016a recently li et al have deposited poly allylamine hydrochloride pah and poly acrylic acid paa polyelectrolytes onto the outer surface of tfc pei hollow fiber membrane to significantly mitigate membrane fouling the modified membrane possessed a higher salt rejection of 97 and higher power density increasing from 11 6 w m 2 at 10 bar to 16 2 w m 2 at 15 bar li et al 2017 due to the naturally unsatisfied physicochemical properties of pro membrane materials some shortcomings hinder the development of pro membranes including serve icp low surface hydrophilicity poor mechanical properties low power density and low fouling resistance membrane modification strategies have attracted increased attentions for enhancing membrane performance such as water flux mechanical properties and fouling resistance to form high performance pro membranes which mainly consists of chemical and physical modification methods 6 engineering applications of pro membranes the osmotic heat engine ohe is a closed loop membrane based energy system consisting of pro and md process for sustainable energy generation han et al 2015b the energy production efficiency of the process is highly dependent on the pro and membranes draw solution and membrane system water recovery previous studies evaluated the potential of inorganic draw solutes with high solubility and high osmotic pressure such as nacl mgcl2 cacl2 licl for closed loop pro process yet the high reverse solute flux was also observed gong et al 2017 recently islam et al selected eleven organic draw solutions that exhibit high solubility high osmotic pressure and low reverse solute flux for closed loop pro process the higher peak power densities were obtained at 2 8 mpa osmotic pressure compared to nacl and nh4hco3 the low reverse solute flux can mitigate the concentration polarization and achieve higher power density however the recovery of these organic solutes via md process still needs to be identified islam et al 2018 hickenbottom et al also investigated the assessment of the techno economic viability of closed loop pro process results indicated that ohe electricity generation costs was not competitive to the low grade heat powered organic rankine cycle electricity generation costs 0 48 per kwh vs 0 08 0 13 per kwh hickenbottom et al 2017 khasawneh et al reported that three pro power plants were proposed on the red sea dead sea rsds results demonstrated that only the third pro plant was economically feasible using dead sea water as draw solution achieving a 134 5 mw capacity and a 0 056 per kwh levelized cost of electricity khasawneh et al 2018 aim et al investigated the energy efficiencies of the pro process using dead sea ds coupling with wastewater seawater or ro brine water however the production of energy with ds seawater and ds ro brine water at 0 5δπm respectively was 0 659 and 0 482 kwh m3 which is more than the energy input altaee et al 2017 nevertheless the coupon scale performance would not be directly translated to full scale performance due to practical system limitations and performance limiting concerns such as membrane fouling lin et al 2014 yip and elimelech 2013 power density and water flux measurements from experimental pro studies are much higher than those of the larger systems straub et al 2014a in 2013 statkraft decided to halt osmotic power investments subsequently straub et al demonstrated the unfeasibility for pro to extract net positive power generation from river water and seawater the expected energetic inputs would surpass the energetic outputs because the specific energy extractable from these solutions is low nevertheless it is important and significant to develop high performance pro membranes to maximize energy production in order to compensate the energy losses from pre treatments and pumps for pro plants straub et al also believed that practical limitations such as severe membrane fouling and inefficiencies would hinder the ultimate feasibility of ro pro hybrid systems saline solutions with higher concentration difference and theoretical energy density one order of magnitude higher than river water and seawater systems may be feasible in the near future straub et al 2016 in a more recent report the saltpower plant showed 10 to 20 kw of electricity depending on the salinities of the waters higher salinity gradients than statkraft with toyobo s hollow fine fiber cta membrane that could be operated at a pressure of up to about 70 bars pankratz 2020 ultimate aim of pro membranes is to be configured into carefully designed membrane modules for pro applications however only a few studies have conducted on designing and assembling membrane modules that could meet the practical needs of high efficiency and high power output al anzi et al 2016 he et al 2015 straub et al 2014a tough restrictions exist in membrane module designs for pro applications in terms of spacing internal flow patterns pressure loss membrane area and membrane deformation except for desirable pro membranes there are other important factors that could further reduce energy consumption for the first time loeb et al acknowledged the importance of pressure exchangers to achieve a cost effective pro system the utilization of pressure exchangers avoided complicated design and complex process saving much more energy and costs loeb 2002 generally pro technology is applied to generate electricity for power plant inevitably the problem of energy loss exists in these processes some studies found that transmission costs could be reduced by choosing a strategic location of the plant preferably close to energy consumption centers chen et al 2017 he et al 2016 o toole et al 2016 7 conclusions and perspectives pro is a promising technology to harvest sgp nevertheless some key issues such as concentration polarization reverse solute diffusion membrane fouling and mechanical stability need to be resolved to improve its power density and performance stability this can be achieved by rationally designing membrane materials and structures with advanced fabrication and modification methods low s value and low fouling tendency are essential for pro substrate surface modification of pro membranes can effectively mitigate icp and membrane fouling by improving the surface properties such as hydrophilicity roughness and porosity the incorporation of novel hydrophilic or superhydrophilic nanomaterials into substrates could greatly enhance water permeability and anti fouling performance membrane rejection layers need to exhibit low reverse solute diffusion as it often leads to more serious icp and severer membrane fouling scaling for tfc membranes the morphology thickness and roughness of the pa layer need to be carefully controlled to optimize the membrane permeability and selectivity a highly effective strategy is to induce an interlayer in the tfc membrane which forms thinner and more ordered pa layer thus enhanced permeability and selectivity and avoids the intrusion of pa into the substrate pores thus reduced s value of the substrate in addition incorporation of nanoparticles into pa layer could induce nano channels inside the nanocomposite membrane which leads to enhanced separation performance with respect to permeability and rejection to date most pro membranes are fabricated using organic polymeric materials compared with polymer membranes more robust inorganic ceramic or metallic membranes have been being rapidly developed in recent years which have great potential to be used as high performance substrates for pro membranes due to their outstanding inherent properties such as highly mechanical chemical thermal stability antifouling and hydrophilicity cao et al 2014 dong et al 2006a 2011 2010 2006b 2018 2009 li et al 2016a tian et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 2015a zhu 2015b high mechanical properties of ceramic membranes endow an outstanding power density and high pressure resistance while good hydrophilicity will very possibly impart the pro membrane with low icp and good anti fouling property however the trade off between mechanical strength and porosity thus icp needs to be carefully considered for the optimization of such substrates zhu et al 2016 in addition high strength and high toughness porous stainless steel and other metal membranes are also promising substrates for pro membranes besides high strength and toughness the excellent electrical conductivity can further allow fouling mitigation using cost effective electrochemical methods si et al 2020 surface modification of ceramic or metal substrates are also highly feasible using more hydrophilic nano particles which is another effective way to control icp zhao et al 2012 pro processes also have critical dependence on the choice of feed and draw solutions a higher concentration gradient can improve the feasibility of pro practical operation therefore pro is more likely to be commercialized for applications involving hypersaline draw solutions and or feed waters with very low osmotic pressure su et al 2010 for example statkraft had planned to apply glacier melt water as its fresh water source pankratz 2020 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17325,with the goal of zero liquid discharge and green energy harvest extraction of abundant green energy from saline water via pressure retarded osmosis pro technology is a promising but challenging issue for water treatment technologies to achieve water and energy sustainability development of high performance pro membranes has received increased concerns yet still under controversy in practical applications in this review a comprehensive and up to date discussion of some key historical developments is first introduced covering the major advances of pro engineering applications and novel membranes especially made in recent years then the critical performance indicators of pro membranes including water flux and power density are briefly discussed subsequently sufficient discussion on four performance limiting factors in pro membrane and process is presented including concentration polarization reverse solute diffusion membrane fouling and mechanical stability to fully address these issues an updated insight is provided into recent major progresses on advanced fabrication and modification techniques of novel pro membranes featuring enhanced performance with different configurations and materials which are also reviewed in detail based on the viewpoint of design rationales afterwards antifouling strategies and engineering applications are critically introduced finally conclusions and future perspective of pro membrane for practical operation are briefly discussed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment sustainable energy extraction pressure retarded osmosis membrane critical performance performance limiting factors membrane fabrication and modification 1 introduction rapid population growth and global climate change call for clean and renewable alternative energy sources chu and majumdar 2012 panwar et al 2011 among these renewable energy sources osmotic energy is an emerging green power with a global potential of approximately 2 tw logan and elimelech 2012 osmotic energy derives from the salt concentration difference between two aqueous solutions of different salinities such as that between river water and seawater for this reason it is also commonly known as salinity gradient power sgp panwar et al 2011 post et al 2007 a variety of technologies such as pressure retarded osmosis pro achilli et al 2009 loeb et al 1976 tiraferri et al 2011 reverse electrodialysis red mei and tang 2018 post et al 2010 and capacitive mixing capmix rica et al 2013 have been actively developed in recent years in spite of its existing controversy in practical application potential for seawater river system straub et al 2016 yip and elimelech 2014 pro has been preliminarily confirmed to have a strong ability of extracting sustainable energy from a variety of salinity gradients with highly attractive power densities and significantly mitigated membrane fouling especially in some bench scale pro hybrid experiments using reverse osmosis ro or membrane distillation md engineered hypersaline wastewater di water system thorsen and holt 2009 pro can be considered as the reverse process of reverse osmosis ro she et al 2016a according to the applied hydraulic pressure difference δ p and effective osmosis pressure difference δπ eff across the semi permeable membrane membrane processes could be divided into reverse osmosis ro δπ eff δ p pressure retarded osmosis pro 0 δ p δπ eff forward osmosis fo δ p 0 and pressure assisted osmosis pao δ p 0 fig 1 also see she et al 2016a in ro and pao hydraulic pressure is relied on to push water through the membrane and thereby mechanical energy is consumed fo does not consume mechanical energy due to its lack of hydraulic pressure in contrast power generation can be achieved in pro as water permeates against the pressure gradient from the low salinity feed solution into the pressurized high salinity draw solution this pressurized water can be utilized to generate electricity e g by using it to drive a turbine see fig 2 and logan and elimelech 2012 one of the most critical components in pro is the semi permeable membrane that largely determines the power density of the pro process and thus its commercial viability hickenbottom et al 2016 madsen et al 2017 maisonneuve et al 2016 various pro membranes with precisely tuned structures and morphologies as well as novel materials have been the research focuses in the field of pro in recent ten years fig 3 which prompt us to critically evaluate the recent progress in pro membranes and materials in spite of annually published two or three review papers on pro topic in recent years fig 3a achilli and childress 2010 helfer et al 2014 klaysom et al 2013 they often focus on the process aspects draw solution and applications with pro membranes not mentioned or only briefly summarized for example helfer et al provided a brief overview of membrane materials in one of the sections of their 2014 review helfer et al 2014 similarly the development of pro membranes as one of the concerned topics is briefly reviewed by alsvik et al in 2013 alsvik and hägg 2013 and han et al in 2015 han et al 2015a recently straub et al reviewed the potential and ultimate viability of three systems of pro process such as controllable mixing where rivers meet the sea high concentration gradients available from hypersaline solutions and hybrid pro incorporated into ro desalination plants to reduce electricity requirements straub et al 2016 due to the lack of comprehensive reviews on the latest development in pro membranes particular in last five years this review attempts to summarize recent development performance breakthroughs key performance limiting challenges design principles and fabrication modification methods of pro membranes this review starts with a brief historical development of pro highlighting the important milestones with respect to theory materials processes and engineering applications the critical performance indicators of pro membranes including water flux and power density are briefly summarized then the performance limiting factors of hindering practical applications are discussed in details including concentration polarization reverse solute diffusion membrane fouling and mechanical stability design rationales fabrication and modification techniques are systematically provided to show how to reasonably fabricate and modify pro membranes to obtain high performance and to fully address these performance limiting factors finally future development needs and perspectives are also highlighted 2 historical development of pro this section provides a brief overview of the critical milestones of pro technology with particular emphasis on the development and engineering application of pro membranes see fig 4 gerstandt et al 2008 the osmosis phenomenon was discovered nearly 300 years ago but the concept of pro was introduced until 1975 by loeb et al 1975 for the first time they demonstrated the feasibility of pro process for power generation with a u shaped hollow fiber cellulose acetate ca membrane however the water permeability was much lower than expected due to internal concentration polarization icp which is a major issue for extensive applications cadotte et al 1981 mehta and loeb 1978 subsequent pro studies were carried out based on ro membranes which also exhibited poor water flux and power density due to the thick substrates thus causing severe icp thorsen and holt 2009 for this reason the development of pro technique had been hampered until late 2000s statkraft norwegian constructed the first pro plant porotype in norway 2009 which proved the applicability of pro for energy generation in addition several pilot scale pro hybrid research projects such as mega ton project japan and global mvp project korea have also been acknowledged the feasibility of the hybrid processes to recovery energy from ro brine and wastewater effluent system kurihara and hanakawa 2013 skilhagen et al 2008 though statkraft announced to halt osmotic power investments in 2013 a more recent water desalination report demonstrated the potential of improving the cost effective saltpower plant with a co2 neutral heat supply by working with higher salinity gradients than statkraft the test showed 10 to 20 kw of electricity depending on the salinities of the waters with toyobo s hollow fine fiber cta membrane that could be operated at a pressure of up to about 70 bars pankratz 2020 cellulose based fo membranes with reduced icp were developed by hydration technologies inc hti albany or due to the thinner and more hydrophilic cellulosic substrates unfortunately these cellulose based fo membranes could not withstand high pressure in pro process nevertheless all these existing issues promoted us to explore ideal pro membranes with novel materials and specially designed structures in recent years the thin film composite tfc fo membranes have become more popular due to their advantages such as structurally adjustable support layer and simple fabrication process for both support and active layers yip et al 2010 as reported by statkraft it is suggested that the applied pressure may increase up to 13 5 bar thus meeting the commercial basis 5 w m 2 however the weak mechanical strength of tfc fo membranes inevitably resulted in compaction and deformation problems under high pressure in pro process compared to flat sheet membranes tfc pro hollow fiber membranes exhibit superior mechanical strength and higher water flux chou et al 2012 ma et al 2012 wang et al 2012 more recently thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes have attracted great increase of interest with competitive superiorities such as excellent separation performance and easy scaling up while the concept of tfn was originally developed in the context of ro membranes jeong et al 2007 it has been increasingly used in fo and pro membranes to achieve higher water permeability and or reduced structural parameter amini et al 2013 lau et al 2015 in addition the incorporation of novel materials such as graphene oxide go carbon nanotubes cnts and metal organic frameworks mofs into selectively active layer also greatly enhances pro membrane permeability and mechanical strength while maintaining its good integrity amini et al 2013 dixon and kim hak 2015 ma et al 2017 song et al 2013 for example tian et al fabricated a novel tfn membrane consisting of an ultrathin pa layer on the reinforced pei support with functionalized carbon nanotubes f cnts the obtained membrane performed an excellent mechanical strength with stable power density 17 3 w m 2 at 16 9 bar tian et al 2015 3 critical performance indicators for evaluating pro membranes the most important performance indicators of pro include water flux and power density water flux is one of the most important parameters in pro for a semi permeable membrane that is permeable to water but completely rejects solutes its ideal water flux jw l m 2 h 1 in the absence of concentration polarization is proportional to driving force i e the difference between the effective transmembrane osmotic pressure δ π eff bar and the transmembrane hydraulic pressure δ p bar 1 j w a δ π e f f δ p where a m s 1 pa 1 is the water permeability coefficient of the pro membrane in reality the water flux of a real pro membrane is also affected by concentration polarization as well as the permeability of solutes through the membrane both of which tend to reduce the actual available water flux lee et al 1981 2 j w a π d m 1 c f b c d m exp j w k 1 b j w exp j w k 1 δ p where π d m bar is the osmotic pressure difference between draw solution and membrane b m s 1 is the solute permeability coefficient cf b g l 1 is the salt concentration of the bulk feed solution and cd m g l 1 is the salt concentration of the draw solution at the membrane surface the solute resistivity for diffusion within the porous support layer k s m 1 is defined by 3 k t τ d ε where t m τ and ε are the thickness tortuosity and porosity of the support layer respectively k can be used to determine the influence of internal concentration polarization power density w is another critical parameter that largely determines the commercial viability of pro process while early types of pro membranes often have low power density of 1 w m 2 a much higher power density 5 w m 2 is required to make pro commercially attractive lee et al 1981 by neglecting the losses in energy conversion and pumping the gross power density is giver by 4 w j w δ p under ideal conditions without the presence of concentration polarization the maximum power density can be obtained of δp 0 5δπm fig 1c nevertheless for a membrane subject to severe concentration polarization or mechanical deformation the optional pressure can differ significantly from 0 5δπm water permeability coefficient a and solute permeability coefficient b m s 1 are usually used to characterize the separation properties of the active layer of a pro membrane while icp in a support layer is reflected by structure parameter s μm which is dependent on the support layer thickness ts tortuosity τ and porosity ε 5 s t s τ ε decreasing membrane thickness and tortuosity and increasing porosity all facilitate diffusion of solutes across the support layer and into the bulk solution thereby reducing icp akther et al 2015 kim et al 2015 lee and kim 2016 in general high membrane water permeability coefficient a reduces the frictional resistance of water through the membrane active layer and thereby favors a higher power density tiraferri et al 2011 low b and small s values are also required to mitigate the negative effects of reverse solute diffusion and internal concentration polarization thorsen and holt 2009 tiraferri et al 2011 meanwhile antifouling pro membranes are needed to avoid severe loss of water flux power density and membrane integrity over time the various performance limiting factors will be further discussed in section 4 icp in section 4 1 4 performance limiting factors for pro membranes pro membranes suffer from some key challenges that severely prevent the feasibility of wide practical applications and hinder their commercialization due to performance limiting factors including icp reverse solute diffusion membrane fouling and mechanical stability strategies for overcoming these critical issues to achieve higher power density are further presented in section 5 where novel materials and fabrication modification methods are reviewed for rational design of high performance substrates and active layers 4 1 internal concentration polarization icp concentration polarization cp can severely limit pro performance and thus is a major obstacle for large scale pro applications cp refers to the concentration gradients near the membrane solution interface as a result of the selective transport of solutes through a membrane in the context of osmotically driven membrane processes cp can be further classified as icp that occurs within the membrane substrate and external concentration polarization ecp that occurs in the feed and draw solutions i e concentrative ecp and dilutive ecp respectively both icp and ecp reduce the available osmosis driving force across the membrane active layer resulting in decreased water flux and power density qin et al 2010 xu et al 2017 zhao and zou 2011 nevertheless it is commonly agreed that icp plays a more dominating role over ecp in limiting the flux and power performance of pro membranes klaysom et al 2013 for pro application a mode of active layer facing to draw solution al ds is most often employed where more challenging concentrative icp occurs within a support layer resulting in severe performance degradation mccutcheon and elimelech 2007 mccutcheon et al 2006 in some of the early studies that use commercial ro membranes in pro processes low water fluxes of or 1 l m 2 h 1 are often reported which is largely ascribed to the occurrence of severe concentrative icp in their relative thick and tortuous support layers the key to reduce concentrative icp is to reduce the structural parameter s by designing membrane substrates with high porosity low thickness low tortuosity and excellent hydrophilicity rahimpour and madaeni 2007 yaroshchuk 2015 recently increased substrate hydrophilicity has also been shown to mitigate concentrative icp due to enhanced connectivity of water pathways in substrates i e the avoidance of air pockets that prevent effective diffusion of solutes emadzadeh et al 2014 liu et al 2016b puguan et al 2014 the detailed design and fabrication of pro membrane substrates are presented in section 5 3 1 inherently icp is affected by solute diffusivity and substrate properties for pro process in addition unfavorable occurrence of reverse solute diffusion further accelerates the negative effect of icp resulting in the lowering of driving force and consequently membrane performance such as flux she et al 2016a the negative effects of reverse solute diffusion are further discussed in section 4 2 in addition to its direct effect on water flux and power density icp can also affect pro performance directly by promoting more severe fouling in pro applications the porous substrate is exposed to the feed solution the icp of foulants and foulant precursors in the substrates can cause greatly accelerated fouling for example zhang et al reported a complete loss of water flux due to icp induced gypsum scaling in the substrate zhang et al 2014a 4 2 reverse solute diffusion rsd membrane selectivity plays a critical role in determining the power performance of pro process a pro membrane with relatively low retention i e high b value can cause severe leakage of draw solutes into the feed water a phenomenon known as reverse solute diffusion in general reverse solute diffusion results in the loss of draw solutes and leads to more serious icp which consequently decreases pro water flux and power density she et al 2012 touati and tadeo 2016 at the module and plant levels the leaked draw solutes accumulate in the feed water causing increased salinity and osmotic pressure in the feed solution xiao et al 2012 xiao et al 2011 furthermore the leakage of fouling precursors such as ca2 mg2 so4 2 etc from the draw solution into the feed may promote severe membrane fouling e g by forming organic ca2 mg2 bridging caso4 scaling etc she et al 2016a zhang et al 2014a although replenishment of draw solutes is generally not required for typical pro applications using seawater or brine as draw solution it can impose significant additional cost for some close looped pro processes such as pro based osmotic heat engines in the latter case the cost of draw solutes replenishment is governed by the ratio of reverse solute diffusion over the water flux js jw han et al 2015b loeb 1998 reverse solute diffusion occurs with water permeation simultaneously the js jw ratio is closely related with the selectivity of the membrane active layer according to classical solution diffusion theory this ratio is given by 6 j s j w b a β r g t 1 a δ p j w where β is the van t hoff coefficient and is a constant if the concentration and osmotic pressure of the solution follow a linear relationship rg 0 083145 l bar mol 1 k 1 is the universal gas constant and t k is absolute temperature the positive js jw m indicates the direction of solute diffusion is opposite to that of water permeation in reality the selectivity parameter b a can be significantly affected by the applied pressure a subject that will be further discussed in section 4 3 4 3 membrane fouling compared to ro and fo pro tends to have much more severe membrane fouling and requires more frequent cleaning and more intensive maintenance she et al 2012 yip and elimelech 2013 therefore fouling control is one of the most important aspects in pro operation in some cases where di water without any foulants is used as feed solution no membrane fouling occurs as expected enabling much higher power densities in contrast for foulant containing feed solutions severe membrane fouling would be a more challenging issue that foulants can easily enter porous substrates but are subsequently retained by active later consequently causing severe internal pore blocking and external fouling foulants can easily enter the substrate but are subsequently retained by the active later causing internal severe pore blocking in addition to the development of external fouling han et al 2016b for example yip et al demonstrated the impact of organic fouling on power generation and their results showed that fouling of porous substrate nearly halved the water flux yip and elimelech 2013 furthermore the accumulation of foulant precursors in the porous layer can result in elevated concentrations for example icp of ca2 inside the substrate can potentially promote organic fouling biofouling as well as inorganic scaling zhang et al reported an extreme case of complete loss of flux due to severe pro scaling by caso4 indeed even when the feed water contains little or no ca2 or so4 2 the reverse diffusion of these solutes and or their icp inside the porous substrate can still lead to severe gypsum scaling zhang et al 2014a icp of feed and draw solutes can also lead to increased salt concentration inside the substrate which may weaken the electrostatic repulsion between colloidal particles and promote their aggregation kim et al 2016a in general pro fouling can be mitigated by improved membrane structure and materials properties optimized operational conditions and effective pretreatment and cleaning strategies for example han et al combined feed pretreatment by utilizing the anti foulants such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp and alkaline cleaning methods to maintain high water flux and power density over several operation cycles in pro process han et al 2016b pro fouling can also be moderated by using reduced water flux and proper control of solution chemistry for example wang et al demonstrated effective reduction of silica scaling by ph adjustment in the feed and or draw solutions e g ph wang et al 2017 aside from the optimization of operational conditions pretreatment and cleaning proper design of membrane structure and tuning membrane physiochemical properties can effectively mitigate pro fouling detailed discussion on membrane design and fabrication can be found in section 5 4 4 mechanical stability in pro process a hydraulic pressure is applied to the draw solution side to achieve optimum power density this pressure is typically on the same order of half of the osmotic pressure of the draw solution e g 10 bar when seawater is used therefore compared to fo process that involved no or little hydraulic pressure mechanical stability is a key consideration for pro process the membrane stability is further complicated by the membrane configuration for flat fleet pro membranes spacers are used in the feed channels the wide unsupported span can cause severe deformation of membranes resulting in loss of rejection she et al 2012 the common mechanical failure issue in lab environment has been also similarly observed at pilot scale in some recent reports where much poorer performance was shown than expected using commercial spiral wound modules due to deformation of the membranes and spacer filled channels inside the modules im et al 2018 kim et al 2017 kook et al 2018 lee et al 2017 lee et al demonstrated the viability of mitigating membrane deformation via a combined configuration with feed spacer on tricot spacer thus obtaining lower selectivity loss and channel pressure drop under pressurization lee et al 2020 in contrast hollow fiber pro membranes are self supported and do not require the use of spacer nevertheless draw solution is often circulated in the lumen side of hollow fibers and the high applied pressure can cause the burst of the fibers chen et al 2016 further discussion on membrane configuration can be found in section 5 2 unsatisfactory mechanical stability of pro membranes can lead to structural deformation and ever destruction under high pressure operation li et al 2015b furthermore deformation of active layer is detrimental to membrane selectivity resulting in more severe reverse solute diffusion section 4 2 and often more severe membrane fouling section 4 3 these factors may severely hinder the large scale development of pro technology the development of pro membranes with desired mechanical strength is thus a high research priority in addition pro membranes with high strength offer greater room for the optimization of power density for example for highly permeable pro membranes the optimal pressure could be 0 5 δπm at higher applied pressure both icp and fouling can be reduced due to the lower water flux leading to more stable pro operation she et al 2012 in general the mechanical stability of a pro membrane is determined by its structure e g thickness and pore structure in addition to the inherent strength of membrane material membranes with lower porosity and greater thickness can provide improved mechanical stability yet often at the expense of increased structural parameter s and more severe icp sections 3 and 4 1 in the case of hollow fiber membranes smaller fiber diameter can result in greater mechanical stability but at the same time greater hydraulic resistance and pressure drop in the lumen side these trade off relationships need to be carefully considered for membrane optimization although some breakthroughs have been made in development of pro membranes there is still a wide gap existing in high performance membrane between experimental researches and actual applications for example the produced net energy of pro membranes rapidly drops to only slightly above or even below the economically viable value for long term practical operation due to icp effects membrane deformation and membrane fouling thus it is important to continue studying the emerging advanced strategies on how to improve water flux to overcome its limitations through rationally designing and fabricating high performance pro membranes 5 rational design of pro membranes with enhanced performances based on the above discussion rational structure design fabrication and modification of pro membranes is very important in order to achieve high key performance to overcome key practical challenges in this section more detailed discussions will be made about what kinds of structures and materials substrate and active layer are more suitable for development of high performance pro membranes based on design principle as well as fabrication and modification techniques 5 1 membrane design rationales membrane design by systemically considering materials structures and configurations is important to achieve excellent performance by employing advanced fabrication and modification techniques one of the most critical consideration is the choice of substrate due to its critical influence on icp mechanical stability and fouling achieving a low s value requires substrates with small thickness high porosity and or low tortuosity of the substrate however conventional finger like pore structure often adopted for fo membranes is not suitable due to its weak mechanical stability this type of pore structure usually results in severe membrane deformation and destruction fig 5 a in contrast substrates with sponge like structure and smaller pore size provide better mechanical strength fig 5b a more extreme case is the commercial toyobo pro membrane that adopts a dense structure for the entire membrane to withstand high pressure operation whereas its thin membrane thickness mitigates icp in addition to pore structure hydrophilicity of substrates is important to reduce icp and fouling propensity of pro membranes in view of the critical trade off relationship between icp and mechanical strength novel substrates formed by high strength metal or ceramic based materials could have potential advantages for the simultaneous enhancement in pro power density and mechanical stability chen et al 2020 dong et al 2007 dong et al 2008 fu et al 2019 li et al 2015a liu et al 2016a lü et al 2014 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 these hydrophilic substrates are also expected to impart better antifouling performance similarly incorporating nanomaterials into the substrate can potentially mitigate icp reduce membrane fouling and improve mechanical stability simultaneously lu et al 2020 son et al 2016 improving pro power performance also requires the use of rejection layers with high water permeability a value and high selectivity a b value high selectivity of the active layer can mitigate reverse solute diffusion thus reduce icp and membrane fouling yang et al 2018 at the same time membrane water permeability is essential in determining the pro water flux and thus power density in this respect there is great rooms for advanced membrane fabrication methods for example thin film nanocomposite membranes incorporating nano materials such as go mof and cnts or including an interlayer material can potentially offer simultaneously improved membrane water permeance and selectivity yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 5 2 membrane configurations with the rapid development of advanced techniques for water treatment and energy extraction applications researchers have been trying to design and prepare pro membranes with enhanced properties and performance generally two common configurations can be classified including flat sheet and hollow fiber membranes see table 1 the details are presented as follows in the early stage of fo development commercial flat sheet ro membranes were employed however severe icp caused the unsatisfactory salt rejection and water flux due to the membrane structure with the subsequent progress of fo membranes moderate enhancement of water flux was obtained as a result of relatively thin substrates of flat sheet cellulose triacetate cta membranes developed by hti albany or achilli et al 2009 akther et al 2015 kim et al reported the membrane performance of hti flat sheet cta membrane for the 2m nacl feed solution and 0 5m nacl draw solution scheme obtaining the water flux of 13 9 l m 2 h 1 and power density of 4 7 w m 2 at the hydraulic pressure of 12 5 bar kim and elimelech 2013 since 2010 flat sheet tfc membranes have achieved superior performance in permeability and power density than cta membranes straub et al investigated the pro performance of hti flat sheet tfc membrane for concentrate 3m nacl draw solution with a high power density of 60 w m 2 at hydraulic pressure of 48 bar straub et al 2014b however flat sheet membranes often need a feed channel spacer to maintain the feed channel geometry in pro process where the spacers inevitably lead to the energy loss of hydraulic pressure and pro membrane deformation under high pressure she et al observed that membrane deformation caused the severe reverse solute diffusion when using commercial cta flat sheet membranes under higher hydraulic pressure subsequently an unfavorable rsd enhanced icp resulted in the decrease of water flux and power density she et al 2012 similarly kim et al observed a dramatic deviation between actual water flux and the predicted values when using commercial flat sheet membranes at high hydraulic pressure kim and elimelech 2012 nevertheless feed spacers at high pressure induced the deformation and blocked the membrane area for water permeation and the phenomenon was referred to shadow effect which drastically increased the solute permeability coefficient overall careful design and employment of suitable spacers is quite critical to develop effective flat sheet pro membrane modules for further practical scaling up applications due to its proneness to mechanical damage and low packing density flat sheet configuration is no longer considered to take priority for pro process by comparison hollow fiber pro membranes offer high membrane surface area per volume and no shadow effects with self support structure cheng et al 2016 zhang et al 2014b tables 2 and table 3 summarize these key parameters for flat sheet and hollow fiber pro membranes respectively as shown in fig 6 hollow fiber composite pro membranes with thin and highly porous but mechanically stronger substrates could achieve the higher power density while withstanding the high operation pressure indicating the tremendous potential for practical pro process kurihara et al prepared a 10 inch hollow fiber membrane module in a prototype pro plant obtaining the maximum power density of 13 5 w m 2 kurihara et al 2016 similar to fabricating tfc flat sheet membrane tfc hollow fiber membranes have been successfully synthesized on porous support by interfacial polymerization ip method pa selective layer could be formed on either inner or outer side or both inner and outer sides of porous support layer fu et al 2015 2013 zhao et al 2012 the outer selective pro hollow fiber membrane with the best performance can withstand hydraulic pressures up to 22 bar and achieve a maximum power density of 10 05 w m 2 using 1 m nacl and deionized water as draw solution and feed solution respectively cheng et al 2017 compared with inner selective pro membrane however many studies have reported the superior advantages of outer selective pro hollow fiber membrane due to the higher membrane area easier cleaning and less pressure drop sun and chung 2013 but a major problem of outer selective pro hollow fiber membrane is the multiple and complicated fabrication processes compared to the inner selective counterparts due to its proneness of defect formation during ip process 5 3 performance improved strategies 5 3 1 substrate layer with reduced icp generally pro substrate materials mainly consist of polysulfone psf polyethersulfone resin pes polyacrylonitrile pan polyamide imine pai polyetherimide pei and polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp among them pes and pan can fully meet the pressure capacity requirements of pro membranes with advantages of low cost good mechanical thermal and chemical stability tsai et al 2005 psf and pes are the most widely used substrate materials for tfc membranes due to several advantages such as wide temperature resistant range excellent acid and alkali resistance and fairly good chlorine resistance however in the osmotically driven membrane process the hydrophilicity of psf and pes substrates is not so satisfactory which results in nonsufficient wetting of support layers thus increasing icp and reducing water flux geise et al 2014 tiraferri et al 2011 over the past decade some other novel substrates have been emerging li et al developed a series of tfc pa membranes with p84 co polyimide support and subsequently tested the membrane performance such as water flux power density and mechanical strength under various conditions the inter selective membrane achieved excellent properties in both mechanical property tensile strength up to 5 mpa and power density up to 12 w m 2 at 21 bar using water and 1 m nacl as feed solution and draw solution respectively li and chung 2014 han et al fabricated a novel tfc membrane using superhydrophilic sulfonatedpolyphenylenesulfone sppsu as substrate material comparing to commercial tfc membrane the obtained membrane exhibited approximately 2 times higher water flux indicating less icp effect existed within the superhydrophilic substrate han et al 2016a it is well known that a low substrate structure parameter is favorable to reduce icp effect consequently the substrates should be rationally designed to facilitate solute diffusion with low tortuosity high porosity and low thickness su and chung 2011 tiraferri et al 2011 to date although some asymmetric membranes were shown to exhibit a high performance thin film composite tfc membranes have exhibited a lot of advantages such as lower fabrication costs and higher stability regardless of the feed quality and composition non solvent induced phase separation nips method is widely used to prepare an asymmetric membrane comprised of a dense top layer and porous substrate however the dense top layer may lead to a severe icp as a result of high mass transport resistance lin et al 2006 liu and ng 2014 though subsequent studies have reported some multi layer structured membranes with a less flux decline and better pressure tolerance it is difficult to simultaneously control the morphology of active layer and substrate via phase inversion method fu et al 2015 su et al fabricated the double skinned ca hollow fiber membranes by phase inversion method the prepared membranes achieved a high water flux up to 17 1 l m 2 h 1 using 2 m mgcl2 draw solution and di water feed solution however the results showed a high reverse solute flux which could lead to unsatisfactory membrane fouling su et al 2010 a recent study investigated the performance of ca based hollow fiber membranes prepared by thermally assisted nips method t nip for pro process compared to conventional nips based substrates the obtained membranes showed thinner selective skin layer higher porosity and higher mechanical strength in addition the higher power density of 5 5 w m 2 was achieved at 16 bar compared to conventional ca membranes cho et al 2019 recently different strategies have been explored to develop more suitable substrates to reduce icp extent for tfc fo membranes fu et al 2013 han et al 2013a xiao et al developed a sacrificial pei layer approach to prepare psf support via co casting method the obtained support exhibited the lower s value 167 μ m vs 241 μ m with thinner skin layer and higher porosity compared to pristine psf support xiao et al 2015 compared to nips based substrates thermally induced phase separation tips based substrates with macrovoid free structure are more suitable for tfc fo membranes due to their higher mechanical strength and higher porosity liang et al developed a vertically oriented porous pvdf substrate with excellent water permeability and lower s value thus reducing the icp effect the water flux of up to 93 6 l m 2 h 1 of the developed tfc membranes was obtained in fo process using 2 m nacl as draw solution liang et al 2017 however the selective layer formation is limited by the cooling rate in tips process which largely determines the pore size of membranes consequently it is still difficult to prepare the salt selective layer with suitable pore size via tips for osmotic process klok et al 1998 compared to phase inversion method electro spinning technology is a novel method in fabricating nanofiber membrane with higher porosity specific surface area and more adjustable thickness which also promotes the development of novel thin film nanofiber membranes bui et al 2011 bui and mccutcheon 2014 li et al 2016b pan et al 2017 shi et al 2016 however the high porosity of substrates can compromise the mechanical strength which might not be suitable for high operation pressure in pro process park et al reported an interconnected highly porous pes support via electro spinning process combined post co solvent treatment although the obtained support is favorable to effectively reduce icp the open size must be reduced as much as possible to withstand the high applied pressure without causing deformation in pro park et al 2016 kim et al prepared a robust thermally rearranged nanofiber polymer substrate via converting hydroxypolyimide hpi to polybenzoxazole co imide pboi compared to the reported nanofiber supports such as pvdf and pes the pboi substrate exhibited excellent chemical stability because pboi would not dissolve in any organic solvent or acid solutions the maximum power density up to 10 9 w m 2 was obtained at 15 bar using 1 m nacl as draw solution kim et al 2018 nevertheless there is still much room in developing the high mechanically strong substrates that could withstand the high pressure in pro process improving hydrophilicity of substrates could be of great help with mitigating icp effect and to improve membrane anti fouling properties thus enhancing water permeability some studies found that sufficient wetting of substrate layer not only significantly reduced icp but also facilitated water continuity within the membrane thereby providing the pathways for rapid water transport fan et al prepared a hollow fiber hydrophilic cnts based pa membrane via wetting spinning method the unique cnts support showed a much higher porosity of 93 than that of the polymeric hollow fibers 60 80 due to its low icp the cnts pa membrane showed a high flux 80 l m 2 h 1 which was 3 6 times higher than that of commercial cta membrane fan et al 2018 puguan et al fabricated a hydrophilic pva nanofibrous substrate via electrospinning method compared to fo commercial membranes the obtained membrane with lower s which resulted in lower icp effect exhibited 7 fold water flux in fo process puguan et al 2014 similarly aiba et al reported that the cross linking of pbi with n butylsufonate significantly improved water flux from 1 88 l m 2 h 1 to 22 1 l m 2 h 1 due to the advantages of pbi such as high water absorbability outstanding mechanical properties and thermal stability aiba et al 2016 5 3 2 substrate layer with enhanced mechanical stability nowadays one of the main obstacles in pro practical applications is the unsatisfactory membrane mechanical property usually resulting in harmful membrane structure deformation destruction and even severe performance degradation under high applied hydraulic pressure furthermore membrane deformation will increase reverse solute diffusion that will further increase icp therefore much more methods have to be carefully considered to avoid the damage of pro membrane in pro process chung et al 2012 as a summary the important progress of various promising strategies of investigating main mechanical properties of pro membranes in the recent decade are shown in table 4 such as elongation at break tensile strength young s modulus and burst pressure excellent mechanical properties not only effectively avoid unnecessary membrane deformation in practical operation but improve the performance such as power density great efforts to improve mechanical properties of conventional pro membranes have been focused on rational membrane structural design and various investigations of employing stronger membrane materials that can be used to achieve high pressure resistant pro membranes rational design of membrane structure i e substrate structure is an important strategy for enhancing the whole mechanical strength of pro membranes wei et al 2016 generally the substrate layer provides the majority of mechanical integrity for pro membrane a sponge like dominant structure of substrate layer plays an important role in enhancing mechanical strength zhang et al investigated two different structures from finger like macrovoids to sponge like of pes substrate by controlling water content in the polymer dope increasing from 0 wt to 6 4 wt via a wet wet spinning process with an advanced co extrusion technology showing the highest burst pressure 22 bar with the thickest skin layer 630 nm and uniform surface pores showing a narrow distribution zhang et al 2014b also han et al fabricated different pro hollow fiber membranes by varying the composition and flow rate of the dope suspension and obtained the highest tensile stress up to 10 mpa they demonstrated that the excellent mechanical strength might attribute to a high membrane stretch resistance but low ductility han and chung 2014 apart from rational membrane structure design it is important to pay attention to reasonable selection of mechanically stronger membrane substrate materials to increase the mechanical stability of whole pro membranes for instance a stronger pro membrane material with formed dominant sponge like structure and hollow fiber configuration could be utilized to effectively increase the mechanical stability lim et al 2018 a robust polymeric pro membrane consisting of pes substrate and pa active layer performed an astonish burst pressure up to 9 5 bar and could withstand a hydraulic pressure of 9 bar chou et al 2012 furthermore reasonable addition of special additives or modification agents also plays a positive role in enhancing mechanical strength for instance tian et al reported a novel tfn pei membrane by blending multi walled cnts into support which provided a great increase in mechanical strength withstanding high hydraulic pressure as high as 24 bar tian et al 2015 by introducing inorganic salts cacl2 licl or mgcl2 to the dope solution wan and coworkers fabricated a tfc pes hollow fiber membrane exhibiting a good tensile strength and burst pressure up to 5 8 mpa and 33 bar respectively finally achieving a high operating pressure as high as 30 bar wan et al 2018 she et al fabricated a tricot fabric reinforced flat sheet pro membrane with significantly enhanced mechanical resistance to the tensile stretching with an effective applied pressure of 18 4 bar which possessed the fair good structure integrity and unaltered separation performance in the pro process she et al 2016b in general physical modifications such as pre compression are used to achieve better performance and mechanical reinforcement based on various practical operation requirements li et al showed the effects of morphology on enhancing the mechanical property of pai pro membrane substrate they found pre compression could eliminate weak micro regions and effectively improve membrane mechanical stability li et al 2013 in addition post treatment has been considered to play an important role in physical modification organic solvents are reported with moderate effect on enhancing porosity and mechanical strength such as n n dimethylformamide dmf and dimethylsulfoxide dmso tian et al 2015 preferably the post treatment of membrane substrate could be conducted in advance of forming selective active layer contributing to well maintain the structure and geometry of pro membrane compared with other post treatment techniques thermal post treatment is usually used to improve membrane selectivity of pro membrane active layer by reasonably reducing pore size su et al 2010 tsai et al 2011 conditions of post treatment should be carefully considered and systematically optimized according to different membrane types and practical operation requirements since they could either strengthen or weaken membrane performance chen et al 2016 5 3 3 active layer with mitigated rsd until now almost all pro membranes are still composed of pa active layer as shown in fig 3 d for the first time ekiner et al developed non cellulose asymmetric membrane made of aromatic pa in 1991 ekiner and hayes 1991 generally the active layer is prepared with aromatic pa monomers such as m phenylenediamine mpd and more aromatic polyhalides such as trimesoyl chloride tmc among the polyamides tmc mpd processed pa active layer possesses excellent permeability and selectivity and is the most available for pro membrane fabrication in general interfacial polymerization conditions and curing process such as different combinations of amine and acid chloride monomer concentrations and reaction time need to be carefully optimized to improve pro membrane performance such as selectivity of pa layer water transport properties and interfacial robustness between pa layer and substrate ghosh et al investigated the effect of various organic solvents reaction and curing conditions on the formation of pa layer the results showed that membrane permeability increased with curing time due to the complete removal of organic solvents ghosh et al 2008 the formation of active layer morphology thickness and roughness greatly determines tfc membranes performance hermans et al 2015 soroush et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 some studies have demonstrated that pda modification effectively improved the toughness of pa layer and the smoother membrane surface was favorable to form pa layer with suitable pore size and pore size distribution ingole et al 2014 li et al 2013 yang et al prepared a more ordered hydrophilic and thinner pa layer on a tannic acid ta fe nano scaffold interlayer via ip method the ta fe interlayer not only served as a more defined reaction interface but avoided the blocking of the protuberances inside the substrate pores which were beneficial to water permeability and selectivity overcoming the trade off between permeability and selectivity yang et al 2018 excellent membrane properties can be ascribed to the as formed ultrathin pa layer with no defects which endows the satisfied separation performance due to its high cross linking density good chain stiffness and excellent chain packing do et al 2012 gai et al 2014 gu et al 2012 for this reason the developed composite pro membranes offer many advantages such as high water flux low structure parameter and high salinity selectivity addition of different components into pa layer is another method to overcome the formation of the defects of original membrane material and to effectively utilize the synergism between new components and membrane matrix to enhance composite membrane performance the addition of various novel nanomaterials such as silica nanoparticles or aquaporin can optimize the physicochemical properties of the membrane and provide special water channels to improve water permeability while maintaining salt rejection jeong et al 2007 yin et al 2012 a more recent study illustrated that the incorporation of cnts into solvent n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp via spin coating method also moderately improved water permeability of pbi based nanocomposite membranes the well dispersed cnts in the pbi improved the water permeability by 1 7 times without scarifying the salt rejection zhang et al 2018 some studies have also reported that the incorporation of hydrophilic nanoparticles can greatly enhance the water permeability of tfn membranes however the contradictory results declined water flux and rejection were also reported which might be attributed to the poorly understood mechanism chae et al 2015 yang et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 yang et al prepared the psf tfn membranes incorporating ag nanoparticles into pa layer via ip method the formation of selective nano channels induced by ag nanoparticles greatly facilitated water transport and nearly tripled water flux with increased rejection which overcame the conventional trade off between selectivity and permeability yang et al 2019 han and coworkers reported a post treatment procedure on the pa layer of tfc pan membrane via immersing in naocl and nahco3 aqueous solutions respectively obtaining an ultrahigh water flux up to 5 30 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 which is 4 times as high as that of the pristine membrane the satisfactory results may attribute to increasing free volume of membrane reducing the thickness of active layer and the overall mass transfer resistance han et al 2013b surfactants are also advantageous to the performance enhancement of selective active layer of tfc membranes via ip method kang et al 2007 mansourpanah et al 2009 mansourpanah et al fabricated tfc pes nanofiltration membranes by adding different surfactants cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab non ionic triton x 100 and anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate sds into the dimethylacetamide dmac organic phase and the aqueous phase the enhancement of mgcl2 rejection was due to the amphiphilic nature of the surfactant accelerating the effective contact between membrane and solution mansourpanah et al 2009 cui et al added sodium dodecyl sulfate sds into the amine ip solution to fabricate commercial polyimide polymer pro membranes and then the fabricated tfc membrane was post treated by the dmf solution the combination of sds and dmf treatments enhanced water permeability 2 7 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 vs 1 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and power density from 8 65 w m 2 to 18 09 w m 2 without sacrificing the selectivity and the robustness of the membranes cui et al 2014 more recently as shown in fig 7 a novel nanoscale turing type pa membrane for water purification has been reported by tan et al via interfacial polymerization in which this turing type pa layer 20 nm or less is two times thinner than that of traditional pa membranes the water permeability was 3 4 times higher than that of desalination nf membranes with the rejection 99 for the solutes of na2so4 or mgso4 surpassing the water salt separation upper bound line tan et al 2018 since pa membrane plays a dominant role in pro ro and nf processes rational design of novel structure and morphologies is important to achieve extended applications although this novel turing type pa was only applied in nf process its protocol and design principle possibly give us some inspirations of extending applications in pro process if pa based pro membranes can be fabricated using the same materials but different fabrication technique similarly novel 3d printing of thinner and smoother pa layer inspires us to prepare the novel pro membrane with great potential in enhanced permeability and anti fouling ability chowdhury et al 2018 these two studies also give us some new insights into the fundamental understanding between pa membrane performance and pa morphology and or surface chemistry which is important for pro application 5 3 4 fouling control strategies membrane fouling in pro is more complicated and more challenging to control with substrates facing to the feed water while foulants could block the pores of the substrates and or deposit on the surface of the active layer tiraferri et al 2012 despite the low a value of toyobo s hollow fine fiber cta membranes the commercial membranes offer excellent mechanical strength and superior resistance to chlorine compared to polyamide compared to porous substrates solutes and foulants cannot easily enter cta hollow fiber membranes thus mitigating negative fouling and icp effects fujiwara et al 1994 in addition membrane fouling can also be effectively eliminated in the closed loop pro configuration where solution chemistries with high purity solution such as di water could be controlled thus avoiding the frequent chemical cleaning or membrane backwashing chemical modification could effectively enhance water flux and fouling resistance with different additives such as co solvent proton acceptors and surfactants it could sufficiently alter surface hydrophilicity and charge consequently accelerating water permeability as shown in fig 8 a kim et al prepared a commercial tfc membrane from hti modified by hydrophilic tio2 nanoparticles via a facile spray coating method offering a significantly enhanced water flux from 21 l m 2 h 1 to 26 l m 2 h 1 while reverse salt flux was reduced by 50 kim et al 2016b zhao et al designed a carbon quantum dots modified pro membrane by grafting a polydopamine layer on the pes substrate fig 8 b zhao et al 2017 as illustrated in fig 8 c by embedding cnts within the pes support the porosity and hydrophilicity of support presented a significant increase which in turn greatly enhanced water flux son et al 2016 as shown in fig 8 d kim et al reported a thermally rearranged tfc polymer membrane with a porous and robust support and a polyamide active layer combined with a thermally rearranged polymer particularly cnts have attracted great attentions of many groups kim et al 2018 recently grafting has been widely applied for pro membrane modification rana and matsuura 2010 a recent study reported the peg grafted tfc membrane via the reaction between rich amine groups and poly ethylene glycol peg the organic fouling results showed weaker membrane foulant interaction for the peg functionalized surface with the flux decline 7 2 vs 15 7 compared to pristine tfc membranes romero vargas castrillón et al 2014 electrostatically inducing zwitterionic materials into membrane surface could perform outstanding hydrophilicity thus inhibiting the adsorption of foulants lieu le et al 2017 han et al grafted zwitterionic copolymer comprising 2 methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine mpc and 2 amino ethyl methacrylate aema via free radical polymerization onto the surface of tfc pes hollow fiber membrane the grafted membrane performed superior resistance of organic foulants alginate organic fouling and inorganic scaling caso4 and cahpo4 scaling compared to the unmodified membrane a lower flux decline 37 vs 61 was achieved when using a real wastewater brine comprising multi foulants as the feed solution han et al 2018 however the unfavorable effects of grafting method may cause the reduction of porosity even the block of the pores of substrates thus increasing the s value zhang et al demonstrated the great potential of aminosilane 3 aminopropyltri methoxysilane aptms to be grafted for preparing the anti fouling pro membranes after aptms grafting no increase in s value of the pei substrate was observed with same porosity 83 compared to pristine tfc pei membrane the grafted membrane exhibited about half fouling index and a higher water flux recovery 98 vs 80 however the unfavorable increased salt leakage with a decreased salt rejection from 86 to 83 was also observed zhang et al 2016a recently li et al have deposited poly allylamine hydrochloride pah and poly acrylic acid paa polyelectrolytes onto the outer surface of tfc pei hollow fiber membrane to significantly mitigate membrane fouling the modified membrane possessed a higher salt rejection of 97 and higher power density increasing from 11 6 w m 2 at 10 bar to 16 2 w m 2 at 15 bar li et al 2017 due to the naturally unsatisfied physicochemical properties of pro membrane materials some shortcomings hinder the development of pro membranes including serve icp low surface hydrophilicity poor mechanical properties low power density and low fouling resistance membrane modification strategies have attracted increased attentions for enhancing membrane performance such as water flux mechanical properties and fouling resistance to form high performance pro membranes which mainly consists of chemical and physical modification methods 6 engineering applications of pro membranes the osmotic heat engine ohe is a closed loop membrane based energy system consisting of pro and md process for sustainable energy generation han et al 2015b the energy production efficiency of the process is highly dependent on the pro and membranes draw solution and membrane system water recovery previous studies evaluated the potential of inorganic draw solutes with high solubility and high osmotic pressure such as nacl mgcl2 cacl2 licl for closed loop pro process yet the high reverse solute flux was also observed gong et al 2017 recently islam et al selected eleven organic draw solutions that exhibit high solubility high osmotic pressure and low reverse solute flux for closed loop pro process the higher peak power densities were obtained at 2 8 mpa osmotic pressure compared to nacl and nh4hco3 the low reverse solute flux can mitigate the concentration polarization and achieve higher power density however the recovery of these organic solutes via md process still needs to be identified islam et al 2018 hickenbottom et al also investigated the assessment of the techno economic viability of closed loop pro process results indicated that ohe electricity generation costs was not competitive to the low grade heat powered organic rankine cycle electricity generation costs 0 48 per kwh vs 0 08 0 13 per kwh hickenbottom et al 2017 khasawneh et al reported that three pro power plants were proposed on the red sea dead sea rsds results demonstrated that only the third pro plant was economically feasible using dead sea water as draw solution achieving a 134 5 mw capacity and a 0 056 per kwh levelized cost of electricity khasawneh et al 2018 aim et al investigated the energy efficiencies of the pro process using dead sea ds coupling with wastewater seawater or ro brine water however the production of energy with ds seawater and ds ro brine water at 0 5δπm respectively was 0 659 and 0 482 kwh m3 which is more than the energy input altaee et al 2017 nevertheless the coupon scale performance would not be directly translated to full scale performance due to practical system limitations and performance limiting concerns such as membrane fouling lin et al 2014 yip and elimelech 2013 power density and water flux measurements from experimental pro studies are much higher than those of the larger systems straub et al 2014a in 2013 statkraft decided to halt osmotic power investments subsequently straub et al demonstrated the unfeasibility for pro to extract net positive power generation from river water and seawater the expected energetic inputs would surpass the energetic outputs because the specific energy extractable from these solutions is low nevertheless it is important and significant to develop high performance pro membranes to maximize energy production in order to compensate the energy losses from pre treatments and pumps for pro plants straub et al also believed that practical limitations such as severe membrane fouling and inefficiencies would hinder the ultimate feasibility of ro pro hybrid systems saline solutions with higher concentration difference and theoretical energy density one order of magnitude higher than river water and seawater systems may be feasible in the near future straub et al 2016 in a more recent report the saltpower plant showed 10 to 20 kw of electricity depending on the salinities of the waters higher salinity gradients than statkraft with toyobo s hollow fine fiber cta membrane that could be operated at a pressure of up to about 70 bars pankratz 2020 ultimate aim of pro membranes is to be configured into carefully designed membrane modules for pro applications however only a few studies have conducted on designing and assembling membrane modules that could meet the practical needs of high efficiency and high power output al anzi et al 2016 he et al 2015 straub et al 2014a tough restrictions exist in membrane module designs for pro applications in terms of spacing internal flow patterns pressure loss membrane area and membrane deformation except for desirable pro membranes there are other important factors that could further reduce energy consumption for the first time loeb et al acknowledged the importance of pressure exchangers to achieve a cost effective pro system the utilization of pressure exchangers avoided complicated design and complex process saving much more energy and costs loeb 2002 generally pro technology is applied to generate electricity for power plant inevitably the problem of energy loss exists in these processes some studies found that transmission costs could be reduced by choosing a strategic location of the plant preferably close to energy consumption centers chen et al 2017 he et al 2016 o toole et al 2016 7 conclusions and perspectives pro is a promising technology to harvest sgp nevertheless some key issues such as concentration polarization reverse solute diffusion membrane fouling and mechanical stability need to be resolved to improve its power density and performance stability this can be achieved by rationally designing membrane materials and structures with advanced fabrication and modification methods low s value and low fouling tendency are essential for pro substrate surface modification of pro membranes can effectively mitigate icp and membrane fouling by improving the surface properties such as hydrophilicity roughness and porosity the incorporation of novel hydrophilic or superhydrophilic nanomaterials into substrates could greatly enhance water permeability and anti fouling performance membrane rejection layers need to exhibit low reverse solute diffusion as it often leads to more serious icp and severer membrane fouling scaling for tfc membranes the morphology thickness and roughness of the pa layer need to be carefully controlled to optimize the membrane permeability and selectivity a highly effective strategy is to induce an interlayer in the tfc membrane which forms thinner and more ordered pa layer thus enhanced permeability and selectivity and avoids the intrusion of pa into the substrate pores thus reduced s value of the substrate in addition incorporation of nanoparticles into pa layer could induce nano channels inside the nanocomposite membrane which leads to enhanced separation performance with respect to permeability and rejection to date most pro membranes are fabricated using organic polymeric materials compared with polymer membranes more robust inorganic ceramic or metallic membranes have been being rapidly developed in recent years which have great potential to be used as high performance substrates for pro membranes due to their outstanding inherent properties such as highly mechanical chemical thermal stability antifouling and hydrophilicity cao et al 2014 dong et al 2006a 2011 2010 2006b 2018 2009 li et al 2016a tian et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 2015a zhu 2015b high mechanical properties of ceramic membranes endow an outstanding power density and high pressure resistance while good hydrophilicity will very possibly impart the pro membrane with low icp and good anti fouling property however the trade off between mechanical strength and porosity thus icp needs to be carefully considered for the optimization of such substrates zhu et al 2016 in addition high strength and high toughness porous stainless steel and other metal membranes are also promising substrates for pro membranes besides high strength and toughness the excellent electrical conductivity can further allow fouling mitigation using cost effective electrochemical methods si et al 2020 surface modification of ceramic or metal substrates are also highly feasible using more hydrophilic nano particles which is another effective way to control icp zhao et al 2012 pro processes also have critical dependence on the choice of feed and draw solutions a higher concentration gradient can improve the feasibility of pro practical operation therefore pro is more likely to be commercialized for applications involving hypersaline draw solutions and or feed waters with very low osmotic pressure su et al 2010 for example statkraft had planned to apply glacier melt water as its fresh water source pankratz 2020 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17326,in the field of microplastic mp research in the environment a significant amount of the currently reported results is uncertain because of the inappropriate methods of sampling detection and quantification of mps fortunately many research groups are aware of these challenges but validated methods which are the prerequisite of standardized measurements are scarce recovery tests are especially rare in the field of mp sampling the aim of our research was to take a step forward and collect data on cascade filtration recoveries by modeling different turbulance conditions and sampling depth applying environmentally relevant mp concentrations while obtaining large sample volumes as reference materials different polymer types polyethylene pe polypropylene pp poly ethylene terephthalate pet poly vinyl chloride pvc polyamide pa and shapes sphere fragment fiber were used and for detection near infrared spectroscopy microscopy was applied the developed method provides information not only on system based mp losses but on sampling efficiency in a model environment as well based on the results the highest recovery rate of all polymers was 31 4 on average sampled from the water surface during continuous stirring in these conditions 92 4 of the pe spheres and 31 9 of the pe fragments were recovered this indicates particles reported in environmental monitoring studies might be less than the real environmental concentration we can conclude that surface sampling is more efficient than sampling in a deeper layer of the water column our research revealed that the widespread application of microspheres as reference materials might lead to too optimistic recovery values the application of reference particles fragments fibers with higher environmental relevance shows much lower recovery rates our results highlight that validating the efficiency of the whole sampling process from the environment is more important than measuring only the filtration device s recovery this study helps us to better understand the relationship and the possible gaps between the reported mp results and the real life concentrations in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic water sampling validation recovery near infrared spectroscopy sampling device 1 introduction the scientific interest in the field of microplastics mps significantly increased at the end of the 2000s and the number of studies is still dynamically expanding mps have been detected globally not only in seawater and freshwater but in other water related matrices such as sediment tap water and wastewater parellelly the effects of mps in water ecosystems have become obvious and plastic ingestion and the caused adverse effects have been observed in the low trophic fauna and in vertebrates as well in the past 2 3 years the issue of microplastics caught a wider public and media attention as well but instead of the growing knowledge on the abundance and the potential harms of mps many results might be misleading due to unharmonized methods and the lack of standardization these studies have a high uncertainty because of the inconsistent methods of sampling detection and quantification of mps therefore uncertain environmental concentrations are published the most common failures that lead to uncertain results on mps are the low sample volume the use of commercial plastics in sampling or sample preparation and the sorting and identification of mps with visual evaluation only however the abundance of articles with optical observation is decreasing zhao et al 2014 faure et al 2015 colleen et al 2016 besley et al 2017 wang et al 2017 kosuth et al 2018 fortunately many research groups are aware of these challenges and nowadays samples are measured usually with different molecular spectroscopic raman or fourier transformed infrared ftir or gas chromatographic mass spectrometric thermoextraction desorption or pyrolysis gc ms methods elert et al 2017 sometimes background contamination is also tackled and controlled alomar et al 2016 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 but this is not enough to validate sample preparation efficiency validated methods in the field of sampling and sample preparation of mps are the prerequisite of standardization which is necessary for the harmonization and validation of analytical methods for the global comparability of results and have to be established in the near future some research groups have already taken the first steps and compared methods during sample processing the most important parameters of these studies are highlighted in the supplementary information si 1 reference particles added by measuring their weight or counting their numbers are either self produced with different grinding and sieving methods or commercially available engineered microspheres some studies also apply hand cut fibers as well the use of microspheres are more common but the shape of these particles is rather similar to primarily produced mps and does not cover the environmentally more relevant fragments fibers secondary microplastics in some studies pre incubation of the reference particles in the matrix is also applied hurley et al 2018 this also supports environmental relevance of the recovery measurements recovery rates are measured by gravimetry or with visual inspection under microscope with nile red staining or molecular spectroscopy such as raman or ft ir microscopy the more common gravimetry and visual analysis is easier and faster to conduct however the results may lead to overestimation of the recovery with rates varying between 50 100 reportedly despite the most efficient sample preparation mps are usually still surrounded by other particles from the matrix when reference particles are added to environmental matrices this can be avoided by using and spiking purified water but the environmental relevance of these setups are very low regarding the sizes of the reference particles in the lower range recovery is also lower imhof et al 2012 hengstmann et al 2018 wiggin and holland 2019 it is also report that solutions with a higher density have a higher recovery rate of the denser particles quinn et al 2017 surprisingly it is less common to validate preparation processes and recovery data in water freshwater seawater wastewater than in solid environmental samples three years ago miller et al 2017 stated in a review article that they are not aware of any studies reporting the recovery of microplastics in seawater samples since then wiggin and holland 2019 conducted a study in milli q water using commercially available polyethylene pe and polystyrene ps microspheres with different size ranges where the average recovery rates were between 67 79 it is important to note that no spectral analysis has been conducted during these tests only visual analysis which may lead to under or overestimation of the recovered particles ziajahromi et al 2017 investigated sample preparation efficiency using wastewater samples spiked with ps particles 250 500 μm where they observed 100 recovery with ft ir measurements the vast majority of microplastic studies in the aquatic environment apply different nets e g manta net but the application of different fractionated filtration systems operated by pumps are getting more common prata et al 2018 stock et al 2019 recovery measures are usually implemented in studies where filtration systems are applied however there is only limited data available ziajahromi et al 2017 validated an in situ fractionated filtration device designed for wastewater sampling 60 to 200 mg of ground ps particles with four different sizes were added individually to four liters of tap water than passed through the sieves sieves were dried and measured the recovery rate was determined based on the mass loss of two repetitions recovery rates were above of 90 this method provides data only on the filtration efficiency of one specific polymer with low density so environmentally relevant conclusions cannot be drawn unfortunately it is not detailed in the paper how the fraction of spiking mps is selected and the set concentration 60 to 200 mg mps 4 liter is very high and overrepresenting the total mass of particles that are usually measured in wastewater treatment plants wwtps bannick et al 2018 prepared an artificial water medium for validation tests using different organic and inorganic materials for reference mps they used commercially available pe and cryomilled ps granulate 60 mg of each particle type were incubated in 500 ml surface water for seven days then added to 150 liters of water in a steel barrel they reported that these spiking concentrations correspond with earlier results obtained from wwtps the content of the barrel was pumped through different mesh size steel filter plates in a well designed sampling system where plastic spare parts were eliminated the samples were analyzed by thermoextraction desorption gc ms ted gc ms recovery rates show high efficiency both for pe and ps 81 and 110 respectively similarly to ziajahromi et al 2017 and bannick et al 2018 validated the complete sampling process the use of an artificial water medium is a more realistic environmental model however as the whole content of the barrel was filtered through the system this test does not answer how many of the environmentally present particles are sampled this test gives an overview of the recovery of those particles that are entering the suction valve in the report a general sampling depth of 50 cm is described but the effect of the sampling depth on the recovery cannot be examined as the whole content of the barrel was used the study paves the way for further sampling validations where not only particles with low densities applied and the sampling depth could be considered funck et al 2020 used a closed pressurized filter cascade for the sampling of wastewater they performed validation of the sampling system in a 1 m3 ibc intermediate bulk container tank filled with tap water and 10 grams of each reference material during each replicate the whole content of the tank was filtered then the container was immediately refilled with 1 m3 of tap water and this volume was filtered as well the sampling system was washed out between the three replicates the recovery was gravimetrically determined averages of different size categories ranged between 85 88 the test system was well designed and plastic free but tap water contamination and ibc tank disintegration due to mechanical use during sampling could cause slight differences similar to bannick et al 2018 the whole sampling system was validated the whole content of the tank was filtered and only low density polymers were used which is a limitation of these results hildebrandt et al 2019 conducted lab scale validation on a sampling system that is not based on filtration but continuous flow centrifugation cfc similarly to bannick et al 2018 they incubated the particles in a surface water sample to better represent real life mps high amounts of the reference materials 1 5 grams were suspended in low volumes final volume 0 8 2 liters of liquid media and then solutions were exposed to the cfc recoveries were over 95 measured by the mass of particles as it can be concluded based on the overview of scientific literature and also highlighted by silva et al 2018 only a low number of research articles on mps are targeting both quality control and quality assurance they also emphasize that other analytical parameters such as precision trueness selectivity specificity limit of detection and sensitivity which are required for the validation of analytical methods used for the determination of environmental contaminants are currently not established for the validation protocols of applied analytical quantification techniques of microplastics validation of sample preparation methods with recovery measurements is very important to steer the microplastic research towards a standardized analysis to gather comparable data besides providing information on the effectiveness of the applied method we can better understand the relation of the measured data to the real environmental concentration for this better understanding it is vital to get detailed information on the sampling methods to determine how efficient is the sampling of microplastics in the environment despite the importance of sampling efficiency measures until now only a few studies investigated the recovery capabilities of mp sampling which will be summarized in table 4 in the discussion section to help better comparision with the results of the current study our research aimed to take a step forward and gather data on cascade filtration recoveries by modeling different turbulance conditions and sampling depth and obtain large sample quantities from a medium that is spiked with mps in environmentally relevant concentrations 2 materials methods 2 1 preparation of microplastic particles the efficiency recovery rate of the sampling device was tested in a controlled test environment with the addition of an known number of microplastic reference materials of various types sizes and shapes as such particles are not available on the market only in the form of microbeads or powders first these environmentally relevant particles had to be produced plastic fragments were prepared with cryogenic grinding as input material commercial polypropylene pp low density polyethylene ldpe polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyethylene terephthalate pet foils films were chosen pp ldpe and pvc foils were obtained from a commercial packaging store pet film was cut from mineral water bottles as there was no producer provided data on their density and thickness particles were measured in triplicates with a pycnometer in ethanol medium density and a micrometer thickness original materials were first cut into fragments of 0 5 1 cm size in diameter then placed in a retsch cryomill the system was cooled with liquid nitrogen therefore the melting of the plastic could be avoided the settings of the mill were pre cooling for 120 seconds with 1 s 1 frequency grinding for 120 180 seconds with 25 30 1 s 1 frequency the procedure was repeated twice only soft pvc films needed one cycle after grinding a series of retch s sieves with 100 mm diameter was used to separate fractions 500 µm 500 300 µm 300 100 µm 100 50 µm fractions were collected in pre cleaned petri dishes for the sampling validation 300 100 µm fraction was used this size range is reported many times from the aquatic environment either sampling with manta nets or filter cascades bordós et al 2019 besides the plastic foils three different types of plastic fibers kaposplast ltd hungary were used as microfibers are not commercially available our group had to produce these such production methods resulting small fibers in a standard way are present but rarely described cole 2016 frehland et al 2020 but hand cut microfibers are often used cole et al 2014 quinn et al 2017 caron et al 2018 vermerien et al 2020 the used plastics were made of pp polyamide pa and pet and were cut into 1 1 5 mm length also commercially available pe microbeads with fluorescent labeling cospheric llc were used to have spherical mps in the test system the used reference microplastics and their properties are summarized in table 1 thirty pieces of each reference material in total 240 particles were picked with forceps under a dino lite edge am4115tl 10 140x magnification optical microscope and thenadded to a 40 ml epa vial and suspended in 0 1 tween 80 sigma aldrich usa solution images of all particles used in the test system have been taken under dino lite edge am4115tl optical microscope at 100x magnification these are presented in the supplementary information si 2 further scanning electron microscope sem images were taken from the cryomilled particles fragments by a jeol jsm 5500lv scanning electron microscope in high vacuum mode with a secondary electron detector adhesive carbon tape was used to fix the samples on copper sample holders to prevent them from charging they were sputtered with an au pd layer the images are shown in the supplementary information si 3 2 2 sampling tests in controlled test environment the device used for the sampling test is the improved version of the system that has been described by bordós et al 2019 for the sampling tests cylindrical stainless steel filters 50 and 25 µm in metal housings were connected in a cascade and were operated with a jet pump plastic spare parts were excluded from the system rubber hoses seals metal fittings and suction valve were used on every occasion water flow was always measured with a water meter with 0 1 l precision in every repetition 1 500 l water was sampled with a flow rate of 65 l min the sampling tests were conducted in a one meter wide one meter high and three meters long stainless steel tank with food processing quality the tank was filled with 2 400 liters of tap water prefiltered with a 15 µm mesh size stainless steel filter to avoid mp contamination in the size range of the test materials when the water level reached 1 500 liters in the tank the content of the prepared reference mp dispersion 30 particles of each material in total 240 particles was added and a stirrer 22 rpm was started and operated until reaching the final 2 400 liters to homogenize the tank s content the final mp concentration was 100 particles m3 which is environmentally relevant in case of freshwaters usually few tens or few hundred particles per 1 000 l sample reported zhao et al 2014 mani et al 2015 wang et al 2017 sampling tests were conducted in different depths and with different stirring conditions in the stainless steel tank the suction valve was either kept constantly 10 cm below the water surface or on halfway between the surface and the bottom in line with water level decrease referred to as half water column sampling to model different turbulance conditions during the tests there were a no stirring b periodic or c continuous stirring if no stirring was applied sampling only started 30 minutes after the homogenization to let the particles distribute on the natural way without disturbance when stirring was periodical the stirrer was operated for 10 seconds per minute every setup that are presented in table 2 and a blind test without mps were conducted in three independent replications after each repetition the tank was cleaned twice thoroughly with filtered water before the next replicate compared to other studies a huge advantage of our setup was the filtration of the used tap water before the experiment for the prevention of cross contamination since we were spiking with environmentally relevant concentrations and measuring numbers of particles instead of the total mass of polymers all confounding factors had to be eliminated 2 3 identification of microplastics after filtration tests the content of the filters and filter housings were thoroughly rinsed in a pre cleaned beaker with filtered 5 µm deionized water then it was filtered on a whatman anodisc 25 mm in diameter 0 02 µm pore size inorganic filter membrane obtained from merck the filters were dried with ethanol 96 and first investigated under an optical microscope dino lite edge am4115tl 10 140x magnification with uv light op uv led 365 nm to enumerate the fluorescent microbeads then analyzed with a fourier transform ft spectrophotometer microscope system in the near infrared nir region the used equipment was perkinelmer spectrum 400 ft ir ft nir spectrophotometer coupled to a perkinelmer spotlight 400 ft ir ft nir microscope imaging system attachment perkinelmer inc waltham ma usa the microscope was equipped with mct mercury cadmium telluride array detector the spectra acquisition was performed in transmission mode with image sampling mode samples on anodisc filters were taken into two quartz replacement windows foss nirsystems inc silver spring md usa tightly held by tweezers background measurements of the anodisc filters were conducted and also results were correlated with this background 15 and 4 scans at the background and the sample respectively with a resolution of 16 cm 1 a data interval of 8 cm 1 and speed of interferometer 2 20 cm s were recorded for each spectrum in the near infrared wavelength range between 6500 and 4000 cm 1 pixel size was set to 25 µm this means the smallest applied reference particle will appear in multiple pixels that improves shape and material analysis the measurement time for each filter was approximately 5 hours data collection was performed with spectrumimage 1 6 5 0396 software perkinelmer inc waltham ma usa the spectra of reference microplastic database was setup beforehand by the same spectrophotometer equipped with near infrared accessory nira attachment perkinelmer inc waltham ma usa with diffuse reflectance mode in the near infrared region using original materials the nira was equipped with ingaas indium gallium arsenide detector 32 scans with a resolution of 16 cm 1 a data interval of 2 cm 1 and speed of interferometer 1 00 cm s were recorded for each spectrum in the near infrared wavelength range between 1000 and 4000 cm 1 data collection was performed with spectrum 6 3 2 software perkinelmer inc waltham ma usa for data analysis perkinelmer spectrumimage and imagej 1 52a software rasband w s imagej u s national institutes of health bethesda maryland usa were used only particles with a correlation of over 80 were accepted after automated image analysis a visual inspection was conducted to validate and revise the results e g overlapping fibers of same polymeric materials are recognized by the software as one single particle during laboratory work strict precautions were taken to avoid sample contamination as much as possible whenever it was possible sample processing steps were conducted under a laminar airflow cabinet for all sample processing and glassware cleaning steps filtered 5 µm pore size stainless steel filter deionized water was used samples were always covered with aluminum foil or kept in glass petri dishes during the work cotton laboratory coat was worn besides general cleaning benchtops and cabinets were regularly wiped 2 4 supplementary measurements in this experiment a multiple step validation approach was followed not only recoveries from simulated samplings have been measured but supplementary tests were conducted to better understand the origin of the possible particle loss during the recovery measures a schematic flow diagram of the multiple step validation is presented in fig 1 as the main experiment was focusing on the relation of mp concentration in the tank compared to the final filtrate mp number instead of filtering the whole content of the tank further information had to be collected on the performance of the sampling device and the related intermediate steps for this two questions had to be answered a have all particles entering the suction valve reached the filter cascade and b have all of the collected particles on the filter cascade been washed efficiently to the final aluminum oxide filter in order to determine particle loss in the whole sampling system suction valve hoses fittings pump water meter a field experiment on the danube river was conducted the sampling system was set up and after the filtration of 500 l volume of river water 10 10 fluorescent microsphere obtained from cospheric 300 µm in diameter with a density of 0 98 and 1 2 g cm3 in 0 1 tween 80 solution was injected directly next to the suction valve with a pipette then further 500 l water was pumped through the system five repetitions were conducted filter cascades were opened in the laboratory rinsed to an 8 µm pore size 47 mm in diameter cellulose nitrate filter and fluorescent particles were enumerated under an optical microscope dino lite edge am4115tl 10 140x magnification using uv light op uv led 365 nm a blind test was also conducted with the injection of 0 1 tween 80 solution without reference particles particle loss occurring during the washing of the filters i e recovering the retained particles was evaluated in a laboratory experiment samples previously taken on the field free from any fluorescent microspheres were used the inflow socket was opened and 10 10 fluorescent microsphere obtained from cospheric 300 µm in diameter with a density of 0 98 and 1 2 g cm3 were rinsed into the filter housing with deionized water filter housings were closed and then placed on a linear shaker for 10 minutes on 170 rpm after this incubation filter housings were opened and both the filters and filter housings were rinsed to an 8 µm pore size 47 mm in diameter cellulose nitrate filter and fluorescent particles were enumerated under an optical microscope dino lite edge am4115tl 10 140x magnification using uv light op uv led 365 nm a blind test was also conducted without adding the reference particles 3 results 3 1 sampling validation in controlled test environment during our measurements we strived to set environmentally relevant mp concentrations and as we were using ir microscopy for the detection particle number approach was followed as filtrated volume was recorded precisely particle number could be calculated easily on a particle m3 basis in the sample the reported recovery rates were calculated from the original concentration 100 particles m3 and the measured data blank measures were conducted in the setup of surface sampling with continuous stirring only one pe fragment was found in every three repetitions as this setup resulted in the highest recoveries in the experimental part we can conclude based on the blank test results that the prefiltration of the tap water and all precautionary actions were successful to prevent background contamination the highest recovery results occurred during the continuous stirring of the tank which is a very optimistic setup in terms of environmental relevance it was designed to represent the best available homogenization here the average recovery of all polymers was the highest and reached 31 4 individual recovery of polymer types in an average of the three replications are 62 2 for pe 40 4 for pa 24 6 for pvc 20 2 for pet 9 7 for pp when the tank was periodically stirred or when no stirring was applied average recovery results for all plastic types were very close to each other no stirring values were a bit higher on the surface 9 9 compared to 9 5 and in half water column 7 2 compared to 5 1 when sampling depths are compared it can be concluded that surface sampling resulted in higher recovery values under all turbulance conditions the results are shown in fig 2 regarding polymer types and their density pe particles with low density clearly showed the highest recovery in all setups in average 29 7 at fragments 0 95 g cm3 and 24 9 at spheres 1 2 g cm3 highest value reached 92 4 for pe spheres surface sampling and continuous stirring while lowest individual value was recorded for pet and pp fragments and pp fibers since in some setups none of these mps were recovered particles with higher density such as pa fibers 16 9 pet fibers 11 6 and pvc fragments 8 5 are extracted better than low density pp particles fibers and fragments 4 6 and 1 8 respectively without considering polymer shape descending order of average recoveries are pe 27 3 range 11 5 62 2 pa 16 9 range 7 1 40 4 pvc 8 5 range 1 8 24 6 pet 7 4 range 2 7 20 2 pp 3 2 range 0 9 9 7 except pp these results indicate decreasing tendency of recovery for mps with higher density pe 0 95 g cm3 pe 1 2 g cm3 pa 1 14 g cm3 pet 1 3 g cm3 pvc 1 29 g cm3 pet 1 37 g cm3 interestingly low density pp fibers and fargments are recovered less 4 6 and 1 8 respectively than particles with higher density such as pa fibers 16 9 pet fibers 11 6 and pvc fragments 8 5 the results are presented in fig 2 and table 3 during setups sn and hn surface and half water column sampling without stirring an additional type of microsphere was used so in this system pe spheres with similar diameter but with different density 1 2 and 0 98 g cm3 were tested this helped to compare polymer density effect on recovery when no disturbance i e flow in the test environment occurred based on our results mps with a higher density were recovered with a lower rate both in surface sampling 7 1 and half water column sampling 0 than low density spheres 35 5 and 12 4 respectively in the experiments pp and pet were both used in different shapes fibers fragments but with the same density per polymer type polymers with the same density could be recovered differently due to the effect of size and or shape recovery of pp fibers and fragments is in the same range 4 6 and 1 8 respectively but there is a big gap in pet recovery 11 6 of fibers were recovered while fragments only yielded 3 2 as presented in fig 2 and table 3 when we look at the recovery results of the current sampling validation considering the shape of the polymers we can conclude that microspheres have the highest average recovery rates 24 9 recovery for fibers and fragments are much lower 11 0 and 10 8 respectively as presented on fig 2 our results support the opinion that studies applying only microspheres as reference material might be optimistic and overestimate the recovering capacity of the method for real life particles 3 2 supplementary measurements the aim of our experimental design was to filter only a part of the water in the tanks so filtration efficiency from the environment i e sampling could be modeled as not the whole content of the tank was filtered potential particle losses of the sampling system should be measured separately in this experiment commercially available fluorescent microspheres were used because these are easy to handle identification under uv light with an optical microscope is fast and no background contamination from environmental matrices is expected tagged spheres like these could be a good choice when quality assurance quality control of sampling and sample preparation is considered the results of the particle loss measurements with direct injection next to the suction valve show that low density particles are recovered on an average over 95 while particle with higher density recovered on an average of 63 as no significant loss occurs during the washing of the filters 95 recovery was recorded for both types of reference particles this means that there could be a moderate loss of more dense particles in the sampling system or during the direct injection process these particles rather sink than penetrate the suction valve for higher recovery of these particles possibly stronger suction would be needed blank experiments resulted in no recovery in any tests 4 discussion all the parameters investigated during this work are compared to the literature in table 4 and will be discussed in detail in the followings 4 1 shapes and sizes of microplastics particles applied in the presented sampling validation test covered a wide range both in shape and in polymer type the goal was to cover the three main shapes of microplastics spheres fragments fibers during the experiments and thus to represent environmentally relevant particles as well this is an important step as currently commercially available spheres pellets are probably the most popular in not only the sample preparation validation quinn et al 2017 hurley et al 2018 wiggin and holland 2019 but in sampling validation tests as well bannick et al 2018 hildebrandt et al 2019 funck et al 2020 beyond microspheres ground polymers i e fragments that are environmentally more relevant were also used ziajahromi et al 2017 bannick et al 2018 until now fibers were only applied in sample preparation validation cole et al 2014 quinn et al 2017 caron et al 2018 hurley et al 2018 but no data are available on fiber recovery during sampling validation in the case of fibers we applied hand cut pieces as this production method is used currently in other studies with the similar size range of fibers as used in the current research cole et al 2014 caron et al 2018 these particles might not represent all environmentally relevant fibers the best e g small microfibers from the washing of synthetic clothes air deposition but simulate microfibers from syntehetic ropes fishing lines and nets currently only a few technique is available to prepare smaller microfibers in a standard way and these have to be emphasized in the future cole 2016 frehland et al 2020 the use of environmentally more relevant mps is very important we found that in the same conditions microspheres are recovered better as fragments or fibers this result supports the opinion that studies applying only microspheres as reference material might be optimistic and overestimate the recovering capacity of the method for real life particles a possible reason for lower recovery of fragments could be poor hydrodynamic properties and agglomeration of the particles due to the flake like shapes and irregular edges as this can be seen in the sem images in the supplementary information si 3 due to these properties particles might also get sticked to the tank s surface water tank layer surface tension the surface of the spheres and fibers applied in the current study is more smooth as presented in the supplementary information si 2 probably this enhances the recovery when smaller fibers in diameter would be used presumably agglomeration would be also an issue there due to the curly shape of these filaments e g entanglement of mps released from laundry interestingly even if microfiber standards are produced in the smaller size range such as presented by cole 2016 and frehland et al 2020 these fibers are still tend to be more straight than curly also with smooth edges similarly to the shape of those that were applied in the current study beyond the shape of the used mps further steps could be taken in the future to environmentally more relevant validation if not only virgin particles but preincubated bannick et al 2018 hildebrandt et al 2019 or weathered mps are used 4 2 effect of polymer size on recovery in our study there is a limitation to compare the effect of polymer size on recovery as only pp and pet were used in different sizes 100 300 µm fragments and 1000 1500 mm fibers similar to earlier studies hengstmann et al 2018 hurley et al 2018 silva et al 2018 wiggin and holland 2019 average percentage of recovery decreased parallelly with the size class of particles the relation of the recovery of pp fibers and fragments 4 6 and 1 8 respectively is similar to pet fibers and fragments 11 6 and 3 2 respectively there is a further limitation as particle shape is also different even though if fibers are rather thick and not simulating laundry originated mps fragmentation of polymers might cause an error as well but this has not been tackled in any sampling validation study yet and neither could be measured in the frame of this research 4 3 effect of polymer density on recovery although some studies during sample preparation investigated the effect of polymer densities on recovery quinn et al 2017 hurley et al 2018 this was never targeted in sampling validation of fractionated filtration before usually these studies are focusing on recovering individual polymer types such as ps ziajahromi et al 2017 or pe particles funck et al 2020 bannick et al 2018 investigated both pe and ps and also found differences in recovery but the density of the applied reference materials was not specified in our study seven of the applied reference materials had different density and except pp results showed decreasing recovery for mps with higher density this indicates a particle loss due to sedimentation 4 4 different approaches of validation tests according to the literature a high and environmentally not occurring load of mps was applied to conduct a representative gravimetric analysis during most of the validation tests bannick et al 2018 stated environmentally representative concentrations and the recovery measures were conducted with ted gc ms instead of gravimetry we also strived to set environmentally relevant mp concentrations and as we were using ir microscopy for the detection particle number approach was followed in these systems where particle numbers are much lower are very sensitive for any disturbance this means precaution on mp pollution prevention had to be taken we used pretreated water i e filtered from mps but none of the fractionated filtration validation studies have done this before the background contamination coming from tap water is probably negligible when high environmentally not relevant masses of reference particles are applied funck et al 2020 but as the recovery is measured gravimetrically and several liters of water is filtered total suspended solid content of the tap water may cause a huge unexpected error in the measurements this may influence the measurement up to adding 40 mg l total suspended solids to the measurement chen et al 2020 during sampling validation of fractionated filtration where the whole content of the experimental tank is filtered ziajahromi et al 2017 bannick et al 2018 funck et al 2020 losses can occur only in the sampling device so no information can be obtained on sampling efficiency from the environment in our study we presented the first validation of a fractionated filtration sampling system where the efficiency of the whole sampling process is investigated for this only a certain volume 1 500 l which has already been applied in the field by setälä et al 2016 and mintenig et al 2017 of the experimental tank was filtered according to the supplementary measurements on filtration efficiency and filter washing we can conclude that system based particle loss is not high when commercially available microspheres are used this indicates that the results of the sampling experiment are concerning the losses of particles in different setups instead of the losses of the sampling device in the recovery tests we have targeted a higher flow rate 65 l min than bannick et al 2018 5 6 l min because this ensures compatibility to effective field sampling where large volumes are concentrated during a relatively short period recoveries were calculated on the sample volume basis the experiment enables us to consider the natural distribution of particles in water bodies in different turbulance conditions and is able to quantify the rate of microplastic recovery from the environment i e the number of particles that can be collected by the suction valve 4 5 comparision of sampling depth and turbulence conditions a further novelty of this study that different sampling depth and turbulance conditions were compared different turbulance conditions were meant to represent different lakes and rivers where the distribution of mps is not only described by their density but other parameters such as turbulences as well no straight correlation could be observed in recovery rates when the tank was stirred periodically and when no stirring was applied a continuous stirring triplicate sampling was conducted to evaluate the sampling device s recovery capacity in optimal conditions where the content of the tank is the most homogenous distribution of mps in surface waters is also affecting the sampling depth one advantage of pump based fractionated filtration sampling that sampling depth can be easily chosen from the surface to deeper layers of the water column but there is no information available which is the more effective in our study we aimed to investigate this and found that surface layer sampling always yielded more mps on average as half water column sampling did 5 conclusion the validation test presented above was designed to qualify a cascade filtration sampling device s recovery rate from an environmentally representative model as a novelty the goal of the investigation was to reveal the number of particles entering and passing through the system from a known concentration of mp dispersion tests were conducted in a closed system where different mps were applied with concentrations similar to the detection levels in the environment particle number approach different turbulance conditions were generated and the effect of sampling depth was also investigated water surface half water column large quantities were applied and instead of filtering the whole content of the tank 2 400 l samples were taken such as during real life surface water sampling 1 500 l water was filtered it can be concluded from the test results that surface sampling resulted in higher recovery values under all turbulance conditions when no stirring or periodical stirring was applied mps were recovered from the surface on average 9 9 and 9 5 while from the half water column 7 2 and 5 1 respectively these turbulance conditions were designed to model river and lake conditions as it was experienced during the tests fluorescent microplastics could be a good choice as surrogate standards when quality assurance quality control of sampling and sample preparation is considered but spheres cannot be used as a single reference material to describe comprehensively recovery efficiency of any systems the currently tested system aimed to take a step towards modeling natural systems with its different flow conditions and the diverse mp particles used in these tests we found that the preset concentration of mps in the tank was 3 10 times higher than that of the samples this helps to better understand the relation between the reported mp values and the real environmental concentration to better understand this relation between measured data and the real environmental concentrations further improvements are necessary on the model system reference particles should be produced in all shapes from all polymer types to investigate their agglomeration potential and their dispersion hydrodynamics in the tank size ranges of the used mps should be lowered to give results on other environmentally and also ecotoxicologically relevant fractions a comprehensive multiple steps validation approach is needed to determine the efficiency of different mp sampling sample preparation and analysis methods in the future these measures are necessary prerequisites of standardization

17326,in the field of microplastic mp research in the environment a significant amount of the currently reported results is uncertain because of the inappropriate methods of sampling detection and quantification of mps fortunately many research groups are aware of these challenges but validated methods which are the prerequisite of standardized measurements are scarce recovery tests are especially rare in the field of mp sampling the aim of our research was to take a step forward and collect data on cascade filtration recoveries by modeling different turbulance conditions and sampling depth applying environmentally relevant mp concentrations while obtaining large sample volumes as reference materials different polymer types polyethylene pe polypropylene pp poly ethylene terephthalate pet poly vinyl chloride pvc polyamide pa and shapes sphere fragment fiber were used and for detection near infrared spectroscopy microscopy was applied the developed method provides information not only on system based mp losses but on sampling efficiency in a model environment as well based on the results the highest recovery rate of all polymers was 31 4 on average sampled from the water surface during continuous stirring in these conditions 92 4 of the pe spheres and 31 9 of the pe fragments were recovered this indicates particles reported in environmental monitoring studies might be less than the real environmental concentration we can conclude that surface sampling is more efficient than sampling in a deeper layer of the water column our research revealed that the widespread application of microspheres as reference materials might lead to too optimistic recovery values the application of reference particles fragments fibers with higher environmental relevance shows much lower recovery rates our results highlight that validating the efficiency of the whole sampling process from the environment is more important than measuring only the filtration device s recovery this study helps us to better understand the relationship and the possible gaps between the reported mp results and the real life concentrations in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic water sampling validation recovery near infrared spectroscopy sampling device 1 introduction the scientific interest in the field of microplastics mps significantly increased at the end of the 2000s and the number of studies is still dynamically expanding mps have been detected globally not only in seawater and freshwater but in other water related matrices such as sediment tap water and wastewater parellelly the effects of mps in water ecosystems have become obvious and plastic ingestion and the caused adverse effects have been observed in the low trophic fauna and in vertebrates as well in the past 2 3 years the issue of microplastics caught a wider public and media attention as well but instead of the growing knowledge on the abundance and the potential harms of mps many results might be misleading due to unharmonized methods and the lack of standardization these studies have a high uncertainty because of the inconsistent methods of sampling detection and quantification of mps therefore uncertain environmental concentrations are published the most common failures that lead to uncertain results on mps are the low sample volume the use of commercial plastics in sampling or sample preparation and the sorting and identification of mps with visual evaluation only however the abundance of articles with optical observation is decreasing zhao et al 2014 faure et al 2015 colleen et al 2016 besley et al 2017 wang et al 2017 kosuth et al 2018 fortunately many research groups are aware of these challenges and nowadays samples are measured usually with different molecular spectroscopic raman or fourier transformed infrared ftir or gas chromatographic mass spectrometric thermoextraction desorption or pyrolysis gc ms methods elert et al 2017 sometimes background contamination is also tackled and controlled alomar et al 2016 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 but this is not enough to validate sample preparation efficiency validated methods in the field of sampling and sample preparation of mps are the prerequisite of standardization which is necessary for the harmonization and validation of analytical methods for the global comparability of results and have to be established in the near future some research groups have already taken the first steps and compared methods during sample processing the most important parameters of these studies are highlighted in the supplementary information si 1 reference particles added by measuring their weight or counting their numbers are either self produced with different grinding and sieving methods or commercially available engineered microspheres some studies also apply hand cut fibers as well the use of microspheres are more common but the shape of these particles is rather similar to primarily produced mps and does not cover the environmentally more relevant fragments fibers secondary microplastics in some studies pre incubation of the reference particles in the matrix is also applied hurley et al 2018 this also supports environmental relevance of the recovery measurements recovery rates are measured by gravimetry or with visual inspection under microscope with nile red staining or molecular spectroscopy such as raman or ft ir microscopy the more common gravimetry and visual analysis is easier and faster to conduct however the results may lead to overestimation of the recovery with rates varying between 50 100 reportedly despite the most efficient sample preparation mps are usually still surrounded by other particles from the matrix when reference particles are added to environmental matrices this can be avoided by using and spiking purified water but the environmental relevance of these setups are very low regarding the sizes of the reference particles in the lower range recovery is also lower imhof et al 2012 hengstmann et al 2018 wiggin and holland 2019 it is also report that solutions with a higher density have a higher recovery rate of the denser particles quinn et al 2017 surprisingly it is less common to validate preparation processes and recovery data in water freshwater seawater wastewater than in solid environmental samples three years ago miller et al 2017 stated in a review article that they are not aware of any studies reporting the recovery of microplastics in seawater samples since then wiggin and holland 2019 conducted a study in milli q water using commercially available polyethylene pe and polystyrene ps microspheres with different size ranges where the average recovery rates were between 67 79 it is important to note that no spectral analysis has been conducted during these tests only visual analysis which may lead to under or overestimation of the recovered particles ziajahromi et al 2017 investigated sample preparation efficiency using wastewater samples spiked with ps particles 250 500 μm where they observed 100 recovery with ft ir measurements the vast majority of microplastic studies in the aquatic environment apply different nets e g manta net but the application of different fractionated filtration systems operated by pumps are getting more common prata et al 2018 stock et al 2019 recovery measures are usually implemented in studies where filtration systems are applied however there is only limited data available ziajahromi et al 2017 validated an in situ fractionated filtration device designed for wastewater sampling 60 to 200 mg of ground ps particles with four different sizes were added individually to four liters of tap water than passed through the sieves sieves were dried and measured the recovery rate was determined based on the mass loss of two repetitions recovery rates were above of 90 this method provides data only on the filtration efficiency of one specific polymer with low density so environmentally relevant conclusions cannot be drawn unfortunately it is not detailed in the paper how the fraction of spiking mps is selected and the set concentration 60 to 200 mg mps 4 liter is very high and overrepresenting the total mass of particles that are usually measured in wastewater treatment plants wwtps bannick et al 2018 prepared an artificial water medium for validation tests using different organic and inorganic materials for reference mps they used commercially available pe and cryomilled ps granulate 60 mg of each particle type were incubated in 500 ml surface water for seven days then added to 150 liters of water in a steel barrel they reported that these spiking concentrations correspond with earlier results obtained from wwtps the content of the barrel was pumped through different mesh size steel filter plates in a well designed sampling system where plastic spare parts were eliminated the samples were analyzed by thermoextraction desorption gc ms ted gc ms recovery rates show high efficiency both for pe and ps 81 and 110 respectively similarly to ziajahromi et al 2017 and bannick et al 2018 validated the complete sampling process the use of an artificial water medium is a more realistic environmental model however as the whole content of the barrel was filtered through the system this test does not answer how many of the environmentally present particles are sampled this test gives an overview of the recovery of those particles that are entering the suction valve in the report a general sampling depth of 50 cm is described but the effect of the sampling depth on the recovery cannot be examined as the whole content of the barrel was used the study paves the way for further sampling validations where not only particles with low densities applied and the sampling depth could be considered funck et al 2020 used a closed pressurized filter cascade for the sampling of wastewater they performed validation of the sampling system in a 1 m3 ibc intermediate bulk container tank filled with tap water and 10 grams of each reference material during each replicate the whole content of the tank was filtered then the container was immediately refilled with 1 m3 of tap water and this volume was filtered as well the sampling system was washed out between the three replicates the recovery was gravimetrically determined averages of different size categories ranged between 85 88 the test system was well designed and plastic free but tap water contamination and ibc tank disintegration due to mechanical use during sampling could cause slight differences similar to bannick et al 2018 the whole sampling system was validated the whole content of the tank was filtered and only low density polymers were used which is a limitation of these results hildebrandt et al 2019 conducted lab scale validation on a sampling system that is not based on filtration but continuous flow centrifugation cfc similarly to bannick et al 2018 they incubated the particles in a surface water sample to better represent real life mps high amounts of the reference materials 1 5 grams were suspended in low volumes final volume 0 8 2 liters of liquid media and then solutions were exposed to the cfc recoveries were over 95 measured by the mass of particles as it can be concluded based on the overview of scientific literature and also highlighted by silva et al 2018 only a low number of research articles on mps are targeting both quality control and quality assurance they also emphasize that other analytical parameters such as precision trueness selectivity specificity limit of detection and sensitivity which are required for the validation of analytical methods used for the determination of environmental contaminants are currently not established for the validation protocols of applied analytical quantification techniques of microplastics validation of sample preparation methods with recovery measurements is very important to steer the microplastic research towards a standardized analysis to gather comparable data besides providing information on the effectiveness of the applied method we can better understand the relation of the measured data to the real environmental concentration for this better understanding it is vital to get detailed information on the sampling methods to determine how efficient is the sampling of microplastics in the environment despite the importance of sampling efficiency measures until now only a few studies investigated the recovery capabilities of mp sampling which will be summarized in table 4 in the discussion section to help better comparision with the results of the current study our research aimed to take a step forward and gather data on cascade filtration recoveries by modeling different turbulance conditions and sampling depth and obtain large sample quantities from a medium that is spiked with mps in environmentally relevant concentrations 2 materials methods 2 1 preparation of microplastic particles the efficiency recovery rate of the sampling device was tested in a controlled test environment with the addition of an known number of microplastic reference materials of various types sizes and shapes as such particles are not available on the market only in the form of microbeads or powders first these environmentally relevant particles had to be produced plastic fragments were prepared with cryogenic grinding as input material commercial polypropylene pp low density polyethylene ldpe polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyethylene terephthalate pet foils films were chosen pp ldpe and pvc foils were obtained from a commercial packaging store pet film was cut from mineral water bottles as there was no producer provided data on their density and thickness particles were measured in triplicates with a pycnometer in ethanol medium density and a micrometer thickness original materials were first cut into fragments of 0 5 1 cm size in diameter then placed in a retsch cryomill the system was cooled with liquid nitrogen therefore the melting of the plastic could be avoided the settings of the mill were pre cooling for 120 seconds with 1 s 1 frequency grinding for 120 180 seconds with 25 30 1 s 1 frequency the procedure was repeated twice only soft pvc films needed one cycle after grinding a series of retch s sieves with 100 mm diameter was used to separate fractions 500 µm 500 300 µm 300 100 µm 100 50 µm fractions were collected in pre cleaned petri dishes for the sampling validation 300 100 µm fraction was used this size range is reported many times from the aquatic environment either sampling with manta nets or filter cascades bordós et al 2019 besides the plastic foils three different types of plastic fibers kaposplast ltd hungary were used as microfibers are not commercially available our group had to produce these such production methods resulting small fibers in a standard way are present but rarely described cole 2016 frehland et al 2020 but hand cut microfibers are often used cole et al 2014 quinn et al 2017 caron et al 2018 vermerien et al 2020 the used plastics were made of pp polyamide pa and pet and were cut into 1 1 5 mm length also commercially available pe microbeads with fluorescent labeling cospheric llc were used to have spherical mps in the test system the used reference microplastics and their properties are summarized in table 1 thirty pieces of each reference material in total 240 particles were picked with forceps under a dino lite edge am4115tl 10 140x magnification optical microscope and thenadded to a 40 ml epa vial and suspended in 0 1 tween 80 sigma aldrich usa solution images of all particles used in the test system have been taken under dino lite edge am4115tl optical microscope at 100x magnification these are presented in the supplementary information si 2 further scanning electron microscope sem images were taken from the cryomilled particles fragments by a jeol jsm 5500lv scanning electron microscope in high vacuum mode with a secondary electron detector adhesive carbon tape was used to fix the samples on copper sample holders to prevent them from charging they were sputtered with an au pd layer the images are shown in the supplementary information si 3 2 2 sampling tests in controlled test environment the device used for the sampling test is the improved version of the system that has been described by bordós et al 2019 for the sampling tests cylindrical stainless steel filters 50 and 25 µm in metal housings were connected in a cascade and were operated with a jet pump plastic spare parts were excluded from the system rubber hoses seals metal fittings and suction valve were used on every occasion water flow was always measured with a water meter with 0 1 l precision in every repetition 1 500 l water was sampled with a flow rate of 65 l min the sampling tests were conducted in a one meter wide one meter high and three meters long stainless steel tank with food processing quality the tank was filled with 2 400 liters of tap water prefiltered with a 15 µm mesh size stainless steel filter to avoid mp contamination in the size range of the test materials when the water level reached 1 500 liters in the tank the content of the prepared reference mp dispersion 30 particles of each material in total 240 particles was added and a stirrer 22 rpm was started and operated until reaching the final 2 400 liters to homogenize the tank s content the final mp concentration was 100 particles m3 which is environmentally relevant in case of freshwaters usually few tens or few hundred particles per 1 000 l sample reported zhao et al 2014 mani et al 2015 wang et al 2017 sampling tests were conducted in different depths and with different stirring conditions in the stainless steel tank the suction valve was either kept constantly 10 cm below the water surface or on halfway between the surface and the bottom in line with water level decrease referred to as half water column sampling to model different turbulance conditions during the tests there were a no stirring b periodic or c continuous stirring if no stirring was applied sampling only started 30 minutes after the homogenization to let the particles distribute on the natural way without disturbance when stirring was periodical the stirrer was operated for 10 seconds per minute every setup that are presented in table 2 and a blind test without mps were conducted in three independent replications after each repetition the tank was cleaned twice thoroughly with filtered water before the next replicate compared to other studies a huge advantage of our setup was the filtration of the used tap water before the experiment for the prevention of cross contamination since we were spiking with environmentally relevant concentrations and measuring numbers of particles instead of the total mass of polymers all confounding factors had to be eliminated 2 3 identification of microplastics after filtration tests the content of the filters and filter housings were thoroughly rinsed in a pre cleaned beaker with filtered 5 µm deionized water then it was filtered on a whatman anodisc 25 mm in diameter 0 02 µm pore size inorganic filter membrane obtained from merck the filters were dried with ethanol 96 and first investigated under an optical microscope dino lite edge am4115tl 10 140x magnification with uv light op uv led 365 nm to enumerate the fluorescent microbeads then analyzed with a fourier transform ft spectrophotometer microscope system in the near infrared nir region the used equipment was perkinelmer spectrum 400 ft ir ft nir spectrophotometer coupled to a perkinelmer spotlight 400 ft ir ft nir microscope imaging system attachment perkinelmer inc waltham ma usa the microscope was equipped with mct mercury cadmium telluride array detector the spectra acquisition was performed in transmission mode with image sampling mode samples on anodisc filters were taken into two quartz replacement windows foss nirsystems inc silver spring md usa tightly held by tweezers background measurements of the anodisc filters were conducted and also results were correlated with this background 15 and 4 scans at the background and the

4000 cm 1 pixel size was set to 25 µm this means the smallest applied reference particle will appear in multiple pixels that improves shape and material analysis the measurement time for each filter

near infrared wavelength range between 1000 and 4000 cm 1 data collection was performed with spectrum 6 3 2 software perkinelmer inc waltham ma usa for data analysis perkinelmer spectrumimage and imagej 1 52a software rasband w s imagej u s national institutes of health bethesda maryland usa were used only particles with a correlation of over 80 were accepted after automated image analysis a visual inspection was conducted to validate and revise the results e g overlapping fibers of same polymeric materials are recognized by the software as one single particle during laboratory work strict precautions were taken to avoid sample contamination as much as possible whenever it was possible sample processing steps were conducted under a laminar airflow cabinet for all sample processing and glassware cleaning steps filtered 5 µm pore size stainless steel filter deionized water was used samples were always covered with aluminum foil or kept in glass petri dishes during the work cotton laboratory coat was worn besides general cleaning benchtops and cabinets were regularly wiped 2 4 supplementary measurements in this experiment a multiple step validation approach was followed not only recoveries from simulated samplings have been measured but supplementary tests were conducted to better understand the origin of the possible particle loss during the recovery measures a schematic flow diagram of the multiple step validation is presented in fig 1 as the main experiment was focusing on the relation of mp concentration in the tank compared to the final filtrate mp number instead of filtering the whole content of the tank further information had to be collected on the performance of the sampling device and the related intermediate steps for this two questions had to be answered a have all particles entering the suction valve reached the filter cascade and b have all of the collected particles on the filter cascade been washed efficiently to the final aluminum oxide filter in order to determine particle loss in the whole sampling system suction valve hoses fittings pump water meter a field experiment on the danube river was conducted the sampling system was set up and after the filtration of 500 l volume of river water 10 10 fluorescent microsphere obtained from cospheric 300 µm in diameter with a density of 0 98 and 1 2 g cm3 in 0 1 tween 80 solution was injected directly next to the suction valve with a pipette then further 500 l water was pumped through the system five repetitions were conducted filter cascades were opened in the laboratory rinsed to an 8 µm pore size 47 mm in diameter cellulose nitrate filter and fluorescent particles were enumerated under an optical microscope dino lite edge am4115tl 10 140x magnification using uv light op uv led 365 nm a blind test was also conducted with the injection of 0 1 tween 80 solution without reference particles particle loss occurring during the washing of the filters i e recovering the retained particles was evaluated in a laboratory experiment samples previously taken on the field free from any fluorescent microspheres were used the inflow socket was opened and 10 10 fluorescent microsphere obtained from cospheric 300 µm in diameter with a density of 0 98 and 1 2 g cm3 were rinsed into the filter housing with deionized water filter housings were closed and then placed on a linear shaker for 10 minutes on 170 rpm after this incubation filter housings were opened and both the filters and filter housings were rinsed to an 8 µm pore size 47 mm in diameter cellulose nitrate filter and fluorescent particles were enumerated under an optical microscope dino lite edge am4115tl 10 140x magnification using uv light op uv led 365 nm a blind test was also conducted without adding the reference particles 3 results 3 1 sampling validation in controlled test environment during our measurements we strived to set environmentally relevant mp concentrations and as we were using ir microscopy for the detection particle number approach was followed as filtrated volume was recorded precisely particle number could be calculated easily on a particle m3 basis in the sample the reported recovery rates were calculated from the original concentration 100 particles m3 and the measured data blank measures were conducted in the setup of surface sampling with continuous stirring only one pe fragment was found in every three repetitions as this setup resulted in the highest recoveries in the experimental part we can conclude based on the blank test results that the prefiltration of the tap water and all precautionary actions were successful to prevent background contamination the highest recovery results occurred during the continuous stirring of the tank which is a very optimistic setup in terms of environmental relevance it was designed to represent the best available homogenization here the average recovery of all polymers was the highest and reached 31 4 individual recovery of polymer types in an average of the three replications are 62 2 for pe 40 4 for pa 24 6 for pvc 20 2 for pet 9 7 for pp when the tank was periodically stirred or when no stirring was applied average recovery results for all plastic types were very close to each other no stirring values were a bit higher on the surface 9 9 compared to 9 5 and in half water column 7 2 compared to 5 1 when sampling depths are compared it can be concluded that surface sampling resulted in higher recovery values under all turbulance conditions the results are shown in fig 2 regarding polymer types and their density pe particles with low density clearly showed the highest recovery in all setups in average 29 7 at fragments 0 95 g cm3 and 24 9 at spheres 1 2 g cm3 highest value reached 92 4 for pe spheres surface sampling and continuous stirring while lowest individual value was recorded for pet and pp fragments and pp fibers since in some setups none of these mps were recovered particles with higher density such as pa fibers 16 9 pet fibers 11 6 and pvc fragments 8 5 are extracted better than low density pp particles fibers and fragments 4 6 and 1 8 respectively without considering polymer shape descending order of average recoveries are pe 27 3 range 11 5 62 2 pa 16 9 range 7 1 40 4 pvc 8 5 range 1 8 24 6 pet 7 4 range 2 7 20 2 pp 3 2 range 0 9 9 7 except pp these results indicate decreasing tendency of recovery for mps with higher density pe 0 95 g cm3 pe 1 2 g cm3 pa 1 14 g cm3 pet 1 3 g cm3 pvc 1 29 g cm3 pet 1 37 g cm3 interestingly low density pp fibers and fargments are recovered less 4 6 and 1 8 respectively than particles with higher density such as pa fibers 16 9 pet fibers 11 6 and pvc fragments 8 5 the results are presented in fig 2 and table 3 during setups sn and hn surface and half water column sampling without stirring an additional type of microsphere was used so in this system pe spheres with similar diameter but with different density 1 2 and 0 98 g cm3 were tested this helped to compare polymer density effect on recovery when no disturbance i e flow in the test environment occurred based on our results mps with a higher density were recovered with a lower rate both in surface sampling 7 1 and half water column sampling 0 than low density spheres 35 5 and 12 4 respectively in the experiments pp and pet were both used in different shapes fibers fragments but with the same density per polymer type polymers with the same density could be recovered differently due to the effect of size and or shape recovery of pp fibers and fragments is in the same range 4 6 and 1 8 respectively but there is a big gap in pet recovery 11 6 of fibers were recovered while fragments only yielded 3 2 as presented in fig 2 and table 3 when we look at the recovery results of the current sampling validation considering the shape of the polymers we can conclude that microspheres have the highest average recovery rates 24 9 recovery for fibers and fragments are much lower 11 0 and 10 8 respectively as presented on fig 2 our results support the opinion that studies applying only microspheres as reference material might be optimistic and overestimate the recovering capacity of the method for real life particles 3 2 supplementary measurements the aim of our experimental design was to filter only a part of the water in the tanks so filtration efficiency from the environment i e sampling could be modeled as not the whole content of the tank was filtered potential particle losses of the sampling system should be measured separately in this experiment commercially available fluorescent microspheres were used because these are easy to handle identification under uv light with an optical microscope is fast and no background contamination from environmental matrices is expected tagged spheres like these could be a good choice when quality assurance quality control of sampling and sample preparation is considered the results of the particle loss measurements with direct injection next to the suction valve show that low density particles are recovered on an average over 95 while particle with higher density recovered on an average of 63 as no significant loss occurs during the washing of the filters 95 recovery was recorded for both types of reference particles this means that there could be a moderate loss of more dense particles in the sampling system or during the direct injection process these particles rather sink than penetrate the suction valve for higher recovery of these particles possibly stronger suction would be needed blank experiments resulted in no recovery in any tests 4 discussion all the parameters investigated during this work are compared to the literature in table 4 and will be discussed in detail in the followings 4 1 shapes and sizes of microplastics particles applied in the presented sampling validation test covered a wide range both in shape and in polymer type the goal was to cover the three main shapes of microplastics spheres fragments fibers during the experiments and thus to represent environmentally relevant particles as well this is an important step as currently commercially available spheres pellets are probably the most popular in not only the sample preparation validation quinn et al 2017 hurley et al 2018 wiggin and holland 2019 but in sampling validation tests as well bannick et al 2018 hildebrandt et al 2019 funck et al 2020 beyond microspheres ground polymers i e fragments that are environmentally more relevant were also used ziajahromi et al 2017 bannick et al 2018 until now fibers were only applied in sample preparation validation cole et al 2014 quinn et al 2017 caron et al 2018 hurley et al 2018 but no data are available on fiber recovery during sampling validation in the case of fibers we applied hand cut pieces as this production method is used currently in other studies with the similar size range of fibers as used in the current research cole et al 2014 caron et al 2018 these particles might not represent all environmentally relevant fibers the best e g small microfibers from the washing of synthetic clothes air deposition but simulate microfibers from syntehetic ropes fishing lines and nets currently only a few technique is available to prepare smaller microfibers in a standard way and these have to be emphasized in the future cole 2016 frehland et al 2020 the use of environmentally more relevant mps is very important we found that in the same conditions microspheres are recovered better as fragments or fibers this result supports the opinion that studies applying only microspheres as reference material might be optimistic and overestimate the recovering capacity of the method for real life particles a possible reason for lower recovery of fragments could be poor hydrodynamic properties and agglomeration of the particles due to the flake like shapes and irregular edges as this can be seen in the sem images in the supplementary information si 3 due to these properties particles might also get sticked to the tank s surface water tank layer surface tension the surface of the spheres and fibers applied in the current study is more smooth as presented in the supplementary information si 2 probably this enhances the recovery when smaller fibers in diameter would be used presumably agglomeration would be also an issue there due to the curly shape of these filaments e g entanglement of mps released from laundry interestingly even if microfiber standards are produced in the smaller size range such as presented by cole 2016 and frehland et al 2020 these fibers are still tend to be more straight than curly also with smooth edges similarly to the shape of those that were applied in the current study beyond the shape of the used mps further steps could be taken in the future to environmentally more relevant validation if not only virgin particles but preincubated bannick et al 2018 hildebrandt et al 2019 or weathered mps are used 4 2 effect of polymer size on recovery in our study there is a limitation to compare the effect of polymer size on recovery as only pp and pet were used in different sizes 100 300 µm fragments and 1000 1500 mm fibers similar to earlier studies hengstmann et al 2018 hurley et al 2018 silva et al 2018 wiggin and holland 2019 average percentage of recovery decreased parallelly with the size class of particles the relation of the recovery of pp fibers and fragments 4 6 and 1 8 respectively is similar to pet fibers and fragments 11 6 and 3 2 respectively there is a further limitation as particle shape is also different even though if fibers are rather thick and not simulating laundry originated mps fragmentation of polymers might cause an error as well but this has not been tackled in any sampling validation study yet and neither could be measured in the frame of this research 4 3 effect of polymer density on recovery although some studies during sample preparation investigated the effect of polymer densities on recovery quinn et al 2017 hurley et al 2018 this was never targeted in sampling validation of fractionated filtration before usually these studies are focusing on recovering individual polymer types such as ps ziajahromi et al 2017 or pe particles funck et al 2020 bannick et al 2018 investigated both pe and ps and also found differences in recovery but the density of the applied reference materials was not specified in our study seven of the applied reference materials had different density and except pp results showed decreasing recovery for mps with higher density this indicates a particle loss due to sedimentation 4 4 different approaches of validation tests according to the literature a high and environmentally not occurring load of mps was applied to conduct a representative gravimetric analysis during most of the validation tests bannick et al 2018 stated environmentally representative concentrations and the recovery measures were conducted with ted gc ms instead of gravimetry we also strived to set environmentally relevant mp concentrations and as we were using ir microscopy for the detection particle number approach was followed in these systems where particle numbers are much lower are very sensitive for any disturbance this means precaution on mp pollution prevention had to be taken we used pretreated water i e filtered from mps but none of the fractionated filtration validation studies have done this before the background contamination coming from tap water is probably negligible when high environmentally not relevant masses of reference particles are applied funck et al 2020 but as the recovery is measured gravimetrically and several liters of water is filtered total suspended solid content of the tap water may cause a huge unexpected error in the measurements this may influence the measurement up to adding 40 mg l total suspended solids to the measurement chen et al 2020 during sampling validation of fractionated filtration where the whole content of the experimental tank is filtered ziajahromi et al 2017 bannick et al 2018 funck et al 2020 losses can occur only in the sampling device so no information can be obtained on sampling efficiency from the environment in our study we presented the first validation of a fractionated filtration sampling system where the efficiency of the whole sampling process is investigated for this only a certain volume 1 500 l which has already been applied in the field by setälä et al 2016 and mintenig et al 2017 of the experimental tank was filtered according to the supplementary measurements on filtration efficiency and filter washing we can conclude that system based particle loss is not high when commercially available microspheres are used this indicates that the results of the sampling experiment are concerning the losses of particles in different setups instead of the losses of the sampling device in the recovery tests we have targeted a higher flow rate 65 l min than bannick et al 2018 5 6 l min because this ensures compatibility to effective field sampling where large volumes are concentrated during a relatively short period recoveries were calculated on the sample volume basis the experiment enables us to consider the natural distribution of particles in water bodies in different turbulance conditions and is able to quantify the rate of microplastic recovery from the environment i e the number of particles that can be collected by the suction valve 4 5 comparision of sampling depth and turbulence conditions a further novelty of this study that different sampling depth and turbulance conditions were compared different turbulance conditions were meant to represent different lakes and rivers where the distribution of mps is not only described by their density but other parameters such as turbulences as well no straight correlation could be observed in recovery rates when the tank was stirred periodically and when no stirring was applied a continuous stirring triplicate sampling was conducted to evaluate the sampling device s recovery capacity in optimal conditions where the content of the tank is the most homogenous distribution of mps in surface waters is also affecting the sampling depth one advantage of pump based fractionated filtration sampling that sampling depth can be easily chosen from the surface to deeper layers of the water column but there is no information available which is the more effective in our study we aimed to investigate this and found that surface layer sampling always yielded more mps on average as half water column sampling did 5 conclusion the validation test presented above was designed to qualify a cascade filtration sampling device s recovery rate from an environmentally representative model as a novelty the goal of the investigation was to reveal the number of particles entering and passing through the system from a known concentration of mp dispersion tests were conducted in a closed system where different mps were applied with concentrations similar to the detection levels in the environment particle number approach different turbulance conditions were generated and the effect of sampling depth was also investigated water surface half water column large quantities were applied and instead of filtering the whole content of the tank 2 400 l samples were taken such as during real life surface water sampling 1 500 l water was filtered it can be concluded from the test results that surface sampling resulted in higher recovery values under all turbulance conditions when no stirring or periodical stirring was applied mps were recovered from the surface on average 9 9 and 9 5 while from the half water column 7 2 and 5 1 respectively these turbulance conditions were designed to model river and lake conditions as it was experienced during the tests fluorescent microplastics could be a good choice as surrogate standards when quality assurance quality control of sampling and sample preparation is considered but spheres cannot be used as a single reference material to describe comprehensively recovery efficiency of any systems the currently tested system aimed to take a step towards modeling natural systems with its different flow conditions and the diverse mp particles used in these tests we found that the preset concentration of mps in the tank was 3 10 times higher than that of the samples this helps to better understand the relation between the reported mp values and the real environmental concentration to better understand this relation between measured data and the real environmental concentrations further improvements are necessary on the model system reference particles should be produced in all shapes from all polymer types to investigate their agglomeration potential and their dispersion hydrodynamics in the tank size ranges of the used mps should be lowered to give results on other environmentally and also ecotoxicologically relevant fractions a comprehensive multiple steps validation approach is needed to determine the efficiency of different mp sampling sample preparation and analysis methods in the future these measures are necessary prerequisites of standardization

17327,coagulation flocculation is one of the most extensive and cost effective pretreatments to improve the dewaterability of sludge in water treatment plants in this study three series of graft cationic starch st based flocculants with distinct structural characteristics including charge density cd graft chain length l and graft chain distribution n were synthesized by graft copolymerization of 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and acrylamide onto st backbone the structural effects of these st based flocculants on the sludge dewaterability have been quantitatively analyzed by using a second order polynomial model according to phenomenological theory the predicted dewatering performance and optimal dose were fully consistent with the experimental results on the basis of this established model the dewatering mechanisms were discussed in detail by combination of the analysis of the changes in filter cake moisture content specific resistance of filtration bound water content compression coefficient extracellular polymeric substances fractions and components spatial distributions of proteins and polysaccharides microstructures of sludge cake and flocs properties in the dewatering process this graft st based flocculant with the structural characteristics of high cd long l and low n exhibited superior sludge dewaterability because of the enhanced charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects among these three structural factors cd played a more important role in improvement of sludge dewaterability than l and n due to the dominant effect of charge neutralization this study provided a better understanding of structure activity relationship of these grafting modified flocculants which was of significant guidance for the exploit

recent decades with strict environmental management which is a key challenge in wastewater treatment plants wwtps for populated urban areas christensen et al 2015 huge quantities of was consisting of over 90 water content heavy metal and various persistent organic pollutants cause great economic and environmental burden christensen et al 2015 swierczek et al 2018 wei et al 2018a the components of was especially extracellular polymeric substances eps contain numerous hydrophilic materials that are highly hydrated and capture a large amount of water which cause considerable difficulty in acquiring effective sludge dewatering li et al 2007 sheng et al 2010 coagulation flocculation is a simple and inexpensive pretreatment technique prior to mechanical dewatering that can effectively improve dewatering efficiency to reduce the volume of sludge and the cost of transportation and handling effectively through coagulating and flocculating negatively charged sludge colloids wang et al 2013 wei et al 2018a zhang et al 2017 however currently commercial coagulants and flocculants such as aluminum and ferric coagulants and polyacrylamide based flocculants may shorten the service life of the wastewater treatment equipment due to the hydrolysis acidification of inorganic coagulants and cause the secondary pollution risks because of the residual metal ions and acrylamide monomer in treated waters adewole and muritala 2019 jin et al 2019 kim et al 2016 mowla et al 2013 wei et al 2018a b hence there is an urgent need to develop environmental friendly economical and high efficient flocculants in sludge treatment recently considerable increment of energy demands and environmental requirements has promoted the development of natural polymeric renewable resources adewole and muritala 2019 wei et al 2018a the popular natural polymers such as starch st chitosan and cellulose have widely attracted attention due to their environmental friendliness and high efficiency bratskaya et al 2004 fanta 1973 lan et al 2018 lee et al 2015 yang et al 2016 zheng et al 2020 among them st is considered as one of the most promising natural polymers because of its outstanding advantages including low cost and easy availability which can be flexibly modified to prepare various flocculants with different structures jin et al 2019 meshram et al 2009 wang et al 2013 among various common chemical modifications bratskaya et al 2004 rani et al 2012 song et al 2009 wei et al 2018b wu et al 2016 graft copolymerization is a popular and effective way to introduce various branch chains containing different specifically functional groups onto the polymeric backbone therefore drastically improving their application performance fanta 1973 ryno et al 2014 zheng et al 2020 the flocculants with different structural features show distinct sludge dewatering performance since the final application performance of a material including flocculants entirely relies on its internal molecular structure huang et al 2019 mierczynska vasilev et al 2013 volkenstein 1985 yang et al 2016 nevertheless previous research on the structural factors of graft polymeric flocculants have mainly concerned with the types of functional groups and the selectivity of graft monomers liu et al 2020 wu et al 2020 aiming at the structural characteristics of sludge researchers found that increase of positive charge density and suitable grafting of some hydrophobic groups in polymeric flocculants were beneficial to improvement of sludge dewatering liu et al 2020 wu et al 2020 however the contributions of some more fine structural factors of graft polymeric flocculants such as graft chain length l and graft chain distribution n to sludge dewatering were failed to study in detail until now chen et al 2018 lv et al 2014 wei et al 2018a besides previous works involved in the effects of flocculants molecular structure on dewatering performance have mainly focused on qualitative analysis and few study has reported the quantitative structure activity relationship between graft polymeric flocculants and their dewaterability in this work three series of graft st based flocculants with different charge density cd ls and ns were designed and synthesized and each series of the graft flocculants was kept with only one structural parameter being varied by controlling the variably synthetic conditions to reveal the structure activity relationship of this graft starch based flocculant in sludge dewatering process the sludge dewatering performance of these st based flocculants were characterized by filter cake moisture content fcmc and specific resistance of filtration srf in addition the dewatering mechanisms were elucidated by combining fcmc srf bound water content compression coefficient eps fractions and components spatial distributions of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps microstructures of sludge cake and flocs properties in the dewatering process finally a second order polynomial model on the basis of phenomenological theory ginzburg 1950 was introduced to quantitatively analyze the dewatering mechanisms and predict the fcmc and optimal dose 2

before the graft copolymerization st was slightly modified by cta through etherification to improve its solubility and was recorded as cs then three series of co graft st based flocculants with distinct cds ls and ns namely cs cd1 cs cd7 cs cd1 l1 cs cd1 l5 and cs cd1 n1 cs cd1 n5 respectively were designed and obtained by controlling of the fed mass ratio of two monomers and initiator in graft copolymerization according to our previous work hu et al 2020 the detailed preparation conditions were listed in table 1 the cd of the flocculants were detected by colloid titration hu et al 2020 wei et al 2018b the molecular structures of those st based flocculants were basically characterized by ftir bruker model ifs 66 s and 1h nmr bruker ascend 400 which were showed in supporting information figs s1 and s2 respectively and discussed in detail in supporting information text s1 2 2 2 evaluation of grafted chain length and distribution the l and n of st based flocculants was characterized by the average number of grafted monomers per graft chain and grafted chain per starch chain respectively according to our previous report these two structural parameters can be roughly evaluated using eqs 1 and 2 based on some theoretical assumptions due to the evident difficulty in their detections using current characterization methods since various environmental factors can affect the synthesis efficiency and structural characteristics hu et al 2020 yu et al 2018 the initiation efficiency of aps was assumed to remain constant according to the grafting reaction time of 3 0 h and the half life of aps of about 60 0 h in this case fmc corporation 2001 the percentage of the actual disassociated aps was about 3 4 in addition each aps decomposition can get two free radicals and each initiated free radical was assumed to effectively propagate a graft chain which means that n was twice the initiated aps besides all monomers am and dmc were randomly grafted onto starch backbone in graft copolymerization since the actual reaction yields all exceeded 90 the detailed calculation processes for l and n were presented in supporting information text s2 all the theoretically estimated n and l values as listed in table 1 were considered to be comparable to the corresponding real values because all st based flocculants were obtained under the same external

membrane bioreactor the moisture content and the ratio of volatile suspended solids vss to total suspended solids tss vss tss were 98 5 and 43 0 0 9 respectively analyzed according to apha 1998 table

completed in 5 days and dewatering test for each group used the same was sample 2 3 2 sludge conditioning the stock solution of st based flocculants with the concentration of 3 0 g l was freshly prepared by directly dissolving a known amount of solid flocculants in water for the following dewatering experiments in the conditioning process a certain amount of flocculant solution was added to an aliquot of 100 ml of sludge and then was reacted in a program controlled paddle apparatus model ta6 wuhan hengling technology co ltd under a rapid stirring of 250 rpm for 1 0 min followed by a low agitation at 50 rpm for 5 0 min the fcmc srf bound water content compressibility floc properties zeta potential and characteristics of eps were carefully measured by the following methods 2 3 3 sludge dewatering as a major criterion for assessing the dewatering effect of sludge the fcmc was taken under consideration after dewatering the sludge cake was dried at 105 c in a laboratory drying oven to determine the fcmc in accordance with the standard method meanwhile the filterability of sludge was evaluated by means of srf chen et al 2015 wei et al 2018b the conditioned sludge suspension 100 ml was filtered using a buchner funnel with 0 45 µm filter and a constant pressure of 0 05 mpa was applied by a vacuum pump the volume of filtrate was continuously recorded every 10 s before breaking the vacuum state or terminate the filtering after 7 0 min the dewatering equipment was schematically described in supporting information fig s3 the srf of the was sample was calculated by 3 s r f 2 p a 2 b μ ω where p n m2 denotes pressure a m2 is the filter area b s m6 indicates the slope of filtrate discharge curve μ n s m2 is kinetic viscosity and ω kg m3 represents dry solid weight per unit volume sludge on the filtrate media the sludge cake compressibility was evaluated by the compressibility coefficient s which was obtained by fitting data using eq 4 cao et al 2016 qi et al 2011 4 s r f 1 s r f 2 p 1 p 2 s where srf 1 and srf 2 are the specific resistance to filtration under two different pressures p 1 and p 2 i e 0 03 and 0 05 mpa here respectively 2 4 floc properties the floc size and compactness were also measured according to our previous studies hu et al 2020 wei et al 2018b a and l represent the projected area and characteristic length of the sludge floc respectively the two dimensional fractal dimension d 2 of floc using image analysis was calculated through linear fitting of the slope of log a versus log l based on eq 5 5 a l d 2 furthermore the zeta potentials of sludge conditioned by different st based flocculants at their optimal doses were detected by a zetasizer nano z malvern uk the surface morphologies of flocs were directly observed using a scanning electron microscope sem fei quanta 250 the sludge flocs need to be preprocessed by freeze drying treatment under vacuum at 60 c for 72 h the content of bound water in sludge cake was measured by a differential scanning calorimetry analyzer ta us and the experimental methods referred to the literature li et al 2020 wei et al 2019a 2 5 eps fractionation and characterization 2 5 1 extraction of eps the eps including soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were extracted from conditioned and raw was by a modified heat extraction method niu et al 2013 wei et al 2018b firstly the sludge sample was centrifuged at 764 7 g for 10 0 min and the supernatant was considered to s eps then the sludge pellet in the centrifuge tube was re suspended into a 10 ml of 0 05 nacl aqueous solution sonicated at 20 khz for 2 0 min shaken horizontally at 150 rpm for 10 0 min sonicated again for 2 0 min centrifuged at 2124 g for 10 0 min the collected supernatant was lb eps finally the re suspended pellet was sonicated for 3 0 min heated for 30 0 min at 60 c centrifuged at 5438 g for 10 0 min and separated as tb eps the eps solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane prior to organic analysis 2 5 2 analysis of eps the dissolved organic carbon in eps fraction was measured using a total organic carbon toc analyzer with an automatic sampling system aurora 1030 w usa pn contents were measured using a uv 2600a spectrometer unico usa with bovine serum albumin as the standard substance bradford 1976 kim et al 2016 the absorbance of the pn solution was measured at the wavelength of 595 nm after it turned cyan with the solution of coomassie brilliant blue g 250 for 2 0 min ps concentrations were measured and analyzed using anthrone method frolund et al 1996 ps reacted with anthrone into blue green color and the absorbance was detected at the maximum absorption wavelength of 620 nm on the basis of a previously measured standard curve ps concentrations can be estimated a zeiss lsm 710 confocal laser scanning microscope clsm germany was used to analyze the spatial distributions of pn and ps in sludge flocs the pn and ps are dyed to green and blue by using fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc and calcofluor white m2r respectively ai et al 2019 chen et al 2020 kim et al 2016 the detailed operation process was as follows 1 the sludge samples were placed in 1 5 ml tubes and resuspended in 1 0 ml of freshly prepared 2 nmorpholino ethanesulfonic acid mes buffer solution 2 100 μl of 0 1 mol l fitc dissolved in n n dimethylformamide was added and then mixed with 100 μl of 0 1 mol l calcofluor white m2r 3 the mixture was dyed in darkness at room temperature for 2 h and the samples were repeatedly rinsed with deionized water and then dispersed in 1 0 ml mes and 4 the ar kr laser light source with a fluorescein filter provided excitation at 488 nm and 405 nm for pn and ps respectively samples were observed through a 100

2400 nm min with 5 nm of emission and excitation slit bandwidths 3 results and discussion three series of graft st based flocculants with different structural features were synthesized and used to treat municipal sludge and further explore the relationship between the structure and performance of grafted flocculants in sludge dewatering process and the detailed structural parameters of various st based flocculants and its dewatering performance at their optimal doses including srf fcmc zeta potential s and sludge flocs properties are all listed in table 1 scheme 1 roughly describes the different structural morphologies of the various st based flocculants schematically including the high or low cd long or short l and sparse or dense n 3 1 effect of cd 3 1 1 effect of cd on sludge dewatering seven cs cds cs cd1 cs cd7 with different cds but the same l and n were first used to investigate the effect of cd on sludge dewatering fig 1 a and b showed that the srf and fcmc of sludge conditioned by each cs cd all decreased rapidly at the beginning and then reached a plateau with the increase of dose indicating these st based flocculants presented good dewatering performance in addition the dewatering performance of seven cs cds was completely proportional to their cds and flocculants with higher cd can obtain lower srf and fcmc in addition to smaller optimal dose according to fig 1a b and table 1 the srf and fcmc of sludge conditioned by cs cd7 with the highest cd approximately 4 061 mmol g in this work can be reduced from 13 01 1012 m kg and 97 05 to 2 06 1012 m kg and 83 09 respectively at the smallest optimal dose of 6 0 mg g tss cs cds with higher cd than cs cd7 can t be tried here because of the difficulty in practical preparation and relative poor water solubility besides the contents of bound water in sludge cake decreased with the increase of the st based flocculants cd and were consistent with the fcmc according to table 1 which was due to more efficient aggregation of sludge flocs conditioned by cs cds with higher contents of cationic quaternary ammonium groups resulting in more effective extrusion and release of bound water wei et al 2019a besides the zeta potentials of sludge obviously increased when these cationic st based flocculants were conditioned as shown in table 1 at their optimal doses cs cd7 led to a maximum increase from 12 7 to 2 39 mv these finding illustrated the increase of cd was beneficial to sludge dewatering and charge neutralization played a leading role in dewatering process on account of negatively charged characteristics of sludge liu et al 2020 wei et al 2018b wu et al 2020 in addition to srf and fcmc the microstructures of sludge including sludge floc properties and the surface morphologies of final sludge cakes are essential to evaluate the dewatering effects of flocculants in wwtps moghaddam et al 2010 in comparison with the sludge floc properties of raw sludge the l and d 2 of sludge flocs treated by various cs cds at their optimal doses were all increased evidently according to table 1 indicating large and compact sludge flocs were obtained after conditioning besides the graft starch based flocculants with higher cd caused larger l and higher d 2 because of the enhanced not only charge neutralization but also bridging flocculation effects the improved intramolecular repulsion of cs cd with a high content of cationic groups on the branch chains usually resulted in a more extended conformation of polymeric flocculant in solution and thus an enhanced bridging flocculation effect scheme 1 flory 1953 yang et al 2016 moreover the surface morphologies of sludge cakes as accumulated sludge flocs were directly observed under sem supporting information fig s4 a s4 h consistently the microstructures of sludge cakes turned from relatively flat and smooth without channels and voids to rough and porous after conditioned by cs cds especially for those with high cd resulting in good water permeability and high dewaterability wang et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 it might be due to that large sludge flocs obtained by cs cds with high cd could not be closely packed and cause a final rough and porous microstructures of sludge cakes besides the measured s of sludge filter cakes supporting information fig s5 and table 1 further confirmed that cs cds with relatively high cd such as cs cd6 and cs cd7 had low s and improved compressibility different from normal synthetic polymeric flocculants this graft st based flocculant exhibited a rigid rod chain conformation because of not only its polyelectrolyte s characteristics but also distinct glycocycle backbone scheme 1 flory 1953 thus cs cds can still act as skeleton builders partially wei et al 2018a cause more water drainage from the channels and voids in sludge cake and finally improve the compressibility and water permeability 3 1 2 effect of cd on eps eps is one of the main factors affecting sludge dewatering process forster 1971 poxon and darby 1997 and investigation of the variations in eps distribution and composition in depth is vital to well understand the internal dewatering mechanisms the toc pn and ps contents in three eps fractions of sludge conditioned by various cs cds at their optimal doses are shown in fig 1c and d in comparison to the raw sludge the toc contents in tb eps had just slightly decrease after conditioning while those in s eps and lb eps decreased notably besides the decrease levels of which were strongly associated with the cd of cs cds fig 1c moreover the change trends of the contents of the main organic components pn and ps in three eps fractions of sludge conditioned by different cs cds were roughly similar to those of their corresponded toc contents fig 1c and d the contents of pn and ps in s eps and lb eps decreased evidently and were closely related to the cds of conditioned cs cds based on clsm analysis fig 2 the distributions of pn and ps in sludge flocs turned concentrated and dense with the cds of conditioned cs cds besides a core shell like structure i e pn was embedded by ps was formed to facilitate the densification of eps through some more effective interactions between ps and this st based flocculant due to their similar molecular structures wei et al 2018b those phenomena indicated that the total eps especially s eps and lb eps were effectively compressed by cs cds due to the charge neutralization and bridging effects resulting in involved pn and ps being collapsed and aggregated release of trapped water and finally improved dewatering properties fig 1a and b christensen et al 2015 wei et al 2018b b zhang et al 2019 besides the obvious correlations between the enhanced dewatering performance and the decreased organic contents in s eps and lb eps confirmed that the dewaterability of sludge was mainly relevant to the pn and ps in s eps and lb eps but not in tb eps fraction fig 1a d which were full consistent with previous reports fmc corporation 2001 higgins and novak 1997 li and yang 2007 wei et al 2018b yu et al 2008 the 3d eem fluorescence technique due to its high selectivity and sensitivity was used for further analysis of various organic compounds with fluorescent properties in the three eps fractions of sludge conditioned by various cs cds supporting information fig s6 although 3d eem analysis can t reveal all components in eps baker 2001 chen et al 2003 jacquin et al 2017 3d eem fluorescence spectra were usually divided into 5 regions and the five fluorescent peaks were extracted and represent 5 types of substances including aromatic pn λex em 230 nm 340 nm peak a tryptophan like pn λex em 280 nm 350 nm peak b fulvic acid λex em 240 nm 420 nm peak c and humic substances λex em 350 nm 440 nm and 270 nm 450 nm at peaks d and e respectively chen et al 2003 jacquin et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 accordingly the intensities of the five fluorescent peaks are illustrated in fig 1e after adding cs cds the variation trends in intensities of peaks a and b namely pn like matters were basically consistent with those in the contents of pn in three eps fractions fig 1d the fluorescence intensity of the pn like matters in the s eps and lb eps fraction decreased significantly especially sludge conditioned by cs cds with high cd in addition the characteristic peaks c d and e were mainly ascribed to fulvic acid and humic substances chen et al 2003 jacquin et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 the intensities of these three peaks were relatively weak without notable changes after conditioning these results further confirmed these starch based flocculants mainly interacted with pn and ps in eps which were closely related to the finally dewatering performance 3 2 effects of l and n 3 2 1 effects of l and n on dewatering properties in addition to cd the l and n are also important structural factors of graft copolymers which impact on their application performance hu et al 2020 liu et al 2017 yu et al 2018 another two series of graft cationic st based flocculants cs cd1 ls and cs cd1 ns the former with the similar cd and n but different l while the latter with the similar cd and l but different n were thus tried to investigate the effects of l and n on sludge dewatering figs 3a 3b and figs 4a 4b the srf and fcmc of cs cd1 ls and cs cd1 ns exhibited similar decreasing trends to those of cs cds with the increase of flocculants dose besides in the measured ranges of l and n the effects of l and n on the dewatering performance were both slightly but the graft st based flocculants with larger l or with lower n caused relatively low optimal doses but improved srf and fcmc and reduced content of bound water in sludge cake fig 3 a b fig 4 a b and table 1 this finding indicated the chain architectures of graft polymeric flocculants with the characteristics of longer and sparser graft chains were beneficial to improve the dewatering properties the longer graft chains enhanced the adsorption bridging effects of this st based flocculant and thus improved the dewateribility of sludge however the graft polymeric flocculants with denser graft chains had the enhanced steric hindrance effects and the cationic graft chains on the st backbone with rigid rod chain conformation caused the sludge colloids and flocs uneasily to approach to the flocculants resulting in their inefficient interactions and relatively poor dewatering performance given the relative error of sludge flocs parameters l and d 2 had almost no changes with the l and n table 1 indicating the length and distribution of graft chain had less impact on the sludge flocs properties however the change trends of s were similar to those of srf and fcmc with l and n after conditioned by cs cd1 ls and cs cd1 ns at their optimal doses table 1 the longer and sparser graft chains on the st based flocculants partially acted as skeleton builders may cause more porous and channels in the sludge filter cakes supporting information fig s4 i s4 r due to the distinct spatial characteristics and thus improved the compressibility and final water permeability scheme 1 nevertheless in comprehensive comparison with various parameters of cs cds with different cds table 1 cd obviously played a more important role than l and n to the dewatering performance of these st based flocculants not only srf fcmc and bound water content but also the properties of sludge flocs and cakes 3 2 2 effect of l and n on eps the influences of l and n on eps fractions and compositions were further investigated and shown in fig 3c d and fig 4c d respectively the contents of toc pn and ps in different eps fractions after conditioned by cs cd1 ls and cs cd1 ns especially in s eps and lb eps roughly decreased with the increase of l fig 3c d but increased with the n fig 4c d besides the spatial distributions of pn and ps in sludge aggregates supporting information figs s7 and s8 showed that cs cd1 ls with long l and cs cd1 ns with low n caused more compact morphologies of pn and ps moreover according to the measured 3d eem spectra supporting information figs s9 and s10 the change trends for the fluorescence intensities of the pn like matters peaks a and b in s eps and lb eps fractions figs 3e and 4e were consistent with those for the pn contents with the changes of l and n in those graft flocculants figs 3d and 4d however the intensities of c d and e peaks corresponding to fulvic acid and humic substances were irregular combination of their sludge dewatering fig 3a b and fig 4a b the graft st based flocculants with relatively long or sparse graft chain exhibited superior enhanced dewatering performance due to their efficiently decreasing of organic contents in s eps and lb eps specifically pn and ps which were full consistent with previous studies li et al 2016 sheng et al 2010 and the results of cd effects discussed in section 3 1 2 in short the dewatering performance of this graft cationic st based flocculant mainly depended on the structural factors cd n and l however the effects of l and n on the eps and dewatering properties were all relatively weak in comparison with those of cd according to figs 1 4 and table 1 indicating cd had a dominant impact on the dewateribility of sludge due to the significant charge neutralization effects 3 3 modeling 3 3 1 modeling of structural factors in order to further quantitatively analyze the structural effects of this graft st based flocculants on the sludge dewatering a second order polynomial model as shown in eq 6 was introduced based on phenomenological theory ginzburg 1950 to reveal its structure activity relationship aforementioned three structural factors n 3 in eq 6 cd l and n were used as independent variables besides given the actual effects of charge neutralization in sludge dewatering due to the total charge contents cc not cd cc defined as the product of cd and flocculant dose stood for cd as shown in eqs 7 and 8 6 y b 0 i 1 n b i x i i 1 n b i i x i 2 i 1 n 1 i 1 n b i j x i x j 7 y b 0 b cc cd dose b l l b n n b cc l cd dose l b cc n cd dose n b l n n l b cc 2 c d 2 dos e 2 b l 2 l 2 b n 2 n 2 8 y b 0 b cc cc b l l b n n b cc l cc l b cc n cc n b l n n l b cc 2 c c 2 b l 2 l 2 b n 2 n 2 cc cd dose where y refers to the fcmc b 0 stands for the constant coefficient b cc b l and b n are the linear coefficients corresponding to cc l and n respectively b cc l b cc n b l n b cc 2 b l 2 and b n 2 are the quadratic coefficients on the basis of eq 8 the fcmcs of the three series of graft st based flocculants at various doses figs 1 a 3 a and 4 a were fitted and evaluated the simulated and original fcmc data are presented and compared in fig 5 the simulation and original fcmc data agreed with each other well and its correlation coefficients r 2 was approximately equal to 0 891 besides the simulation coefficients were obtained by using the matlab software as shown in eq 9 9 y 93 6 56 38 cc 1 863 10 6 l 1 111 10 2 n 2 74 10 3 cc l 0 874 cc n 1 714 10 4 n l 76 63 c c 2 1 022 10 8 l 2 1 01 10 4 n 2 r 2 0 891 according to eq 9 values of b cc and b l were negative indicating increase of cc and l were beneficial to reduce the water in sludge due to improved charge neutralization and adsorption bridging effects lee and liu 2001 wei et al 2018b while that of b n was positive illuminating dense graft chain distribution would deteriorate the dewateribility of sludge because of the steric hindrance effect these findings were fully consistent with previous results figs 1 4 and table 1 and further confirmed that this graft cationic st based flocculant with high cc long l and sparse n exhibited superior sludge dewatering noted worthily the values of b n and b l kept low levels quite close to zero but b cc was much larger than b n and b l which further confirmed that cc played a major effect on the dewatering performance of the graft st based flocculants besides the two interaction coefficients associated with cc b cc l and b cc n were both negative indicating those structural parameters positively affected each other interactively in addition to cc and l the dominant effect of charge neutralization would be also promoted by n although n itself had negative effect on dewatering in short the similarity of theoretic and experimental data fig 5 and the reasonable physical meanings of obtained coefficients discussed above indicated that this employed second order polynomial model can be effectively used to analyze the experimental results and establish the structure activity relationship of this st based flocculant 3 3 2 theoretical estimation effective evaluation of optimal dose doseopt is critical for practical engineering applications therefore three new equations eqs 10 12 were obtained by taking the derivatives of eq 8 on the basis of cc n and l respectively as follows 10 dos e opt cs cds b cc b cc l l b cc n n 2 bc c 2 cd 56 38 2 74 10 3 l 0 874 n 2 76 63 cd 11 dos e opt cs cd 1 ls b l 2 b l 2 l b l n n b cc l cd 1 863 10 6 2 1 022 10 8 l 1 714 10 4 n 2 74 10 3 cd 12 dos e opt cs cd 1 ns b n 2 b n 2 n b l n l b cc n cd 1 111 10 2 2 1 01 10 4 n 1 714 10 4 l 0 874 cd based on eqs 10 12 the theoretic optimal doses of this st based flocculant for sludge dewatering were obtained from the structural parameters cd l and n as shown in fig 6 the simulated optimal doses were fairly consistent with the experimental ones according to fig 6 however the theoretic optimal doses of the st based flocculants with relatively low cd showed high error it may be due to high flocculant dose required and thus other dewatering effects associated with l and n such as bridging flocculation could not be ignored above all the optimal dose and dewatering properties of this graft cationic st based flocculant can be predicted by these well established models eqs 8 12 4 conclusion this study mainly investigated the effects of three structural factors cd n and l of the graft cationic st based flocculants on the dewatering performance besides the structure activity relationship was analyzed quantitatively by a second order polynomial model based on phenomenological theory the conclusions can be summarized as follow this graft cationic st based flocculant with the structural characteristics of high cd long l and low n scheme 1 exhibited superior dewaterability of sludge causing low fcmc srf and bound water content efficient compression of pn and ps in eps especially in s eps and lb eps fractions large and compact sludge flocs small s and porous sludge cake because of the enhanced charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects among these three structural factors cd played a more important role in improvement of dewatering properties than l and n in addition to charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects this st based flocculant can partially act as a skeleton builder due to its distinct rigid rod chain conformation in water improve the compressibility and water filterability and thus cause much more water drainage from the channels and voids in sludge cakes the employed theoretic model well simulated the experimental data fig 5 and reasonably explained the physical meanings of obtained coefficients besides the optimal doses can be correctly estimated accordingly indicating this second order polynomial model can effectively analyze the experimental results and establish the structure activity relationship of this st based flocculant in short a novel and simple way was provided to design and select the low cost and high efficient flocculants in sludge dewatering for wwtps in this work although more practices of this model are needed and different sludge such as digested sludge should be further tried declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17327,coagulation flocculation is one of the most extensive and cost effective pretreatments to improve the dewaterability of sludge in water treatment plants in this study three series of graft cationic starch st based flocculants with distinct structural characteristics including charge density cd graft chain length l and graft chain distribution n were synthesized by graft copolymerization of 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and acrylamide onto st backbone the structural effects of these st based flocculants on the sludge dewaterability have been quantitatively analyzed by using a second order polynomial model according to phenomenological theory the predicted dewatering performance and optimal dose were fully consistent with the experimental results on the basis of this established model the dewatering mechanisms were discussed in detail by combination of the analysis of the changes in filter cake moisture content specific resistance of filtration bound water content compression coefficient extracellular polymeric substances fractions and components spatial distributions of proteins and polysaccharides microstructures of sludge cake and flocs properties in the dewatering process this graft st based flocculant with the structural characteristics of high cd long l and low n exhibited superior sludge dewaterability because of the enhanced charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects among these three structural factors cd played a more important role in improvement of sludge dewaterability than l and n due to the dominant effect of charge neutralization this study provided a better understanding of structure activity relationship of these grafting modified flocculants which was of significant guidance for the exploit

flocculants charge density graft chain length and distribution structure activity relationship dewatering mechanisms 1 introduction waste activated sludge was production has substantially increased in recent decades with strict environmental management which is a key challenge in wastewater treatment plants wwtps for populated urban areas christensen et al 2015 huge quantities of was consisting of over 90 water content heavy metal and various persistent organic pollutants cause great economic and environmental burden christensen et al 2015 swierczek et al 2018 wei et al 2018a the components of was especially extracellular polymeric substances eps contain numerous hydrophilic materials that are highly hydrated and capture a large amount of water which cause considerable difficulty in acquiring effective sludge dewatering li et al 2007 sheng et al 2010 coagulation flocculation is a simple and inexpensive pretreatment technique prior to mechanical dewatering that can effectively improve dewatering efficiency to reduce the volume of sludge and the cost of transportation and handling effectively through coagulating and flocculating negatively charged sludge colloids wang et al 2013 wei et al 2018a zhang et al 2017 however currently commercial coagulants and flocculants such as aluminum and ferric coagulants and polyacrylamide based flocculants may shorten the service life of the wastewater treatment equipment due to the hydrolysis acidification of inorganic coagulants and cause the secondary pollution risks because of the residual metal ions and acrylamide monomer in treated waters adewole and muritala 2019 jin et al 2019 kim et al 2016 mowla et al 2013 wei et al 2018a b hence there is an urgent need to develop environmental friendly economical and high efficient flocculants in sludge treatment recently considerable increment of energy demands and environmental requirements has promoted the development of natural polymeric renewable resources adewole and muritala 2019 wei et al 2018a the popular natural polymers such as starch st chitosan and cellulose have widely attracted attention due to their environmental friendliness and high efficiency bratskaya et al 2004 fanta 1973 lan et al 2018 lee et al 2015 yang et al 2016 zheng et al 2020 among them st is considered as one of the most promising natural polymers because of its outstanding advantages including low cost and easy availability which can be flexibly modified to prepare various flocculants with different structures jin et al 2019 meshram et al 2009 wang et al 2013 among various common chemical modifications bratskaya et al 2004 rani et al 2012 song et al 2009 wei et al 2018b wu et al 2016 graft copolymerization is a popular and effective way to introduce various branch chains containing different specifically functional groups onto the polymeric backbone therefore drastically improving their application performance fanta 1973 ryno et al 2014 zheng et al 2020 the flocculants with different structural features show distinct sludge dewatering performance since the final application performance of a material including flocculants entirely relies on its internal molecular structure huang et al 2019 mierczynska vasilev et al 2013 volkenstein 1985 yang et al 2016 nevertheless previous research on the structural factors of graft polymeric flocculants have mainly concerned with the types of functional groups and the selectivity of graft monomers liu et al 2020 wu et al 2020 aiming at the structural characteristics of sludge researchers found that increase of positive charge density and suitable grafting of some hydrophobic groups in polymeric flocculants were beneficial to improvement of sludge dewatering liu et al 2020 wu et al 2020 however the contributions of some more fine structural factors of graft polymeric flocculants such as graft chain length l and graft chain distribution n to sludge dewatering were failed to study in detail until now chen et al 2018 lv et al 2014 wei et al 2018a besides previous works involved in the effects of flocculants molecular structure on dewatering performance have mainly focused on qualitative analysis and few study has reported the quantitative structure activity relationship between graft polymeric flocculants and their dewaterability in this work three series of graft st based flocculants with different charge density cd ls and ns were designed and synthesized and each series of the graft flocculants was kept with only one structural parameter being varied by controlling the variably synthetic conditions to reveal the structure activity relationship of this graft starch based flocculant in sludge dewatering process the sludge dewatering performance of these st based flocculants were characterized by filter cake moisture content fcmc and specific resistance of filtration srf in addition the dewatering mechanisms were elucidated by combining fcmc srf bound water content compression coefficient eps fractions and components spatial distributions of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps microstructures of sludge cake and flocs properties in the dewatering process finally a second order polynomial model on the basis of phenomenological theory ginzburg 1950 was introduced to quantitatively analyze the dewatering mechanisms and predict the fcmc and optimal dose 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials st weight average molecular weight of approximately 1 5 105 g mol was purchased from binzhou jinhui corn development co ltd 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethyl

from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd glucose 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride cta 60wt in water and poly vinyl sulfate potassium salt were purchased from aladdin industrial corporation calcofluor white m2r and fluorescein isothiocyanate was purchased from phytotech and beida pharmaceutical technology co ltd nacl naoh ammonium persulfate aps and other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from shanghai lingfeng chemical reagent co ltd 2 2 preparation and characterization of co graft st based flocculants 2 2 1 preparation and general characterization before the graft copolymerization st was slightly modified by cta through etherification to improve its solubility and was recorded as cs then three series of co graft st based flocculants with distinct cds ls and ns namely cs cd1 cs cd7 cs cd1 l1 cs cd1 l5 and cs cd1 n1 cs cd1 n5 respectively were designed and obtained by controlling of the fed mass ratio of two monomers and initiator in graft copolymerization according to our previous work hu et al 2020 the detailed preparation conditions were listed in table 1 the cd of the flocculants were detected by colloid titration hu et al 2020 wei et al 2018b the molecular structures of those st based flocculants were basically characterized by ftir bruker model ifs 66 s and 1h nmr bruker ascend 400 which were showed in supporting information figs s1 and s2 respectively and discussed in detail in supporting information text s1 2 2 2 evaluation of grafted chain length and distribution the l and n of st based flocculants was characterized by the average number of grafted monomers per graft chain and grafted chain per starch chain respectively according to our previous report these two structural parameters can be roughly evaluated using eqs 1 and 2 based on some theoretical assumptions due to the evident difficulty in their detections using current characterization methods since various environmental factors can affect the synthesis efficiency and structural characteristics hu et al 2020 yu et al 2018 the initiation efficiency of aps was assumed to remain constant according to the grafting reaction time of 3 0 h and the half life of aps of about 60 0 h in this case fmc corporation 2001 the percentage of the actual disassociated aps was about 3 4 in addition each aps decomposition can get two free radicals and each initiated free radical was assumed to effectively propagate a graft chain which means that n was twice the initiated aps besides all monomers am and dmc were randomly grafted onto starch backbone in graft copolymerization since the actual reaction yields all exceeded 90 the detailed calculation processes for l and n were presented in supporting information text s2 all the theoretically estimated n and l values as listed in table 1 were considered to be comparable to the corresponding real values because all st based flocculants were obtained under the same external experimental conditions and within the similar systematic errors 1 n 2 η m aps m cs m aps m cs 2 l m am m am m dmc m dmc m cs m cs n where m cs m am m dmc and m aps are the mass amounts of cs am dmc

due to very low substitution degree of cta 2 3 batch test 2 3 1 was was samples were acquired from a wastewater treatment plant in nanjing china through an activated sludge process and by using a membrane bioreactor the moisture content and the ratio of volatile suspended solids vss to total suspended solids tss vss tss were 98 5 and 43 0 0 9 respectively analyzed according to apha 1998 table s1 in supporting information listed all physicochemical parameters of was and their detailed measurements the sludge samples were subsequently stored at 4 0 c in the refrigerator all experiments were completed in 5 days and dewatering test for each group used the same was sample 2 3 2 sludge conditioning the stock solution of st based flocculants with the concentration of 3 0 g l was freshly prepared by directly dissolving a known amount of solid flocculants in water for the following dewatering experiments in the conditioning process a certain amount of flocculant solution was added to an aliquot of 100 ml of sludge and then was reacted in a program controlled paddle apparatus model ta6 wuhan hengling technology co ltd under a rapid stirring of 250 rpm for 1 0 min followed by a low agitation at 50 rpm for 5 0 min the fcmc srf bound water content compressibility floc properties zeta potential and characteristics of eps were carefully measured by the following methods 2 3 3 sludge dewatering as a major criterion for assessing the dewatering effect of sludge the fcmc was taken under consideration after dewatering the sludge cake was dried at 105 c in a laboratory drying oven to determine the fcmc in accordance with the standard method meanwhile the filterability of sludge was evaluated by means of srf chen et al 2015 wei et al 2018b the conditioned sludge suspension 100 ml was filtered using a buchner funnel with 0 45 µm filter and a constant pressure of 0 05 mpa was applied by a vacuum pump the volume of filtrate was continuously recorded every 10 s before breaking the vacuum state or terminate the filtering after 7 0 min the dewatering equipment was schematically described in supporting information fig s3 the srf of the was sample was calculated by 3 s r f 2 p a 2 b μ ω where p n m2 denotes pressure a m2 is the filter area b s m6 indicates the slope of filtrate discharge curve μ n s m2 is kinetic viscosity and ω kg m3 represents dry solid weight per unit volume sludge on the filtrate media the sludge cake compressibility was evaluated by the compressibility coefficient s which was obtained by fitting data using eq 4 cao et al 2016 qi et al 2011 4 s r f 1 s r f 2 p 1 p 2 s where srf 1 and srf 2 are the specific resistance to filtration under two different pressures p 1 and p 2 i e 0 03 and 0 05 mpa here respectively 2 4 floc properties the floc size and compactness were also measured according to our previous studies hu et al 2020 wei et al 2018b a and l represent the projected area and characteristic length of the sludge floc respectively the two dimensional fractal dimension d 2 of floc using image analysis was calculated through linear fitting of the slope of log a versus log l based on eq 5 5 a l d 2 furthermore the zeta potentials of sludge conditioned by different st based flocculants at their optimal doses were detected by a zetasizer nano z malvern uk the surface morphologies of flocs were directly observed using a scanning electron microscope sem fei quanta 250 the sludge flocs need to be preprocessed by freeze drying treatment under vacuum at 60 c for 72 h the content of bound water in sludge cake was measured by a differential scanning calorimetry analyzer ta us and the experimental methods referred to the literature li et al 2020 wei et al 2019a 2 5 eps fractionation and characterization 2 5 1 extraction of eps the eps including soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were extracted from conditioned and raw was by a modified heat extraction method niu et al 2013 wei et al 2018b firstly the sludge sample was centrifuged at 764 7 g for 10 0 min and the supernatant was considered to s eps then the sludge pellet in the centrifuge tube was re suspended into a 10 ml of 0 05 nacl aqueous solution sonicated at 20 khz for 2 0 min shaken horizontally at 150 rpm for 10 0 min sonicated again for 2 0 min centrifuged at 2124 g for 10 0 min the collected supernatant was lb eps finally the re suspended pellet was sonicated for 3 0 min heated for 30 0 min at 60 c centrifuged at 5438 g for 10 0 min and separated as tb eps the eps solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane prior to organic analysis 2 5 2 analysis of eps the dissolved organic carbon in eps fraction was measured using a total organic carbon toc analyzer with an automatic sampling system aurora 1030 w usa pn contents were measured using a uv 2600a spectrometer unico usa with bovine serum albumin as the standard substance bradford 1976 kim et al 2016 the absorbance of the pn solution was measured at the wavelength of 595 nm after it turned cyan with the solution of coomassie brilliant blue g 250 for 2 0 min ps concentrations were measured and analyzed using anthrone method frolund et al 1996 ps reacted with anthrone into blue green color and the absorbance was detected at the maximum absorption wavelength of 620 nm on the basis of a previously measured standard curve ps concentrations can be estimated a zeiss lsm 710 confocal laser scanning microscope clsm germany was used to analyze the spatial distributions of pn and ps in sludge flocs the pn and ps are dyed to green and blue by using fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc and calcofluor white m2r respectively ai et al 2019 chen et al 2020 kim et al 2016 the detailed operation process was as follows 1 the sludge samples were placed in 1 5 ml tubes and resuspended in 1 0 ml of freshly prepared 2 nmorpholino ethanesulfonic acid mes buffer solution 2 100 μl of 0 1 mol l fitc dissolved in n n dimethylformamide was added and then mixed with 100 μl of 0 1 mol l calcofluor white m2r 3 the mixture was dyed in darkness at room temperature for 2 h and the samples were repeatedly rinsed with deionized water and then dispersed in 1 0 ml mes and 4 the ar kr laser light source with a fluorescein filter provided excitation at 488 nm and 405 nm for pn and ps respectively samples were observed through a 100 magnifications with an aperture of 1 3 all images were stored for 2d analysis ai et al 2019 chen et al 2020 kim et al 2016 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra were measured on a f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi japan with an emission range from 250 nm to 550 nm at 1 nm increment and an excitation range from 200 nm to 450 nm at 5 nm increment at a scan speed of 2400 nm min with 5 nm of emission and excitation slit bandwidths 3 results and discussion three series of graft st based flocculants with different structural features were synthesized and used to treat municipal sludge and further explore the relationship between the structure and performance of grafted flocculants in sludge dewatering process and the detailed structural parameters of various st based flocculants and its dewatering performance at their optimal doses including srf fcmc zeta potential s and sludge flocs properties are all listed in table 1 scheme 1 roughly describes the different structural morphologies of the various st based flocculants schematically including the high or low cd long or short l and sparse or dense n 3 1 effect of cd 3 1 1 effect of cd on sludge dewatering seven cs cds cs cd1 cs cd7 with different cds but the same l and n were first used to investigate the effect of cd on sludge dewatering fig 1 a and b showed that the srf and fcmc of sludge conditioned by each cs cd all decreased rapidly at the beginning and then reached a plateau with the increase of dose indicating these st based flocculants presented good dewatering performance in addition the dewatering performance of seven cs cds was completely proportional to their cds and flocculants with higher cd can obtain lower srf and fcmc in addition to smaller optimal dose according to fig 1a b and table 1 the srf and fcmc of sludge conditioned by cs cd7 with the highest cd approximately 4 061 mmol g in this work can be reduced from 13 01 1012 m kg and 97 05 to 2 06 1012 m kg and 83 09 respectively at the smallest optimal dose of 6 0 mg g tss cs cds with higher cd than cs cd7 can t be tried here because of the difficulty in practical preparation and relative poor water solubility besides the contents of bound water in sludge cake decreased with the increase of the st based flocculants cd and were consistent with the fcmc according to table 1 which was due to more efficient aggregation of sludge flocs conditioned by cs cds with higher contents of cationic quaternary ammonium groups resulting in more effective extrusion and release of bound water wei et al 2019a besides the zeta potentials of sludge obviously increased when these cationic st based flocculants were conditioned as shown in table 1 at their optimal doses cs cd7 led to a maximum increase from 12 7 to 2 39 mv these finding illustrated the increase of cd was beneficial to sludge dewatering and charge neutralization played a leading role in dewatering process on account of negatively charged characteristics of sludge liu et al 2020 wei et al 2018b wu et al 2020 in addition to srf and fcmc the microstructures of sludge including sludge floc properties and the surface morphologies of final sludge cakes are essential to evaluate the dewatering effects of flocculants in wwtps moghaddam et al 2010 in comparison with the sludge floc properties of raw sludge the l and d 2 of sludge flocs treated by various cs cds at their optimal doses were all increased evidently according to table 1 indicating large and compact sludge flocs were obtained after conditioning besides the graft starch based flocculants with higher cd caused larger l and higher d 2 because of the enhanced not only charge neutralization but also bridging flocculation effects the improved intramolecular repulsion of cs cd with a high content of cationic groups on the branch chains usually resulted in a more extended conformation of polymeric flocculant in solution and thus an enhanced bridging flocculation effect scheme 1 flory 1953 yang et al 2016 moreover the surface morphologies of sludge cakes as accumulated sludge flocs were directly observed under sem supporting information fig s4 a s4 h consistently the microstructures of sludge cakes turned from relatively flat and smooth without channels and voids to rough and porous after conditioned by cs cds especially for those with high cd resulting in good water permeability and high dewaterability wang et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 it might be due to that large sludge flocs obtained by cs cds with high cd could not be closely packed and cause a final rough and porous microstructures of sludge cakes besides the measured s of sludge filter cakes supporting information fig s5 and table 1 further confirmed that cs cds with relatively high cd such as cs cd6 and cs cd7 had low s and improved compressibility different from normal synthetic polymeric flocculants this graft st based flocculant exhibited a rigid rod chain conformation because of not only its polyelectrolyte s characteristics but also distinct glycocycle backbone scheme 1 flory 1953 thus cs cds can still act as skeleton builders partially wei et al 2018a cause more water drainage from the channels and voids in sludge cake and finally improve the compressibility and water permeability 3 1 2 effect of cd on eps eps is one of the main factors affecting sludge dewatering process forster 1971 poxon and darby 1997 and investigation of the variations in eps distribution and composition in depth is vital to well understand the internal dewatering mechanisms the toc pn and ps contents in three eps fractions of sludge conditioned by various cs cds at their optimal doses are shown in fig 1c and d in comparison to the raw sludge the toc contents in tb eps had just slightly decrease after conditioning while those in s eps and lb eps decreased notably besides the decrease levels of which were strongly associated with the cd of cs cds fig 1c moreover the change trends of the contents of the main organic components pn and ps in three eps fractions of sludge conditioned by different cs cds were roughly similar to those of their corresponded toc contents fig 1c and d the contents of pn and ps in s eps and lb eps decreased evidently and were closely related to the cds of conditioned cs cds based on clsm analysis fig 2 the distributions of pn and ps in sludge flocs turned concentrated and dense with the cds of conditioned cs cds besides a core shell like structure i e pn was embedded by ps was formed to facilitate the densification of eps through some more effective interactions between ps and this st based flocculant due to their similar molecular structures wei et al 2018b those phenomena indicated that the total eps especially s eps and lb eps were effectively compressed by cs cds due to the charge neutralization and bridging effects resulting in involved pn and ps being collapsed and aggregated release of trapped water and finally improved dewatering properties fig 1a and b christensen et al 2015 wei et al 2018b b zhang et al 2019 besides the obvious correlations between the enhanced dewatering performance and the decreased organic contents in s eps and lb eps confirmed that the dewaterability of sludge was mainly relevant to the pn and ps in s eps and lb eps but not in tb eps fraction fig 1a d which were full consistent with previous reports fmc corporation 2001 higgins and novak 1997 li and yang 2007 wei et al 2018b yu et al 2008 the 3d eem fluorescence technique due to its high selectivity and sensitivity was used for further analysis of various organic compounds with fluorescent properties in the three eps fractions of sludge conditioned by various cs cds supporting information fig s6 although 3d eem analysis can t reveal all components in eps baker 2001 chen et al 2003 jacquin et al 2017 3d eem fluorescence spectra were usually divided into 5 regions and the five fluorescent peaks were extracted and represent 5 types of substances including aromatic pn λex em 230 nm 340 nm peak a tryptophan like pn λex em 280 nm 350 nm peak b fulvic acid λex em 240 nm 420 nm peak c and humic substances λex em 350 nm 440 nm and 270 nm 450 nm at peaks d and e respectively chen et al 2003 jacquin et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 accordingly the intensities of the five fluorescent peaks are illustrated in fig 1e after adding cs cds the variation trends in intensities of peaks a and b namely pn like matters were basically consistent with those in the contents of pn in three eps fractions fig 1d the fluorescence intensity of the pn like matters in the s eps and lb eps fraction decreased significantly especially sludge conditioned by cs cds with high cd in addition the characteristic peaks c d and e were mainly ascribed to fulvic acid and humic substances chen et al 2003 jacquin et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 the intensities of these three peaks were relatively weak without notable changes after conditioning these results further confirmed these starch based flocculants mainly interacted with pn and ps in eps which were closely related to the finally dewatering performance 3 2 effects of l and n 3 2 1 effects of l and n on dewatering properties in addition to cd the l and n are also important structural factors of graft copolymers which impact on their application performance hu et al 2020 liu et al 2017 yu et al 2018 another two series of graft cationic st based flocculants cs cd1 ls and cs cd1 ns the former with the similar cd and n but different l while the latter with the similar cd and l but different n were thus tried to investigate the effects of l and n on sludge dewatering figs 3a 3b and figs 4a 4b the srf and fcmc of cs cd1 ls and cs cd1 ns exhibited similar decreasing trends to those of cs cds with the increase of flocculants dose besides in the measured ranges of l and n the effects of l and n on the dewatering performance were both slightly but the graft st based flocculants with larger l or with lower n caused relatively low optimal doses but improved srf and fcmc and reduced content of bound water in sludge cake fig 3 a b fig 4 a b and table 1 this finding indicated the chain architectures of graft polymeric flocculants with the characteristics of longer and sparser graft chains were beneficial to improve the dewatering properties the longer graft chains enhanced the adsorption bridging effects of this st based flocculant and thus improved the dewateribility of sludge however the graft polymeric flocculants with denser graft chains had the enhanced steric hindrance effects and the cationic graft chains on the st backbone with rigid rod chain conformation caused the sludge colloids and flocs uneasily to approach to the flocculants resulting in their inefficient interactions and relatively poor dewatering performance given the relative error of sludge flocs parameters l and d 2 had almost no changes with the l and n table 1 indicating the length and distribution of graft chain had less impact on the sludge flocs properties however the change trends of s were similar to those of srf and fcmc with l and n after conditioned by cs cd1 ls and cs cd1 ns at their optimal doses table 1 the longer and sparser graft chains on the st based flocculants partially acted as skeleton builders may cause more porous and channels in the sludge filter cakes supporting information fig s4 i s4 r due to the distinct spatial characteristics and thus improved the compressibility and final water permeability scheme 1 nevertheless in comprehensive comparison with various parameters of cs cds with different cds table 1 cd obviously played a more important role than l and n to the dewatering performance of these st based flocculants not only srf fcmc and bound water content but also the properties of sludge flocs and cakes 3 2 2 effect of l and n on eps the influences of l and n on eps fractions and compositions were further investigated and shown in fig 3c d and fig 4c d respectively the contents of toc pn and ps in different eps fractions after conditioned by cs cd1 ls and cs cd1 ns especially in s eps and lb eps roughly decreased with the increase of l fig 3c d but increased with the n fig 4c d besides the spatial distributions of pn and ps in sludge aggregates supporting information figs s7 and s8 showed that cs cd1 ls with long l and cs cd1 ns with low n caused more compact morphologies of pn and ps moreover according to the measured 3d eem spectra supporting information figs s9 and s10 the change trends for the fluorescence intensities of the pn like matters peaks a and b in s eps and lb eps fractions figs 3e and 4e were consistent with those for the pn contents with the changes of l and n in those graft flocculants figs 3d and 4d however the intensities of c d and e peaks corresponding to fulvic acid and humic substances were irregular combination of their sludge dewatering fig 3a b and fig 4a b the graft st based flocculants with relatively long or sparse graft chain exhibited superior enhanced dewatering performance due to their efficiently decreasing of organic contents in s eps and lb eps specifically pn and ps which were full consistent with previous studies li et al 2016 sheng et al 2010 and the results of cd effects discussed in section 3 1 2 in short the dewatering performance of this graft cationic st based flocculant mainly depended on the structural factors cd n and l however the effects of l and n on the eps and dewatering properties were all relatively weak in comparison with those of cd according to figs 1 4 and table 1 indicating cd had a dominant impact on the dewateribility of sludge due to the significant charge neutralization effects 3 3 modeling 3 3 1 modeling of structural factors in order to further quantitatively analyze the structural effects of this graft st based flocculants on the sludge dewatering a second order polynomial model as shown in eq 6 was introduced based on phenomenological theory ginzburg 1950 to reveal its structure activity relationship aforementioned three structural factors n 3 in eq 6 cd l and n were used as independent variables besides given the actual effects of charge neutralization in sludge dewatering due to the total charge contents cc not cd cc defined as the product of cd and flocculant dose stood for cd as shown in eqs 7 and 8 6 y b 0 i 1 n b i x i i 1 n b i i x i 2 i 1 n 1 i 1 n b i j x i x j 7 y b 0 b cc cd dose b l l b n n b cc l cd dose l b cc n cd dose n b l n n l b cc 2 c d 2 dos e 2 b l 2 l 2 b n 2 n 2 8 y b 0 b cc cc b l l b n n b cc l cc l b cc n cc n b l n n l b cc 2 c c 2 b l 2 l 2 b n 2 n 2 cc cd dose where y refers to the fcmc b 0 stands for the constant coefficient b cc b l and b n are the linear coefficients corresponding to cc l and n respectively b cc l b cc n b l n b cc 2 b l 2 and b n 2 are the quadratic coefficients on the basis of eq 8 the fcmcs of the three series of graft st based flocculants at various doses figs 1 a 3 a and 4 a were fitted and evaluated the simulated and original fcmc data are presented and compared in fig 5 the simulation and original fcmc data agreed with each other well and its correlation coefficients r 2 was approximately equal to 0 891 besides the simulation coefficients were obtained by using the matlab software as shown in eq 9 9 y 93 6 56 38 cc 1 863 10 6 l 1 111 10 2 n 2 74 10 3 cc l 0 874 cc n 1 714 10 4 n l 76 63 c c 2 1 022 10 8 l 2 1 01 10 4 n 2 r 2 0 891 according to eq 9 values of b cc and b l were negative indicating increase of cc and l were beneficial to reduce the water in sludge due to improved charge neutralization and adsorption bridging effects lee and liu 2001 wei et al 2018b while that of b n was positive illuminating dense graft chain distribution would deteriorate the dewateribility of sludge because of the steric hindrance effect these findings were fully consistent with previous results figs 1 4 and table 1 and further confirmed that this graft cationic st based flocculant with high cc long l and sparse n exhibited superior sludge dewatering noted worthily the values of b n and b l kept low levels quite close to zero but b cc was much larger than b n and b l which further confirmed that cc played a major effect on the dewatering performance of the graft st based flocculants besides the two interaction coefficients associated with cc b cc l and b cc n were both negative indicating those structural parameters positively affected each other interactively in addition to cc and l the dominant effect of charge neutralization would be also promoted by n although n itself had negative effect on dewatering in short the similarity of theoretic and experimental data fig 5 and the reasonable physical meanings of obtained coefficients discussed above indicated that this employed second order polynomial model can be effectively used to analyze the experimental results and establish the structure activity relationship of this st based flocculant 3 3 2 theoretical estimation effective evaluation of optimal dose doseopt is critical for practical engineering applications therefore three new equations eqs 10 12 were obtained by taking the derivatives of eq 8 on the basis of cc n and l respectively as follows 10 dos e opt cs cds b cc b cc l l b cc n n 2 bc c 2 cd 56 38 2 74 10 3 l 0 874 n 2 76 63 cd 11 dos e opt cs cd 1 ls b l 2 b l 2 l b l n n b cc l cd 1 863 10 6 2 1 022 10 8 l 1 714 10 4 n 2 74 10 3 cd 12 dos e opt cs cd 1 ns b n 2 b n 2 n b l n l b cc n cd 1 111 10 2 2 1 01 10 4 n 1 714 10 4 l 0 874 cd based on eqs 10 12 the theoretic optimal doses of this st based flocculant for sludge dewatering were obtained from the structural parameters cd l and n as shown in fig 6 the simulated optimal doses were fairly consistent with the experimental ones according to fig 6 however the theoretic optimal doses of the st based flocculants with relatively low cd showed high error it may be due to high flocculant dose required and thus other dewatering effects associated with l and n such as bridging flocculation could not be ignored above all the optimal dose and dewatering properties of this graft cationic st based flocculant can be predicted by these well established models eqs 8 12 4 conclusion this study mainly investigated the effects of three structural factors cd n and l of the graft cationic st based flocculants on the dewatering performance besides the structure activity relationship was analyzed quantitatively by a second order polynomial model based on phenomenological theory the conclusions can be summarized as follow this graft cationic st based flocculant with the structural characteristics of high cd long l and low n scheme 1 exhibited superior dewaterability of sludge causing low fcmc srf and bound water content efficient compression of pn and ps in eps especially in s eps and lb eps fractions large and compact sludge flocs small s and porous sludge cake because of the enhanced charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects among these three structural factors cd played a more important role in improvement of dewatering properties than l and n in addition to charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects this st based flocculant can partially act as a skeleton builder due to its distinct rigid rod chain conformation in water improve the compressibility and water filterability and thus cause much more water drainage from the channels and voids in sludge cakes the employed theoretic model well simulated the experimental data fig 5 and reasonably explained the physical meanings of obtained coefficients besides the optimal doses can be correctly estimated accordingly indicating this second order polynomial model can effectively analyze the experimental results and establish the structure activity relationship of this st based flocculant in short a novel and simple way was provided to design and select the low cost and high efficient flocculants in sludge dewatering for wwtps in this work although more practices of this model are needed and different sludge such as digested sludge should be further tried declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

and their structural formulae were elucidated by high resolution mass spectrometry toxicity effects for chlorinated solutions increased when compared to the unreacted metribuzin solution dbps were more toxic to artemia salina nauplii increasing around 20 on nauplii mortality it was also observed high estrogenicity to human receptors in blyes assays and mutagenic and developmental toxicant effects to animals and humans in q sar methodology suggesting that dbps are potentially more toxic than the precursor metribuzin metribuzin solutions at 10 mg l 1 showed equivalent 17 β estradiol

used for pre and post emergence control of grass and broadleaved weed in crops it is a photosynthesis inhibitor blocking the electron transport in the hill reaction of photosystem ii antonopoulou and konstantinou 2014 štěpánova et al 2012 metribuzin is considered nontoxic or slightly toxic to non target species such as mammals bees fresh or estuarine marine fishes and invertebrates and moderately toxic to avian species on an acute basis according to epa metribuzin has not shown carcinogenicity mutagenicity or developmental toxicity effects to humans and animals epa 2003 1998 due to its efficiency and relative low toxicity this herbicide has been extensively used in diverse crops worldwide such as soybean sugar cane tomato carrots vines and others honório et al 2013 travlos et al

due to its physical and chemical properties antonopoulou and konstantinou 2014 fairchild and sappington 2002 štěpánova et al 2012 residues levels up to 25 15 µg l 1 in water samples have been reported in the literature antonopoulou and konstantinou 2014 in brazil surface and groundwater metribuzin contamination has been associated to soybean corn and cotton producing regions albuquerque et al 2016 in a monitoring study developed by dores et al 2006 metribuzin was the most detected herbicide frequency of 48 in surface and groundwater located in the middle west of brazil in this study metribuzin was detected in drinking water well waterhole dam and irrigation well at maximum concentration values of 351 90 138 and 129 ng l 1 respectively according to albuquerque et al 2016 metribuzin was detected in 20 out of 113 samples from brazilian freshwater at concentration from 3 to 8 ng l 1 in a literature review about emergent contaminants in aquatic matrices from brazil metribuzin was one of the organic microcontaminants identified among those with the highest concentrations detected in groundwater samples montagner et al 2017 once present in waters bodies organic microcontaminants can reach drinking water sources and pass unchanged through the treatment or react in the chlorination step to generate disinfection by products dbps according to hu et al 2017 metribuzin cannot be removed through coagulation sedimentation and filtration used in conventional water treatment plants wtps on the other hand metribuzin has been shown to be reactive to free chlorine in the disinfection step generating dbps in the treated effluent chamberlain et al 2012 hu et al 2017 it is known that natural organic matter nom primarily comprised of humic and fulvic acids is the major contributor to dbps formation in the last decade several studies have suggested an increased rate in liver colon bladder and rectum cancers in populations exposed to some of these dbps produced by chlorination of nom abbas et al 2015 komulainen 2004 however the contribution by microcontaminants in this issue must not be neglected pesticides have been studied in chlorination step to evaluate the formation of new dbps or even regulated dbps hu et al 2015 2017 kamata et al 2017 kamoshita et al 2010 li et al 2016 tian et al 2014 2013 xu et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 some studies have shown that dbps formed by pesticide chlorination may be more toxic than their precursor compounds kamoshita et al 2010 tawk et al 2015 tian et al 2014 2013 although there are many studies involving the chlorination of pesticides in wtps there is still a huge knowledge gap regarding the dbps formation for many active ingredients in addition there are few pesticide chlorination studies addressing the dbps toxicity kamoshita et al 2010 kishida et al 2010 tawk et al 2015 tian et al 2014 2013 there are some studies in the literature describing the removal and or degradation kinetics of metribuzin in chlorination reactions hu et al 2017 conducted a thorough research to evaluate the degradation kinetics of metribuzin initial concentration of 1000 µg l 1 in chlorination process the ph bromide and ammonium concentration as well as temperature effects were evaluated according to this study degradation of metribuzin can be well described by a second order kinetics model and the rate constants of the acid catalyzed and hocl oxidizing charged metribuzin were 7 72 0 90 108 m 2 min 1 and 8 22 4 90 103 m 1 min 1 respectively metribuzin degradation rate increased with bromide concentration acid ph and temperature and decreased with ammonium concentration in addition hu et al 2017 evaluated some halogenated volatile dbps described on epa 551a and epa 551b methods in another study chamberlain et

recalcitrant 20 of removal under basic conditions ph 8 6 according to miltner et al 1989 96 of metribuzin was removed from river water after 6 h under contact with free chlorine at 3 mg l 1 in this study removal estimate may have been impacted due to the lack of quenching following sampling to the authors best knowledge the aforementioned studies are the only ones related to metribuzin chlorination in the literature therefore there are no studies involving identification and elucidation of non target dbps the supposed degradation pathway and or the toxicity assessment of metribuzin by products after chlorination process in view of metribuzin presence in water sources and its recognized reactivity to free chlorine the development of this study is crucial to understanding the formation of new dbps and their potential risks to human and environmental health thus the main objectives of this study were 1 to identify the main dbps formed during metribuzin chlorination using ultra high performance liquid chromatography heated electrospray ionization high resolution mass spectrometry uhplchesi hrms 2 to propose a degradation pathway and 3 to apply in vivo in vitro and in silico toxicity tests to measure possible adverse effects of unreacted and chlorinated metribuzin solutions on non target organisms for which the intact herbicide is supposed to be safe 2 materials

considerably higher than in surface water samples to ensure the identification and elucidation of minor dbps with the analytical method in addition the biological assays applied in this study require high concentration of the compound to assess the toxic effects in a short time exposure for disinfection by products elucidation and mineralization rate analysis of the metribuzin aliquots of 250 ml

toxicity assays 2 4 1 acute toxicity using artemia salina assay the hatching procedure followed the standardized short term toxicity test with artemia salina nauplii described by vanhaecke and persoone 1981 the hatching medium was produced with artificial seawater 35 g l 1 solution of sea salt and the ph was adjusted to 8 9 then the solution was transferred to an aquarium adapted with a teflon divider which has 2 mm diameter orifices equally spaced from each other thus the orifices were sealed and on one side of the aquarium were added 500 mg l 1 of brine shrimp cyst the system was aerated and kept under illumination 70 w for 24 h at 25 2 ⁰c a large number of cysts hatched starting the first larval stage of the brine shrimp nauplii i then the aeration system was turned off the part of the aquarium where the larvae hatched was protected from light and the seal of the divider with orifices was removed the light source was positioned at the opposite side to attract the larvae thus the artemia salina nauplli stage i were separated from cysts and in addition there was a selection by mobility the aquarium divider was locked and the system was aired and kept under illumination for 24 h the incubation for 48 h ensured that all larvae had moulted to the instar ii iii stages the most sensitive stages vanhaecke et al 1981 vanhaecke and persoone 1981 xu et al 2015 10 larvae were transferred for each well of 24 well plates and exposed to herbicide solutions pre and post chlorination time 0 15 30 60 min 12 and 24 h at final concentration of 10 mg l 1 positive sodium lauryl sulfate curve and negative control saline solution were performed according vanhaecke et al 1981 and vanhaecke and persoone 1981 all experiments were performed in sextuplicate and the positive control curve in triplicates mortality after 48 h was calculated by number of immobile after 20 s of observation 2 4 2 estrogenicity assay the estrogenic activity of the chlorinated samples was determined using a lux based saccharomyces cerevisiae bioluminescent assay a strain capable of responding to estrogenic compounds bioluminescent yeast estrogen screen blyes and a constitutively bioluminescent strain blyr were applied as described by sanseverino et al 2005 sanseverino et al 2005 the re engineered saccharomyces cerevisiae was kindly provided by the toxicological analysis sector of the environmental company of the são paulo state cetesb with prior authorization from the company 490 biotec knoxville tennessee usa the growth of the blyes and blyr culture was performed according to sanseverino et al 2005 next one hundred and fifty microliters of yeast solutions and fifty microliters of sample blank solution positive control or negative control were transferred to each well of a black 96 well microfluor microtiter plates positive control was done using 17β estradiol e2 in 4 dmso solution sigma aldrich st louis usa the cells were exposed to 18 dilutions of e2 at concentrations range of 1 25 10 13 m to 5 0 10 8 m final concentration of dmso in the well was 1 each sample was tested in 12 dilution factors in relation to the initial solution 0 25 2 5 10 4 dmso was added into each sample in the dilution step final concentration of dmso in the well was 1 as negative control were used a dmso 1 solution and b only ultrapure water eldridge et al 2015 the experiments were arranged identically on two plates one for the estrogenic evaluation using blyes strain and the other using blyr strain the analyte concentration is considered toxic for the strains if there is reduction 20 ic20 of the blyr strain bioluminescence signal the plates were shaken and incubated at 30 c for 4 h bioluminescence was measured using an integration time of 1 second per well the response of each samples was converted to relative response unit expressed as a percentage of the maximum response observed for e2 e2max the 50 effective concentration ec50 and or 20 effective concentration ec20 were calculated using the linear portion of the sigmoidal dose response curve the equivalent of e2 of the samples were calculated in function of positive control ec of e2 ec of the sample detection limits were determined by calculating the concentration of chemical at background bioluminescence plus three standards deviations according to eldridge et al 2011 2 4 3 cell viability by colorimetric mtt assay the mtt assay was performed according to iso 10993 5 2009 2009 with minor adaptations after the proper growth and maintenance the hepg2 cells were seeded at a density of 4 104 cells per well in 200 µl of fresh medium the plates were incubated for 24 h 5 co2 37 c 90 humidity to form a half confluent monolayer the plate was examined under a phase contrast microscope and the medium carefully removed then it was added 100 µl of dmem containing 1 of fetal bovine serum and 100 µl of sample negative control pbs solution 1 and ph 7 2 positive control dmso or blank the samples were tested in 5 concentrations levels adequately spaced 0 3125 0 625 1 25 2 5 and 5 mg l 1 the plates were incubated at the same aforementioned conditions for 48 h and examined under a phase contrast microscope the medium was carefully removed from the plates to avoid reductive chemicals thus 50 µl of mtt at 5 mg ml 1 were added in each well and the plate was incubated for 2 h the mtt solution was removed and the formazan salt was solubilized with 100 µl of dmso the plates were shaked and absorbance was measured using a 490 nm filter reference wavelength 650 nm cytotoxic effects are confirmed if viability is reduced to less than 70 of the blank the quality check of assay was performed according to iso 10993 5 2009 2009 2 4 4 in silico toxicity evaluation the toxicity prediction was assessed using the us environmental protection agenccy toxicity estimation software tool us epa t e s t version 4 2 1 based on quantitative structure activity relationship q sar methodologies martin 2016 consensus was the prediction method applied to evaluate following endpoints mutagenicity ames test reference and developmental toxicity to animals and humans consensus method has shown to achieve the best prediction results during external validation martin 2016 for binary active inactive toxicity endpoints the accuracy is evaluated in terms of concordance sensibility and specificity in the training set concordance sensitivity and specificity values closer to 1 0 mean better accuracy on toxicity prediction higher prediction sensitivities than specificities are common and acceptable for regulatory applications because it is desirable to minimize false negatives martin 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal and mineralization of metribuzin in chlorination process metribuzin removal analysis was performed to evaluate the reactivity of this herbicide during chlorination process with excess of free chlorine according to fig 1 a metribuzin have a half life time t1 2 of 2 95 min and 92 of removal in 30 min of reaction when submitted to free chlorine at conditions employed in this study the high reactivity of this herbicide was expected once reactive sulfur present on metribuzin s structure may suffer rapid oxidation in addition the structure contains a heterocyclic moiety capable of undergoing ring opening reactions electrophilic and nucleophilic sites susceptible to substitution reactions and unsaturated bonds prone to addition reactions in a recent study hu et al 2017 demonstrated that metribuzin 1 mg l 1 was quickly removed by free chlorine and exerted fast consumption of hocl during drinking water treatment when compared to other herbicides metribuzin has showed high reactivity when submitted to chlorination process using naocl as disinfectant agent however toc results evidenced that mineralization was not achieved after 24 h of free chlorine exposure mineralization is desirable but it is not the main objective of disinfection processes in wtps according to fig 1 b there is no significant difference between the toc of unreacted 0 hour and the chlorinated solutions 24 h even under the high chlorine dosage used in this research in a metribuzin solution free of organic interferents e g natural organic matter and long exposure time the herbicide mineralization was negligible although under different conditions metribuzin mineralization would hardly occur by chlorination step in the real wtp metribuzin removal added to its non mineralization points to the dbps formation that should be further investigated 3 2 identification and elucidation of disinfection by products using hrms the identification of metribuzin by products using uhplc esi hrms provided consistent data to identify and elucidate seventeen compounds generated by chlorination process molecular and structural formulas were proposed based on exact monoisotopic mass relative abundance of isotopes double bond equivalence dbe and when possible by fragmentation profile of the pattern ions ms2 in the collision cell table s1 supplementary data in addition mass spectrum comparison among the chlorinated samples with unreacted and blank solutions were carried out table 1 shows the molecular formulas proposed their theoretical and experimental m z ratio and the calculated error although metribuzin contains electrophilic sites the chlorine atom was not detected in the byproducts chemical structure due to chemical structure of hocl characterized by polarization of cl oh clδ ohδ it readily participates in electrophilic substitution and addition reactions on nucleophilic sites with the chlorine presence on formed by products the dbps identified were formed by sulfur oxidation deamination of the primary amine and in minor proportion by cleavage of the heterocyclic ring based on hplc esi hrms data isotopic ratios and fragmentation by collision induced dissociation table s1 supplementary data the dbps chemical structures and the supposed degradation pathway of metribuzin by chlorination process were proposed fig 2 dbp m12 dbp m15 and dbp m16 commonly described in the literature are identified as deamino metribuzin da deketo metribuzin dk and deamino deketo metribuzin dadk respectively this degradation pathway is especially important for metribuzin degradation in the environmental because it leads to decline of herbicidal activity raschke et al 1998 a although there is a lack of detailed information about potential reaction mechanisms da formation is described as a deamination according to raschke et al 1998 b deamination by photolysis of 4 amino substituted 1 2 4 triazinones and thiones occurs only under the condition of single or double bond with sulfur in position 3 even for compounds with different substituents in position 6 previous investigations confirm that proton donating solvents are required for deamination raschke et al 1998 a the aforementioned conditions may also be decisive for deamination via chlorination process although the mechanism is likely to be different the authors hypothesis is that the deamination occurred via electrophilic attack involving n of the primary amine and free chlorine cleavage susceptibility of the nnh2 bond led to simultaneous deamination after chlorine substitution in the primary amine releasing chloramine in the medium rapid deamination generates more stable compounds due to electrostatic interactions and ring stabilization by tautomeric equilibrium primary amines are very susceptible to chlorination however n chlorinated intermediates were not identified in this study according to dodd and huang 2004 na2s2o3 as quenching agent may reduce n chlorinated intermediates back to the parent compound however tests using ammonium chloride nh4cl as a soft quenching agent were performed and cl containing intermediates were not identified this reinforces our hypothesis regarding the metribuzin deamination mechanism by chlorination reactions in the reactional conditions employed in this study da in oxidative medium was converted to dadk by product due to sulfur oxidation for this reason dbp m12 was consumed after 15 min of reaction fig 3 probably the formation reaction rate of dbp m12 becomes less than the rate of its degradation to form dbp m8 and then dbp m16 dbp m13 also can be formed from dbp m12 dk dbp m15 is formed by sulfur oxidation without deamination reaction sulfur oxidation reactions lead to the formation of dbp m5 and dbp m3 followed by molecule desulfurization dk dbp m15 may suffer deamination to form dadk dbp m16 however the rate of deamination is very slow once sulfur is replaced by another substituent in this case oxygen raschke et al 1998 b the oxidation of sulfur is linked to the formation of sulfone or sulfate raschke et al 1998 a dadk dbp m16 is formed mainly by deamination followed by desulfurization as shown in fig 3 this by product continues to be formed up to 60 min stabilization after this time might be related to ring cleavage reactions occurring simultaneously the hydroxylation of nitrogen in position 2 of the ring structure to form dbp m7 was identified this by product is formed by deamination and sulfur oxidation followed by the nitrogen hydroxylation dbp m7 can be confirmed based on fragmentation with formation of the following ions m z 118 99135 c2h3n2o2s and 168 07729 c7h10n3o2 table s1 supplementary data the dbp m7 formation can be favored by electron withdrawing neighboring groups soch3 sooh and co partial positive charge assumed by nitrogen due to electronic cloud distortion favors the hydroxylation reaction since there is abundance of hydroxyl in the medium dbp m6 is formed by sulfur oxidation of dbp m7 there is no reference to the formation of these by products in the literature hydroxylation reactions also occurred in the tert butyl substituent to form dbp m1 dbp m2 and dbp m4 although ring bonds are strongly polar and stabilized by electrostatic interactions ring opening reactions were also observed by formation of dbp m9 dbp m10 dbp m11 dbp m13 dbp m14 and dpp m17 the dbp m11 is formed by oxidation of the ring carbonyl followed by a chemical structure rearrangement to form a highly stable five membered ring in addition terc butyl group suffer an oxidation reaction to form an aldehyde according to fig 3 dbp m11 is quickly consumed due to deamination reaction followed by sulfur oxidation to form dbp m14 and dbp m10 respectively dbp m13 is formed by ring rearrangement and substitution on terc methyl group probably caused by complete oxidation of a methyl group generating a tertiary alcohol the dbp m13 was proposed based on following positive fragment ions m z 143 08214 c6h11n2o2 and 125 07143 c6h9n2o1 table s1 supplementary data dbp m17 is known as trimethyl pyruvic acid ketocarboxylic acid an important input for the chemical synthesis industry dbp m17 can be formed by oxidation of many compound identified as dbps raschke et al 1998 a also observed ring cleavage and formation of organic ionic compounds such as monocarboxylic dicarboxylic and ketocarboxylic acids in photolysis of metribuzin in oxygenated aqueous solutions the identified dbps and the proposed pathway for the metribuzin degradation in this study were unprecedented in the literature for chlorination process the first and only chlorination of metribuzin study was published by hu et al 2017 however only the degradation kinetics and some chlorinated disinfection by products described on epa 551a and epa551b methods were evaluated hu et al 2017 evidenced the formation of dichloroacetonitrile 1 1 dichloro 2 propanone 1 1 trichloro 2 propanone trichloronitromethane and majority chloroform hu et al 2017 it is important to highlight that cl containing intermediates must be formed since hu et al 2017 evidenced the formation of regulated dbps in chlorinated solutions of metribuzin there are many possibilities to form chlorinated intermediates such as ring cleavage reactions and the loss of methyl group from s ch3 bond for instance however the dbps identified in this study are those that can be analyzed by the analytical technique employed limitations mainly related to ionization capacity of some compounds via electrospray sources can compromise the identification of other compounds of interest 3 3 toxicity evaluation 3 3 1 acute toxicity using artemia salina studies indicate that metribuzin is practically nontoxic or slightly toxic to fresh or estuarine marine fishes and invertebrates on an acute bases but highly toxic to nontarget aquatic plants epa 1998 however there are no studies involving acute toxicity of dbps formed by chlorination of metribuzim in the present study the purpose of using artemia salina nauplii was to identify significant alterations in acute toxicity of pre and post chlorination metribuzin solutions at 10 mg l 1 this test does not conclude about adverse effects of these compounds on aquatic ecosystems but if the chlorination process could increase the risk of this herbicide furthermore once toxic to artemia salina these by products could represent an increased risk for more sensitive aquatic organisms based on results shown in fig 4 there are no significant increase in acute toxicity tukey comparison at 95 confidence between the blank solution and times 0 15 30 60 min and 12 h on the other hand the solution submitted to 24 h of chlorination showed a significant toxicity increase around 20 in relation to blank to the nauplii after 48 h of exposure although it was not possible to quantify the relative contribution of each dbp in the mixture total toxicity the by products dbp m1 m9 m10 m13 and m14 were the only ones to show an increase on their intensity from 12 to 24 h fig 3 thus these compounds might have a greater contribution compared to the other compounds however the presence unidentified dpbs and the synergistic effect in the mixture must be considered 3 3 2 estrogenic potential using blyes and blyr yeasts according to the aforementioned procedure 12 dilutions were prepared from each sample of metribuzin data were plotted in function of the maximum bioluminescence response for e2 versus log of molar concentration positive control or log of dilution factor samples to the blyes assay fig 5 a for blyr assay data were plotted in log scale for both axes bioluminescence cps versus molar concentration positive control or dilution factor samples fig 5 b blyes strain showed similar sensitivity to the estrogenic assay when compared to other studies bergamasco et al 2011 sanseverino et al 2009 the average ec50 and limit of detection lod values obtained for 17 β estradiol from 3 independent experiments were 5 35 1 92 10 10 mol l 1 and 5 47 1 70 ng l 1 respectively according to results showed in fig 5 a 15 min 60 min 12 h and 24 h reaction times presented a clear dose response curve t 0 min and t 30 min metribuzin solutions showed a tendency to estrogenic activity however it was not possible to quantify the ec20 for t 0 min solution because just the 2 most concentrated points had an increase of bioluminescence response the t 30 min solution showed equivalent of e2 values lower than lod according to fig 5 b there were not toxic effects ic20 for the tested solutions the bioluminescence for any tested concentration was the same from negative control solutions a ultrapure water b 1 dmso solution in ultrapure water therefore the dose response curve for all samples in the blyr assay generated overlapped curves with the same response to any concentration tested bioluminescence decrease in blyr assay could cause false negative results in blyes assay table 2 shows the equivalent of e2 expressed in mol l 1 and ng l 1 for each solution it is important to highlight that equivalent of e2 value for each solution was calculated based on ec20 of e2 obtained in the same 96 well plate and not the average ec20 value the equivalent of e2 values were calculated by dividing the ec20 of e2 by the ec20 of the samples the obtained results showed that all chlorinated solutions had greater estrogenic activity than the non chlorinated solution at the same initial concentration of metribuzin thus it is possible to affirm that the chlorination processes in wtps may increase the risk associated with the metribuzin presence in public water supply unreacted metribuzin and t 30 min solution showed equivalent of e2 value lower than lod on the other hand the t 24 h solution showed the highest estrogenicity value according to table 2 the equivalent e2 values for a 10 mg l 1 chlorinated metribuzin solutions ranged from 0 06 to 6 71 µg l 1 for different contact time with free chlorine in silico methods were applied to identify which dbps could increase the estrogenicity of the solutions but the results were not conclusive the obtained results demonstrate that metribuzin can contribute to the increase of estrogenic response of chlorinated samples in real wtps once it cannot be removed in steps prior to chlorination coagulation flocculation sedimentation and filtration hu et al 2017 similar behavior was identified in studies involving chlorination and other alternative oxidative processes to remove estrogenic compounds from water and waste water samples based on bila et al 2007 study ozone dosage was efficient to remove 17 β estradiol from water samples but not enough to reduce the estrogenicity effects hu et al 2006 demonstrated that the increase of contact time with free chlorine can increase the estrogenic activity of chlorinated effluents literature data has demonstrated that metribuzin causes significant effects on hormonal changes in rats thyroxine and somatotropin levels were significantly altered after weeks of exposure at high concentration levels of this herbicide mnif et al 2011 porter et al 1993 however there are no studies evaluating the effects of chlorination on estrogenic activity of the metribuzin the authors highlight that caution should be used in the results interpretation since metribuzin was chlorinated at high concentration and without interferents e g natural organic matter the high estrogenic activity of the dbps formed after metribuzin chlorination should be an alert to the need for further studies involving risk assessment of this herbicide in drinking water especially regarding long term estrogenic effect 3 3 3 cell viability using colorimetric mtt assay the effects of metribuzin solutions pre and post chlorination on cell viability were evaluated by measuring of mitochondrial enzymes activity of living cells using a colorimetric assay mtt the hepatic cells hepg2 were submitted to 48 h of exposure at chlorinated solutions of metribuzin generated from different reaction times 0 15 min 30 min 60 min 12 h and 24 h at five concentration levels the percentage of viable cells was calculated in function of average absorbance of the negative control replicates according to fig 6 there was not evidenced a cell viability reduction that represents toxic effects on cells under conditions described in the present study cell viability tests for metribuzin have not been found in the literature however this herbicide has been described as slightly to moderately toxic to animals and humans in acute and subchronic chronic exposure based assays chiali et al 2013 epa 2003 1998 on the other hand there are no literature data about acute toxicity in vitro or in vivo assay for chlorinated solutions of metribuzin the by products da dk and dadk metribuzin are common by products in other oxidative disinfection process they are considered 2 to 3 times more toxic than pattern compound in acute toxicity via oral exposure but there are few toxicological studies involving these compounds dodor 2008 although it was not possible to conclude about toxicity of each dbp formed in chlorination process the results indicate that there was no toxicity increase of the solutions under the conditions employed in this cell viability test 3 3 4 in silico toxicity ames mutagenicity and developmental toxicity to animals and humans were the selected endpoints for this study predicted values for each compound and validation values were described in table 3 validation values are important to increase the result confidence in the predicted values validation parameters were not calculated for some dbps because there were not similar compounds in the training set this means that the prediction was performed by model extrapolation and therefore they are non reliable in general validation parameters for ames mutagenicity prediction based on consensus method showed high concordance values which indicates greater accuracy in the predicted values most of the evaluated dbps did not present mutagenic effects according to q sar method dbp m11 and dbp m15 may be active for ames mutagenicity tests mainly regarding dbp m11 that presented a highly reliable prediction validation parameters for metribuzin mutagenicity value were not satisfactory concordance 0 00 however according to epa metribuzin has been shown to be non mutagenic epa 2003 in the case of our developmental toxicity investigation it was not possible to evaluate the prediction accuracy for most compounds although all identified dbps demonstrated to be developmental toxicant to animal and human many predictions were non reliable nevertheless the results suggested that dbps may be more toxic than metribuzin the dbps m12 m13 m15 m16 and m17 were considered developmental toxicants according to q sar method with moderate to high reliability literature data has indicated that metribuzin is not developmental toxicant to humans and animals epa 1998 which confirms the q sar prediction obtained for this compound the results indicated that the identified dbps can be more toxic than metribuzin especially for developmental toxicity endpoint thus it is possible that chlorination process might significantly increases the metribuzin toxicity in drinking water these toxicity results should be treated cautiously given that they are based on mathematical calculations therefore these adverse effects should be investigated further 4 conclusions chlorination reaction proved to be efficient for removing metribuzin at 10 mg l 1 from aqueous solutions however the metribuzin mineralization was negligible thus disinfection by products were generated of which seventeen were identified and elucidated in this study toxicity assays demonstrated that chlorinated solutions can be more toxic than the precursor compound especially regarding estrogenicity after chlorinated metribuzin showed estrogenicity equivalent to p nonylphenol and estriol in addition in silico toxicity assays indicated that some byproducts have potential to be mutagenic and developmental toxicant to animal and humans artemia salina test also indicated that the metribuzin by products can be more toxic to the aquatic environmental metribuzin occurrence in water sources has been commonly described in the literature data so it can represent a risk to the drinking water safety the authors alert the need for continuously carrying out studies involving presence of anthropogenic organic microcontaminants especially pesticides in drinking water

17328,a widely used herbicide metribuzin was evaluated for degradation mineralization and disinfection by products dbps formation during aqueous chlorination in addition to assess the toxicity effects of chlorination on metribuzin solution the following tests were performed acute toxicity using artemia salina nauplii cell viability using mtt assay estrogenicity using a re engineered bioluminescent yeast estrogen screen blyes and a constitutively bioluminescent strain blyr mutagenicity and developmental toxicity using q sar methodology metribuzin at 10 mg l 1 was degraded by chlorination achieving 93 of removal at 30 min of reaction toc analysis showed that the herbicide does not suffer complete mineralization even after 24 h of contact with free chlorine seventeen dbps were detected and their structural formulae were elucidated by high resolution mass spectrometry toxicity effects for chlorinated solutions increased when compared to the unreacted metribuzin solution dbps were more toxic to artemia salina nauplii increasing around 20 on nauplii mortality it was also observed high estrogenicity to human receptors in blyes assays and mutagenic and developmental toxicant effects to animals and humans in q sar methodology suggesting that dbps are potentially more toxic than the precursor metribuzin metribuzin solutions at 10 mg l 1 showed equivalent 17 β estradiol

konstantinou 2014 štěpánova et al 2012 metribuzin is considered nontoxic or slightly toxic to non target species such as mammals bees fresh or estuarine marine fishes and invertebrates and moderately toxic to avian species on an acute basis according to epa metribuzin has not shown carcinogenicity mutagenicity or developmental toxicity effects to humans and animals epa 2003 1998 due to its efficiency and relative low toxicity this herbicide has been extensively used in diverse crops worldwide such as soybean sugar cane tomato carrots vines and others honório et al 2013 travlos et al 2017 consequently metribuzin has been determined in different aquatic compartments at trace concentration levels metribuzin is highly susceptible to runoff and leaching into surface and groundwater due to its physical and chemical properties antonopoulou and konstantinou 2014 fairchild and sappington 2002 štěpánova et al 2012 residues levels up to 25 15 µg l 1 in water samples have been reported in the literature antonopoulou and konstantinou 2014 in brazil surface and groundwater metribuzin contamination has been associated to soybean corn and cotton producing regions albuquerque et al 2016 in a monitoring study developed by dores et al 2006 metribuzin was the most detected herbicide frequency of 48 in surface and groundwater located in the middle west of brazil in this study metribuzin was detected in drinking water well waterhole dam and irrigation well at maximum concentration values of 351 90 138 and 129 ng l 1 respectively according to albuquerque et al 2016 metribuzin was detected in 20 out of 113 samples from brazilian freshwater at concentration from 3 to 8 ng l 1 in a literature review about emergent contaminants in aquatic matrices from brazil metribuzin was one of the organic microcontaminants identified among those with the highest concentrations detected in groundwater samples montagner et al 2017 once present in waters bodies organic microcontaminants can reach drinking water sources and pass unchanged through the treatment or react in the chlorination step to generate disinfection by products dbps according to hu et al 2017 metribuzin cannot be removed through coagulation sedimentation and filtration used in conventional water treatment plants wtps on the other hand metribuzin has been shown to be reactive to free chlorine in the disinfection step generating dbps in the treated effluent chamberlain et al 2012 hu et al 2017 it is known that natural organic matter nom primarily comprised of humic and fulvic acids is the major contributor to dbps formation in the last decade several studies have suggested an increased rate in liver colon bladder and rectum cancers in populations exposed to some of these dbps produced by chlorination of nom abbas et al 2015 komulainen 2004 however the contribution by microcontaminants in this issue must not be neglected pesticides have been studied in chlorination step to evaluate the formation of new dbps or even regulated dbps hu et al 2015 2017 kamata et al 2017 kamoshita et al 2010 li et al 2016 tian et al 2014 2013 xu et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 some studies have shown that dbps formed by pesticide chlorination may be more toxic than their precursor compounds kamoshita et al 2010 tawk et al 2015 tian et al 2014 2013 although there are many studies involving the chlorination of pesticides in wtps there is still a huge knowledge gap regarding the dbps formation for many active ingredients in addition there are few pesticide chlorination studies addressing the dbps toxicity kamoshita et al 2010 kishida et al 2010 tawk et al 2015 tian et al 2014 2013 there are some studies in the literature describing the removal and or degradation kinetics of metribuzin in chlorination reactions hu et al 2017 conducted a thorough research to evaluate the degradation kinetics of metribuzin initial concentration of 1000 µg l 1 in chlorination process the ph bromide and ammonium concentration as well as temperature effects were evaluated according to this study degradation of metribuzin can be well described by a second order kinetics model and the rate constants of the acid catalyzed and hocl oxidizing charged metribuzin were 7 72 0 90 108 m 2 min 1 and 8 22 4 90 103 m 1 min 1 respectively metribuzin degradation rate increased with bromide concentration acid ph and temperature and decreased with ammonium concentration in addition hu et al 2017 evaluated some halogenated volatile dbps described on epa 551a and epa 551b methods in another study chamberlain et al 2012 demonstrated that metribuzin is reactive to free chlorine even at very low concentration levels 1 to 3 µg l 1 and typical surface water disinfection conditions free chlorine concentration 2 to 5 mg l 1 contact time x free chorine concentration 107 to 146 mg min l 1 metribuzin was at least moderately reactive 20 50 of removal to free chlorine under slightly acid conditions ph 6 6 and more recalcitrant 20 of removal under basic conditions ph 8 6 according to miltner et al 1989 96 of metribuzin was removed from river water after 6 h under contact with free chlorine at 3 mg l 1 in this study removal estimate may have been impacted due to the lack of quenching following sampling to the authors best knowledge the aforementioned studies are the only ones related to metribuzin chlorination in the literature therefore there are no studies involving identification and elucidation of non target dbps the supposed degradation pathway and or the toxicity assessment of metribuzin by products after chlorination process in view of metribuzin presence in water sources and its recognized reactivity to free chlorine the development of this study is crucial to understanding the formation of new dbps and their potential risks to human and environmental health thus the main objectives of this study were 1 to identify the main dbps formed during metribuzin chlorination using ultra high performance liquid chromatography heated electrospray ionization high resolution mass spectrometry uhplchesi hrms 2 to propose a degradation pathway and 3 to apply in vivo in vitro and in silico toxicity tests to measure possible adverse effects of unreacted and chlorinated metribuzin solutions on non target organisms for which the intact herbicide is supposed to be safe 2 materials

prepared in a 1000 ml volumetric flask to evaluate removal mineralization and disinfection by products formation of the herbicide in chlorination disinfection process metribuzin concentration was considerably higher than in surface water samples to ensure the identification and elucidation of minor dbps with the analytical method in addition the biological assays applied in this study require high concentration of the compound to assess the toxic effects in a short time exposure for disinfection by products elucidation and mineralization rate analysis of the metribuzin aliquots of 250 ml

toxicity assays 2 4 1 acute toxicity using artemia salina assay the hatching procedure followed the standardized short term toxicity test with artemia salina nauplii described by vanhaecke and persoone 1981 the hatching medium was produced with artificial seawater 35 g l 1 solution of sea salt and the ph was adjusted to 8 9 then the solution was transferred to an aquarium adapted with a teflon divider which has 2 mm diameter orifices equally spaced from each other thus the orifices were sealed and on one side of the aquarium were added 500 mg l 1 of brine shrimp cyst the system was aerated and kept under illumination 70 w for 24 h at 25 2 ⁰c a large number of cysts hatched starting the first larval stage of the brine shrimp nauplii i then the aeration system was turned off the part of the aquarium where the larvae hatched was protected from light and the seal of the divider with orifices was removed the light source was positioned at the opposite side to attract the larvae thus the artemia salina nauplli stage i were separated from cysts and in addition there was a selection by mobility the aquarium divider was locked and the system was aired and kept under illumination for 24 h the incubation for 48 h ensured that all larvae had moulted to the instar ii iii stages the most sensitive stages vanhaecke et al 1981 vanhaecke and persoone 1981 xu et al 2015 10 larvae were transferred for each well of 24 well plates and exposed to herbicide solutions pre and post chlorination time 0 15 30 60 min 12 and 24 h at final concentration of 10 mg l 1 positive sodium lauryl sulfate curve and negative control saline solution were performed according vanhaecke et al 1981 and vanhaecke and persoone 1981 all experiments were performed in sextuplicate and the positive control curve in triplicates mortality after 48 h was calculated by number of immobile after 20 s of observation 2 4 2 estrogenicity assay the estrogenic activity of the chlorinated samples was determined using a lux based saccharomyces cerevisiae bioluminescent assay a strain capable of responding to estrogenic compounds bioluminescent yeast estrogen screen blyes and a constitutively bioluminescent strain blyr were applied as described by sanseverino et al 2005 sanseverino et al 2005 the re engineered saccharomyces cerevisiae was kindly provided by the toxicological analysis sector of the environmental company of the são paulo state cetesb with prior authorization from the company 490 biotec knoxville tennessee usa the growth of the blyes and blyr culture was performed according to sanseverino et al 2005 next one hundred and fifty microliters of yeast solutions and fifty microliters of sample blank solution positive control or negative control were transferred to each well of a black 96 well microfluor microtiter plates positive control was done using 17β estradiol e2 in 4 dmso solution sigma aldrich st louis usa the cells were exposed to 18 dilutions of e2 at concentrations range of 1 25 10 13 m to 5 0 10 8 m final concentration of dmso in the well was 1 each sample was tested in 12 dilution factors in relation to the initial solution 0 25 2 5 10 4 dmso was added into each sample in the dilution step final concentration of dmso in the well was 1 as negative control were used a dmso 1 solution and b only ultrapure water eldridge et al 2015 the experiments were arranged identically on two plates one for the estrogenic evaluation using blyes strain and the other using blyr strain the analyte concentration is considered toxic for the strains if there is reduction 20 ic20 of the blyr strain bioluminescence signal the plates were shaken and incubated at 30 c for 4 h bioluminescence was measured using an integration time of 1 second per well the response of each samples was converted to relative response unit expressed as a percentage of the maximum response observed for e2 e2max the 50 effective concentration ec50 and or 20 effective concentration ec20 were calculated using the linear portion of the sigmoidal dose response curve the equivalent of e2 of the samples were calculated in function of positive control ec of e2 ec of the sample detection limits were determined by calculating the concentration of chemical at background bioluminescence plus three standards deviations according to eldridge et al 2011 2 4 3 cell viability by colorimetric mtt assay the mtt assay was performed according to iso 10993 5 2009 2009 with minor adaptations after the proper growth and maintenance the hepg2 cells were seeded at a density of 4 104 cells per well in 200 µl of fresh medium the plates were incubated for 24 h 5 co2 37 c 90 humidity to form a half confluent monolayer the plate was examined under a phase contrast microscope and the medium carefully removed then it was added 100 µl of dmem containing 1 of fetal bovine serum and 100 µl of sample negative control pbs solution 1 and ph 7 2 positive control dmso or blank the samples were tested in 5 concentrations levels adequately spaced 0 3125 0 625 1 25 2 5 and 5 mg l 1 the plates were incubated at the same aforementioned conditions for 48 h and examined under a phase contrast microscope the medium was carefully removed from the plates to avoid reductive chemicals thus 50 µl of mtt at 5 mg ml 1 were added in each well and the plate was incubated for 2 h the mtt solution was removed and the formazan salt was solubilized with 100 µl of dmso the plates were shaked and absorbance was measured using a 490 nm filter reference wavelength 650 nm cytotoxic effects are confirmed if viability is reduced to less than 70 of the blank the quality check of assay was performed according to iso 10993 5 2009 2009 2 4 4 in silico toxicity evaluation the toxicity prediction was assessed using the us environmental protection agenccy toxicity estimation software tool us epa t e s t version 4 2 1 based on quantitative structure activity relationship q sar methodologies martin 2016 consensus was the prediction method applied to evaluate following endpoints mutagenicity ames test reference and developmental toxicity to animals and humans consensus method has shown to achieve the best prediction results during external validation martin 2016 for binary active inactive toxicity endpoints the accuracy is evaluated in terms of concordance sensibility and specificity in the training set concordance sensitivity and specificity values closer to 1 0 mean better accuracy on toxicity prediction higher prediction sensitivities than specificities are common and acceptable for regulatory applications because it is desirable to minimize false negatives martin 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal and mineralization of metribuzin in chlorination process metribuzin removal analysis was performed to evaluate the reactivity of this herbicide during chlorination process with excess of free chlorine according to fig 1 a metribuzin have a half life time t1 2 of 2 95 min and 92 of removal in 30 min of reaction when submitted to free chlorine at conditions employed in this study the high reactivity of this herbicide was expected once reactive sulfur present on metribuzin s structure may suffer rapid oxidation in addition the structure contains a heterocyclic moiety capable of undergoing ring opening reactions electrophilic and nucleophilic sites susceptible to substitution reactions and unsaturated bonds prone to addition reactions in a recent study hu et al 2017 demonstrated that metribuzin 1 mg l 1 was quickly removed by free chlorine and exerted fast consumption of hocl during drinking water treatment when compared to other herbicides metribuzin has showed high reactivity when submitted to chlorination process using naocl as disinfectant agent however toc results evidenced that mineralization was not achieved after 24 h of free chlorine exposure mineralization is desirable but it is not the main objective of disinfection processes in wtps according to fig 1 b there is no significant difference between the toc of unreacted 0 hour and the chlorinated solutions 24 h even under the high chlorine dosage used in this research in a metribuzin solution free of organic interferents e g natural organic matter and long exposure time the herbicide mineralization was negligible although under different conditions metribuzin mineralization would hardly occur by chlorination step in the real wtp metribuzin removal added to its non mineralization points to the dbps formation that should be further investigated 3 2 identification and elucidation of disinfection by products using hrms the identification of metribuzin by products using uhplc esi hrms provided consistent data to identify and elucidate seventeen compounds generated by chlorination process molecular and structural formulas were proposed based on exact monoisotopic mass relative abundance of isotopes double bond equivalence dbe and when possible by fragmentation profile of the pattern ions ms2 in the collision cell table s1 supplementary data in addition mass spectrum comparison among the chlorinated samples with unreacted and blank solutions were carried out table 1 shows the molecular formulas proposed their theoretical and experimental m z ratio and the calculated error although metribuzin contains electrophilic sites the chlorine atom was not detected in the byproducts chemical structure due to chemical structure of hocl characterized by polarization of cl oh clδ ohδ it readily participates in electrophilic substitution and addition reactions on nucleophilic sites with the chlorine presence on formed by products the dbps identified were formed by sulfur oxidation deamination of the primary amine and in minor proportion by cleavage of the heterocyclic ring based on hplc esi hrms data isotopic ratios and fragmentation by collision induced dissociation table s1 supplementary data the dbps chemical structures and the supposed degradation pathway of metribuzin by chlorination process were proposed fig 2 dbp m12 dbp m15 and dbp m16 commonly described in the literature are identified as deamino metribuzin da deketo metribuzin dk and deamino deketo metribuzin dadk respectively this degradation pathway is especially important for metribuzin degradation in the environmental because it leads to decline of herbicidal activity raschke et al 1998 a although there is a lack of detailed information about potential reaction mechanisms da formation is described as a deamination according to raschke et al 1998 b deamination by photolysis of 4 amino substituted 1 2 4 triazinones and thiones occurs only under the condition of single or double bond with sulfur in position 3 even for compounds with different substituents in position 6 previous investigations confirm that proton donating solvents are required for deamination raschke et al 1998 a the aforementioned conditions may also be decisive for deamination via chlorination process although the mechanism is likely to be different the authors hypothesis is that the deamination occurred via electrophilic attack involving n of the primary amine and free chlorine cleavage susceptibility of the nnh2 bond led to simultaneous deamination after chlorine substitution in the primary amine releasing chloramine in the medium rapid deamination generates more stable compounds due to electrostatic interactions and ring stabilization by tautomeric equilibrium primary amines are very susceptible to chlorination however n chlorinated intermediates were not identified in this study according to dodd and huang 2004 na2s2o3 as quenching agent may reduce n chlorinated intermediates back to the parent compound however tests using ammonium chloride nh4cl as a soft quenching agent were performed and cl containing intermediates were not identified this reinforces our hypothesis regarding the metribuzin deamination mechanism by chlorination reactions in the reactional conditions employed in this study da in oxidative medium was converted to dadk by product due to sulfur oxidation for this reason dbp m12 was consumed after 15 min of reaction fig 3 probably the formation reaction rate of dbp m12 becomes less than the rate of its degradation to form dbp m8 and then dbp m16 dbp m13 also can be formed from dbp m12 dk dbp m15 is formed by sulfur oxidation without deamination reaction sulfur oxidation reactions lead to the formation of dbp m5 and dbp m3 followed by molecule desulfurization dk dbp m15 may suffer deamination to form dadk dbp m16 however the rate of deamination is very slow once sulfur is replaced by another substituent in this case oxygen raschke et al 1998 b the oxidation of sulfur is linked to the formation of sulfone or sulfate raschke et al 1998 a dadk dbp m16 is formed mainly by deamination followed by desulfurization as shown in fig 3 this by product continues to be formed up to 60 min stabilization after this time might be related to ring cleavage reactions occurring simultaneously the hydroxylation of nitrogen in position 2 of the ring structure to form dbp m7 was identified this by product is formed by deamination and sulfur oxidation followed by the nitrogen hydroxylation dbp m7 can be confirmed based on fragmentation with formation of the following ions m z 118 99135 c2h3n2o2s and 168 07729 c7h10n3o2 table s1 supplementary data the dbp m7 formation can be favored by electron withdrawing neighboring groups soch3 sooh and co partial positive charge assumed by nitrogen due to electronic cloud distortion favors the hydroxylation reaction since there is abundance of hydroxyl in the medium dbp m6 is formed by sulfur oxidation of dbp m7 there is no reference to the formation of these by products in the literature hydroxylation reactions also occurred in the tert butyl substituent to form dbp m1 dbp m2 and dbp m4 although ring bonds are strongly polar and stabilized by electrostatic interactions ring opening reactions were also observed by formation of dbp m9 dbp m10 dbp m11 dbp m13 dbp m14 and dpp m17 the dbp m11 is formed by oxidation of the ring carbonyl followed by a chemical structure rearrangement to form a highly stable five membered ring in addition terc butyl group suffer an oxidation reaction to form an aldehyde according to fig 3 dbp m11 is quickly consumed due to deamination reaction followed by sulfur oxidation to form dbp m14 and dbp m10 respectively dbp m13 is formed by ring rearrangement and substitution on terc methyl group probably caused by complete oxidation of a methyl group generating a tertiary alcohol the dbp m13 was proposed based on following positive fragment ions m z 143 08214 c6h11n2o2 and 125 07143 c6h9n2o1 table s1 supplementary data dbp m17 is known as trimethyl pyruvic acid ketocarboxylic acid an important input for the chemical synthesis industry dbp m17 can be formed by oxidation of many compound identified as dbps raschke et al 1998 a also observed ring cleavage and formation of organic ionic compounds such as monocarboxylic dicarboxylic and ketocarboxylic acids in photolysis of metribuzin in oxygenated aqueous solutions the identified dbps and the proposed pathway for the metribuzin degradation in this study were unprecedented in the literature for chlorination process the first and only chlorination of metribuzin study was published by hu et al 2017 however only the degradation kinetics and some chlorinated disinfection by products described on epa 551a and epa551b methods were evaluated hu et al 2017 evidenced the formation of dichloroacetonitrile 1 1 dichloro 2 propanone 1 1 trichloro 2 propanone trichloronitromethane and majority chloroform hu et al 2017 it is important to highlight that cl containing intermediates must be formed since hu et al 2017 evidenced the formation of regulated dbps in chlorinated solutions of metribuzin there are many possibilities to form chlorinated intermediates such as ring cleavage reactions and the loss of methyl group from s ch3 bond for instance however the dbps identified in this study are those that can be analyzed by the analytical technique employed limitations mainly related to ionization capacity of some compounds via electrospray sources can compromise the identification of other compounds of interest 3 3 toxicity evaluation 3 3 1 acute toxicity using artemia salina studies indicate that metribuzin is practically nontoxic or slightly toxic to fresh or estuarine marine fishes and invertebrates on an acute bases but highly toxic to nontarget aquatic plants epa 1998 however there are no studies involving acute toxicity of dbps formed by chlorination of metribuzim in the present study the purpose of using artemia salina nauplii was to identify significant alterations in acute toxicity of pre and post chlorination metribuzin solutions at 10 mg l 1 this test does not conclude about adverse effects of these compounds on aquatic ecosystems but if the chlorination process could increase the risk of this herbicide furthermore once toxic to artemia salina these by products could represent an increased risk for more sensitive aquatic organisms based on results shown in fig 4 there are no significant increase in acute toxicity tukey comparison at 95 confidence between the blank solution and times 0 15 30 60 min and 12 h on the other hand the solution submitted to 24 h of chlorination showed a significant toxicity increase around 20 in relation to blank to the nauplii after 48 h of exposure although it was not possible to quantify the relative contribution of each dbp in the mixture total toxicity the by products dbp m1 m9 m10 m13 and m14 were the only ones to show an increase on their intensity from 12 to 24 h fig 3 thus these compounds might have a greater contribution compared to the other compounds however the presence unidentified dpbs and the synergistic effect in the mixture must be considered 3 3 2 estrogenic potential using blyes and blyr yeasts according to the aforementioned procedure 12 dilutions were prepared from each sample of metribuzin data were plotted in function of the maximum bioluminescence response for e2 versus log of molar concentration positive control or log of dilution factor samples to the blyes assay fig 5 a for blyr assay data were plotted in log scale for both axes bioluminescence cps versus molar concentration positive control or dilution factor samples fig 5 b blyes strain showed similar sensitivity to the estrogenic assay when compared to other studies bergamasco et al 2011 sanseverino et al 2009 the average ec50 and limit of detection lod values obtained for 17 β estradiol from 3 independent experiments were 5 35 1 92 10 10 mol l 1 and 5 47 1 70 ng l 1 respectively according to results showed in fig 5 a 15 min 60 min 12 h and 24 h reaction times presented a clear dose response curve t 0 min and t 30 min metribuzin solutions showed a tendency to estrogenic activity however it was not possible to quantify the ec20 for t 0 min solution because just the 2 most concentrated points had an increase of bioluminescence response the t 30 min solution showed equivalent of e2 values lower than lod according to fig 5 b there were not toxic effects ic20 for the tested solutions the bioluminescence for any tested concentration was the same from negative control solutions a ultrapure water b 1 dmso solution in ultrapure water therefore the dose response curve for all samples in the blyr assay generated overlapped curves with the same response to any concentration tested bioluminescence decrease in blyr assay could cause false negative results in blyes assay table 2 shows the equivalent of e2 expressed in mol l 1 and ng l 1 for each solution it is important to highlight that equivalent of e2 value for each solution was calculated based on ec20 of e2 obtained in the same 96 well plate and not the average ec20 value the equivalent of e2 values were calculated by dividing the ec20 of e2 by the ec20 of the samples the obtained results showed that all chlorinated solutions had greater estrogenic activity than the non chlorinated solution at the same initial concentration of metribuzin thus it is possible to affirm that the chlorination processes in wtps may increase the risk associated with the metribuzin presence in public water supply unreacted metribuzin and t 30 min solution showed equivalent of e2 value lower than lod on the other hand the t 24 h solution showed the highest estrogenicity value according to table 2 the equivalent e2 values for a 10 mg l 1 chlorinated metribuzin solutions ranged from 0 06 to 6 71 µg l 1 for different contact time with free chlorine in silico methods were applied to identify which dbps could increase the estrogenicity of the solutions but the results were not conclusive the obtained results demonstrate that metribuzin can contribute to the increase of estrogenic response of chlorinated samples in real wtps once it cannot be removed in steps prior to chlorination coagulation flocculation sedimentation and filtration hu et al 2017 similar behavior was identified in studies involving chlorination and other alternative oxidative processes to remove estrogenic compounds from water and waste water samples based on bila et al 2007 study ozone dosage was efficient to remove 17 β estradiol from water samples but not enough to reduce the estrogenicity effects hu et al 2006 demonstrated that the increase of contact time with free chlorine can increase the estrogenic activity of chlorinated effluents literature data has demonstrated that metribuzin causes significant effects on hormonal changes in rats thyroxine and somatotropin levels were significantly altered after weeks of exposure at high concentration levels of this herbicide mnif et al 2011 porter et al 1993 however there are no studies evaluating the effects of chlorination on estrogenic activity of the metribuzin the authors highlight that caution should be used in the results interpretation since metribuzin was chlorinated at high concentration and without interferents e g natural organic matter the high estrogenic activity of the dbps formed after metribuzin chlorination should be an alert to the need for further studies involving risk assessment of this herbicide in drinking water especially regarding long term estrogenic effect 3 3 3 cell viability using colorimetric mtt assay the effects of metribuzin solutions pre and post chlorination on cell viability were evaluated by measuring of mitochondrial enzymes activity of living cells using a colorimetric assay mtt the hepatic cells hepg2 were submitted to 48 h of exposure at chlorinated solutions of metribuzin generated from different reaction times 0 15 min 30 min 60 min 12 h and 24 h at five concentration levels the percentage of viable cells was calculated in function of average absorbance of the negative control replicates according to fig 6 there was not evidenced a cell viability reduction that represents toxic effects on cells under conditions described in the present study cell viability tests for metribuzin have not been found in the literature however this herbicide has been described as slightly to moderately toxic to animals and humans in acute and subchronic chronic exposure based assays chiali et al 2013 epa 2003 1998 on the other hand there are no literature data about acute toxicity in vitro or in vivo assay for chlorinated solutions of metribuzin the by products da dk and dadk metribuzin are common by products in other oxidative disinfection process they are considered 2 to 3 times more toxic than pattern compound in acute toxicity via oral exposure but there are few toxicological studies involving these compounds dodor 2008 although it was not possible to conclude about toxicity of each dbp formed in chlorination process the results indicate that there was no toxicity increase of the solutions under the conditions employed in this cell viability test 3 3 4 in silico toxicity ames mutagenicity and developmental toxicity to animals and humans were the selected endpoints for this study predicted values for each compound and validation values were described in table 3 validation values are important to increase the result confidence in the predicted values validation parameters were not calculated for some dbps because there were not similar compounds in the training set this means that the prediction was performed by model extrapolation and therefore they are non reliable in general validation parameters for ames mutagenicity prediction based on consensus method showed high concordance values which indicates greater accuracy in the predicted values most of the evaluated dbps did not present mutagenic effects according to q sar method dbp m11 and dbp m15 may be active for ames mutagenicity tests mainly regarding dbp m11 that presented a highly reliable prediction validation parameters for metribuzin mutagenicity value were not satisfactory concordance 0 00 however according to epa metribuzin has been shown to be non mutagenic epa 2003 in the case of our developmental toxicity investigation it was not possible to evaluate the prediction accuracy for most compounds although all identified dbps demonstrated to be developmental toxicant to animal and human many predictions were non reliable nevertheless the results suggested that dbps may be more toxic than metribuzin the dbps m12 m13 m15 m16 and m17 were considered developmental toxicants according to q sar method with moderate to high reliability literature data has indicated that metribuzin is not developmental toxicant to humans and animals epa 1998 which confirms the q sar prediction obtained for this compound the results indicated that the identified dbps can be more toxic than metribuzin especially for developmental toxicity endpoint thus it is possible that chlorination process might significantly increases the metribuzin toxicity in drinking water these toxicity results should be treated cautiously given that they are based on mathematical calculations therefore these adverse effects should be investigated further 4 conclusions chlorination reaction proved to be efficient for removing metribuzin at 10 mg l 1 from aqueous solutions however the metribuzin mineralization was negligible thus disinfection by products were generated of which seventeen were identified and elucidated in this study toxicity assays demonstrated that chlorinated solutions can be more toxic than the precursor compound especially regarding estrogenicity after chlorinated metribuzin showed estrogenicity equivalent to p nonylphenol and estriol in addition in silico toxicity assays indicated that some byproducts have potential to be mutagenic and developmental toxicant to animal and humans artemia salina test also indicated that the metribuzin by products can be more toxic to the aquatic environmental metribuzin occurrence in water sources has been commonly described in the literature data so it can represent a risk to the drinking water safety the authors alert the need for continuously carrying out studies involving presence of anthropogenic organic microcontaminants especially pesticides in drinking water

this approach has already been confirmed to be an attractive method for the monitoring of chemical pollutants brown and milton 2008 and pesticides li et al 2017 present in the environment at low

ultrasensitive detection huang et al 2020 ren et al 2011 its broader applicability has been hindered by problems associated with both sample preparation and reproducibility of the signal generated at the sers active sensor substrate su et al 2017 both being key requirements for practical implementation kudelski 2005 reilly et al 2007 thus techniques including the creation of colloidal suspensions

cheng et al 2011 and filtration zhang et al 2015 despite these advances there remain important limitations in the use of these paper based sensors including the high background raman interference in the sers detection observed in many commercially available papers furthermore the inhomogeneous and discrete distribution of nanostructures on paper has meant that many techniques have only moderate sensitivities in the nm range zhang et al 2015 in order to improve the signal readout large sample volumes e g litre level have been needed to accumulate molecular targets in the detection zone a task that is often impractical lee et al 2011 meng et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 the development of effective and simple production of closely packed nanostructure arrays uniformly distributed on the paper

model wastewater samples with sensitivities as low as nm equivalent to 150 ppt to our knowledge rapid sers detection using paper as a substrate to address wbe in the community for the evaluation of illicit drug use trends in real samples has not been reported here we demonstrate a new bespoke paper based sers substrate created by the assembly of noble metal core shell nanoparticles on modified electrospun glass nanofibrous paper gnfp the sensors were used for the detection of methamphetamine in water samples including surface water and wastewater in different areas within beijing fig 1 the objectives of this study were to synthesize au ag core shells by seeded growth which exhibit high sers enhancement and construct a novel paper based sers substrate with the nanoparticles immobilized on a nanofibrous paper functionalized with poly l lysine pll finally we used this novel paper based sers substrate for methamphetamine detection in real surface and wastewater samples which was compared to mass spectrometry as a gold standard reference technique in order to evaluate community drug consumption with sers sensors at wastewater treatment plants in beijing the sensor provides a potential tool for rapid on site analysis of sewage to identify spatio temporal variations in local trends in drug use 2 experimental section 2 1 preparation of glass nanofibrous paper based sers substrates synthesis of au ag core shell nanoparticles gold nanoparticles aunps were prepared by reduction of gold iii chloride hydrate with trisodium citrate using a procedure adapted from the literature shen et al 2010 briefly 50 ml of 0 01 w w haucl4 was reduced by 750 μl of 1 w w trisodium citrate solution at 100 c under vigorous magnetic stirring for 20 min until the solution turned light red the prepared aunps were used as seed particles a total of 600 μl of agno3 solution 0 5 w w was added to 100 ml of the boiling gold seed solution afterwards 1 ml of sodium citrate solution 1 w w was added dropwise as the reducing agent with stirring the solution was boiled for 1 h and then cooled to room temperature fabrication of au ag pll on paper gnfp 8 mm 8 mm was first cleaned exhaustively through a series of sequential washing steps with ultrapure water acetone ethanol and ultrapure water each for 10 min prior to drying at 60 c in the oven the paper was then immersed in 0 1 wt pll solution for 10 min and rinsed in water with any remaining fluid gently blown away under a stream of pure nitrogen gas the pll layer coated gnfp was then immersed into a solution containing the synthesized au ag core shell colloid for 30 h au ag core shell nanoparticles assembled on the surface of the nanofibrous paper due to local electrostatic interactions with pll finally the paper was washed with phosphate buffer 0 01 mm ph 7 0 and dried in a stream of nitrogen gas the substrates were characterized by both low magnification and high magnification field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem as shown in fig 2 2 2 analytical performance of the novel sers sensors to demonstrate the quantitative capability of this sers active sensor experimental samples were prepared as follows crystal violet cv solids were dissolved in ethyl alcohol without any further purification to obtain a 1 mm stock solution then cv standards were prepared using serial dilutions of the stock solution with ethyl alcohol similarly standards of methamphetamine were prepared again by serial dilution of a 100 ppm stock solution with deionized water giving a series of methamphetamine standards at 0 01 0 1 1 0 10 0 100 0 1000 0 and 10 000 0 ppb these standards were used to determine key analytical performance metrics including the limit of detection and linear range 2 3 detection of illicit drugs in water samples in order to evaluate the feasibility of detecting methamphetamine in real samples concentrations in surface and wastewater samples were determined using sers and these samples were also measured using conventional instrumentation namely liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms surface water samples were collected from two rivers the pearl river in guangdong province and the wanquan river in the city of beijing and from weiming lake in beijing see the supporting information for detailed sample collection information in addition wastewater was collected as both influent and effluent from sixteen domestic wastewater treatment plants fangzhuang xiaohongmen hexi wulituo lugouqiao beiyuan gaobeidian qinghe wujiacun xioajiahe jiuxianqiao beixiaohe wenquan xiaoyueyuan huaifang and yongfeng located in the urban area of beijing fig 1 sampling was conducted during summer each treatment plant was sampled for 4 consecutive days over a period of 24 h and the samples were combined for measurement detailed in the supporting information sers analysis two hundred millilitres of wastewater was processed on site by first acidifying the sample by adding 10 drops of hcl ph 2 and then filtering using a 0 22 μm membrane to remove solid debris purification and enrichment were performed using a standard 3 ml cationic solid phase extraction cartridge from affinisep paris france pre equilibrated using 1 ml of acetonitrile acn and 2 ml of water as follows sample loading of the 200 ml of filtered wastewater washing for removal of interferences in 3 ml of water and 3 ml of water acn 60 40 v v drying for 30 s prior to elution in 2 ml of methanol meoh containing 2 formic acid and finally analysis by sers lc ms analysis first 200 ml of each sample was filtered using 0 22 µm membrane filters to remove solid particles and then stored for reference laboratory analysis an oasis mcx cartridge from waters milford usa was pre conditioned in sequence with 6 ml of meoh 4 ml of deionized water and 4 ml of deionized water at ph 2 0 the sample was then loaded onto the cartridge at a flow rate of 2 3 ml min after drying under vacuum the sample was sequentially eluted off the cartridge with 4 ml of meoh and 4 ml of 5 nh3 in meoh the eluate was evaporated to dryness under a gentle nitrogen stream and re constituted in 200 μl of acn water 5 95 v v a further cleaning step was performed using a 0 22 μm centrifugal filter vwr international pa usa before lc ms analysis theoretical calculation simulations density functional theory dft calculations were used to confirm vibrational band assignments for methamphetamine c10h15n all the quantum chemical calculations were performed using dft with the bp86 functional and 6 311g d basis set employing the gaussian 09 and gaussview 3 09 program package kohn et al 1996 p hohenberg 1964 the calculations were performed without any symmetry restrictions 3 results and discussion 3 1 novel substrate for sers sensors au ag core shell nanoparticles were synthesized to combine the strong sers effect of ag with the well known stability of au li et al 2017 it has also been proposed that plasmonic au ag core shell nanomaterials have a better sers effect than single component au or ag due to their resonant behaviour li et al 2017 the synthesized au ag was characterized by ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrometry figure s1 as well as field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem and high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem fig 2 figure s1 shows the uv vis spectra of aunps and au ag compared with the absorption peak of aunps the peak of the au ag solution was blue shifted as shown in fig 2b and c the average diameter of au ag was approximately 40 nm exhibiting a uniform size we also obtained a more detailed au ag particle size distribution image through hr tem see figure s2 which demonstrated that the majority of the diameter sizes of au ag ranged from 37 to 43 nm 16 21 the gnfp 8 mm 8 mm provided an enhanced surface area leading to improvements in both sensitivity and dynamic range as a function of the increased number of noble metal core shell nanoparticles that could be modified on its surface the surface topography of the gnfp was determined by fe sem fig 2e and f showing that a highly porous three dimensional matrix was formed when compared to two dimensional planar substrates li et al 2017 nanofibrous paper substrates with a hierarchical structure of nanoparticles adsorbed onto the fibril matrix exhibited an increased surface area and enhanced the absorption capacity for easy access of analytes by absorbing the au ag pll solution the sers gnfp could be easily fabricated see scheme 1 here we used pll to attach au ag to the paper matrix by exploiting its positively charged amine functional groups and its low raman scattering cross section pll was readily absorbed onto the paper at room temperature without any other treatment providing an excellent mediator for the physisorption and ionic stabilization of the negatively charged au ag on the glassy paper in a single step according to a previous report fang et al 2015 the assembly times of glass in pll and nanoparticle solutions were optimized at 10 min and 30 h respectively using characterization of low magnification fig 2g and high magnification fig 2h fe sem images the experimental results show that the au ag core shell nanoparticles have been effectively loaded on gnfp with pll to investigate the reproducibility of the sers platform 8 different sers substrates were used to measure 100 nm cv standards fig 3 a shows that the 8 different spectra were consistent with a strong peak at 1620 cm 1 showing a relative standard deviation rsd of 5 given that an ideal sensor substrate should be stable for long term storage we compared the sers signals from a freshly prepared au ag assembled on the gnfp substrate with the same substrate following storage under atmospheric conditions for one or two months as shown in fig 3 2 μl of 100 nm cv was analysed on the freshly prepared au ag pll gnfp sers substrate no 3 and from a substrate prepared one month no 2 and two months no 1 earlier raman spectra were obtained using a portable raman spectroscopy system i raman portable raman spectrometer b w tek usa using a high quantum efficiency charge coupled device ccd array detector a 785 nm laser was used for excitation the collection parameters of each sers spectrum included an exposure time of 5000 ms and integrating 3 times over each spectrum the results demonstrated no significant decrease in the signal intensity with a raman peak at 1620 cm 1 showing an rsd of 5 9 3 2 detection of illicit drugs in solutions we used au ag pll assembled on glass nanoporous paper substrates for sers detection of methamphetamine as shown in fig 4 compared with the theoretical raman spectra fig 4 inset and the powder spectra figure s3 the sers spectra of methamphetamine show a close correspondence the sers bands were also compared with the theoretical predictions and vibrations as shown in table s1 which were consistent with assignments made in previous investigations kline et al 2016 the molecular structures of the analytes are presented in fig 4 as an aid for visualizing the vibrational mode assignments as shown in the raman spectra in table s1 methamphetamine can be differentiated using five bands at 619 cm 1 835 cm 1 1001 cm 1 1016 cm 1 and 1602 cm 1 although in our work we found the strongest signal band at 1016 cm 1 to be analytically most useful to illustrate the analytical capability of the sers active substrate for illicit drug detection we carried out the detection of methamphetamine in a combined qualitative and quantitative way first 2 µl of the methamphetamine solution at a series of standard concentrations 0 01 0 1 1 0 10 0 100 0 1000 0 and 10 000 0 ppb in anhydrous ethanol were analysed on the sers enabled paper substrate as the solvent evaporated the analytes were spread evenly on the sers active layer on the sensor scheme 1 raman spectra were obtained using a portable raman spectroscopy system i raman portable raman spectrometer b w tek usa using a high quantum efficiency ccd array detector a 785 nm laser was used for excitation the collection parameters of each sers spectrum included an exposure time of 5000 ms and integrating 3 times over each spectrum raman spectra of different concentrations of methamphetamine were obtained using the characteristic band at 1016 cm 1 fig 5 a indicates that the intensity of this signal increased for methamphetamine concentrations between 0 01 and 10 000 0 ppb with the baseline subtracted from all the raman spectra fig 5b shows the relationship between changes in the raman intensity of methamphetamine with increasing methamphetamine concentrations giving an excellent linear correlation r2 0 99 with the logarithmic concentration of methamphetamine ranging from 10 1 ppb to 104 ppb as presented in the inset of fig 5b the limit of detection was estimated to be 7 2 ppt 3 standard deviations above the mean of the baseline 3 3 evaluation of the drug concentration with sers sensors by analysis of surface water in order to investigate the efficacy of the sensor for the detection of real samples we present preliminarily results that verified the feasibility of analysing surface water including lake water and river water samples the surface water samples were first filtered with 0 22 µm membrane filters then 100 ppb methamphetamine was spiked into the different types of aqueous samples including buffer lake sample and river samples as shown in fig 6 a using lc ms measurements as our gold standard reference technique the results from the buffer sample corresponded well with the measured concentrations in the lake and river samples including the pearl river and wanquan river as shown in table s2 3 4 evaluation of community drug consumption with sers sensors at wastewater treatment plants we also analysed methamphetamine concentrations in the wastewater collected from 16 influent and effluent pipes in wastewater treatment plants in beijing again normalized by the daily flow rate of sewage at each plant fig 6b fig 6b and fig 6d demonstrated the concentrations of methamphetamine in sewage in beijing and estimated average loads of methamphetamine where wastewater samples were collected from influent detailed data in the tables s3 and s4 as shown in table s3 methamphetamine was present in all of the influents with concentrations ranging from 3 10 ppt to 180 0 ppt the high concentration level of methamphetamine in influents suggests a wide use of methamphetamine in beijing table s3 shows that higher methamphetamine daily drug loadings per daily flow rate are present at the five sites xiaohongmen gaobeidian qinghe jiuxianqiao and huaifang that are located in more central districts of beijing as shown in fig 1 closest to the business and entertainment centres with the highest population densities wenquan and yongfeng are the farthest from the centre of the city and showed the lowest daily drug load of methamphetamine in our sampling periods the drug load was also low at xiaojiahe and hexi which although not far from the urban centre receive sewage from the suburbs finally we also found that the removal efficiencies of methamphetamine were efficient in the wastewater treatment plants by comparing the influent with effluent samples as shown in fig 6b and table s3 again using data that were normalized by the flow rate as shown in fig 6c the removal efficiencies for methamphetamine were typically 89 with the exception of the fangzhuang 63 5 and hexi 60 3 plants similarly high methamphetamine removal efficiencies have been observed in the literature elsewhere loganathan et al 2009 postigo et al 2010 4 conclusion in summary we present the development of methods for the fabrication of sers substrates comprising glass nanoporous paper synthesized by electrospinning functionalized with au ag core shell nanoparticles the substrates serve as simple sers sensors with negligible background interference providing high sensitivity good reproducibility and excellent stability the sensors were used for the detection of methamphetamine in water treatment plants in beijing district and the results were in close agreement with those obtained by a gold standard mass spectrometry method as a reference this application of sers sensors demonstrates an innovative technology for the evaluation of community wide methamphetamine consumption the results also showed the effective removal of the drug measured as the difference between influx and efflux at the sampled wastewater treatment plants the sers sensors provided a clear demonstration of a new wbe tool that could have generic application to a range of public health issues including those for the rapid monitoring of community drug use local environmental pollution and markers for infectious diseases in addition chiral sensors should be further explored in the future

this approach has already been confirmed to be an attractive method for the monitoring of chemical pollutants brown and milton 2008 and pesticides li et al 2017 present in the environment at low concentrations the key to this technique is the electromagnetic enhancement afforded by noble metal nanostructures lin et al 2016 xie et al 2011 although sers analysis holds potential to achieve ultrasensitive detection huang et al 2020 ren et al 2011 its broader applicability has been hindered by problems associated with both sample preparation and reproducibility of the signal generated at the sers active sensor substrate su et al 2017 both being key requirements for practical implementation kudelski 2005 reilly et al 2007 thus techniques including the creation of colloidal suspensions of metal nanocrystals using chemical synthesis wang et al 2005 yap et al 2012 electrochemically nano textured metal surfaces cheng et al 2010 regularly patterned metal particles using vapour deposition reilly et al 2007 lithographic techniques wang et al 2005 and template directed self assembly yap et al 2012 have all been developed to manufacture stable and sensitive sensing surfaces the wide variety of different techniques currently available cheng et al 2010 includes those for the fabrication of well ordered periodic silver or gold nanoparticle arrays which enable precise control

he et al 2009 polavarapu and liz marzán 2013 polavarapu et al 2014 yu and white 2010 provide a versatile and low cost alternative and have attracted increasing interest in recent years for the development of portable miniaturized devices suitable for on site analysis and testing martinez et al 2008 2010 paper based sers substrates have the advantage that they can wick the samples by

cheng et al 2011 and filtration zhang et al 2015 despite these advances there remain important limitations in the use of these paper based sensors including the high background raman interference in the sers detection observed in many commercially available papers furthermore the inhomogeneous and discrete distribution of nanostructures on paper has meant that many techniques have only moderate sensitivities in the nm range zhang et al 2015 in order to improve the signal readout large sample volumes e g litre level have been needed to accumulate molecular targets in the detection zone a task that is often impractical lee et al 2011 meng et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 the development of effective and simple production of closely packed nanostructure arrays uniformly distributed on the paper surface for signal analysis also remains an important challenge in order to overcome this obstacle most recently xu et al 2019 reported the sers detection of methyl blue mb an organic pollutant in wastewater using zno au nanorods as the substrate similarly lee et al 2017 demonstrated the use of paper as a substrate for sers detection of two toxic drugs 4 aminobenzoic acid and pyrocatechol in model wastewater samples with sensitivities as low as nm equivalent to 150 ppt to our knowledge rapid sers detection using paper as a substrate to address wbe in the community for the evaluation of illicit drug use trends in real samples has not been reported here we demonstrate a new bespoke paper based sers substrate created by the assembly of noble metal core shell nanoparticles on modified electrospun glass nanofibrous paper gnfp the sensors were used for the detection of methamphetamine in water samples including surface water and wastewater in different areas within beijing fig 1 the objectives of this study were to synthesize au ag core shells by seeded growth which exhibit high sers enhancement and construct a novel paper based sers substrate with the nanoparticles immobilized on a nanofibrous paper functionalized with poly l lysine pll finally we used this novel paper based sers substrate for methamphetamine detection in real surface and wastewater samples which was compared to mass spectrometry as a gold standard reference technique in order to evaluate community drug consumption with sers sensors at wastewater treatment plants in beijing the sensor provides a potential tool for rapid on site analysis of sewage to identify spatio temporal variations in local trends in drug use 2 experimental section 2 1 preparation of glass nanofibrous paper based sers substrates synthesis of au ag core shell nanoparticles gold nanoparticles aunps were prepared by reduction of gold iii chloride hydrate with trisodium citrate using a procedure adapted from the literature shen et al 2010 briefly 50 ml of 0 01 w w haucl4 was reduced by 750 μl of 1 w w trisodium citrate solution at 100 c under vigorous magnetic stirring for 20 min until the solution turned light red the prepared aunps were used as seed particles a total of 600 μl of agno3 solution 0 5 w w was added to 100 ml of the boiling gold seed solution afterwards 1 ml of sodium citrate solution 1 w w was added dropwise as the reducing agent with stirring the solution was boiled for 1 h and then cooled to room temperature fabrication of au ag pll on paper gnfp 8 mm 8 mm was first cleaned exhaustively through a series of sequential washing steps with ultrapure water acetone ethanol and ultrapure water each for 10 min prior to drying at 60 c in the oven the paper was then immersed in 0 1 wt pll solution for 10 min and rinsed in water with any remaining fluid gently blown away under a stream of pure nitrogen gas the pll layer coated gnfp was then immersed into a solution containing the synthesized au ag core shell colloid for 30 h au ag core shell nanoparticles assembled on the surface of the nanofibrous paper due to local electrostatic interactions with pll finally the paper was washed with phosphate buffer 0 01 mm ph 7 0 and dried in a stream of nitrogen gas the substrates were characterized by both low magnification and high magnification field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem as shown in fig 2 2 2 analytical performance of the novel sers sensors to demonstrate the quantitative capability of this sers active sensor experimental samples were prepared as follows crystal violet cv solids were dissolved in ethyl alcohol without any further purification to obtain a 1 mm stock solution then cv standards were prepared using serial dilutions of the stock solution with ethyl alcohol similarly standards of methamphetamine were prepared again by serial dilution of a 100 ppm stock solution with deionized water giving a series of methamphetamine standards at 0 01 0 1 1 0 10 0 100 0 1000 0 and 10 000 0 ppb these standards were used to determine key analytical performance metrics including the limit of detection and linear range 2 3 detection of illicit drugs in water samples in order to evaluate the feasibility of detecting methamphetamine in real samples concentrations in surface and wastewater samples were determined using sers and these samples were also measured using conventional instrumentation namely liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms surface water samples were collected from two rivers the pearl river in guangdong province and the wanquan river in the city of beijing and from weiming lake in beijing see the supporting information for detailed sample collection information in addition wastewater was collected as both influent and effluent from sixteen domestic wastewater treatment plants fangzhuang xiaohongmen hexi wulituo lugouqiao beiyuan gaobeidian qinghe wujiacun xioajiahe jiuxianqiao beixiaohe wenquan xiaoyueyuan huaifang and yongfeng located in the urban area of beijing fig 1 sampling was conducted during summer each treatment plant was sampled for 4 consecutive days over a period of 24 h and the samples were combined for measurement detailed in the supporting information sers analysis two hundred millilitres of wastewater was processed on site by first acidifying the sample by adding 10 drops of hcl ph 2 and then filtering using a 0 22 μm membrane to remove solid debris purification and enrichment were performed using a standard 3 ml cationic solid phase extraction cartridge from affinisep paris france pre equilibrated using 1 ml of acetonitrile acn and 2 ml of water as follows sample loading of the 200 ml of filtered wastewater washing for removal of interferences in 3 ml of water and 3 ml of water acn 60 40 v v drying for 30 s prior to elution in 2 ml of methanol meoh containing 2 formic acid and finally analysis by sers lc ms analysis first 200 ml of each sample was filtered using 0 22 µm membrane filters to remove solid particles and then stored for reference laboratory analysis an oasis mcx cartridge from waters milford usa was pre conditioned in sequence with 6 ml of meoh 4 ml of deionized water and 4 ml of deionized water at ph 2 0 the sample was then loaded onto the cartridge at a flow rate of 2 3 ml min after drying under vacuum the sample was sequentially eluted off the cartridge with 4 ml of meoh and 4 ml of 5 nh3 in meoh the eluate was evaporated to dryness under a gentle nitrogen stream and re constituted in 200 μl

theory dft calculations were used to confirm vibrational band assignments for methamphetamine c10h15n all the quantum chemical calculations were performed using dft with the bp86 functional and 6 311g d basis set employing the gaussian 09 and gaussview 3 09 program package kohn et al 1996 p hohenberg 1964 the calculations were performed without any symmetry restrictions 3 results and discussion 3 1 novel substrate for sers sensors au ag core shell nanoparticles were synthesized to combine the strong sers effect of ag with the well known stability of au li et al 2017 it has also been proposed that plasmonic au ag core shell nanomaterials have a better sers effect than single component au or ag due to their resonant behaviour li et al 2017 the synthesized au ag was characterized by ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrometry figure s1 as well as field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem and high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem fig 2 figure s1 shows the uv vis spectra of aunps and au ag compared with the absorption peak of aunps the peak of the au ag solution was blue shifted as shown in fig 2b and c the average diameter of au ag was approximately 40 nm exhibiting a uniform size we also obtained a more detailed au ag particle size distribution image through hr tem see figure s2 which demonstrated that the majority of the diameter sizes of au ag ranged from 37 to 43 nm 16 21 the gnfp 8 mm 8 mm provided an enhanced surface area leading to improvements in both sensitivity and dynamic range as a function of the increased number of noble metal core shell nanoparticles that could be modified on its surface the surface topography of the gnfp was determined by fe sem fig 2e and f showing that a highly porous three dimensional matrix was formed when compared to two dimensional planar substrates li et al 2017 nanofibrous paper substrates with a hierarchical structure of nanoparticles adsorbed onto the fibril matrix exhibited an increased surface area and enhanced the absorption capacity for easy access of analytes by absorbing the au ag pll solution the sers gnfp could be easily fabricated see scheme 1 here we used pll to attach au ag to the paper matrix by exploiting its positively charged amine functional groups and its low raman scattering cross section pll was readily absorbed onto the paper at room temperature without any other treatment providing an excellent mediator for the physisorption and ionic stabilization of the negatively charged au ag on the glassy paper in a single step according to a previous report fang et al 2015 the assembly times of glass in pll and nanoparticle solutions were optimized at 10 min and 30 h respectively using characterization of low magnification fig 2g and high magnification fig 2h fe sem images the experimental results show that the au ag core shell nanoparticles have been effectively loaded on gnfp with pll to investigate the reproducibility of the sers platform 8 different sers substrates were used to measure 100 nm cv standards fig 3 a shows that the 8 different spectra were consistent with a strong peak at 1620 cm 1 showing a relative standard deviation rsd of 5 given that an ideal sensor substrate should be stable for long term storage we compared the sers signals from a freshly prepared au ag assembled on the gnfp substrate with the same substrate following storage under atmospheric conditions for one or two months as shown in fig 3 2 μl of 100 nm cv was analysed on the freshly prepared au ag pll gnfp sers substrate no 3 and from a substrate prepared one month no 2 and two months no 1 earlier raman spectra were obtained using a portable raman spectroscopy system i raman portable raman spectrometer b w tek usa using a high quantum efficiency charge coupled device ccd array detector a 785 nm laser was used for excitation the collection parameters of each sers spectrum included an exposure time of 5000 ms and integrating 3 times over each spectrum the results demonstrated no significant decrease in the signal intensity with a raman peak at 1620 cm 1 showing an rsd of 5 9 3 2 detection of illicit drugs in solutions we used au ag pll assembled on glass nanoporous paper substrates for sers detection of methamphetamine as shown in fig 4 compared with the theoretical raman spectra fig 4 inset and the powder spectra figure s3 the sers spectra of methamphetamine show a close correspondence the sers bands were also compared with the theoretical predictions and vibrations as shown in table s1 which were consistent with assignments made in previous investigations kline et al 2016 the molecular structures of the analytes are presented in fig 4 as an aid for visualizing the vibrational mode assignments as shown in the raman spectra in table s1 methamphetamine can be differentiated using five bands at 619 cm 1 835 cm 1 1001 cm 1 1016 cm 1 and 1602 cm 1 although in our work we found the strongest signal band at 1016 cm 1 to be analytically most useful to illustrate the analytical capability of the sers active substrate for illicit drug detection we carried out the detection of methamphetamine in a combined qualitative and quantitative way first 2 µl of the methamphetamine solution at a series of standard concentrations 0 01 0 1 1 0 10 0 100 0 1000 0 and 10 000 0 ppb in anhydrous ethanol were analysed on the sers enabled paper substrate as the solvent evaporated the analytes were spread evenly on the sers active layer on the sensor scheme 1 raman spectra were obtained using a portable raman spectroscopy system i raman portable raman spectrometer b w tek usa using a high quantum efficiency ccd array detector a 785 nm laser was used for excitation the collection parameters of each sers spectrum included an exposure time of 5000 ms and integrating 3 times over each spectrum raman spectra of different concentrations of methamphetamine were obtained using the characteristic band at 1016 cm 1 fig 5 a indicates that the intensity of this signal increased for methamphetamine concentrations between 0 01 and 10 000 0 ppb with the baseline subtracted from all the raman spectra fig 5b shows the relationship between changes in the raman intensity of methamphetamine with increasing methamphetamine concentrations giving an excellent linear correlation r2 0 99 with the logarithmic concentration of methamphetamine ranging from 10 1 ppb to 104 ppb as presented in the inset of fig 5b the limit of detection was estimated to be 7 2 ppt 3 standard deviations above the mean of the baseline 3 3 evaluation of the drug concentration with sers sensors by analysis of surface water in order to investigate the efficacy of the sensor for the detection of real samples we present preliminarily results that verified the feasibility of analysing surface water including lake water and river water samples the surface water samples were first filtered with 0 22 µm membrane filters then 100 ppb methamphetamine was spiked into the different types of aqueous samples including buffer lake sample and river samples as shown in fig 6 a using lc ms measurements as our gold standard reference technique the results from the buffer sample corresponded well with the measured concentrations in the lake and river samples including the pearl river and wanquan river as shown in table s2 3 4 evaluation of community drug consumption with sers sensors at wastewater treatment plants we also analysed methamphetamine concentrations in the wastewater collected from 16 influent and effluent pipes in wastewater treatment plants in beijing again normalized by the daily flow rate of sewage at each plant fig 6b fig 6b and fig 6d demonstrated the concentrations of methamphetamine in sewage in beijing and estimated average loads of methamphetamine where wastewater samples were collected from influent detailed data in the tables s3 and s4 as shown in table s3 methamphetamine was present in all of the influents with concentrations ranging from 3 10 ppt to 180 0 ppt the high concentration level of methamphetamine in influents suggests a wide use of methamphetamine in beijing table s3 shows that higher methamphetamine daily drug loadings per daily flow rate are present at the five sites xiaohongmen gaobeidian qinghe jiuxianqiao and huaifang that are located in more central districts of beijing as shown in fig 1 closest to the business and entertainment centres with the highest population densities wenquan and yongfeng are the farthest from the centre of the city and showed the lowest daily drug load of methamphetamine in our sampling periods the drug load was also low at xiaojiahe and hexi which although not far from the urban centre receive sewage from the suburbs finally we also found that the removal efficiencies of methamphetamine were efficient in the wastewater treatment plants by comparing the influent with effluent samples as shown in fig 6b and table s3 again using data that were normalized by the flow rate as shown in fig 6c the removal efficiencies for methamphetamine were typically 89 with the exception of the fangzhuang 63 5 and hexi 60 3 plants similarly high methamphetamine removal efficiencies have been observed in the literature elsewhere loganathan et al 2009 postigo et al 2010 4 conclusion in summary we present the development of methods for the fabrication of sers substrates comprising glass nanoporous paper synthesized by electrospinning functionalized with au ag core shell nanoparticles the substrates serve as simple sers sensors with negligible background interference providing high sensitivity good reproducibility and excellent stability the sensors were used for the detection of methamphetamine in water treatment plants in beijing district and the results were in close agreement with those obtained by a gold standard mass spectrometry method as a reference this application of sers sensors demonstrates an innovative technology for the evaluation of community wide methamphetamine consumption the results also showed the effective removal of the drug measured as the difference between influx and efflux at the sampled wastewater treatment plants the sers sensors provided a clear demonstration of a new wbe tool that could have generic application to a range of public health issues including those for the rapid monitoring of community drug use local environmental pollution and markers for infectious diseases in addition chiral sensors should be further explored in the future
