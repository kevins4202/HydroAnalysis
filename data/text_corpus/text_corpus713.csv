3565,identifying the effect of climate variability and human activities on runoff changes is scientifically essential for understanding hydrological processes and sustainable water resources management this study selected 64 catchments located in the mainland of china to quantify the effects of different driving forces on runoff changes results showed that annual runoff in the haihe river basin liaohe river basin and yellow river basin exhibited significantly decreasing trends from 1965 to 2018 p 0 05 whereas the northwest river basin had positive trends in the annual runoff meanwhile the pettitt test method was applied to detect abrupt changes in annual runoff compared to the rivers in southern china the northern rivers had significant abrupt changes in annual runoff and mostly occurred in the 1990 s the choudhury yang equation based on the budyko hypothesis was used to assess the sensitivity of runoff to precipitation p potential evapotranspiration et0 and the land surface n changes the results showed that runoff was more sensitive to p and n compared to et0 attribution analysis revealed that p was the dominant factor in the northwest river basin southwest river basin yangtze river basin southeast river basin and pearl river basin whereas the changes in n were responsible for runoff changes in the liaohe river basin haihe river basin yellow river basin songhuajiang river basin and huaihe river basin the land surface changes n were resulted from vegetation restoration urbanization expansion construction of reservoirs check dams and surface water withdrawals leading to significant changes in river runoff in recent years the findings can provide good insight for water resources management across china keywords runoff changes chinese river basins human activities budyko hypothesis attribution analysis 1 introduction streamflow is one of the critical components of the hydrological cycle and has experienced substantial evolutions in response to external changes piao et al 2010 vorosmarty et al 2000 observations showed that significant changes occurred in water discharge in 24 of the world s rivers li et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to understand streamflow generation changes and underlying causes under the changing environment for better water resources management burn 1994 dethier et al 2020 liu et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 in general external influences include climate forcing and human activities which can trigger remarkable changes on fluvial hydrological processes li et al 2018 luce and holden 2009 climate changes such as rainfall fluctuation radiometric enhancement and continued warming together with intensive human activities such as reservoir constructions water consumption and vegetation restoration not only affect the atmospheric water vapor content but also alter underlying surface characteristics of catchments alsharhan and rizk 2020 ipcc 2013 li and quiring 2021 thus assessing the contribution of climate variability and human activities is fundamental to improve water resources management and achieve water security yin et al 2020 in recent years various approaches were applied to differentiate the effect of driving factors on streamflow changes dey and mishra 2017 taking baimasi basin as the case study wang et al 2010 applied the variable infiltration capacity vic model to reveal the enhanced effect of human activities on runoff changes shi et al 2019 applied the swat model to assess effect of soil and water conservation measures on hydrological processes and found that check dams accounted for 12 of runoff reduction in the wuding river basin gao et al 2011 found that human activities were the dominant driving factors for runoff reduction in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin based on double mass curve xu et al 2014 reported that the haihe basin was affected by land use cover changes significantly by using the budyko hypothesis as above mentioned the methods for separating the individual impact of driving factors can be categorized as process based hydrological model simulation empirical statistical approaches and conceptual approaches in general the process based hydrological model is superior in characterizing spatial heterogeneity and time varying development with the information of soil topography and vegetation but it is subject to deterministic structure availability of large data sets time consuming calibration and validation processes which is difficult to simulate in data scare area devia et al 2015 the statistical methods employ parametric or nonparametric regression models to evaluate the relationship between hydrological factors and climatic variables which is easy to use and requires less data input however this method may not capture non stationary nature in hydrological systems ahn and merwade 2014 the conceptual model falls exactly into the middle of the above methods by having specific physical meanings and requiring appropriate input data taking the budyko hypothesis as an example the regional water balance is constrained by only water supply and energy availability neglecting the interactions between atmosphere and land budyko 1974 fu 1981 yang et al 2008 it has been widely used to investigate the hydrological response to climate forcing and human activities huang et al 2016 xu et al 2014 yang et al 2014 the study by chang et al 2016 in the jing river basin compared the budyko model with topmodel and the vic hydrological model and attained similar results where the contribution of climate changes and human activities were 20 and 80 respectively a comprehensive framework has been constructed to evaluate effectiveness among ten methods by zhang et al 2020b the findings in guanting river confirmed that the budyko based method was applicable to analyze runoff changes although there were slight differences in attribution values varying between 5 and 12 there is emerging evidences in variations of global runoff which have raised substantial attention from researchers in europe the river flow exhibited amplification of the south dry north wet contrast exhibiting a strong and significant decrease in the mediterranean and along with a weak increase in northern europe gudmundsson et al 2017 the decline in annual runoff mainly resulting from increasing dryness was detectable in the pacific northwest united states luce and holden 2009 bart 2016 found that wildfire had caused runoff decline in central and southern california furthermore wang et al 2020 complied 1321 catchments and found that global runoff exhibited a 11 9 mm a reduction on average therefore patterns of runoff across space and time appeared to be diverse due to the complex interaction between atmospheric forcing and multiple terrestrial processes gudmundsson et al 2021 runoff exhibited diverse changes in various basins due to the combined effects of climate change and human activities for example the current 100 year flood would occur twice as often across 40 of the world and over 60 of southeast asia central africa central europe and canada as a result of global warming arnell and gosling 2016 feng et al 2016 reported that large scale revegetation program resulted in significant decreases in the ratio of river runoff to annual precipitation on the loess plateau of china china has a wide territory with heterogeneous topography vegetation coverage climatic types and urbanization intensities effects of climatic forcing and human interferences shift from one fluvial system to another zhang et al 2015 during the past decades unambiguously continued warming has enhanced atmospheric water vapor content based on clausius clapeyron equation suggesting the alterations of surface water resources distributions ouyang et al 2014 besides there are 98 822 reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 895 3 billion m3 and cropland irrigation area reached 33 32 million hectares around china cmwr 2018b concurrent external forcing altered flow regimes of the river and numerous researches investigated the influences of human activities on runoff variation wu et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 most studies focused on flow regimes of river basins at the local scale and different methods the differences in the time intervals of hydrometeorological data series used may draw improper conclusions of hydrological processes wang et al 2021b wu et al 2017 xu et al 2014 several studies have conducted the contribution analysis across china yang et al 2014 and huang et al 2016 found that the influence of climatic factors on runoff exhibited large regional variations liu et al 2017 addressed human activities such as population density gross domestic product and reservoirs were mainly responsible for runoff changes in this study a comprehensive analysis was employed to assess the spatial pattern of runoff changes with updated database and to reveal their responses to climate changes and human activities such as irrigation area changes dam constructions and vegetation growth thus the objectives of this study are 1 to identify spatiotemporal variations of annual runoff from 1961 to 2018 at 64 hydrological stations across china 2 to quantify the contribution of different influencing factors to runoff changes by using the choudhury yang equation based on budyko hypothesis and double mass curve method 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area china is situated in eastern asia on the western shore of the pacific ocean and is affected by the southeast pacific and southwest indian monsoon along with extensive territory and complex terrain precipitation varied greatly from different regions overall rainfall decreases from southeast of 2700 mm to northwest of 20 mm on average shown in fig 1 adequately considering spatial heterogeneity and river networks the mainland of china was classified into ten river basins i e songhuajiang river basin shrb liaohe river basin lrb haihe river basin hairb huaihe river basin huairb yangtze river basin yzrb yellow river basin yrb pearl river basin prb southeast river basin serb southwest river basin swrb and northwest river basin nwrb the detailed information of the river basins is displayed in table 1 the three largest rivers namely yellow yrb yangtze yzrb and pearl rivers prb from north to south discharge more than 1 2 1012 m3 a of freshwater into the western pacific ocean accounting for more than 85 of the total water for all chinese rivers into the oceans liu et al 2014 the yellow and yangtze rivers originate from the qinghai tibet plateau with mainstream lengths of 5464 km and 6300 km respectively and cover areas of 75 2 104 km2 and 180 104 km2 the pearl river originates from the yunnan plateau with a length of 2197 km in mainstream and a catchment area of 45 3 104 km2 according to the geographical characteristics and climate patterns the ten river basins can be divided into two groups the northern dry basin shrb lrb hairb huairb yrb and nwrb and the southern wet basins yzrb prb serb and swrb the total volume of the six northern river basins having a total catchment area of 2 27 million km2 accounts for 20 of the national total runoff whereas four southern river basins with a total catchment of 2 86 million km2 accounting for more than 80 of the national total runoff zhang et al 2011 the asian summer monsoon an important component of the global circulation systems results in obvious spatial and seasonal patterns of precipitation in china cheng et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 the asian summer monsoon generally carries abundant moisture from the ocean and forms high rainfall it begins in april may and retreats in september october and brings more than 70 rainfall in the wet season ding et al 2020 li and zhang 2009 consequently annual precipitation in the east china is much higher than that in the northwest inland besides different regions are characterized by various climatic conditions the northern rivers shrb lrb huairb hairb and yrb are dominated by the temperate monsoon climate with annual precipitation between 500 and 700 mm the lrb huairb and yrb basins also cover a region with continental monsoon climate with mean annual precipitation of approximately 450 mm a the southern rivers yzrb serb prb flow across a region of subtropical monsoon climate with an average precipitation of 1450 mm a liu et al 2014 therefore we divided the 64 catchments into three categories arid zone rainfall 200 mm semi arid zone rainfall 200 p 800 mm and humid zone p 800 mm huang 1990 fig 1 2 2 datasets the annual runoff runoff depth with unit of mm data series of 64 hydrological stations from 1965 to 2018 were collected from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources in china and the chinese river sediment bulletin http www mwr gov cn all the 64 stations had 54 years of continuous observed annual data from 1965 to 2018 except three stations in the yarlung tsangpo river which were available from 1965 to 2011 daily meteorological data during the same period at 840 stations in mainland china were collected through the china national meteorological

and abrupt change detection the nonparametric mann kendall mk test is applied to detect temporal trends in annual hydro meteorological time series kendall 1975 mann 1945 the details of the method would not be introduced here due to its wide application in hydrological researches aziz and burn 2006 de oliveira et al 2021 wang et al 2021a zhao et al 2014 the non parametric pettitt breakpoint test pettitt 1979 is used to detect abrupt changes in hydrological and meteorological time series lan et al 2020 ma et al 2008 villarini et al 2009 for a given series x x1 x2 xn it can be divided into two series x1 x2 xt and xt 1 xt 2 xn according to the breakpoint the test statistic ut n is given by 2 u t n i 1 t j 1 n sgn x t x j i f t 2 n where the sgn is a sign function with values of 1 0 or 1 the breakpoint is defined as where ut n reaches the maximum kn 3 k n max u t n the significance level associated with kn is determined approximately by 4 ρ exp 6 k n 2 n 3 n 2 when the significance level ρ 0 05 the null hypothesis no significant differences between the two sub series is rejected the approximate significance probability for a change point is calculated as α 1 ρ the series is split into two sub series at the location where the breakpoint exits 2 3 2 double mass curve dmc double mass curve has been widely used in the consistency analysis of hydrometeorological data gao et al 2011 zhao et al 2014 the theory of this method is based on the fact that plotting cumulative quantities during the same period exhibits a straight line as long as no significant changes occur mu et al 2010 it can provide a practical and visual insight of hydrological variations 2 3 3 the elasticity of runoff derived from the choudhury yang equation in a river basin the water balance equation can be expressed as 5 p r e δ s where p is precipitation mm e is actual evapotranspiration mm r is runoff mm δs is the change of water storage however on multi years scale the change of water storage can be neglected assumed to be zero the actual evapotranspiration ratio was the function of available water and available energy budyko 1948 budyko 1974 at different spatial scale the available energy not only includes water equivalent of net radiation but also is affected by horizontal advection exposed by climatic factors such as humidity and air temperature thus the availability of water and energy can be measured by precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration et0 respectively the relationship can be expressed as 6 e p f e t 0 p from eq 6 the e solely depends on climatic conditions researchers attempted to integrate the effects of catchment characteristics into the budyko hypothesis and obtained satisfying results fu 1981 mezentsev 1955 turc 1954 recently yang and yang 2011 derived the fluvial hydro thermal balance equation as 7 e p e t 0 p n e t 0 n 1 n where e denotes mean annual actual evapotranspiration mm p denotes mean annual precipitation mm et0 is mean annual potential evapotranspiration mm n is the underlying surface parameter substituting eq 7 into eq 5 we can get 8 r p p e t 0 p n e t 0 n 1 n from eq 8 r is a function of p et0 n assuming the p et0 n be independent the total differential of r can be written as 9 dr f p d p f e t 0 d e t 0 f n d n the coefficient of elasticity is defined as the ratio of the dependent variable y change to the change in the independent variable x schaake 1990 expressed as ε dy y dx x similarly the precipitation elasticity to runoff is defined as ε p dr r dp p the evapotranspiration elasticity is ε e t 0 dr r de t 0 e t 0 and the catchment landscape elasticity is ε n dr r dn n re arranging the terms in eq 9 by elasticities we can get the following form 10 dr r ε p dp p ε e t 0 de t 0 e t 0 ε n dn n the elasticities of runoff are given as follows ning et al 2016 11 ε p 1 ϕ n 1 n 1 ϕ n 1 1 ϕ n 1 ϕ n 1 n ϕ 12 ε e t 0 1 1 ϕ n 1 1 ϕ n 1 n 13 ε n ln 1 ϕ n ϕ n ln 1 ϕ n ω 1 ϕ n 1 1 ϕ n 1 n 2 3 4 attributing runoff changes to external factors according to the abrupt change test the annual runoff time series can be divided into two periods i e baseline period where limited human activities influenced the river runoff and the changing period where extensive human activities resulted in great alternation in river runoff ning et al 2020 zhao et al 2014 then the runoff changes between the changing period r2 and baseline period r1 are 14 δ r r 2 r 1 from eq 9 the runoff changes can be attributed to changes in p et0 and n which is estimated as 15 δ r δ r p δ r e t 0 δ r n the variation of runoff induced from different factors denoted as i can be derived from elasticities as follows 16 δ r i ε i r i δ i thus the relative contribution to runoff changes for each factor is calculated as 17 η i δ r i δ r 100 where η i denotes the contribution of p et0 and n to runoff variations 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variations of precipitation and runoff fig 2 demonstrated the mk trends of annual precipitation p and annual runoff r from 1961 to 2018 when the statistic value is smaller than 1 96 or greater than 1 96 it implies significantly decreasing or increasing trends at the 95 confidence level thus the mk trends of p and r have been divided into four patterns pattern a pattern b pattern c and pattern d in total 34 rivers 53 of studied rivers belonged to pattern b with no significant trend in both p and r pattern a was characterized as stable p and decreasing r covered 26 rivers 40 of studied rivers and pattern c covered only one river 2 of studied rivers with stable r and increasing p pattern d with increasing r and p included 3 rivers 5 of studied rivers fig 3 exhibited the distribution of patterns and changing rates of r indicating spatial heterogeneity of p and r of the ten river basins a majority of pattern a was observed in yrb huairb and hairb suggesting that there were external factors except precipitation affecting runoff variations for example zhang et al 2020a concluded that ecological restoration was the dominant cause of runoff reduction between toudaoguai and longmen of yrb however runoff in tangnaihai station of yrb and liujianfang station of lrb exhibited insignificant reduction with average changing rates of 0 58 and 0 46 mm a respectively the chenglingji station of yzrb and qianjiang station of prb were characterized as pattern a with significantly decreasing rates of 3 92 and 2 74 mm a in runoff depth simultaneously the headwater of yzrb zhimenda hydrological station was categorized as pattern d indicating both apparent increases in p and r other hydrological stations in yzrb prb serb swrb and shrb held relatively stable in p and r with no significant variations two glaciered tributaries of tarim river source regions exhibited positive trends in r corresponding to glacier shrinkage under rising temperature and enhanced precipitation wang et al 2021b though the annual precipitation increased in recent decades the inland river hei river had relatively stable runoff overall central and northeast parts of china was characterized by pattern a and northwest parts were covered by pattern d 3 2 abrupt changes in annual runoff identification of the abrupt changing points was the basic requirement to separate the whole runoff time series into baseline period and changing period for attribution analysis fig 4 depicted the abrupt change points of annual runoff in different river basins considered in this study based on the pettitt test the catchments with id between 3 and 32 had significant breaking points suggesting significant changes of runoff in lrb hairb yrb and nwrb table 1 the abrupt changing year mainly was 1985 2000 when it was the time to carry out reform and open policy in china and pursue the construction of hydraulic engineering facilities vigorously to satisfy agricultural and industrial development liu et al 2017 suggested that approximately 475 large reservoirs in ten major basins were built in this period and justified the time points of abrupt changes in this study 3 3 the elasticity analysis of runoff the elasticity coefficient denotes the response of runoff depth changes to the 1 increase of each variable xu et al 2014 have illustrated the relationships among aridity index φ denoted as et0 p catchment underlying parameter n and the elasticity of runoff similarly shown in fig 5 the absolute value of the elasticity coefficient exhibits positive trends with the increase of φ and n suggesting that runoff appears more sensitive to the external changing environment in the drying regions in this study the elasticity coefficients ranged from 4 52 to 4 24 in the semi arid and arid regions were from 1 55 to 2 55 in the humid region the dry regions had a wider range of the elasticity coefficient of n than humid region implying that evidently spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface conditions affected runoff regimes fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of runoff elasticity coefficients at all the stations the elasticity coefficients were higher in northern china than in the south the elasticity coefficient of runoff changes to precipitation ε p in shrb lrb hairb yrb and huairb ranged from 1 88 to 4 23 with an average value of 3 05 indicating that a 10 increase in precipitation would contribute to an increase of 30 5 in runoff nevertheless the lowest value ε p varying from 1 02 to 2 10 with a mean value of 1 56 occurred in yzrb swrb serb and prb indicating that an increase of 10 in precipitation would lead to 15 6 increase of runoff the potential evapotranspiration et0 and the underlying surface parameter n had negative effects on runoff with mean elasticity coefficients of 1 60 and 2 51 respectively in northern china implying that 10 increase in et0 or n would cause 16 or 25 1 decrease of runoff 3 4 attribution analysis of annual runoff changes fig 7 displayed the comparison between the simulated runoff changes via budyko equation and observed runoff changes the results showed that simulated runoff matched observed runoff statistically well with the correlation coefficient of 0 993 and the mean absolute error mae was 4 23 mm hence the budyko equation was capable to assess the response of runoff changes to different driving factors the different influences of driving factors were shown in fig 8 the underlying surface parameter n outweighed the other two factors as the primary forcing in shrb lrb hairb yrb and huairb id 1 3 29 49 51 with an average contribution rate of 88 besides n had an evident effect on dongting lake of yzrb id 42 44 accounting for 57 98 which was correlated to the operation of the three gorges reservoir he et al 2021 in contrast precipitation was the dominant factor in nwrb swrb yzrb serb and prb and potential evapotranspiration exerted a relatively moderate effect in all river basins the double mass curve dmc was used to assess the influences of human activities by plotting the cumulative runoff and cumulative precipitation the curves would turn down or upward as long as there were abrupt changes in the runoff time series fig 9 depicts the contribution rates of human activities after transition points derived from dmc human activities played key roles in shrb lrb hairb and yrb id 2 29 with mean annual precipitation fluctuating around 500 mm which was in good agreement with that from budyko hypothesis however for the watersheds with annual average precipitation extremely higher or lower than 500 mm great differences existed between the dmc and budyko method figs 8 and 9 this can be attributed to the simple regression of dmc which only considers the influence of precipitation and ignores the interaction of soil vegetation atmosphere the coefficients of the regression equation denote the ratio of runoff to precipitation indicating the proportion of precipitation converting to runoff the combination of runoff coefficient c and elasticity of p can be written as follows 18 ε p dq q dp p dq dp p q dq dp 1 c as eq 18 shown ε p increased with the decrease of c runoff coefficient as shown in fig 9 the catchment with id 1 30 in northern china had relatively smaller coefficient values of 0 5 however the absolute value of elasticity of p reached the highest fig 6 indicating p was the sensitive factor of runoff generation in water limited regions in these regions runoff resulted mainly from infiltration excess runoff yang et al 2012 it was estimated that the p threshold for surface runoff generation 5 mm day on bare land and the threshold for vegetated area increased reaching up to greater than 30 mm within 30 min yao et al 2011 experiments from runoff plots demonstrated that rainfall with a high intensity of 1 28 mm min and a duration of 30 min could completely infiltrate in the forested area cai 2001 this was resulted from large storage capacity in thick loess soil layer for high soil water infiltration therefore runoff was more sensitive to p due to the limited effective precipitation in semi arid regions in contrast southern china had higher runoff coefficients fig 9 whereas the absolute values of elasticity of p remained at a lower level fig 6 this illustrated that precipitation had moderate effect on runoff in humid watersheds compared to the semi arid regions in humid regions saturation excess runoff was the dominant mechanism of runoff generation which required less rainfall to saturate soil layer and surface runoff yielded rapidly accordingly relationships between runoff coefficient and ε p provided deep insight to understand the mechanism of runoff generation and explained the hydrological response to the elasticity of p 4 discussions 4 1 the dominant driving forces for runoff changes in major chinese basins the underlying surface parameter in the budyko hypothesis represents the characteristics of soil topography and vegetation choudhury 1999 milly 1994 yang et al 2007 which are affected by human activities hence it can conclude that human activities play enhancing roles in alternations of flow regimes of shrb lrb yrb hairb and huairb based on analysis derived from the budyko hypothesis and dmc we selected 20 typical catchments that were predominantly affected by intense human activities to assess the influence of vegetation coverages terrace buildings urbanization construction of hydraulic facilities and irrigation consumption on runoff changes as shown in fig 10 ndvi had a positive trend from 1985 to 2010 with the mean increasing value of 0 13 during the past decades large scale vegetation restoration projects have been implemented to increase vegetation greenness such as the grain for green program three north shelterbelt program etc liu et al 2016 xiao and moody 2004 changes in vegetation cover influence the hydrological cycle mainly through modulating the process of canopy interception evaporation transpiration and infiltration brown et al 2005 thus increased vegetation induced the decrease of annual runoff coefficient and increased rainfall threshold of yielding surface runoff hu et al 2021 maetens et al 2012 besides terraces derived from zhang et al 2020c had shown that percentages of terraces in hairb yrb and huairb were more than 10 fig 10 the wei river basin id 26 of yrb and yi river basin id 51 of huairb had the highest proportion of 34 9 and 28 2 respectively the construction of terraces could reshape land surface topography and enhance surface roughness and increase infiltration chen et al 2017 previous studies showed that terraces in northern china reduced runoff by 20 45 cai 2004 he et al 2008 as shown in fig 11 the expansion of urbanization is another important factor leading to changes in annual runoff from the 20 catchments build up lands exhibited positive trends from 1980 to 2015 urbanization increased impervious surfaces modified the natural vegetation cover and further influence the hydrological cycle liu et al 2021a miller et al 2014 sun et al 2011 meanwhile rapid urbanization induced huge water consumption during the past decades it is estimated that water withdrawals in china have increased from 549 8 billion m3 in 2000 to 601 5 billion m3 in 2018 cmwr 2018a fig 12 clearly demonstrated that irrigated agricultural areas are obviously increasing in most provinces of china particularly in heilongjiang jilin henan anhui provinces and inner mongolia autonomous region in the shrb lrb nwrb the middle reach of yrb and huairb and the irrigation areas increased by 5474 8 ha 1014 5 ha 1566 1 ha 2140 8 ha and 2533 9 ha respectively irrigation resulted in an evident decrease of river runoff with decreased annual variability of runoff processes in the huang huai hai plain zhang et al 2015 additionally the construction of hydraulic facilities altered natural flows by influencing hydrological regimes and the ecology of rivers yin and yang 2011 it was estimated that water storage volume of reservoirs increased from 197 billion m3 in 2002 to 410 4 billion m3 in 2018 in china cmwr 2018a zhang et al 2015 addressed that the total reservoir capacity in the hubei hunan jiangxi guangdong and guangxi provinces reached respectively 9 92 1010m3 4 02 1010m3 2 94 1010m3 4 29 1010m3 3 78 1010m3 check dam was widely applied to trap sediment load from the loess plateau to the yellow river in the past decades more than 56 thousand check dams in the yrb resulted in a significant decrease in annual runoff liu et al 2021b yang et al 2020 as shown in fig 13 the large size medium size and small size check dams were 5546 8596 and 40 982 by 2016 however 82 of small size check dams were built before 1989 liu et al 2021b guyassa et al 2017 stated dams could increase infiltration by 18 of runoff the construction of hydraulic facilities could intercept natural rivers and store upstream water to meet the social economic and environmental demands the hydrograph becomes smooth stable and less flood peak occurs with adjustment of dams and reservoirs liu et al 2014 4 2 uncertainty analysis we compared our results with previous studies and the comparison indicated that the major driving factors to runoff changes were similar table 2 for example the fractional contribution of human activities in hairb and yrb obtained in our study were 57 100 48 139 respectively and were 73 1 from xu et al 2014 and 57 1 from chu et al 2019 yang et al 2014 reported that climate forcing had the largest positive contribution to runoff changes in the northwest consistent with results from this study liu et al 2017 concluded that climate changes played key roles in alternation of runoff regimes in southern and northwest china whereas the contribution of human activities was different from our study the differences mainly were due to the comparison of different time intervals and different structure of methods additionally huang et al 2016 assessed the response of runoff changes to different climatic factors indicating that precipitation was the dominant factor in most parts of china and net radiation had strong effects in southern china however this study indicated that potential evapotranspiration had moderate effect on runoff changes as a result of offsetting effects in climatic factors as for the cold or alpine watersheds it is necessary to consider the effects of snowmelt or glacier shrinkage due to climate warming wang et al 2021b addressed that glacier shrinking affected by rising temperature accounted for runoff changes of tarim river of nwrb by 66 94 furthermore the budyko based hydrothermal coupled balanced equation had limited performance to further quantify the contributions of various human activities such as urbanization water consumption reservoirs construction etc on runoff changes although results existed certain uncertainty the budyko based method effectively avoided negative impacts of complicated parameterization and model structure and hence was an effective tool to assess the responses of runoff changes to climate changes and human activities 5 conclusions this study applied the mann kendall trend test and pettitt test to investigate the spatial temporal changes of annual runoff at 64 stations across the mainland china the budyko based method was employed to quantify the effects of climate variability and human activities on runoff changes in the selected river basins the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 annual runoff in hairb lrb and yrb exhibited significant decreasing trends during 1965 2018 ranging from 1 37 mm a to 0 29 mm a whereas nwrb had significant positive trends p 0 05 in the southern china annual runoff in yzrb huairb and prb presented insignificantly decreasing trends northern rivers experienced significant abrupt changes in 1990 s whereas southern rivers exhibited insignificant abrupt changes 2 the elasticity analysis demonstrated that runoff was more sensitive to p and n rather than et0 particularly for the northern rivers relatively higher absolute elasticities indicated that the same changes in driving variables resulted in higher runoff changes 3 changes in annual runoff in nwrb swrb yzrb serb and prb were largely attributed to the changes in p whereas land surface changes played a critical role in shrb lrb hairb yrb huairb accounting for more than 80 of

3565,identifying the effect of climate variability and human activities on runoff changes is scientifically essential for understanding hydrological processes and sustainable water resources management this study selected 64 catchments located in the mainland of china to quantify the effects of different driving forces on runoff changes results showed that annual runoff in the haihe river basin liaohe river basin and yellow river basin exhibited significantly decreasing trends from 1965 to 2018 p 0 05 whereas the northwest river basin had positive trends in the annual runoff meanwhile the pettitt test method was applied to detect abrupt changes in annual runoff compared to the rivers in southern china the northern rivers had significant abrupt changes in annual runoff and mostly occurred in the 1990 s the choudhury yang equation based on the budyko hypothesis was used to assess the sensitivity of runoff to precipitation p potential evapotranspiration et0 and the land surface n changes the results showed that runoff was more sensitive to p and n compared to et0 attribution analysis revealed that p was the dominant factor in the northwest river basin southwest river basin yangtze river basin southeast river basin and pearl river basin whereas the changes in n were responsible for runoff changes in the liaohe river basin haihe river basin yellow river basin songhuajiang river basin and huaihe river basin the land surface changes n were resulted from vegetation restoration urbanization expansion construction of reservoirs check dams and surface water withdrawals leading to significant changes in river runoff in recent years the findings can provide good insight for water resources management across china keywords runoff changes chinese river basins human activities budyko hypothesis attribution analysis 1 introduction streamflow is one of the critical components of the hydrological cycle and has experienced substantial evolutions in response to external changes piao et al 2010 vorosmarty et al 2000 observations showed that significant changes occurred in water discharge in 24 of the world s rivers li et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to understand streamflow generation changes and underlying causes under the changing environment for better water resources management burn 1994 dethier et al 2020 liu et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 in general external influences include climate forcing and human activities which can trigger remarkable changes on fluvial hydrological processes li et al 2018 luce and holden 2009 climate changes such as rainfall fluctuation radiometric enhancement and continued warming together with intensive human activities such as reservoir constructions water consumption and vegetation restoration not only affect the atmospheric water vapor content but also alter underlying surface characteristics of catchments alsharhan and rizk 2020 ipcc 2013 li and quiring 2021 thus assessing the contribution of climate variability and human activities is fundamental to improve water resources management and achieve water security yin et al 2020 in recent years various approaches were applied to differentiate the effect of driving factors on streamflow changes dey and mishra 2017 taking baimasi basin as the case study wang et al 2010 applied the variable infiltration capacity vic model to reveal the enhanced effect of human activities on runoff changes shi et al 2019 applied the swat model to assess effect of soil and water conservation measures on hydrological processes and found that check dams accounted for 12 of runoff reduction in the wuding river basin gao et al 2011 found that human activities were the dominant driving factors for runoff reduction in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin based on double mass curve xu et al 2014 reported that the haihe basin was affected by land use cover changes significantly by using the budyko hypothesis as above mentioned the methods for separating the individual impact of driving factors can be categorized as process based hydrological model simulation empirical statistical approaches and conceptual approaches in general the process based hydrological model is superior in characterizing spatial heterogeneity and time varying development with the information of soil topography and vegetation but it is subject to deterministic structure availability of large data sets time consuming calibration and validation processes which is difficult to simulate in data scare area devia et al 2015 the statistical methods employ parametric or nonparametric regression models to evaluate the relationship between hydrological factors and climatic variables which is easy to use and requires less data input however this method may not capture non stationary nature in hydrological systems ahn and merwade 2014 the conceptual model falls exactly into the middle of the above methods by having specific physical meanings and requiring appropriate input data taking the budyko hypothesis as an example the regional water balance is constrained by only water supply and energy availability neglecting the interactions between atmosphere and land budyko 1974 fu 1981 yang et al 2008 it has been widely used to investigate the hydrological response to climate forcing and human activities huang et al 2016 xu et al 2014 yang et al 2014 the study by chang et al 2016 in the jing river basin compared the budyko model with topmodel and the vic hydrological model and attained similar results where the contribution of climate changes and human activities were 20 and 80 respectively a comprehensive framework has been constructed to evaluate effectiveness among ten methods by zhang et al 2020b the findings in guanting river confirmed that the budyko based method was applicable to analyze runoff changes although there were slight differences in attribution values varying between 5 and 12 there is emerging evidences in variations of global runoff which have raised substantial attention from researchers in europe the river flow exhibited amplification of the south dry north wet contrast exhibiting a strong and significant decrease in the mediterranean and along with a weak increase in northern europe gudmundsson et al 2017 the decline in annual runoff mainly resulting from increasing dryness was detectable in the pacific northwest united states luce and holden 2009 bart 2016 found that wildfire had caused runoff decline in central and southern california furthermore wang et al 2020 complied 1321 catchments and found that global runoff exhibited a 11 9 mm a reduction on average therefore patterns of runoff across space and time appeared to be diverse due to the complex interaction between atmospheric forcing and multiple terrestrial processes gudmundsson et al 2021 runoff exhibited diverse changes in various basins due to the combined effects of climate change and human activities for example the current 100 year flood would occur twice as often across 40 of the world and over 60 of southeast asia central africa central europe and canada as a result of global warming arnell and gosling 2016 feng et al 2016 reported that large scale revegetation program resulted in significant decreases in the ratio of river runoff to annual precipitation on the loess plateau of china china has a wide territory with heterogeneous topography vegetation coverage climatic types and urbanization intensities effects of climatic forcing and human interferences shift from one fluvial system to another zhang et al 2015 during the past decades unambiguously continued warming has enhanced atmospheric water vapor content based on clausius clapeyron equation suggesting the alterations of surface water resources distributions ouyang et al 2014 besides there are 98 822 reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 895 3 billion m3 and cropland irrigation area reached 33 32 million hectares around china cmwr 2018b concurrent external forcing altered flow regimes of the river and numerous researches investigated the influences of human activities on runoff variation wu et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 most studies focused on flow regimes of river basins at the local scale and different methods the differences in the time intervals of hydrometeorological data series used may draw improper conclusions of hydrological processes wang et al 2021b wu et al 2017 xu et al 2014 several studies have conducted the contribution analysis across china yang et al 2014 and huang et al 2016 found that the influence of climatic factors on runoff exhibited large regional variations liu et al 2017 addressed human activities such as population density gross domestic product and reservoirs were mainly responsible for runoff changes in this study a comprehensive analysis was employed to assess the spatial pattern of runoff changes with updated database and to reveal their responses to climate changes and human activities such as irrigation area changes dam constructions and vegetation growth thus the objectives of this study are 1 to identify spatiotemporal variations of annual runoff from 1961 to 2018 at 64 hydrological stations across china 2 to quantify the contribution of different influencing factors to runoff changes by using the choudhury yang equation based on budyko hypothesis and double mass curve method 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area china is situated in eastern asia on the western shore of the pacific ocean and is affected by the southeast pacific and southwest indian monsoon along with extensive territory and complex terrain precipitation varied greatly from different regions overall rainfall decreases from southeast of 2700 mm to northwest of 20 mm on average shown in fig 1 adequately considering spatial heterogeneity and river networks the mainland of china was classified into ten river basins i e songhuajiang river basin shrb liaohe river basin lrb haihe river basin hairb huaihe river basin huairb yangtze river basin yzrb yellow river basin yrb pearl river basin prb southeast river basin serb southwest river basin swrb and northwest river basin nwrb the detailed information of the river basins is displayed in table 1 the three largest rivers namely yellow yrb yangtze yzrb and pearl rivers prb from north to south discharge more than 1 2 1012 m3 a of freshwater into the western pacific ocean accounting for more than 85 of the total water for all chinese rivers into the oceans liu et al 2014 the yellow and yangtze rivers originate from the qinghai tibet plateau with mainstream lengths of 5464 km and 6300 km respectively and cover areas of 75 2 104 km2 and 180 104 km2 the pearl river originates from the yunnan plateau with a length of 2197 km in mainstream and a catchment area of 45 3 104 km2 according to the geographical characteristics and climate patterns the ten river basins can be divided into two groups the northern dry basin shrb lrb hairb huairb yrb and nwrb and the southern wet basins yzrb prb serb and swrb the total volume of the six northern river basins having a total catchment area of 2 27 million km2 accounts for 20 of the national total runoff whereas four southern river basins with a total catchment of 2 86 million km2 accounting for more than 80 of the national total runoff zhang et al 2011 the asian summer monsoon an important component of the global circulation systems results in obvious spatial and seasonal patterns of precipitation in china cheng et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 the asian summer monsoon generally carries abundant moisture from the ocean and forms high rainfall it begins in april may and retreats in september october and brings more than 70 rainfall in the wet season ding et al 2020 li and zhang 2009 consequently annual precipitation in the east china is much higher than that in the northwest inland besides different regions are characterized by various climatic conditions the northern rivers shrb lrb huairb hairb and yrb are dominated by the temperate monsoon climate with annual precipitation between 500 and 700 mm the lrb huairb and yrb basins also cover a region with continental monsoon climate with mean annual precipitation of approximately 450 mm a the southern rivers yzrb serb prb flow across a region of subtropical monsoon climate with an average precipitation of 1450 mm a liu et al 2014 therefore we divided the 64 catchments into three categories arid zone rainfall 200 mm semi arid zone rainfall 200 p 800 mm and humid zone p 800 mm huang 1990

resources in china and the chinese river sediment bulletin http www mwr gov cn all the 64 stations had 54 years of continuous observed annual data from 1965 to 2018 except three stations in the

and abrupt change detection the nonparametric mann kendall mk test is applied to detect temporal trends in annual hydro meteorological time series kendall 1975 mann 1945 the details of the method would not be introduced here due to its wide application in hydrological researches aziz and burn 2006 de oliveira et al 2021 wang et al 2021a zhao et al 2014 the non parametric pettitt breakpoint test pettitt 1979 is used to detect abrupt changes in hydrological and meteorological time series lan et al 2020 ma et al 2008 villarini et al 2009 for a given series x x1 x2 xn it can be divided into two series x1 x2 xt and xt 1 xt 2 xn according to the breakpoint the test statistic ut n is given by 2 u t n i 1 t j 1 n sgn x t x j i f t 2 n where the sgn is a sign function with values of 1 0 or 1 the breakpoint is defined as where ut n reaches the maximum kn 3 k n max u t n the significance level associated with kn is determined approximately by 4 ρ exp 6 k n 2 n 3 n 2 when the significance level ρ 0 05 the null hypothesis no significant differences between the two sub series is rejected the approximate significance probability for a change point is calculated as α 1 ρ the series is split into two sub series at the location where the breakpoint exits 2 3 2 double mass curve dmc double mass curve has been widely used in the consistency analysis of hydrometeorological data gao et al 2011 zhao et al 2014 the theory of this method is based on the fact that plotting cumulative quantities during the same period exhibits a straight line as long as no significant changes occur mu et al 2010 it can provide a practical and visual insight of hydrological variations 2 3 3 the elasticity of runoff derived from the choudhury yang equation in a river basin the water balance equation can be expressed as 5 p r e δ s where p is precipitation mm e is actual evapotranspiration mm r is runoff mm δs is the change of water storage however on multi years scale the change of water storage can be neglected assumed to be zero the actual evapotranspiration ratio was the function of available water and available energy budyko 1948 budyko 1974 at different spatial scale the available energy not only includes water equivalent of net radiation but also is affected by horizontal advection exposed by climatic factors such as humidity and air temperature thus the availability of water and energy can be measured by precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration et0 respectively the relationship can be expressed as 6 e p f e t 0 p from eq 6 the e solely depends on climatic conditions researchers attempted to integrate the effects of catchment characteristics into the budyko hypothesis and obtained satisfying results fu 1981 mezentsev 1955 turc 1954 recently yang and yang 2011 derived the fluvial hydro thermal balance equation as 7 e p e t 0 p n e t 0 n 1 n where e denotes mean annual actual evapotranspiration mm p denotes mean annual precipitation mm et0 is mean annual potential evapotranspiration mm n is the underlying surface parameter substituting eq 7 into eq 5 we can get 8 r p p e t 0 p n e t 0 n 1 n from eq 8 r is a function of p et0 n assuming the p et0 n be independent the total differential of r can be written as 9 dr f p d p f e t 0 d e t 0 f n d n the coefficient of elasticity is defined as the ratio of the dependent variable y change to the change in the independent variable x schaake 1990 expressed as ε dy y dx x similarly the precipitation elasticity to runoff is defined as ε p dr r dp p the evapotranspiration elasticity is ε e t 0 dr r de t 0 e t 0 and the catchment landscape elasticity is ε n dr r dn n re arranging the terms in eq 9 by elasticities we can get the following form 10 dr r ε p dp p ε e t 0 de t 0 e t 0 ε n dn n the elasticities of runoff are given as follows ning et al 2016 11 ε p 1 ϕ n 1 n 1 ϕ n 1 1 ϕ n 1 ϕ n 1 n ϕ 12 ε e t 0 1 1 ϕ n 1 1 ϕ n 1 n 13 ε n ln 1 ϕ n ϕ n ln 1 ϕ n ω 1 ϕ n 1 1 ϕ n 1 n 2 3 4 attributing runoff changes to external factors according to the abrupt change test the annual runoff time series can be divided into two periods i e baseline period where limited human activities influenced the river runoff and the changing period where extensive human activities resulted in great alternation in river runoff ning et al 2020 zhao et al 2014 then the runoff changes between the changing period r2 and baseline period r1 are 14 δ r r 2 r 1 from eq 9 the runoff changes can be attributed to changes in p et0 and n which is estimated as 15 δ r δ r p δ r e t 0 δ r n the variation of runoff induced from different factors denoted as i can be derived from elasticities as follows 16 δ r i ε i r i δ i thus the relative contribution to runoff changes for each factor is calculated as 17 η i δ r i δ r 100 where η i denotes the contribution of p et0 and n to runoff variations 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variations of precipitation and runoff fig 2 demonstrated the mk trends of annual precipitation p and annual runoff r from 1961 to 2018 when the statistic value is smaller than 1 96 or greater than 1 96 it implies significantly decreasing or increasing trends at the 95 confidence level thus the mk trends of p and r have been divided into four patterns pattern a pattern b pattern c and pattern d in total 34 rivers 53 of studied rivers belonged to pattern b with no significant trend in both p and r pattern a was characterized as stable p and decreasing r covered 26 rivers 40 of studied rivers and pattern c covered only one river 2 of studied rivers with stable r and increasing p pattern d with increasing r and p included 3 rivers 5 of studied rivers fig 3 exhibited the distribution of patterns and changing rates of r indicating spatial heterogeneity of p and r of the ten river basins a majority of pattern a was observed in yrb huairb and hairb suggesting that there were external factors except precipitation affecting runoff variations for example zhang et al 2020a concluded that ecological restoration was the dominant cause of runoff reduction between toudaoguai and longmen of yrb however runoff in tangnaihai station of yrb and liujianfang station of lrb exhibited insignificant reduction with average changing rates of 0 58 and 0 46 mm a respectively the chenglingji station of yzrb and qianjiang station of prb were characterized as pattern a with significantly decreasing rates of 3 92 and 2 74 mm a in runoff depth simultaneously the headwater of yzrb zhimenda hydrological station was categorized as pattern d indicating both apparent increases in p and r other hydrological stations in yzrb prb serb swrb and shrb held relatively stable in p and r with no significant variations two glaciered tributaries of tarim river source regions exhibited positive trends in r corresponding to glacier shrinkage under rising temperature and enhanced precipitation wang et al 2021b though the annual precipitation increased in recent decades the inland river hei river had relatively stable runoff overall central and northeast parts of china was characterized by pattern a and northwest parts were covered by pattern d 3 2 abrupt changes in annual runoff identification of the abrupt changing points was the basic requirement to separate the whole runoff time series into baseline period and changing period for attribution analysis fig 4 depicted the abrupt change points of annual runoff in different river basins considered in this study based on the pettitt test the catchments with id between 3 and 32 had significant breaking points suggesting significant changes of runoff in lrb hairb yrb and nwrb table 1 the abrupt changing year mainly was 1985 2000 when it was the time to carry out reform and open policy in china and pursue the construction of hydraulic engineering facilities vigorously to satisfy agricultural and industrial development liu et al 2017 suggested that approximately 475 large reservoirs in ten major basins were built in this period and justified the time points of abrupt changes in this study 3 3 the elasticity analysis of runoff the elasticity coefficient denotes the response of runoff depth changes to the 1 increase of each variable xu et al 2014 have illustrated the relationships among aridity index φ denoted as et0 p catchment underlying parameter n and the elasticity of runoff similarly shown in fig 5 the absolute value of the elasticity coefficient exhibits positive trends with the increase of φ and n suggesting that runoff appears more sensitive to the external changing environment in the drying regions in this study the elasticity coefficients ranged from 4 52 to 4 24 in the semi arid and arid regions were from 1 55 to 2 55 in the humid region the dry regions had a wider range of the elasticity coefficient of n than humid region implying that evidently spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface conditions affected runoff regimes fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of runoff elasticity coefficients at all the stations the elasticity coefficients were higher in northern china than in the south the elasticity coefficient of runoff changes to precipitation ε p in shrb lrb hairb yrb and huairb ranged from 1 88 to 4 23 with an average value of 3 05 indicating that a 10 increase in precipitation would contribute to an increase of 30 5 in runoff nevertheless the lowest value ε p varying from 1 02 to 2 10 with a mean value of 1 56 occurred in yzrb swrb serb and prb indicating that an increase of 10 in precipitation would lead to 15 6 increase of runoff the potential evapotranspiration et0 and the underlying surface parameter n had negative effects on runoff with mean elasticity coefficients of 1 60 and 2 51 respectively in northern china implying that 10 increase in et0 or n would cause 16 or 25 1 decrease of runoff 3 4 attribution analysis of annual runoff changes fig 7 displayed the comparison between the simulated runoff changes via budyko equation and observed runoff changes the results showed that simulated runoff matched observed runoff statistically well with the correlation coefficient of 0 993 and the mean absolute error mae was 4 23 mm hence the budyko equation was capable to assess the response of runoff changes to different driving factors the different influences of driving factors were shown in fig 8 the underlying surface parameter n outweighed the other two factors as the primary forcing in shrb lrb hairb yrb and huairb id 1 3 29 49 51 with an average contribution rate of 88 besides n had an evident effect on dongting lake of yzrb id 42 44 accounting for 57 98 which was correlated to the operation of the three gorges reservoir he et al 2021 in contrast precipitation was the dominant factor in nwrb swrb yzrb serb and prb and potential evapotranspiration exerted a relatively moderate effect in all river basins the double mass curve dmc was used to assess the influences of human activities by plotting the cumulative runoff and cumulative precipitation the curves would turn down or upward as long as there were abrupt changes in the runoff time series fig 9 depicts the contribution rates of human activities after transition points derived from dmc human activities played key roles in shrb lrb hairb and yrb id 2 29 with mean annual precipitation fluctuating around 500 mm which was in good agreement with that from budyko hypothesis however for the watersheds with annual average precipitation extremely higher or lower than 500 mm great differences existed between the dmc and budyko method figs 8 and 9 this can be attributed to the simple regression of dmc which only considers the influence of precipitation and ignores the interaction of soil vegetation atmosphere the coefficients of the regression equation denote the ratio of runoff to precipitation indicating the proportion of precipitation converting to runoff the combination of runoff coefficient c and elasticity of p can be written as follows 18 ε p dq q dp p dq dp p q dq dp 1 c as eq 18 shown ε p increased with the decrease of c runoff coefficient as shown in fig 9 the catchment with id 1 30 in northern china had relatively smaller coefficient values of 0 5 however the absolute value of elasticity of p reached the highest fig 6 indicating p was the sensitive factor of runoff generation in water limited regions in these regions runoff resulted mainly from infiltration excess runoff yang et al 2012 it was estimated that the p threshold for surface runoff generation 5 mm day on bare land and the threshold for vegetated area increased reaching up to greater than 30 mm within 30 min yao et al 2011 experiments from runoff plots demonstrated that rainfall with a high intensity of 1 28 mm min and a duration of 30 min could completely infiltrate in the forested area cai 2001 this was resulted from large storage capacity in thick loess soil layer for high soil water infiltration therefore runoff was more sensitive to p due to the limited effective precipitation in semi arid regions in contrast southern china had higher runoff coefficients fig 9 whereas the absolute values of elasticity of p remained at a lower level fig 6 this illustrated that precipitation had moderate effect on runoff in humid watersheds compared to the semi arid regions in humid regions saturation excess runoff was the dominant mechanism of runoff generation which required less rainfall to saturate soil layer and surface runoff yielded rapidly accordingly relationships between runoff coefficient and ε p provided deep insight to understand the mechanism of runoff generation and explained the hydrological response to the elasticity of p 4 discussions 4 1 the dominant driving forces for runoff changes in major chinese basins the underlying surface parameter in the budyko hypothesis represents the characteristics of soil topography and vegetation choudhury 1999 milly 1994 yang et al 2007 which are affected by human activities hence it can conclude that human activities play enhancing roles in alternations of flow regimes of shrb lrb yrb hairb and huairb based on analysis derived from the budyko hypothesis and dmc we selected 20 typical catchments that were predominantly affected by intense human activities to assess the influence of vegetation coverages terrace buildings urbanization construction of hydraulic facilities and irrigation consumption on runoff changes as shown in fig 10 ndvi had a positive trend from 1985 to 2010 with the mean increasing value of 0 13 during the past decades large scale vegetation restoration projects have been implemented to increase vegetation greenness such as the grain for green program three north shelterbelt program etc liu et al 2016 xiao and moody 2004 changes in vegetation cover influence the hydrological cycle mainly through modulating the process of canopy interception evaporation transpiration and infiltration brown et al 2005 thus increased vegetation induced the decrease of annual runoff coefficient and increased rainfall threshold of yielding surface runoff hu et al 2021 maetens et al 2012 besides terraces derived from zhang et al 2020c had shown that percentages of terraces in hairb yrb and huairb were more than 10 fig 10 the wei river basin id 26 of yrb and yi river basin id 51 of huairb had the highest proportion of 34 9 and 28 2 respectively the construction of terraces could reshape land surface topography and enhance surface roughness and increase infiltration chen et al 2017 previous studies showed that terraces in northern china reduced runoff by 20 45 cai 2004 he et al 2008 as shown in fig 11 the expansion of urbanization is another important factor leading to changes in annual runoff from the 20 catchments build up lands exhibited positive trends from 1980 to 2015 urbanization increased impervious surfaces modified the natural vegetation cover and further influence the hydrological cycle liu et al 2021a miller et al 2014 sun et al 2011 meanwhile rapid urbanization induced huge water consumption during the past decades it is estimated that water withdrawals in china have increased from 549 8 billion m3 in 2000 to 601 5 billion m3 in 2018 cmwr 2018a fig 12 clearly demonstrated that irrigated agricultural areas are obviously increasing in most provinces of china particularly in heilongjiang jilin henan anhui provinces and inner mongolia autonomous region in the shrb lrb nwrb the middle reach of yrb and huairb and the irrigation areas increased by 5474 8 ha 1014 5 ha 1566 1 ha 2140 8 ha and 2533 9 ha respectively irrigation resulted in an evident decrease of river runoff with decreased annual variability of runoff processes in the huang huai hai plain zhang et al 2015 additionally the construction of hydraulic facilities altered natural flows by influencing hydrological regimes and the ecology of rivers yin and yang 2011 it was estimated that water storage volume of reservoirs increased from 197 billion m3 in 2002 to 410 4 billion m3 in 2018 in china cmwr 2018a zhang et al 2015 addressed that the total reservoir capacity in the hubei hunan jiangxi guangdong and guangxi provinces reached respectively 9 92 1010m3 4 02 1010m3 2 94 1010m3 4 29 1010m3 3 78 1010m3 check dam was widely applied to trap sediment load from the loess plateau to the yellow river in the past decades more than 56 thousand check dams in the yrb resulted in a significant decrease in annual runoff liu et al 2021b yang et al 2020 as shown in fig 13 the large size medium size and small size check dams were 5546 8596 and 40 982 by 2016 however 82 of small size check dams were built before 1989 liu et al 2021b guyassa et al 2017 stated dams could increase infiltration by 18 of runoff the construction of hydraulic facilities could intercept natural rivers and store upstream water to meet the social economic and environmental demands the hydrograph becomes smooth stable and less flood peak occurs with adjustment of dams and reservoirs liu et al 2014 4 2 uncertainty analysis we compared our results with previous studies and the comparison indicated that the major driving factors to runoff changes were similar table 2 for example the fractional contribution of human activities in hairb and yrb obtained in our study were 57 100 48 139 respectively and were 73 1 from xu et al 2014 and 57 1 from chu et al 2019 yang et al 2014 reported that climate forcing had the largest positive contribution to runoff changes in the northwest consistent with results from this study liu et al 2017 concluded that climate changes played key roles in alternation of runoff regimes in southern and northwest china whereas the contribution of human activities was different from our study the differences mainly were due to the comparison of different time intervals and different structure of methods additionally huang et al 2016 assessed the response of runoff changes to different climatic factors indicating that precipitation was the dominant factor in most parts of china and net radiation had strong effects in southern china however this study indicated that potential evapotranspiration had moderate effect on runoff changes as a result of offsetting effects in climatic factors as for the cold or alpine watersheds it is necessary to consider the effects of snowmelt or glacier shrinkage due to climate warming wang et al 2021b addressed that glacier shrinking affected by rising temperature accounted for runoff changes of tarim river of nwrb by 66 94 furthermore the budyko based hydrothermal coupled balanced equation had limited performance to further quantify the contributions of various human activities such as urbanization water consumption reservoirs construction etc on runoff changes although results existed certain uncertainty the budyko based method effectively avoided negative impacts of complicated parameterization and model structure and hence was an effective tool to assess the responses of runoff changes to climate changes and human activities 5 conclusions this study applied the mann kendall trend test and pettitt test to investigate the spatial temporal changes of annual runoff at 64 stations across the mainland china the budyko based method was employed to quantify the effects of climate variability and human activities on runoff changes in the selected river basins the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 annual runoff in hairb lrb and yrb exhibited significant decreasing trends during 1965 2018 ranging from 1 37 mm a to 0 29 mm a whereas nwrb had significant positive trends p 0 05 in the southern china annual runoff in yzrb huairb and prb presented insignificantly decreasing trends northern rivers experienced significant abrupt changes in 1990 s whereas southern rivers exhibited insignificant abrupt changes 2 the elasticity analysis demonstrated that runoff was more sensitive to p and n rather than et0 particularly for the northern rivers relatively higher absolute elasticities indicated that the same changes in driving variables resulted in higher runoff changes 3 changes in annual runoff in nwrb swrb yzrb serb and prb were largely attributed to the changes in p whereas land surface changes played a critical role in shrb lrb hairb yrb huairb accounting for more than 80 of runoff changes on average et0 had moderate effects on runoff variations across the whole of china the runoff variations induced by the parameter n were closely related to vegetation increasing

3566,simulation of multiphase flow in porous media is essential to manage the geologic c o 2 sequestration gcs process and physics based simulation approaches usually take prohibitively high computational cost due to the nonlinearity of the coupled physics this paper contributes to the development and evaluation of a deep learning workflow that accurately and efficiently predicts the temporal spatial evolution of pressure and c o 2 plumes during injection and post injection periods of gcs operations based on a fourier neural operator the deep learning workflow takes input variables or features including rock properties well operational controls and time steps and predicts the state variables of pressure and c o 2 saturation to further improve the predictive fidelity separate deep learning models are trained for c o 2 injection and post injection periods due to the difference in primary driving force of fluid flow and transport during these two phases we also explore different combinations of features to predict the state variables we use a realistic example of c o 2 injection and storage in a 3d heterogeneous saline aquifer and apply the deep learning workflow that is trained from physics based simulation data and emulate the physics process through this numerical experiment we demonstrate that using two separate deep learning models to distinguish post injection from injection period generates the most accurate prediction of pressure and a single deep learning model of the whole gcs process including the cumulative injection volume of c o 2 as a deep learning feature leads to the most accurate prediction of c o 2 saturation for the post injection period it is key to use cumulative c o 2 injection volume to inform the deep learning models about the total carbon storage when predicting either pressure or saturation the deep learning workflow not only provides high predictive fidelity across temporal and spatial scales but also offers a speedup of 250 times compared to full physics reservoir simulation and thus will be a significant predictive tool for engineers to manage the long term process of gcs keywords deep learning fourier neural operator physics based simulation geologic sequestration 1 introduction the process of geologic c o 2 sequestration gcs chen et al 2018 chen et al 2020 can be described by the physics of multiphase flow and transport in porous media in physics based reservoir simulations the governing partial differential equations of multiphase flow in porous media are discretized into a large scale algebraic system based on traditional numerical methods and iteratively solved to predict the temporal spatial evolution of state variables e g pressure and saturation in porous media chen et al 2006 physics based reservoir simulations are capable of handling many complex physics processes however as the nonlinearity of the processes grows due to heterogeneities in rock properties sohal et al 2021 complex fluid thermodynamics li et al 2017 michael et al 2018 and coupled physics processes preisig and prévost 2011 the computational expense will be prohibitively high in recent years deep learning dl techniques have had huge success to regress high dimensional data georgiou et al 2020 and approximate various functions csaji 2001 in the area of fluid flow and transport in porous media many research efforts have been put in improving the capability to predict the state variables in porous media with dl for example physics informed neural network pinn models raissi et al 2019 construct the loss function of the neural networks with the regularization of physics governing equations during the training process fuks and tchelepi 2020 harp et al 2021 such that the predictions by pinn are ensured to be consistent with the physics of fluid flow in porous media the efficacy of pinn is demonstrated to predict processes governed by physics with low or medium complexity but its computation may become intensive to solve flow problems with strong heterogeneity and high nonlinearity on the other hand image based approaches have also been investigated to predict fluid flow in porous media and mainly leverage convolutional neural networks cnn to approximate the nonlinear relationship between the input of rock property maps e g permeability and the output of fluid flow maps e g saturation in porous media zhong et al 2019 tang et al 2020 wen et al 2021 with sparse connectivity between the input and output image based approaches tend to be more efficient at handling fluid flow problems with heterogeneous geological properties during gcs the multiphase flow physics controlling the evolution of pressure and saturation plumes is fairly complex in the c o 2 injection and post injection periods and thus the development of a general dl workflow to handle the whole gcs process becomes essential for efficient reservoir management of such processes here we describe a dl workflow to predict the evolution of the state variables as multiple c o 2 injection and water production wells flow simultaneously in a 3d heterogeneous saline aquifer this workflow is an image based approach as it takes full advantage of the spatial topology predictive capability of a fourier neural operator fno li et al 2020 we mainly contribute to two research aspects in this work first we strategically develop and train exclusive dl models for different periods of the gcs process to improve the predictive accuracy of pressure based on the fact that in different periods the primary driving forces of fluid flow may vary for example the primary driving force during the injection period is the viscous force while during the post injection period they are gravity and capillary pressure if considered for fluid re equilibrium ide et al 2007 lee et al 2016 ren 2018 secondly we also evaluate the impact of different combinations of input variables or features on the predictive accuracy of dl models and find it is essential to treat the cumulative c o 2 injection volume as a dl feature in order to accurately predict the dynamic evolution of state variables especially saturation the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly review the physics of multiphase flow in porous media that governs the gcs process in section 3 we illustrate the dl workflow to emulate the gcs process in detail in section 4 the workflow is tested through numerical experiments to predict the migration of pressure and c o 2 plumes in a 3d heterogeneous saline aquifer and the performance is comprehensively assessed in section 5 we conclude the work with a few remarks 2 governing physics in gcs as c o 2 is injected into a saline aquifer during the gcs process the mobile fluid phases consist of a water rich phase and a c o 2 rich phase with water and c o 2 as the primary components in the water rich and c o 2 rich phases respectively the flow and transport of each fluid component is governed by their corresponding mass balance equation 1 t ϕ α s α ρ α x α i k α k r α μ α ρ α x α i p α ρ α g z l α ρ α x α i q α l 0 where the first term is the fluid accumulation the second is the advective flux based on darcy s law and the third is the source or sink term subscript i denotes the primary fluid components including water and c o 2 α denotes the fluid phase including water rich phase w and c o 2 rich phase g t is time ϕ is the rock porosity s α is the phase saturation ρ α is the fluid phase density x α i is the mole fraction of component i in fluid phase α k is the rock permeability k r α is the phase relative permeability μ α is the phase viscosity p α is the phase pressure g is the acceleration due to gravity z is depth and q α denotes the rate for producing or injecting fluid phase α through well perforation l further eq 1 is constrained by several auxiliary relationships including the equilibrium between fluid volume and pore space capillary pressure constraint and fluid thermodynamics equilibrium more details can be found in previous literature chen et al 2006 michael et al 2018 in a physics based reservoir simulator these equations are solved iteratively to calculate the state variables of pressure and saturation 3 methodology of the deep learning dl workflow 3 1 feature selection and assembly features are defined as the input variables of the deep neural network dnn in the dl workflow and the candidate features available consist of rock permeability k rock porosity ϕ c o 2 injection rate q inj c o 2 cumulative injection volume q inj locations of water production wells loc prod and time steps t the state variables predicted by the dnn include pressure p and c o 2 saturation s g hereafter we shorten c o 2 saturation to saturation these variables are consistently assembled as 2d images as we adopt 2d convolutional neural network architecture for the dnn among the static geological properties the rock permeability k is closely related to the spatial pore connectivity and contributes to the advective flux term in eq 1 the permeability of geologic porous media is usually anisotropic which means the vertical permeability k v is much lower than the horizontal permeability k h e g we assume k v k h 0 1 in our example as a result the impact of vertical connectivity by k v on fluid flow is negligible compared to that of horizontal connectivity by k h therefore ignoring the impact of vertical connectivity we slice the 3d permeability volume into 2d horizontal layer wise images the rock porosity ϕ is a measure of void space of the rock and is only related to the fluid accumulation in eq 1 and thus it can be directly sliced into 2d horizontal layer wise images the c o 2 injection wells are considered to be operated following specified rate schedules so two candidate features can honor these wells including c o 2 injection rate q inj and c o 2 cumulative injection volume q inj both of which are functions of time t during the injection period q inj and q inj are representative variables for injection well controls however during post injection period these wells are shut in with no injection q inj 0 and thus q inj is always a constant equal to the ultimate c o 2 injection volume at the end of the injection period which can be used as an important variable to honor the total c o 2 storage volume in the post injection period q inj and q inj are assembled as 2d images with nonzero values in well perforated grid cells and zeros elsewhere the water production wells are essential for the management of reservoir pressures during gcs and in this work we treat the locations of these wells loc prod as a feature for generality loc prod is a 2d binary image with value 1 in the well perforated grid cells and 0 elsewhere additionally a feature image filled with time t is considered for temporal evolution of the state variables and aids in interpolation at intermediate time steps without training data points as no capillary pressure is considered between the two primary phases in this work the driving forces contributing to the advective flux term in eq 1 are the viscous force and gravity during the injection period the primary driving force of fluid flow is the viscous force when the injection and production wells are open however as the injection and production wells are always shut in in the post injection period the pressure and saturation fields start re equilibrium mainly driven by gravity hence given the difference in primary driving forces of fluid flow and transport in different periods we believe it also makes sense to develop separate and exclusive dnn models for the injection and post injection periods as capillary pressure is a function of saturation and also contributes to the flux term which is closely related to the pressure distribution it might be beneficial to treat saturation as a feature to predict pressure when capillary pressure cannot be ignored which can be good extension of this work in the future in table 1 we permutate the two periods of gcs and the candidate features and generate 5 different dnn models to predict the state variables p and s g separately and we will evaluate the performance of each scenario through our numerical experiments all these features and state variables in table 1 are normalized through min max normalization before feeding into dnn models 3 2 deep neural network dnn architecture after the feature array x and state variable vector y in table 1 are assembled they are fed into the dnn model for training and inference processes the dnn model we applied in this work is the fourier neural operator fno li et al 2020 which directly operates on 2d images and has good predictive capability for different physics based processes the feature array x is initially transformed into a high dimensional space v 0 through the first fully connected dense layer fc 1 and then v l is iteratively updated through 2 v l σ w v l 1 κ v l 1 l 1 l where v l is the feature map at layer l and is a function of v l 1 preceding it σ denotes the nonlinear activation function w is a linear operator defined by a 1d convolutional operator κ is a 2d convolution operator defined in the fourier space based on the practice in the work of li et al 2020 to capture the nonlinearity we also have in total 4 layers related to the operation in eq 2 namely fourier layers ultimately v l is transformed back to the state variable p or s g through two fully connected layers fc 2 and fc 3 the architecture of fno is depicted in fig 1 at fc 1 fno takes the 5 feature images in x table 1 then sequentially goes through 4 fourier and 2 fc layers to predict the output image of state variable p or s g in fig 1 the size 34 16 of the feature images is padded to be in a square shape 34 34 in order to be consistent with the fno implementation in fig 1 there is no activation function σ in the input and output layers fc 1 and fc 3 and σ used through fourier 1 to fourier 4 is the leakyrelu 3 l e a k y r e l u x ifx 0 0 01 x otherwise σ used in fc 2 is relu to strictly ensure the positiveness of prediction 4 r e l u x if x 0 0 otherwise the loss function l in our fno approach is defined as 5 l θ y y where θ are the learnable parameters is the root mean square error operator y is the ground truth of the pressure p or saturation s g y is the prediction of y by fno the ultimate goal of training fno is to find θ by minimizing the loss function l we implemented fno and the associated modules with the deep learning library pytorch paszke et al 2019 and adopted the adam optimizer to train fno where the learning rate is 0 001 and the weight decay factor is 0 0001 to for regularization to avoid overfitting the same architecture of fno in fig 1 is used to predict pressure or saturation in the c o 2 injection or post injection periods the dl workflow of deep learning is shown in fig 2 the well related feature images including q inj q inj and loc prod are full of zeros blue pixels except the locations red pixels where the injection or production wells are perforated as the whole workflow is operated on 2d horizontal layer wise images in the reservoir domain we iteratively predict the state variables for each layer 4 numerical experiments 4 1 heterogeneous 3d reservoir model in this section a physics based reservoir model specifically the sacroc model jia and mcpherson 2018 is developed using a commercial reservoir simulator gem by cmg cmg 2020 which simulates the process of c o 2 injection and water production in a 3d heterogeneous saline aquifer we use this model to generate synthetic data to train and test the dl workflow aforementioned the reservoir domain is discretized using corner point grid with 36 16 25 grid cells in the x y z directions respectively the permeability and porosity fields are correlated and assumed to be spatially heterogeneous and uncertain jia et al 2016 50 equiprobable realizations of heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields are generated using the sequential gaussian simulation approach and ultimately 3 typical realizations at p10 p50 and p90 are selected through ranking them with the diffusive time of flight method details about the geostatistical analysis can be found in jia et al 2016 a p50 realization of the heterogeneous fields is depicted in fig 3 and there are 3 vertical wells for c o 2 injection red wells and 2 vertical wells for water production green wells all of which are perforated through all the reservoir layers the well locations are decided following two guidelines 1 evenly distribute the wells 2 minimize the number of wells to drill the water production wells are drilled to mitigate far field pressure buildup and thus improve c o 2 injectivity and avoid potential c o 2 leakage the total simulation life is 80 years including 30 years with continuous c o 2 injection and water production and the following 50 years of post injection period with all wells shut in the simulation output is in monthly resolution with 962 effective time steps in total a total of 90 simulations were performed using different combinations of the correlated permeability porosity fields total c o 2 injection mass number of active injection wells and c o 2 injection mass split for active injection wells as shown in table 2 we choose 72 simulations for training 80 9 for validation 10 and 9 for testing 10 4 2 model training performance we assemble the samples for the dnn models following the scheme in section 3 1 if we select the training and validation samples with the monthly resolution in the reservoir simulation output the total number of these samples is 1 948 050 962 time steps which leads to potential computer memory issue and low training efficiency to resolve this we assemble these training and validation samples with yearly resolution except that during the 1st year injection and 1st year of post injection we assemble the samples with monthly resolution in order to accurately honor the early transient flow therefore the total number of training and validation samples is reduced to be 210 600 104 time steps in 81 training and validation simulations with a relative reduction of 89 as for the testing samples we still assemble them in the original monthly resolution in order to perform rigorous comparison with reservoir simulations as time t is the input variable for the fno models to aid in interpolation at intermediate time steps without training data points but in the range of the minimum and maximum time the total number of testing samples is 216 450 962 time steps in 9 testing simulations for all the 5 dnn scenarios listed in table 1 we select their training validation and testing samples based on their corresponding prediction period s the training and validation samples are split into small batches with 20 samples batch the maximum number of training epochs is 20 and the learning rate is 0 001 we perform the training and prediction of the dnn models on a single gpu nvidia quadro rtx 4000 table 3 illustrates the training cpu time and overall root mean square error rmse of pressure and saturation at the injection and post injection periods rmse calculated based on testing samples only notice that the n a values indicate that the individual scenario doesn t predict the state variable pressure or saturation at the specific period which is comprehensively illustrated in table 1 the training cpu time is different among different scenarios as the total number of training and validation samples of each scenario varies depending on their prediction period s overall the training process is very efficient further the total training time for each scenario can be further improved by parallel processing since the pressure and saturation dnn models are independent which means pressure prediction doesn t treat saturation as its input variable table 1 or vice versa and they can be trained concurrently the pressure dnn model in the scenario 1 has the lowest pressure rmse 5 033 psia in injection period and the pressure dnn models in the scenarios 3 and 5 leads to the two lowest pressure rmse in post injection period the saturation dnn model in the scenario 5 has the lowest overall saturation rmses in the injection period 0 01462 and post injection period 0 03013 the scenario 4 always have the highest rmses of both pressure and saturation which can be explained by considering that the feature of c o 2 injection rate q inj used in this scenario is not a good feature in the post injection period further we calculate the pressure and saturation rmses versus time for different scenarios based on the 9 testing simulations fig 4 shows the dynamic change of pressure rmse with time at the beginning of injection year 1 the pressure field in the reservoir is perturbed due to the instantaneous opening of the wells and almost all scenarios suffer the spikes of relatively high pressure rmses through comparison scenario 1 predicts the lowest overall pressure rmse red solid line in the injection period and it also exhibits the lowest rmse 6 35 psia in the 1st year similarly the pressure field is also perturbed due to the instantaneous shut in of the wells at the beginning of post injection year 30 scenario 4 purple dotted line and scenario 5 cyan dashed line suffers substantial discontinuity of pressure rmse at around year 30 from the standpoint of feature distribution the injection related features q inj or q inj used in these two scenarios are constant during the post injection period due to well shut in while q inj and q inj may vary with time during the injection period well open and thus the difference in feature distribution induces the occurrence of pressure discontinuity besides as q inj becomes 0 during post injection period it is not an effective feature to characterize the c o 2 storage which likely causes the poorest prediction of pressure in the post injection period for scenario 4 from the intrinsic physics aspect the significant pressure discontinuity in these two scenarios 4 and 5 is because the primary driving force of fluid flow related to global pressure distribution is viscous force in the injection period while that in the post injection period becomes gravity whereas scenario 3 green dash dot line exclusively predicting post injection period has the lowest pressure rmse 6 47 psia at the beginning of post injection period and its performance during the whole post injection period is also highly faithful therefore it necessitates to train separate dnn models for the injection period and the post injection period in order to accurately predict pressure dynamics and we ultimately choose to predict pressure p through a combination of scenarios 1 and 3 and the overall rmse is 3 780 psia the dynamic change of saturation rmse with time is presented in fig 5 in the scenarios 3 4 and 5 that predict the post injection period scenario 4 purple dotted line which treats q inj as a feature variable completely fails inferring the saturation in the post injection period because q inj is not an effective feature to inform the dnn model about how much c o 2 was ultimately injected into the reservoir after 30 years nevertheless there is no significant discontinuity at the beginning of the post injection year 30 in scenario 5 cyan dashed line which can be explained by considering that the saturation field responds slower to well shut in than the pressure field scenario 5 brings the lowest saturation rmse in both injection and post injection periods with overall rmse 0 02542 and thus we choose it to predict the saturation s g based on the most effective scenarios to predict pressure by scenarios 1 and 3 and saturation by scenario 5 we compare the training and validation loss function values defined by eq 5 during the training process for a comprehensive sanity check as shown in fig 6 in fig 6 the performance of training and validation datasets are quite consistent without the issue of overfitting and the validation loss functions of different scenarios ultimately converge without further significant improvement we further plot the rmse of pressure and saturation in each reservoir layer aggregated through all the 9 testing simulations with 962 monthly time steps fig 7 the rmse of pressure through the layers is relatively stable with mean level at 3 78 psia whereas the rmse of saturation through the layers is quite low in most of the layers except that it is relatively high 0 06 in layer 16 or layers below it it is challenging to predict saturation in layer 16 because it contains the maximum number 464 of inactive grid cells making the c o 2 plumes extremely small and irregularly distributed fig 8 as a result of the large number of inactive grid cells this layer serves like a flow barrier for the layers below it layer 17 to 20 and is likely to impact the saturation prediction quality in these layers as well interestingly we observe that the saturation rmse monotonically decreases from layers 16 to 25 which effectively demonstrates the capability of the saturation dnn model in scenario 5 as well further we select a representative testing simulation run run 82 and visualize its pressure and saturation fields in the layers 1 top 14 middle and 25 bottom at years 1 56 early injection 15 58 middle injection 31 50 early post injection and 79 53 close to the end of post injection in order to demonstrate the capability of time interpolation for our dnn models fig 9 presents the selected 4 testing time steps blue stars which are actually not available in the original training time steps red dots fig 9 also shows that the training time steps are evenly spaced with yearly resolution except the monthly resolution refined in the 1st year and 30th year when injection and post injection just start respectively figs 10 and 11 illustrate the pressure and saturation comparison between reservoir simulation and dnn predictions in the injection period years 1 56 and 15 58 the dnn prediction of pressure is quite accurate with mean absolute errors mae 2 79 psia and 3 35 psia in these two interpolated time steps compared to cmg reservoir simulation with continuous c o 2 injection and water production in this period the pressure changes globally the water production also creates low pressure regions nearby the water wells as shown in the green pressure regions in the center of layer 25 further the rock heterogeneity also impacts the pressure patterns for example the low pressure zone blue in layer 1 these patterns in pressure fields are accurately honored by our dnn model as c o 2 is injected into the reservoir the c o 2 plumes in each layer grow surrounding the injection wells with time e g layer 1 and the c o 2 plume size decreases with increasing depth because of the buoyancy effect these details are also accurately predicted by our dnn model with the saturation mae 2 07e 3 and 3 52e 3 in the two injection time steps respectively figs 12 and 13 presents the pressure and saturation predictions in the post injection period years 31 50 and 79 53 with all wells shut in in this period the fluids in the reservoir starts re equilibrium driven by gravity we clearly observe the disappearance of the low pressure zone nearby the production wells in the center of layer 25 which shows during the injection period besides the pressure at the layer 25 at 79 53 years in fig 13 significantly builds up dark red after water slowly accumulates at the bottom of the reservoir because it is heavier than c o 2 dnn captures these fine details and the maes of the two snapshots are extremely low 2 05 and 1 65 psia respectively as c o 2 injection ceases the c o 2 mass stored in the reservoir becomes constant and the plume sizes grow only slightly e g layer 1 this is well captured by our dnn model with the mean absolute errors 4 32e 3 and 5 50e 3 in the two post injection time steps respectively in fig 14 a e we also plot the pressure prediction with time at the 5 well grid cells potential pressure monitoring locations at layer 1 and our dnn predictions are well aligned with the cmg simulations with the highest error only 0 12 among them besides there is less pressure dynamics in the injection period as c o 2 injection and water production competes simultaneously in the reservoir however the pressure significantly declines and ultimately levels off in all the 5 well grid cells at layer 1 reservoir top because the heavier water rich phase flows downwards while the lighter c o 2 rich phase buoys upwards because of their density difference our dnn predictions successfully honor these changes as well which is likely due to that it is quite an appropriate strategy to train two exclusive pressure dnn models for injection and post injection periods since the saturations of the c o 2 rich phase in the injection well grid cells are quite stable and always close to 1 we did not plot the saturation changes in these grid cells instead we plot the dynamic changes of the total c o 2 pore volume in the whole reservoir calculated by s g ϕ in fig 14 f the error of s g ϕ of dnn prediction compared to cmg simulation is 1 82 which is still quite accurate besides dnn prediction of s g ϕ clearly shows the linear trend in the injection period because the injection rate of c o 2 is quite stable and greater than 0 and the post injection plateau results from the shut in of all wells in table 4 we compare the prediction cpu time of dnn versus cmg simulation when predicting the 3d pressure and saturation fields over 962 time steps 80 years the cpu time for cmg to predict pressure and saturation is 42 18 min which is expensive due to full physics compositional simulation the n a values in table 4 indicates that there is no cpu time record to separate the calculation of pressure from that of saturation reported in cmg simulation output however the total cpu time for dnn to predict pressure and saturation sequentially is only 0 17 min which is 251 times faster than cmg as dnn actually predicts the pressure and saturation separately it will take only 0 087 min if we predict them concurrently in parallel besides for tasks such as inverse modeling chen et al 2018 chen et al 2020 we do not need to predict the snapshots of state variable at all the monthly time steps of 80 years instead we may just need to predict snapshots only in yearly resolution to match sparse observation data and our dnn models efficiently predict the snapshots of the sparse time steps without any dependency on their previous time steps 5 discussions and conclusions in this work a deep learning dl workflow based on fourier neural operator is developed to learn the complex flow physics in long term process of geologic c o 2 sequestration from reservoir simulation data and is capable of accurately inferring the temporal spatial evolution of pressure and c o 2 plumes to improve the prediction fidelity we comprehensively evaluate different sets of features that are fed into the dl workflow and carefully examine the necessity to train two separate or a single predictive model for the injection period and the following post injection period as the primary driving force of fluid flow and transport in these two periods is different we successfully applied the dl workflow into a realistic example of c o 2 injection and storage in a 3d heterogeneous saline aquifer and demonstrated that two deep neural network dnn models to separately predict the injection and post injection periods provide the most accurate pressure predictions with rmse 3 78 psia and also lead to minimum spikes at the early periods of injection and post injection when transient flow is significant besides in the post injection period it is important to use cumulative c o 2 injection volume q inj to inform the dnn about the total storage amount of c o 2 as for saturation a single dnn model that takes q inj as its feature is sufficient to accurately predict both injection and post injection periods with rmse 0 0254 as the reservoir simulation output of pressure and saturation has a lot of time steps 962 in monthly resolution we successfully reduced the training and validation samples with only 104 time steps through strategically selecting year resolution time steps except month resolution time steps in the 1st year of injection and post injection periods this approach successfully reduces the sample size by 89 and makes the training process quite affordable with total training time of the dnn models 7 11 h besides we did not observe any loss of fidelity in pressure and saturation when we predict these intermediate time steps that are not considered during the training process we also gauge the dynamic pressure prediction at the 5 well grid cells which can be potential monitoring locations and the dl workflow exhibit high accuracy with a maximum error of only 0 12 the total prediction time of the dl workflow is about 0 017 min or 10 2 s which is 251 times faster than the full physics simulation based on cmg simulator 42 min the efficiency and accuracy of the dl workflow across the time and spatial scales makes it a robust prediction tool for long term gcs processes and greatly favors tasks of inverse modeling that require hundreds or thousands of forward simulation credit authorship

temporal spatial evolution of pressure and c o 2 plumes during injection and post injection periods of gcs operations based on a fourier neural operator the deep learning workflow takes input variables or features including rock properties well operational controls and time steps and predicts the state variables of pressure and c o 2 saturation to further improve the predictive fidelity separate deep learning models are trained for c o 2 injection and post injection periods due to the difference in primary driving force of fluid flow and transport during these two phases we also explore different combinations of features to predict the state variables we use a realistic example of c o 2 injection and storage in a 3d heterogeneous saline aquifer and apply the deep learning workflow that is trained from physics based simulation data and emulate the physics process through this numerical experiment we demonstrate that using two separate deep learning models to distinguish post injection from injection period generates the most accurate prediction of pressure and a single deep learning model of the whole gcs process including the cumulative injection volume of c o 2 as a deep learning feature leads to the most accurate prediction of c o 2 saturation for the post injection period it is key to use cumulative c o 2 injection volume to inform the deep learning models about the total carbon storage when predicting either pressure or saturation the deep learning workflow not only provides high predictive fidelity across temporal and spatial scales but also offers a speedup of 250 times compared to full physics reservoir simulation and thus will be a significant predictive tool for engineers to manage the long term process of gcs keywords deep learning fourier

multiphase flow and transport in porous media in physics based reservoir simulations the governing partial differential equations of multiphase flow in porous media are discretized into a large scale algebraic system based on traditional numerical methods and iteratively solved to predict the temporal spatial evolution of state variables e g pressure and saturation in porous media chen et al 2006 physics based reservoir simulations are capable of handling many complex physics processes however as the nonlinearity of the processes grows due to heterogeneities in rock properties sohal et al 2021 complex fluid thermodynamics li et al 2017 michael et al 2018 and coupled physics processes preisig and prévost 2011 the computational expense will be prohibitively high in recent years deep learning dl techniques have had huge success to regress high dimensional data georgiou et al 2020 and approximate various functions csaji 2001 in the area of fluid flow and transport in porous media many research efforts have been put in improving the capability to predict the state variables in porous media with dl for example physics informed neural network pinn models raissi et al 2019 construct the loss function of the neural networks with the regularization of physics governing equations during the training process fuks and tchelepi 2020 harp et al 2021 such that the predictions by pinn are ensured to be consistent with the physics of fluid flow in porous media the efficacy of pinn is demonstrated to predict processes governed by physics with low or medium complexity but its computation may become intensive to solve flow problems with strong heterogeneity and high nonlinearity on the other hand image based approaches have also been investigated to predict fluid flow in porous media and mainly leverage convolutional neural networks cnn to approximate the nonlinear relationship between the input of rock property maps e g permeability and the output of fluid flow maps e g saturation in porous media zhong et al 2019 tang et al 2020 wen et al 2021 with sparse connectivity between the input and output image based approaches tend to be more efficient at handling fluid flow problems with heterogeneous geological properties during gcs the multiphase flow physics controlling the evolution of pressure and saturation plumes is fairly complex in the c o 2 injection and post injection periods and thus the development of a general dl workflow to handle the whole gcs process becomes essential for efficient reservoir management of such processes here we describe a dl workflow to predict the evolution of the state variables as multiple c o 2 injection and water production wells flow simultaneously in a 3d heterogeneous saline aquifer this workflow is an image based approach as it takes full advantage of the spatial topology predictive capability of a fourier neural operator fno li et al 2020 we mainly contribute to two research aspects in this work first we strategically develop and train exclusive dl models for different periods of the gcs process to improve the predictive accuracy of pressure based on the fact that in different periods the primary driving forces of fluid flow may vary for example the primary driving force during the injection period is the viscous force while during the post injection period they are gravity and capillary pressure if considered for fluid re equilibrium ide et al 2007 lee et al 2016 ren 2018 secondly we also evaluate the impact of different combinations of input variables or features on the predictive accuracy of dl models and find it is essential to treat the cumulative c o 2 injection volume as a dl feature in order to accurately predict the dynamic evolution of state variables especially saturation the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly review the physics of multiphase flow in porous media that governs the gcs process in section 3 we illustrate the dl workflow to emulate the gcs process in detail in section 4 the workflow is tested through numerical experiments to predict the migration of pressure and c o 2 plumes in a 3d heterogeneous saline aquifer and the performance is comprehensively assessed in section 5 we conclude the work with a few remarks 2 governing physics in gcs as c o 2 is injected into a saline aquifer during the gcs process the mobile fluid phases consist of a water rich phase and a c o 2 rich phase with water and c o 2 as the primary components in the water rich and c o 2 rich phases respectively the flow and transport of each fluid component is governed by their corresponding mass balance equation 1 t ϕ α s α ρ α x α i k α k r α μ α ρ α x α i p α ρ α g z l α ρ α x α i q α l 0 where the first term is the fluid accumulation the second is the advective flux based on darcy s law and the third is the source or sink term subscript i denotes the primary fluid components including water and c o 2 α denotes the fluid phase including water rich phase w and c o 2 rich phase g t is time ϕ is the rock porosity s α is the phase saturation ρ α is the fluid phase density x α i is the mole fraction of component i in fluid phase α k is the rock permeability k r α is the phase relative permeability μ α is the phase viscosity p α is the phase pressure g is the acceleration due to gravity z is depth and q α denotes the rate for producing or injecting fluid phase α through well perforation l further eq 1 is constrained by several auxiliary relationships including the equilibrium between fluid volume and pore space capillary pressure constraint and fluid thermodynamics equilibrium more details can be found in previous literature chen et al 2006 michael et al 2018 in a physics based reservoir simulator these equations are solved iteratively to calculate the state variables of pressure and saturation 3 methodology of the deep learning dl workflow 3 1 feature selection and assembly features are defined as the input variables of the deep neural network dnn in the dl workflow and the candidate features available consist of rock permeability k rock porosity ϕ c o 2 injection rate q inj c o 2 cumulative injection volume q inj locations of water production wells loc prod and time steps t the state variables predicted by the dnn include pressure p and c o 2 saturation s g hereafter we shorten c o 2 saturation to saturation these variables are consistently assembled as 2d images as we adopt 2d convolutional neural network architecture for the dnn among the static geological properties the rock permeability k is closely related to the spatial pore connectivity and contributes to the advective flux term in eq 1 the permeability of geologic porous media is usually anisotropic which means the vertical permeability k v is much lower than the horizontal permeability k h e g we assume k v k h 0 1 in our example as a result the impact of vertical connectivity by k v on fluid flow is negligible compared to that of horizontal connectivity by k h therefore ignoring the impact of vertical connectivity we slice the 3d permeability volume into 2d horizontal layer wise images the rock porosity ϕ is a measure of void space of the rock and is only related to the fluid accumulation in eq 1 and thus it can be directly sliced into 2d horizontal layer wise images the c o 2 injection wells are considered to be operated following specified rate schedules so two candidate features can honor these wells including c o 2 injection rate q inj and c o 2 cumulative injection volume q inj both of which are functions of time t during the injection period q inj and q inj are representative variables for injection well controls however during post injection period these wells are shut in with no injection q inj 0 and thus q inj is always a constant equal to the ultimate c o 2 injection volume at the end of the injection period which can be used as an important variable to honor the total c o 2 storage volume in the post injection period q inj and q inj are assembled as 2d images with nonzero values in well perforated grid cells and zeros elsewhere the water production wells are essential for the management of reservoir pressures during gcs and in this work we treat the locations of these wells loc prod as a feature for generality loc prod is a 2d binary image with value 1 in the well perforated grid cells and 0 elsewhere additionally a feature image filled with time t is considered for temporal evolution of the state variables and aids in interpolation at intermediate time steps without training data points as no capillary pressure is considered between the two primary phases in this work the driving forces contributing to the advective flux term in eq 1 are the viscous force and gravity during the injection period the primary driving force of fluid flow is the viscous force when the injection and production wells are open however as the injection and production wells are always shut in in the post injection period the pressure and saturation fields start re equilibrium mainly driven by gravity hence given the difference in primary driving forces of fluid flow and transport in different periods we believe it also makes sense to develop separate and exclusive dnn models for the injection and post injection periods as capillary pressure is a function of saturation and also contributes to the flux term which is closely related to the pressure distribution it might be beneficial to treat saturation as a feature to predict pressure when capillary pressure cannot be ignored which can be good extension of this work in the future in table 1 we permutate the two periods of gcs and the candidate features and generate 5 different dnn models to predict the state variables p and s g separately and we will evaluate the performance of each scenario through our numerical experiments all these features and state variables in table 1 are normalized through min max normalization before feeding into dnn models 3 2 deep neural network dnn architecture after the feature array x and state variable vector y in table 1 are assembled they are fed into the dnn model for training and inference processes the dnn model we applied in this work is the fourier neural operator fno li et al 2020 which directly operates on 2d images and has good predictive capability for different physics based processes the feature array x is initially transformed into a high dimensional space v 0 through the first fully connected dense layer fc 1 and then v l is iteratively updated through 2 v l σ w v l 1 κ v l 1 l 1 l where v l is the feature map at layer l and is a function of v l 1 preceding it σ denotes the nonlinear activation function w is a linear operator defined by a 1d convolutional operator κ is a 2d convolution operator defined in the fourier space based on the practice in the work of li et al 2020 to capture the nonlinearity we also have in total 4 layers related to the operation in eq 2 namely fourier layers ultimately v l is transformed back to the state variable p or s g through two fully connected layers fc 2 and fc 3 the architecture of fno is depicted in fig 1 at fc 1 fno takes the 5 feature images in x table 1 then sequentially goes through 4 fourier and 2 fc layers to predict the output image of state variable p or s g in fig 1 the size 34 16 of the feature images is padded to be in a square shape 34 34 in order to be consistent with the fno implementation in fig 1 there is no activation function σ in the input and output layers fc 1 and fc 3 and σ used through fourier 1 to fourier 4 is the leakyrelu 3 l e a k y r e l u x ifx 0 0 01 x otherwise σ used in fc 2 is relu to strictly ensure the positiveness of prediction 4 r e l u x if x 0 0 otherwise the loss function l in our fno approach is defined as 5 l θ y y where θ are the learnable parameters is the root mean square error operator y is the ground truth of the pressure p or saturation s g y is the prediction of y by fno the ultimate goal of training fno is to find θ by minimizing the loss function l we implemented fno and the associated modules with the deep learning library pytorch paszke et al 2019 and adopted the adam optimizer to train fno where the learning rate is 0 001 and the weight decay factor is 0 0001 to for regularization to avoid overfitting the same architecture of fno in fig 1 is used to predict pressure or saturation in the c o 2 injection or post injection periods the dl workflow of deep learning is shown in fig 2 the well related feature images including q inj q inj and loc prod are full of zeros blue pixels except the locations red pixels where the injection or production wells are perforated as the whole workflow is operated on 2d horizontal layer wise images in the reservoir domain we iteratively predict the state variables for each layer 4 numerical experiments 4 1 heterogeneous 3d reservoir model in this section a physics based reservoir model specifically the sacroc model jia and mcpherson 2018 is developed using a commercial reservoir simulator gem by cmg cmg 2020 which simulates the process of c o 2 injection and water production in a 3d heterogeneous saline aquifer we use this model to generate synthetic data to train and test the dl workflow aforementioned the reservoir domain is discretized using corner point grid with 36 16 25 grid cells in the x y z directions respectively the permeability and porosity fields are correlated and assumed to be spatially heterogeneous and uncertain jia et al 2016 50 equiprobable realizations of heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields are generated using the sequential gaussian simulation approach and ultimately 3 typical realizations at p10 p50 and p90 are selected through ranking them with the diffusive time of flight method details about the geostatistical analysis can be found in jia et al 2016 a p50 realization of the heterogeneous fields is depicted in fig 3 and there are 3 vertical wells for c o 2 injection red wells and 2 vertical wells for water production green wells all of which are perforated through all the reservoir layers the well locations are decided following two guidelines 1 evenly distribute the wells 2 minimize the number of wells to drill the water production wells are drilled to mitigate far field pressure buildup and thus improve c o 2 injectivity and avoid potential c o 2 leakage the total simulation life is 80 years including 30 years with continuous c o 2 injection and water production and the following 50 years of post injection period with all wells shut in the simulation output is in monthly resolution with 962 effective time steps in total a total of 90 simulations were performed using different combinations of the correlated permeability porosity fields total c o 2 injection mass number of active injection wells and c o 2 injection mass split for active injection wells as shown in table 2 we choose 72 simulations for training 80 9 for validation 10 and 9 for testing 10 4 2 model training performance we assemble the samples for the dnn models following the scheme in section 3 1 if we select the training and validation samples with the monthly resolution in the reservoir simulation output the total number of these samples is 1 948 050 962 time steps which leads to potential computer memory issue and low training efficiency to resolve this we assemble these training and validation samples with yearly resolution except that during the 1st year injection and 1st year of post injection we assemble the samples with monthly resolution in order to accurately honor the early transient flow therefore the total number of training and validation samples is reduced to be 210 600 104 time steps in 81 training and validation simulations with a relative reduction of 89 as for the testing samples we still assemble them in the original monthly resolution in order to perform rigorous comparison with reservoir simulations as time t is the input variable for the fno models to aid in interpolation at intermediate time steps without training data points but in the range of the minimum and maximum time the total number of testing samples is 216 450 962 time steps in 9 testing simulations for all the 5 dnn scenarios listed in table 1 we select their training validation and testing samples based on their corresponding prediction period s the training and validation samples are split into small batches with 20 samples batch the maximum number of training epochs is 20 and the learning rate is 0 001 we perform the training and prediction of the dnn models on a single gpu nvidia quadro rtx 4000 table 3 illustrates the training cpu time and overall root mean square error rmse of pressure and saturation at the injection and post injection periods rmse calculated based on testing samples only notice that the n a values indicate that the individual scenario doesn t predict the state variable pressure or saturation at the specific period which is comprehensively illustrated in table 1 the training cpu time is different among different scenarios as the total number of training and validation samples of each scenario varies depending on their prediction period s overall the training process is very efficient further the total training time for each scenario can be further improved by parallel processing since the pressure and saturation dnn models are independent which means pressure prediction doesn t treat saturation as its input variable table 1 or vice versa and they can be trained concurrently the pressure dnn model in the scenario 1 has the lowest pressure rmse 5 033 psia in injection period and the pressure dnn models in the scenarios 3 and 5 leads to the two lowest pressure rmse in post injection period the saturation dnn model in the scenario 5 has the lowest overall saturation rmses in the injection period 0 01462 and post injection period 0 03013 the scenario 4 always have the highest rmses of both pressure and saturation which can be explained by considering that the feature of c o 2 injection rate q inj used in this scenario is not a good feature in the post injection period further we calculate the pressure and saturation rmses versus time for different scenarios based on the 9 testing simulations fig 4 shows the dynamic change of pressure rmse with time at the beginning of injection year 1 the pressure field in the reservoir is perturbed due to the instantaneous opening of the wells and almost all scenarios suffer the spikes of relatively high pressure rmses through comparison scenario 1 predicts the lowest overall pressure rmse red solid line in the injection period and it also exhibits the lowest rmse 6 35 psia in the 1st year similarly the pressure field is also perturbed due to the instantaneous shut in of the wells at the beginning of post injection year 30 scenario 4 purple dotted line and scenario 5 cyan dashed line suffers substantial discontinuity of pressure rmse at around year 30 from the standpoint of feature distribution the injection related features q inj or q inj used in these two scenarios are constant during the post injection period due to well shut in while q inj and q inj may vary with time during the injection period well open and thus the difference in feature distribution induces the occurrence of pressure discontinuity besides as q inj becomes 0 during post injection period it is not an effective feature to characterize the c o 2 storage which likely causes the poorest prediction of pressure in the post injection period for scenario 4 from the intrinsic physics aspect the significant pressure discontinuity in these two scenarios 4 and 5 is because the primary driving force of fluid flow related to global pressure distribution is viscous force in the injection period while that in the post injection period becomes gravity whereas scenario 3 green dash dot line exclusively predicting post injection period has the lowest pressure rmse 6 47 psia at the beginning of post injection period and its performance during the whole post injection period is also highly faithful therefore it necessitates to train separate dnn models for the injection period and the post injection period in order to accurately predict pressure dynamics and we ultimately choose to predict pressure p through a combination of scenarios 1 and 3 and the overall rmse is 3 780 psia the dynamic change of saturation rmse with time is presented in fig 5 in the scenarios 3 4 and 5 that predict the post injection period scenario 4 purple dotted line which treats q inj as a feature variable completely fails inferring the saturation in the post injection period because q inj is not an effective feature to inform the dnn model about how much c o 2 was ultimately injected into the reservoir after 30 years nevertheless there is no significant discontinuity at the beginning of the post injection year 30 in scenario 5 cyan dashed line which can be explained by considering that the saturation field responds slower to well shut in than the pressure field scenario 5 brings the lowest saturation rmse in both injection and post injection periods with overall rmse 0 02542 and thus we choose it to predict the saturation s g based on the most effective scenarios to predict pressure by scenarios 1 and 3 and saturation by scenario 5 we compare the training and validation loss function values defined by eq 5 during the training process for a comprehensive sanity check as shown in fig 6 in fig 6 the performance of training and validation datasets are quite consistent without the issue of overfitting and the validation loss functions of different scenarios ultimately converge without further significant improvement we further plot the rmse of pressure and saturation in each reservoir layer aggregated through all the 9 testing simulations with 962 monthly time steps fig 7 the rmse of pressure through the layers is relatively stable with mean level at 3 78 psia whereas the rmse of saturation through the layers is quite low in most of the layers except that it is relatively high 0 06 in layer 16 or layers below it it is challenging to predict saturation in layer 16 because it contains the maximum number 464 of inactive grid cells making the c o 2 plumes extremely small and irregularly distributed fig 8 as a result of the large number of inactive grid cells this layer serves like a flow barrier for the layers below it layer 17 to 20 and is likely to impact the saturation prediction quality in these layers as well interestingly we observe that the saturation rmse monotonically decreases from layers 16 to 25 which effectively demonstrates the capability of the saturation dnn model in scenario 5 as well further we select a representative testing simulation run run 82 and visualize its pressure and saturation fields in the layers 1 top 14 middle and 25 bottom at years 1 56 early injection 15 58 middle injection 31 50 early post injection and 79 53 close to the end of post injection in order to demonstrate the capability of time interpolation for our dnn models fig 9 presents the selected 4 testing time steps blue stars which are actually not available in the original training time steps red dots fig 9 also shows that the training time steps are evenly spaced with yearly resolution except the monthly resolution refined in the 1st year and 30th year when injection and post injection just start respectively figs 10 and 11 illustrate the pressure and saturation comparison between reservoir simulation and dnn predictions in the injection period years 1 56 and 15 58 the dnn prediction of pressure is quite accurate with mean absolute errors mae 2 79 psia and 3 35 psia in these two interpolated time steps compared to cmg reservoir simulation with continuous c o 2 injection and water production in this period the pressure changes globally the water production also creates low pressure regions nearby the water wells as shown in the green pressure regions in the center of layer 25 further the rock heterogeneity also impacts the pressure patterns for example the low pressure zone blue in layer 1 these patterns in pressure fields are accurately honored by our dnn model as c o 2 is injected into the reservoir the c o 2 plumes in each layer grow surrounding the injection wells with time e g layer 1 and the c o 2 plume size decreases with increasing depth because of the buoyancy effect these details are also accurately predicted by our dnn model with the saturation mae 2 07e 3 and 3 52e 3 in the two injection time steps respectively figs 12 and 13 presents the pressure and saturation predictions in the post injection period years 31 50 and 79 53 with all wells shut in in this period the fluids in the reservoir starts re equilibrium driven by gravity we clearly observe the disappearance of the low pressure zone nearby the production wells in the center of layer 25 which shows during the injection period besides the pressure at the layer 25 at 79 53 years in fig 13 significantly builds up dark red after water slowly accumulates at the bottom of the reservoir because it is heavier than c o 2 dnn captures these fine details and the maes of the two snapshots are extremely low 2 05 and 1 65 psia respectively as c o 2 injection ceases the c o 2 mass stored in the reservoir becomes constant and the plume sizes grow only slightly e g layer 1 this is well captured by our dnn model with the mean absolute errors 4 32e 3 and 5 50e 3 in the two post injection time steps respectively in fig 14 a e we also plot the pressure prediction with time at the 5 well grid cells potential pressure monitoring locations at layer 1 and our dnn predictions are well aligned with the cmg simulations with the highest error only 0 12 among them besides there is less pressure dynamics in the injection period as c o 2 injection and water production competes simultaneously in the reservoir however the pressure significantly declines and ultimately levels off in all the 5 well grid cells at layer 1 reservoir top because the heavier water rich phase flows downwards while the lighter c o 2 rich phase buoys upwards because of their density difference our dnn predictions successfully honor these changes as well which is likely due to that it is quite an appropriate strategy to train two exclusive pressure dnn models for injection and post injection periods since the saturations of the c o 2 rich phase in the injection well grid cells are quite stable and always close to 1 we did not plot the saturation changes in these grid cells instead we plot the dynamic changes of the total c o 2 pore volume in the whole reservoir calculated by s g ϕ in fig 14 f the error of s g ϕ of dnn prediction compared to cmg simulation is 1 82 which is still quite accurate besides dnn prediction of s g ϕ clearly shows the linear trend in the injection period because the injection rate of c o 2 is quite stable and greater than 0 and the post injection plateau results from the shut in of all wells in table 4 we compare the prediction cpu time of dnn versus cmg simulation when predicting the 3d pressure and saturation fields over 962 time steps 80 years the cpu time for cmg to predict pressure and saturation is 42 18 min which is expensive due to full physics compositional simulation the n a values in table 4 indicates that there is no cpu time record to separate the calculation of pressure from that of saturation reported in cmg simulation output however the total cpu time for dnn to predict pressure and saturation sequentially is only 0 17 min which is 251 times faster than cmg as dnn actually predicts the pressure and saturation separately it will take only 0 087 min if we predict them concurrently in parallel besides for tasks such as inverse modeling chen et al 2018 chen et al 2020 we do not need to predict the snapshots of state variable at all the monthly time steps of 80 years instead we may just need to predict snapshots only in yearly resolution to match sparse observation data and our dnn models efficiently predict the snapshots of the sparse time steps without any dependency on their previous time steps 5 discussions and conclusions in this work a deep learning dl workflow based on fourier neural operator is developed to learn the complex flow physics in long term process of geologic c o 2 sequestration from reservoir simulation data and is capable of accurately inferring the temporal spatial evolution of pressure and c o 2 plumes to improve the prediction fidelity we comprehensively evaluate different sets of features that are fed into the dl workflow and carefully examine the necessity to train two separate or a single predictive model for the injection period and the following post injection period as the primary driving force of fluid flow and transport in these two periods is different we successfully applied the dl workflow into a realistic example of c o 2 injection and storage in a 3d heterogeneous saline aquifer and demonstrated that two deep neural network dnn models to separately predict the injection and post injection periods provide the most accurate pressure predictions with rmse 3 78 psia and also lead to minimum spikes at the early periods of injection and post injection when transient flow is significant besides in the post injection period it is important to use cumulative c o 2 injection volume q inj to inform the dnn about the total storage amount of c o 2 as for saturation a single dnn model that takes q inj as its feature is sufficient to accurately predict both injection and post injection periods with rmse 0 0254 as the reservoir simulation output of pressure and saturation has a lot of time steps 962 in monthly resolution we successfully reduced the training and validation samples with only 104 time steps through strategically selecting year resolution time steps except month resolution time steps in the 1st year of injection and post injection periods this approach successfully reduces the sample size by 89 and makes the training process quite affordable with total training time of the dnn models 7 11 h besides we did not observe any loss of fidelity in pressure and saturation when we predict these intermediate time steps that are not considered during the training process we also gauge the dynamic pressure prediction at the 5 well grid cells which can be potential monitoring locations and the dl workflow exhibit high accuracy with a maximum error of only 0 12 the total prediction time of the dl workflow is about 0 017 min or 10 2 s which is 251 times faster than the full physics simulation based on cmg simulator 42 min the efficiency and accuracy of the dl workflow across the time and spatial scales makes it a robust prediction tool for long term gcs processes and greatly favors tasks of inverse modeling that require hundreds or thousands of forward simulation credit authorship

3567,thoroughly understanding the security of water energy and food wef and the factors that influence them is essential for sustainable development management in any region this study proposed a new analytical framework for wef security evaluation in both individual sectors and the whole system using the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis and four dimensions of security indicators availability self sufficiency productivity and accessibility the internal relationships among the three sectors and the main factors influencing wef security were analysed by spearman s rank correlation and radar graphs respectively the five countries in central asia ca which are experiencing wef crises and facing great challenges in achieving their sustainable development goals sdgs were chosen as a case study in this paper our results showed that kazakhstan attained the highest wef security level followed by kyrgyzstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan tajikistan exhibited the lowest security level from 2000 to 2014 three types of internal relationships among the three sectors were identified synergies trade offs and unclassified the unclassified relationship type accounted for the largest share of 54 in ca suggesting great potential for synergetic improvement among the three sectors approaches for improving the country wef security based on our research are as follows kazakhstan should prioritize food allocation and supply kyrgyzstan and tajikistan should increase energy and food production and raise the supply level and usage efficiency of water and food turkmenistan should increase the available water resources and food production and improve the supply level and usage efficiency of water and energy and uzbekistan should both increase the available

food wef are essential for human survival and sustainable socioeconomic development rasul and sharma 2016 the water energy and food security nexus as a whole was first introduced at the world economic forum in 2008 and has received increasing attention from researchers stakeholders and policy makers since the bonn conference in 2011 putra et al 2020 zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2019b water energy and food are traditionally managed by different sectors and they make up the three resource sectors of wef albrecht et al 2018 liu et al 2017a putra et al 2020 simpson and jewitt 2019 in 2011 the world economic forum called for more attention to the nexus among the three sectors wef 2011 zhang et al 2019b since then the concept of the wef security nexus has been interpreted by researchers and international organizations from different perspectives and concerns fao 2014 zhang et al 2018a in general the wef security nexus can be interpreted from two aspects first the nexus is taken as a method to analyse the relationships between the three resources second the nexus is indicated by the interactions among the three resources zhang et al 2018a previous investigations identified four aspects of wef security availability self sufficiency productivity and accessibility of the three resources flammini et al 2014 lee et al 2012 nhamo et al 2020 taniguchi et al 2017 zarei 2020 and explored the interactions among the three sectors however the concept of the wef security nexus is still unclear and more efforts are needed to illustrate it reinhard et al 2017 ensuring wef security

al 2018 based on the analysis of transboundary water resource management resource accessibility and availability the wef nexus was explored in iran iraq and turkey zarei 2020 wef nexus sustainability indicators were selected including water availability and productivity energy accessibility and productivity and food self sufficiency and cereal productivity and the wef nexus sustainability was then evaluated in south africa nhamo et al 2020 for wef nexus interactions the relationships of synergies and trade offs were determined by spearman s rank correlation in five south asian countries putra et al 2020 from the perspective of embedded resources the network approach was applied to analyse the wef nexus in america for which extensive data were needed mahjabin et al 2020 however there is still no sufficient integrative analysis of wef security and the relationships among the three sectors globally and studies related to factors that reduce wef security and methods to improve wef security are lacking albrecht et al 2018 putra et al 2020 these limitations hinder the management and improvement of the wef security nexus and associated sdgs at the country scale in data limited regions to fill the research gaps this study develops an assessment indicator system for wef security and a hybrid framework that integrates the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis spearman s rank correlation and radar graphs to systematically analyse wef security at the country scale designed assessment indicator data are easily acquired from open sources such as the world bank the food and agriculture organization fao online statistical database faostat the u s energy information administration eia and the official sdg database the wef security degree can be calculated by topsis the relationships among water energy and food can be determined by spearman s rank correlation and the potential inhibiting factors can be visualized by radar graphs the five central asian countries are taken as an example to validate the proposed framework we assess the degree of wef security in the five central asian countries during 2000 2014 analyse the spatiotemporal variations in wef security reveal the relationships among the three sectors and identify the factors that positively or negatively determined wef security the results of this study are expected to provide illustrative insights into sustainable wef development in central asia ca 2 methodology 2 1 integrative analytical framework of the wef security the proposed evaluation framework of wef security fig 1 comprises three main phases phase 1 constructing the evaluation indicator system for wef security as indicated in table 1 the essence of resource security includes four pillars availability self sufficiency productivity and accessibility flammini et al 2014 lee et al 2012 nhamo et al 2020 taniguchi et al 2017 zarei 2020 these four aspects demonstrate the security situation for the complete process of resource use from resource abundance availability conflicts between supply and demand self sufficiency and utilization levels productivity to human welfare accessibility availability describes the resources accessible to humans and mainly indicates resource abundance self sufficiency determines whether resource production can meet demand and mostly represents the supply and demand management level productivity illustrates the economic benefits of the resources used and largely reflects the utilization level accessibility indicates whether users can access resources and mainly reflects the human right to consume resources in addition to increase the applicability and reproducibility of the introduced method data availability is also a key issue in the identification of wef security indicators we identify 12 indicators to study wef security for sustainable development at the country scale in data limited regions table 1 based on the aforementioned sdgs and four essential aspects together with previous studies nhamo et al 2020 taniguchi et al 2017 xu et al 2020b zuo et al 2020 although the selected indicators do not totally represent the essence of wef security they illustrate the real wef security level to a large extent detailed justifications and limitations of the wef indicators are listed in table 2 phase 2 determining indicator criteria and calculating wef security determining indicator criteria as revealed in table 3 based on previous studies fao 2018a fao 2018b nhamo et al 2020 zuo et al 2020 the wef indicator security levels of w1 w2 w3 w4 e1 e2 e3 f1 and f3 were determined in addition we defined the top data points of the 2 5th 25th 50th 75th and 97 5th percentiles of the wef security indicator performance for all countries in terms of the e4 f2 and f4 indicators as the i ii iii iv and v level bounds respectively xu et al 2020b zuo et al 2020 the detailed reasons for these indicator thresholds are provided in the appendix determining indicator weight we normalized the indicator original data to a scale from 0 to 1 based on eqs 1 and 2 in section 2 2 1 and the indicator weight was then determined by eqs 3 and 4 in section 2 2 1 calculating wef security we used topsis to calculate the wef security degree and the security degree in the water energy and food sectors the details of topsis implementation are presented in section 2 2 2 phase 3 identification of the wef security pattern we unravelled the relationships among the three sectors based on synergies trade offs and unclassified relationship types putra et al 2020 and applied radar graphs to visualize the major indicators that affect wef security nhamo et al 2020 furthermore wef security is influenced by both natural and socioeconomic factors table 1 therefore we identified the wef security pattern based on the possible inhibiting factors and whether they were determined by natural or socioeconomic factors 2 2 methods to determine wef security 2 2 1 entropy weight method two main types of approaches are available to determine indicator weights namely subjective approaches such as the analytic hierarchy process ahp and objective approaches represented by the entropy weight method chen 2021 tzeng and huang 2011 the entropy weight method has been successfully applied to determine the index weight in the water energy and socioeconomic fields duan et al 2018 zuo et al 2020 the weight is calculated as the difference in the information order degree of each indicator based on objective data the values indicate the data dispersion level and the influence of the various indicators on wef security chen 2021 zuo et al 2020 in this investigation the indicator values are objective and can be quantified therefore the indicators and data attributes are consistent with those of the entropy weight method chen 2021 although policy maker preferences impact wef security assessment there is a gap in the accurate determination of the subjective weights of indicators due to unavailability and uncertainty in subjective government preferences this study aims to propose a universal framework to analyse wef security therefore to acquire objective results we assume that each indicator exhibits almost the same importance from the perspective of the subject and decision maker preferences are neglected this hypothesis is consistent with the entropy weight method chen 2019 note that following the proposed framework scientific communities and country policy makers could choose an appropriate weighting method to determine the weights of indicators and analyse wef security based on their actual needs the steps to calculate the entropy weights are as follows first the raw data of the indicators should be normalized according to eqs 1 and 2 for benefit indicators 1 x ij x ij min x j max x j min x j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n for cost indicators 2 x ij max x j x ij max x j min x j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n where x ij is the standardized value of the j th indicator in the i th country x ij denotes the value of the j th indicator in the i th country i 1 2 m and j 1 2 n are the number of countries and indicators respectively max x j is the maximum value of the j th indicator among m countries and min x j is the minimum value of the j th indicator among m countries next the entropy value of the j th indicator can be calculated with eq 3 3 e j 1 ln m i 1 m x ij ln x ij j 1 2 n where e j is the entropy value of the j th indicator finally the weight of the j th indicator can be obtained by eq 4 4 w j 1 e j n j 1 n e j where w j is the weight of the j th indicator 2 2 2 technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis wef security consists of water energy and food security aspects safety in the three sectors depends on wef availability self sufficiency productivity and accessibility therefore wef security evaluation is consistent with the characteristics of multicriteria decision analysis mcda nhamo et al 2020 topsis was introduced by c l hwang and k yoon in 1981 and performs well in mcda lin et al 2020 sari 2021 following the method the best alternative can be identified based on the relative closeness between the alternative and the ideal solution via topsis lin et al 2020 topsis has the advantages of objectivity logicality and easy calculation furthermore the entropy weight and topsis e topsis method has been successfully applied in various evaluation fields such as water quality evaluation safety estimation of coal mines risk assessment innovation performance and vulnerability determination chen 2021 kaynak et al 2017 li et al 2011 marti and puertas 2021 topsis requires several assumptions first all criteria are assumed to be monotonically increasing or decreasing second all outcomes can be quantified finally not all the criteria are equally important sánchez lozano and fernández martínez 2016 all the criteria of wef security water security energy security and food security satisfy the abovementioned assumptions topsis is a compensatory mcda method that can provide a sound assessment of the aggregated performance of an alternative or practical situation banihabib et al 2017 however the good performance of one indicator does compensate for the poor performance of one another in topsis guitouni and martel 1998 to bridge this gap we determined the security level of each indicator by calculating the relative closeness to the positive and negative ideal solutions then the possible compensatory and non compensatory indicators of wef security were revealed based on a comparison of the wef and indicator security levels the topsis steps are as follows first the standardized object matrix z z ij m n is constructed based on matrix r r ij m n of original indicator data and standard matrix s s ij m n of the levels of the wef security indicators matrix z represents normalized data of 12 wef security indicators 5 r r ij m n r 11 r 1 n r m 1 r mn where r ij is the value of the j th indicator in the i th country 6 s s ij m n s 11 s 1 n s m 1 s mn where s ij is the value of the j th indicator in the i th level table 3 7 z z ij m n z 11 z 1 n z m 1 z mn where z ij is the standardized value of the j th indicator in the i th country 8 z ij r ij s 1 j s 5 j s 1 j f o r c o s t c r i t e r i a s 1 j r ij s 1 j s 5 j f o r b e n e f i t c r i t e r i a where z ij is the standardized value of the j th indicator in the i th country if z ij 0 z ij 0 i f z ij 1 z ij 1 second according to eq 9 the positive ideal solution z j and negative ideal solution z j are identified for the 12 indicators matrices z j and z j represent the best security level and the worst level respectively 9 z j m a x z 1 j z 2 j z mj z j m i n z 1 j z 2 j z mj third according to eq 10 the weighted euclidean distances between every alternative and the positive and negative ideal solutions are calculated separately 10 d i j 1 n w j z ij z j 2 d i j 1 n w j z ij z j 2 where d i and d i are the distances of the alternative to the positive and negative ideal solutions respectively the values of d i and d i represent the differences between the real security degree and the values of the best and worst security levels finally the closeness of each alternative c i can be calculated with eq 11 11 c i d i d i d i the value of c i varies between 0 and 1 the closer c i is to 1 the better the alternative and the closer c i is to 0 the worse the alternative the value of c represents the security level 2 3 analysis of the synergies and trade offs synergy can be regarded as the positive effect of two indicators on each other i e a mutually beneficial relationship exists between these two indicators in contrast a trade off suggests that a given indicator negatively affects another indicator i e there exists a mutually detrimental relationship between these two indicators fader et al 2018 therefore synergy can occur between two indicators that experience a consistent changing trend and the trade off phenomenon is the opposite of synergy spearman s rank correlation analysis is one of the most classic analysis methods for the correlation between two variables compared with the pearson correlation coefficient method spearman s rank correlation has some advantages a it does not require the relationship between the variables to be linear and can identify nonlinear relationships very well b it does not require the variables to be measured on interval or ratio scales and c there are no assumptions about the frequency distribution of the variables hauke and kossowski 2011 spearman 1904 moreover the effectiveness and applicability of the spearman s rank correlation method have been validated in the analysis of relationships in yearly series data from the water energy and food sectors kroll et al 2019 pradhan et al 2017 putra et al 2020 ronzon and sanjuán 2020 following previous studies when the value of spearman s rank correlation coefficient between two variables is greater than 0 6 this relationship is defined as a synergy when the value is less than 0 6 the relationship is defined as a trade off and when the value varies between 0 6 and 0 6 the relationship is defined as an unclassified relationship pradhan et al 2017 putra et al 2020 these three relationships indicate the nexus among the three sectors although correlation does not reflect causality a correlation coefficient greater than 0 6 indicates a consistent change trend between two indicators and a correlation less than 0 6 suggests an inconsistent or even opposite change trend therefore the determined correlation may reflect causality to a certain extent and we combine it with previous studies to analyse any possible causality 3 case study of central asia and data 3 1 description of the study area central asia ca is located at the border between asia and europe and includes five countries kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan fig 2 the total area of these five countries is approximately 4 million km2 liu et al 2020 ca has a continental climate with a mean annual precipitation of 258 mm an average temperature of 9 c and an average annual evapotranspiration of 220 mm during 2000 2019 central asia climate change n d uzbekistan has the largest population of 33 6 million followed by kazakhstan 18 5 million tajikistan 9 3 million kyrgyzstan 6 5 million and turkmenistan 5 9 million the total internal available freshwater resources are 194 km3 of which 33 occurs in kazakhstan renewable internal freshwater resources per capita are 3722 m3 8385 m3 7689 m3 257 m3 and 531 m3 in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan respectively the total oil reserves in kazakhstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan reach 3 9 0 1 and 0 1 thousand million tons respectively kazakhstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan contain total proven gas reserves of 2 7 19 5 and 1 2 trillion cubic metres respectively kazakhstan and uzbekistan host total proven coal reserves of 25 605 and 1375 million tons respectively bp statistical review of world energy 2020 the energy production and consumption ratios in the five countries are shown in fig 2 agriculture is the largest water user in ca and uzbekistan and kazakhstan consume the most virtual water in agriculture yan and tan 2020 the average annual net export of virtual water in agricultural products was approximately 9 billion m3 and kazakhstan had the largest share of 90 during 1992 2016 yan and tan 2020 the main agricultural types of virtual water trade were cereals feeds and cotton yan and tan 2020 in the past virtual water flows have exacerbated water scarcity in ca lee and jung 2018 porkka et al 2012 3 2 water energy and food challenges in central asia ca is one of the most typical regions threatened by wef insecurity at present jalilov et al 2013 and this phenomenon will be exacerbated in the future which will inhibit sdg achievement there have been serious water allocation conflicts between upstream and downstream countries in the aral sea basin asb in ca due to the limited water resources and different water use goals after the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 for instance upstream countries aimed to develop hydropower to meet energy demand but downstream countries required adequate water resources for agricultural irrigation ecology and domestic life moreover the increased crop water demand has increased water insecurity in the syr darya river basin ruan et al 2020 and the increasing population and global warming have exacerbated water stress and conflicts in this region siegfried et al 2012 tian and zhang 2020 according to the un the population in ca will increase to nearly 100 million by 2050 world population prospects 2019 and central asian countries will face increasing challenges in satisfying the growing wef demand previous studies in ca have focused on the analysis of the wef nexus in the amu darya and syr darya river basins based on hydrological models and basin scale water trading approaches granit et al 2012 jalilov et al 2016 ma et al 2020 these investigations have provided useful ideas for integrated wef management of transboundary rivers in ca some previous studies have indicated that there are synergistic and trade off relationships among the water energy and food sectors albrecht et al 2018 fader et al 2018 kaddoura and el khatib 2017 putra et al 2020 therefore potential synergies and trade offs can also be found in ca ma et al 2021 roidt and de strasser 2018 however few studies have analysed wef security for sustainable development at the country scale in ca and the synergies and trade offs among the three sectors remain unclear 3 3 data we obtained time series data for 2000 2014 from various open sources w2 w3 w4 e3 and e4 were obtained from the official sdg database https unstats un org sdgs indicators database and f1 f3 f4 cereal production and domestic supply quantity were acquired from faostat http www fao org faostat en home while the total internal available freshwater resources and

calculated by dividing the total internal available freshwater by the population e1 was obtained by dividing primary energy production by the population e2 was determined by dividing primary energy production by primary energy consumption f2 was calculated by dividing cereal production by the domestic supply however note that the considered f3 and f4 data are 3 year averages e g the average dietary energy supply adequacy f4 in 2000 is the average value over the period from 2000 to 2002 http www fao org faostat en home 4 results 4 1 trends of change in security in the three sectors and overall wef security we observed various security change trends among the three sectors in ca figs 3 5 regarding the water sector the security degree in the five ca countries revealed a steady or slight increase except for kazakhstan fig 3 the security degrees in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan were higher than those in turkmenistan and uzbekistan the average water security scores in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan were 0 75 0 77 0 68 0 22 and 0 13 respectively in addition the minimum values in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan were higher than 0 65 but the maximum values in turkmenistan and uzbekistan were lower than 0 30 from 2000 to 2014 the water security levels in turkmenistan kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan increased by 32 15 and 13 respectively with higher change rates than those observed in kazakhstan and tajikistan in the energy sector kazakhstan and turkmenistan attained significantly higher security degrees than tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan fig 4 the average energy security degrees in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan were 0 77 0 45 0 49 0 64 and 0 42 respectively moreover the minimum values in kazakhstan and turkmenistan were higher than 0 55 but the maximum values in kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan were lower than 0 50 from 2000 to 2014 there were significant increases in energy security in uzbekistan and turkmenistan with change rates of 68 and 43 respectively in contrast energy sector security remained constant in kyrgyzstan in addition there was a larger fluctuation range for energy security than for water sector security which increased by more than 20 from 2000 to 2014 in the five ca countries except for kyrgyzstan in the food sector the change trends varied significantly among the five ca countries fig 5 in general tajikistan attained the lowest food security degree the average food security levels in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan reached 0 76 0 67 0 27 0 80 and 0 69 respectively in addition we observed fluctuating decreasing trends in food security in kazakhstan and turkmenistan and a steady trend in kyrgyzstan moreover food security varied within a wider range than that observed in the water sector which indicated that variation rates were higher than 20 between the minimum and maximum values in kazakhstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan although there was no significant increase or decrease in wef security it varied among the five central asian countries fig 6 additionally kazakhstan and tajikistan attained the highest and lowest wef security levels respectively among the five countries the average wef security scores in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan were 0 79 0 71 0 58 0 62 and 0 59 respectively compared to that in 2000 wef security in 2014 in tajikistan increased by 11 which was the largest improvement in contrast wef security slightly decreased by 5 and 3 from 2000 to 2014 in kazakhstan and turkmenistan respectively further wef security in tajikistan ranged from 0 53 at the bottom to 0 62 at the top and exhibited the largest fluctuation range fig 6 4 2 yearly rates of change in wef security and security in the three sectors the results indicated that in the five central asian countries food security fluctuated significantly more than water and energy security fig 7 in kazakhstan the numbers of years with increased and decreased wef security levels were five and nine respectively with wef security remaining relatively constant the numbers of years with increased and decreased water security levels were eight and six respectively energy security decreased slightly in only two years food security increased slightly in 2006 2009 2010 2013 and 2014 in kyrgyzstan the numbers of years with increased and decreased wef and energy sector security levels were eight and six respectively with wef and energy security levels also remaining steady in addition increases and decreases in the wef and energy sector security levels occurred in the same years from 2000 to 2014 water security continuously increased the number of years with increased and decreased food security levels were 6 and 8 respectively in tajikistan the numbers of years with increased and decreased wef and food sector security levels were eight and six respectively water security continuously increased from 2000 to 2014 energy security decreased in only 2004 2012 and 2014 in turkmenistan the number of years with increased and decreased wef security levels was seven water security decreased in only 2001 2002 and 2004 energy security continuously increased except in 2003 and 2009 in the food sector the numbers of years with increased and decreased security levels were six and eight respectively in uzbekistan the numbers of years with increased and decreased wef security levels were 6 and 8 respectively the numbers of years with increased and decreased water sector security levels were 8 and 6 respectively energy security decreased in only 2002 and 2011 the numbers of years with increased and decreased food security levels were 8 and 6 respectively 4 3 patterns of change in wef security and security in the three sectors to identify the patterns of change in wef security in each country this investigation defined the steady type in which the security change rate in 2014 varied between 10 and 10 with respect to the 2000 level moreover we defined the continuous ascent type in which two conditions were satisfied the change rate was higher than 10 and the absolute value of the number of positive annual change rates minus the number of negative annual change rates was larger than seven when the change rate was higher than 10 and the absolute value of the number of positive annual change rates minus the number of negative annual change rates was smaller than seven these conditions defined the fluctuating ascent type in addition we defined the continuous decrease type as having both a change rate lower than 10 and an absolute value of the number of positive yearly change rates minus the number of negative yearly change rates larger than seven when the change rate was lower than 10 and the absolute value of the number of years with positive change rates minus the number of years with negative change rates was smaller than seven these conditions defined the fluctuating decrease type finally this investigation concluded that wef security revealed stability in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan table 4 in regard to water sector security kyrgyzstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan indicated ascending change patterns energy sector security manifested ascending change patterns in kazakhstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan in contrast in the food sector two countries namely kazakhstan and turkmenistan exhibited decreases in security table 4 although not all ca countries were facing a serious food crisis we can infer that food stress may have been one of the negative factors for improvement in sustainable wef development from 2000 to 2014 4 4 synergies and trade offs of the wef security indicators we observed the same shares of synergies and trade offs among the three sectors in ca and the largest share of unclassified relationships accounting for 54 of all relationships reflecting the inconsistent trends of change in the wef indicators furthermore at the country scale the shares of the synergies were larger than those of the trade offs in kazakhstan and turkmenistan while the opposite was the case in kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan figs 8 and 9 respectively in kazakhstan w1 and f1 attained larger shares of trade offs with another indicator than of synergies suggesting that progress in w1 and f1 poses a potential threat to wef security and sustainable development although kazakhstan contains the largest available water resources in ca the freshwater resources per capita w1 are at the intermediate level with population growth and a growing demand for water in the energy and food sectors the negative effect of water resources could be considerable note that the quantity of the food supply f1 exhibited a continuing downward trend in kazakhstan which could be affected by food policy and dietary habits in kyrgyzstan the energy sector showed unclassified relationships in terms of both the water and food sectors suggesting that the energy sector did not provide adequate support to the water and food sector over the past few years although kyrgyzstan has a high potential for hydroelectricity generation it contains the smallest amount of fossil fuels in ca and the residential sector currently accounts for the largest share of electricity meyer et al 2019 rakhmatullaev et al 2018 as a result the energy sector hinders the sustainability of the water and food sectors in kyrgyzstan between the water and food sectors there was a larger share of trade offs than of synergies in kyrgyzstan which reflects the unmatched relationships between water and land resources kyrgyzstan contains the smallest cultivable area with the lowest ratio of cultivable area to total land area in the asb zhang et al 2019a in contrast kyrgyzstan possesses sufficient water resources limited land resources impede maximizing the utilization of water resources in tajikistan the share of trade offs was slightly larger than that of synergies the wef security degrees relationships and related rationales in tajikistan are comparable to those in kyrgyzstan as an upstream country in the asb the cultivable area and ratio of cultivable area to total area in tajikistan are slightly greater than those in kyrgyzstan zhang et al 2019a moreover we observed that most of the indicators attained nearly equal shares of trade offs and synergies with another indicator and e4 and f2 exhibited unclassified relationships with almost all other wef security indicators hence there is great potential for synchronous development of the three sectors in turkmenistan there was a larger share of synergies than of trade offs among the three sectors however in the water sector the share of trade offs was larger than that of synergies indicating that the water crisis was a great challenge to wef security turkmenistan contains the smallest amount of water resources per capita and experiences high water stress zhang et al 2020 meyer et al 2019 in contrast in the asb the cultivable area of turkmenistan is at the intermediate level zhang et al 2019a furthermore turkmenistan contains the most abundant fossil fuels there are poor matching relationships among water cultivable area and energy resources the water sector poses a threat to energy and food security although uzbekistan attained a slightly larger share of trade offs than of synergies it displayed the largest share of unclassified relationships among the five central asian countries furthermore w2 e2 e4 f1 and f2 revealed unclassified relationships with almost all other wef security indicators therefore the positive and negative mutual relationships of the wef security indicators are not significant in uzbekistan there is an urgent need to integrate the management of the three sectors in uzbekistan 5 discussion 5 1 possible factors inhibiting wef security and security in the three sectors the shares of wef synergies and trade offs were smaller than those of unclassified relationships in the ca countries from 2000 to 2014 figs 8 and 9 respectively until recently the three sectors have provided little support for each other which indicates that the security in these three sectors does not exhibit a significant synchronized increasing trend although we cannot gain insights into wef security from the perspective of interactions we can identify the factors that possibly inhibit sustainable wef development in the three sectors by analysing the relationships between the wef indicator scores and associated sector security degrees throughout 2000 2014 in this investigation i e using entropy weights and topsis rather than decision maker preferences the greatest wef security challenges involved the water sector in turkmenistan and uzbekistan fig 10 a consistent with a lack of water resources in both countries zuo et al 2020 however in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan there was an urgent need to improve the performance of the energy and food sectors jalilov et al 2016 furthermore considering the water sector fig 10b although tajikistan and kyrgyzstan attained the two highest levels of freshwater resources per capita the water security in these two countries was mainly limited by the following factors water accessibility w4 and water use efficiency w3 chen et al 2020 fao 2018a both turkmenistan and uzbekistan were negatively influenced by indicators w1 w2 and w3 fao 2018a fao 2018b zuo et al 2020 moreover due to the lack of safely managed drinking water services uzbekistan exhibited low water accessibility w4 with a security score of 0 41 regarding the energy sector fig 10c energy availability e1 and self sufficiency e2 constrained energy sustainability in kyrgyzstan with security scores of 0 24 and 0 01 respectively the availability of energy e1 with a score of 0 005 posed a threat to energy security in tajikistan the availability e1 and productivity e3 of energy imposed a negative influence on energy sustainability in uzbekistan with security scores of 0 42 and 0 13 respectively interestingly although turkmenistan is globally an important natural gas producing and exporting country energy sustainability is constrained by a low energy productivity e3 with a score of 0 40 considering the food sector fig 10d the food supply quantity f1 continuously decreased from 2000 to 2014 which poses a potential threat to food sustainability in kazakhstan self sufficiency with respect to food f2 was the most negative indicator of food sustainability in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan with security scores of 0 30 and 0 respectively due to limited land resources in contrast although f2 also threatened food security in turkmenistan and uzbekistan the food insecurity in these two countries was mainly attributed to insufficient water resources for irrigation and consequent low food production zhang et al 2020 5 2 wef security patterns wef security patterns are the integrated results of the available resources management performance technology level and relationships among the three sectors these factors and associated wef security indicators can be classified as either natural or socioeconomic factors table 1 there are strong correlations between the income level and wef security and the sdgs with international trade good management performance and advanced technology developed countries can significantly improve their sustainable development levels gain et al 2016 xu et al 2020b in general developed countries exhibit higher levels of sustainable development related to the three sectors than developing countries gain et al 2016 wada and bierkens 2014 we find that both the gross domestic product gdp and per capita gdp of kazakhstan are the highest among the five central asian countries which is consistent with wef security being the highest in kazakhstan in contrast the gdp and per capita gdp in tajikistan are the lowest along with its wef security uzbekistan attains the second lowest wef security level but the gdp and per capita gdp in uzbekistan are the second and third highest respectively in ca we observe that sustainable water and energy development levels are low in uzbekistan for instance the water stress level is the highest in uzbekistan across ca in addition the water use efficiency in uzbekistan has decreased over the past few years chen et al 2020 this investigation aimed to identify the negative factors that are considered obstacles to wef security in ca synthesizing the above results figs 8 10 we classified the wef security patterns as water constrained energy constrained food constrained water energy constrained water food constrained energy food constrained and water energy food constrained furthermore based on the group of critical indicators table 1 we revealed the wef security patterns from the perspective of natural and socioeconomic factors as indicated in table 5 we conclude that the water sector is the critical sector of wef security in ca in general the water crisis is an obstacle to sustainable development in ca even in water rich countries on the natural side the total available freshwater resources are the constraining factor on wef security in turkmenistan and uzbekistan however in the upstream countries of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan the wef security patterns are energy food constrained on the socioeconomic side the wef security patterns in kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan are food constrained and water food constrained respectively turkmenistan attains a low security degree in both the water and energy sectors tajikistan has the potential for integrated management of the three sectors on both the natural and socioeconomic sides the wef security patterns in uzbekistan are water energy food constrained which suggests that the most effort is required for wef sustainable development in uzbekistan the previous paragraphs highlight that natural factors pose a great challenge for wef security in ca regarding the natural conditions of resources wef security could be improved by negotiating the water allocation and energy supply amounts between the upstream and downstream countries in the asb jalilov et al 2016 regarding socioeconomic aspects there remains great potential to improve the overall wef sustainability score via international trade good management performance and advanced technology especially in kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan 5 3 uncertainties and limitations although the 12 selected indicators demonstrate wef security to a large extent some uncertainties need to be clarified table 2 first due to data unavailability some indicators may not capture all aspects of wef security we do not consider unconventional water resources due to missing or few data this may underestimate the water availability w1 water loss is difficult to calculate accurately but it may increase water withdrawal and reduce water self sufficiency w2 access to water w4 may be overestimated because access to agricultural and industrial water is not considered food availability f1 may have some uncertainties because we focus on cereals second wef security is a complicated system problem to increase the applicability and reproducibility of the introduced framework we make several assumptions and simplifications although e1 represents the real availability of primary energy in the past potential fossil and renewable energy may enhance energy availability in the future meyer et al 2019 energy and food self sufficiency e2 and f2 may be overestimated since consumption may not be entirely equal to real demand energy and food accessibility e4 and f4 may be overestimated as we assume that everyone could afford energy and food moreover the electricity supply guarantee rate may also undermine access to electricity third we focus on wef security for sustainable development but do not pay much attention to the environment and ecology water and energy productivity w3 and e3 do not consider environmental and ecological costs associated with water and energy use this situation is consistent with food production f3 environmental and ecological extensions are beyond the scope of this study despite the abovementioned uncertainties the indicator system captures key aspects of wef security at the country level table 2 and systematically evaluates the degree of wef security furthermore the developed framework faces certain limitations although correlation analysis illustrates the relationships among the wef security indicators causality is not determined putra et al 2020 in addition we classify wef security patterns from the perspective of natural and socioeconomic factors but the contributions of these two factors are not quantified due to the complex interactions between the natural conditions of resources and human activities 6 conclusions in this study we proposed a hybrid framework involving topsis spearman s rank correlation and radar graphs to analyse wef security and the corresponding relationships this approach was applied in the five central asian countries to better understand wef security and sustainable development at the country scale our results indicated that wef security and the degree of security in the three sectors exhibited steady trends continuous increasing and decreasing trends and fluctuating increasing and decreasing trends within the five ca countries moreover the water sector was the most critical variable regarding wef security in ca which was verified by the fact that water insecurity poses a threat not only to upstream water resource rich countries tajikistan and kyrgyzstan but also to downstream water resource poor countries turkmenistan uzbekistan and kazakhstan furthermore the wef crisis in the asb is a major issue in ca the potential utilization of hydropower is a beneficial method to ensure energy security in the upstream countries of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan but this may result in a water and food crisis in kazakhstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan moreover sustainable wef development is a goal associated with a whole country and should be addressed at the country scale therefore integrative wef research at the country and basin scales should be conducted to gain insights into the wef security and nexus mechanisms and to achieve win win cooperation among the asb countries data availability data used in this study are publicly available from the websites

3567,thoroughly understanding the security of water energy and food wef and the factors that influence them is essential for sustainable development management in any region this study proposed a new analytical framework for wef security evaluation in both individual sectors and the whole system using the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis and four dimensions of security indicators availability self sufficiency productivity and accessibility the internal relationships among the three sectors and the main factors influencing wef security were analysed by spearman s rank correlation and radar graphs respectively the five countries in central asia ca which are experiencing wef crises and facing great challenges in achieving their sustainable development goals sdgs were chosen as a case study in this paper our results showed that kazakhstan attained the highest wef security level followed by kyrgyzstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan tajikistan exhibited the lowest security level from 2000 to 2014 three types of internal relationships among the three sectors were identified synergies trade offs and unclassified the unclassified relationship type accounted for the largest share of 54 in ca suggesting great potential for synergetic improvement among the three sectors approaches for improving the country wef security based on our research are as follows kazakhstan should prioritize food allocation and supply kyrgyzstan and tajikistan should increase energy and food production and raise the supply level and usage efficiency of water and food turkmenistan should increase the available water resources and food production and improve the supply level and usage efficiency of water and energy and uzbekistan should both increase the available amount and enhance the wef management performance keywords resource security water energy food nexus integrated method sustainable development central asian countries 1 introduction water energy and food wef are essential for human survival and sustainable socioeconomic development rasul and sharma 2016 the water energy and food security nexus as a whole was first introduced at the world economic forum in 2008 and has received increasing attention from researchers stakeholders and policy makers since the bonn conference in 2011 putra et al 2020 zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2019b water energy and food are traditionally managed by different sectors and they make up the three resource sectors of wef albrecht et al 2018 liu et al 2017a putra et al 2020 simpson and jewitt 2019 in 2011 the world economic forum called for more attention to the nexus among the three sectors wef 2011 zhang et al 2019b since then the concept of the wef security nexus has been interpreted by researchers and international organizations from different perspectives and concerns fao 2014 zhang et al 2018a in general the wef security nexus can be interpreted from two aspects first the nexus is taken as a method to analyse the relationships between the three resources second the nexus is indicated by the interactions among the three resources zhang et al 2018a previous investigations identified four aspects of wef security availability self sufficiency productivity and accessibility of the three resources flammini et al 2014 lee et al 2012 nhamo et al 2020 taniguchi et al 2017 zarei 2020 and explored the interactions among the three sectors however the concept of the wef security nexus is still unclear and more efforts are needed to illustrate it reinhard et al 2017 ensuring wef security to sustain a growing population under climate change and globalization is one of the greatest challenges worldwide fuhrman et al 2020 momblanch et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b moreover the three sectors exhibit close relationships with sustainable development goal sdg 2 end hunger achieve food security improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture sdg 6 ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all and sdg 7 ensure access to affordable reliable sustainable and modern energy for all among the 17 sdgs introduced by the united nations un bleischwitz et al 2018 nhamo et al 2020 pradhan et al 2017 therefore a comprehensive evaluation of the wef security nexus can help improve the rationality of integrated wef management and realize the above sdgs namany et al 2019 previous studies have analysed the wef security nexus at the farm household city basin country regional and international scales with various models and tools for a range of purposes abulibdeh and zaidan 2020 barik et al 2017 deng et al 2020 fabiani et al 2020 hussien et al 2017 putra et al 2020 smajgl et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a for example the wef nexus has been analysed via life cycle assessment system dynamics model footprint theory network analysis the nexus solutions tool and bayesian networks ghafoori kharanagh et al 2020 kamrani et al 2020 li and ma 2020 ravar et al 2020 vinca et al 2020 xu et al 2020a although these methods can be applied for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the wef security nexus at multiple scales and can provide some insights for improving wef security e g putra et al 2020 ravar et al 2020 the extensive data requirements are a main limitation for the wide application of these methods especially in developing areas kaddoura and el khatib 2017 liu et al 2017b an overall wef security assessment at the country scale can provide guidance to decision makers for integrated wef management this topic has been explored in some recent studies for example wef nexus sustainability was evaluated by an improved matter element extension model a comprehensive evaluation method suitable for dealing with multiple factors in china wang et al 2018 based on the analysis of transboundary water resource management resource accessibility and availability the wef nexus was explored in iran iraq and turkey zarei 2020 wef nexus sustainability indicators were selected including water availability and productivity energy accessibility and productivity and food self sufficiency and cereal productivity and the wef nexus sustainability was then evaluated in south africa nhamo et al 2020 for wef nexus interactions the relationships of synergies and trade offs were determined by spearman s rank correlation in five south asian countries putra et al 2020 from the perspective of embedded resources the network approach was applied to analyse the wef nexus in america for which extensive data were needed mahjabin et al 2020 however there is still no sufficient integrative analysis of wef security and the relationships among the three sectors globally and studies related to factors that reduce wef security and methods to improve wef security are lacking albrecht et al 2018 putra et al 2020 these limitations hinder the management and improvement of the wef security nexus and associated sdgs at the country scale in data limited regions to fill the research gaps this study develops an assessment indicator system for wef security and a hybrid framework that integrates the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis spearman s rank correlation and radar graphs to systematically analyse wef security at the country scale designed assessment indicator data are easily acquired from open sources such as the world bank the food and agriculture organization fao online statistical database faostat the u s energy information administration eia and the official sdg database the wef security degree can be calculated by topsis the relationships among water energy and food can be determined by spearman s rank correlation and the potential inhibiting factors can be visualized by radar graphs the five central asian countries are taken as an example to validate the proposed framework we assess the degree of wef security in the five central asian countries during 2000 2014 analyse the spatiotemporal variations in wef security reveal the relationships among the three sectors and identify the factors that positively or negatively determined wef security the results of this study are expected to provide illustrative insights into sustainable wef development in central asia ca 2 methodology 2 1 integrative analytical framework of the wef security the proposed evaluation framework of wef security fig 1 comprises three main phases phase 1 constructing the evaluation indicator system for wef security as indicated in table 1 the essence of resource security includes four pillars availability self sufficiency productivity and accessibility flammini et al 2014 lee et al 2012 nhamo et al 2020 taniguchi et al 2017 zarei 2020 these four aspects demonstrate the security situation for the complete process of resource use from resource abundance availability conflicts between supply and demand self sufficiency and utilization levels productivity to human welfare accessibility availability describes the resources accessible to humans and mainly indicates resource abundance self sufficiency determines whether resource production can meet demand and mostly represents the supply and demand management level productivity illustrates the economic benefits of the resources used and largely reflects the utilization level accessibility indicates whether users can access resources and mainly reflects the human right to consume resources in addition to increase the applicability and reproducibility of the introduced method data availability is also a key issue in the identification of wef security indicators we identify 12 indicators to study wef security for sustainable development at the country scale in data limited regions table 1 based on the aforementioned sdgs and four essential aspects together with previous studies nhamo et al 2020 taniguchi et al 2017 xu et al 2020b zuo et al 2020 although the selected indicators do not totally represent the essence of wef security they illustrate the real wef security level to a large extent detailed justifications and limitations of the wef indicators are listed in table 2 phase 2 determining indicator criteria and calculating wef security determining indicator criteria as revealed in table 3 based on previous studies fao 2018a fao 2018b nhamo et al 2020 zuo et al 2020 the wef indicator security levels of w1 w2 w3 w4 e1 e2 e3 f1 and f3 were determined in addition we defined the top data points of the 2 5th 25th 50th 75th and 97 5th percentiles of the wef security indicator performance for all countries in terms of the e4 f2 and f4 indicators as the i ii iii iv and v level bounds respectively xu et al 2020b zuo et al 2020 the detailed reasons for these indicator thresholds are provided in the appendix determining indicator weight we normalized the indicator original data to a scale from 0 to 1 based on eqs 1 and 2 in section 2 2 1 and the indicator weight was then determined by eqs 3 and 4 in section 2 2 1 calculating wef security we used topsis to calculate the wef security degree and the security degree in the water energy and food sectors the details of topsis implementation are presented in section 2 2 2 phase 3 identification of the wef security pattern we unravelled the relationships among the three sectors based on synergies trade offs and unclassified relationship types putra et al 2020 and applied radar graphs to visualize the major indicators that affect wef security nhamo et al 2020 furthermore wef security is influenced by both natural and socioeconomic factors table 1 therefore we identified the wef security pattern based on the possible inhibiting factors and whether they were determined by natural or socioeconomic factors 2 2 methods to determine wef security 2 2 1 entropy weight method two main types of approaches are available to determine indicator weights namely subjective approaches such as the analytic hierarchy process ahp and objective approaches represented by the entropy weight method chen 2021 tzeng and huang 2011 the entropy weight method has been successfully applied to determine the index weight in the water energy and socioeconomic fields duan et al 2018 zuo et al 2020 the weight is calculated as the difference in the information order degree of each indicator based on objective data the values indicate the data dispersion level and the influence of the various indicators on wef security chen 2021 zuo et al 2020 in this investigation the indicator values are objective and can be quantified therefore the indicators and data attributes are consistent with those of the entropy weight method chen 2021 although policy maker preferences impact wef security assessment there is a gap in the accurate determination of the subjective weights of indicators due to unavailability and uncertainty in subjective government preferences this study aims to propose a universal framework to analyse wef security therefore to acquire objective results we assume that each indicator exhibits almost the same importance from the perspective of the subject and decision maker preferences are neglected this hypothesis is consistent with the entropy weight method chen 2019 note that following the proposed framework scientific communities and country policy makers could choose an appropriate weighting method to determine the weights of indicators and analyse wef security based on their actual needs the steps to calculate the entropy weights are as follows first the raw data of the indicators should be normalized according to eqs 1 and 2 for benefit indicators 1 x ij x ij min x j max x j min x j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n for cost indicators 2 x ij max x j x ij max x j min x j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n where x ij is the standardized value of the j th indicator in the i th country x ij denotes the value of the j th indicator in the i th country i 1 2 m and j 1 2 n are the number of countries and indicators respectively max x j is the maximum value of the j th indicator among m countries and min x j is the minimum value of the j th indicator among m countries next the entropy value of the j th indicator can be calculated with eq 3 3 e j 1 ln m i 1 m x ij ln x ij j 1 2 n where e j is the entropy value of the j th indicator finally the weight of the j th indicator can be obtained by eq 4 4 w j 1 e j n j 1 n e j where w j is the weight of the j th indicator 2 2 2 technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis wef security consists of water energy and food security aspects safety in the three sectors depends on wef availability self sufficiency productivity and accessibility therefore wef security evaluation is consistent with the characteristics of multicriteria decision analysis mcda nhamo et al 2020 topsis was introduced by c l hwang and k yoon in 1981 and performs well in mcda lin et al 2020 sari 2021 following the method the best alternative can be identified based on the relative closeness between the alternative and the ideal solution via topsis lin et al 2020 topsis has the advantages of objectivity logicality and easy calculation furthermore the entropy weight and topsis e topsis method has been successfully applied in various evaluation fields such as water quality evaluation safety estimation of coal mines risk assessment innovation performance and vulnerability determination chen 2021 kaynak et al 2017 li et al 2011 marti and puertas 2021 topsis requires several assumptions first all criteria are assumed to be monotonically increasing or decreasing second all outcomes can be quantified finally not all the criteria are equally important sánchez lozano and fernández martínez 2016 all the criteria of wef security water security energy security and food security satisfy the abovementioned assumptions topsis is a compensatory mcda method that can provide a sound assessment of the aggregated performance of an alternative or practical situation banihabib et al 2017 however the good performance of one indicator does compensate for the poor performance of one another in topsis guitouni and martel 1998 to bridge this gap we determined the security level of each indicator by calculating the relative closeness to the positive and negative ideal solutions then the possible compensatory and non compensatory indicators of wef security were revealed based on a comparison of the wef and indicator security levels the topsis steps are as follows first the standardized object matrix z z ij m n is constructed based on matrix r r ij m n of original indicator data and standard matrix s s ij m n of the levels of the wef security indicators matrix z represents normalized data of 12 wef security indicators 5 r r ij m n r 11 r 1 n r m 1 r mn where r ij is the value of the j th indicator in the i th country 6 s s ij m n s 11 s 1 n s m 1 s mn where s ij is the value of the j th indicator in the i th level table 3 7 z z ij m n z 11 z 1 n z m 1 z mn where z ij is the standardized value of the j th indicator in the i th country 8 z ij r ij s 1 j s 5 j s 1 j f o r c o s t c r i t e r i a s 1 j r ij s 1 j s 5 j f o r b e n e f i t c r i t e r i a where z ij is the standardized value of the j th indicator in the i th country if z ij 0 z ij 0 i f z ij 1 z ij 1 second according to eq 9 the positive ideal solution z j and negative ideal solution z j are identified for the 12 indicators matrices z j and z j represent the best security level and the worst level respectively 9 z j m a x z 1 j z 2 j z mj z j m i n z 1 j z 2 j z mj third according to eq 10 the weighted euclidean distances between every alternative and the positive and negative ideal solutions are calculated separately 10 d i j 1 n w j z ij z j 2 d i j 1 n w j z ij z j 2 where d i and d i are the distances of the alternative to the positive and negative ideal solutions respectively the values of d i and d i represent the differences between the real security degree and the values of the best and worst security levels finally the closeness of each alternative c i can be calculated with eq 11 11 c i d i d i d i the value of c i varies between 0 and 1 the closer c i is to 1 the better the alternative and the closer c i is to 0 the worse the alternative the value of c represents the security level 2 3 analysis of the synergies and trade offs synergy can be regarded as the positive effect of two indicators on each other i e a mutually beneficial relationship exists between these two indicators in contrast a trade off suggests that a given indicator negatively affects another indicator i e there exists a mutually detrimental relationship between these two indicators fader et al 2018 therefore synergy can occur between two indicators that experience a consistent changing trend and the trade off phenomenon is the opposite of synergy spearman s rank correlation analysis is one of the most classic analysis methods for the correlation between two variables compared with the pearson correlation coefficient method spearman s rank correlation has some advantages a it does not require the relationship between the variables to be linear and can identify nonlinear relationships very well b it does not require the variables to be measured on interval or ratio scales and c there are no assumptions about the frequency distribution of the variables hauke and kossowski 2011 spearman 1904 moreover the effectiveness and applicability of the spearman s rank correlation method have been validated in the analysis of relationships in yearly series data from the water energy and food sectors kroll et al 2019 pradhan et al 2017 putra et al 2020 ronzon and sanjuán 2020 following previous studies when the value of spearman s rank correlation coefficient between two variables is greater than 0 6 this relationship is defined as a synergy when the value is less than 0 6 the relationship is defined as a trade off and when the value varies between 0 6 and 0 6 the relationship is defined as an unclassified relationship pradhan et al 2017 putra et al 2020 these three relationships indicate the nexus among the three sectors although correlation does not reflect causality a correlation coefficient greater than 0 6 indicates a consistent change trend between two indicators and a correlation less than 0 6 suggests an inconsistent or even opposite change trend therefore the determined correlation may reflect causality to a certain extent and we combine it with previous studies to analyse any possible causality 3 case study of central asia and data 3 1 description of the study area central asia ca is located at the border between asia and europe and includes five countries kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan fig 2 the total area of these five countries is approximately 4 million km2 liu et al 2020 ca has a continental climate with a mean annual precipitation of 258 mm an average temperature of 9 c and an average annual evapotranspiration of 220 mm during 2000 2019 central asia climate change n d uzbekistan has the largest population of 33 6 million followed by kazakhstan 18 5 million tajikistan 9 3 million kyrgyzstan 6 5 million and turkmenistan 5 9 million the total internal available freshwater resources are 194 km3 of which 33 occurs in kazakhstan renewable internal freshwater resources per capita are 3722 m3 8385 m3 7689 m3 257 m3 and 531 m3 in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan respectively the total oil reserves in kazakhstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan reach 3 9 0 1 and 0 1 thousand million tons respectively kazakhstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan contain total proven gas reserves of 2 7 19 5 and 1 2 trillion cubic metres respectively kazakhstan and uzbekistan host total proven coal reserves of 25 605 and 1375 million tons respectively bp statistical review of world energy 2020 the energy production and consumption ratios in the five countries are shown in fig 2 agriculture is the largest water user in ca and uzbekistan and kazakhstan consume the most virtual water in agriculture yan and tan 2020 the average annual net export of virtual water in agricultural products was approximately 9 billion m3 and kazakhstan had the largest share of 90 during 1992 2016 yan and tan 2020 the main agricultural types of virtual water trade were cereals feeds and cotton yan and tan 2020 in the past virtual water flows have exacerbated water scarcity in ca lee and jung 2018 porkka et al 2012 3 2 water energy and food challenges in central asia ca is one of the most typical regions threatened by wef insecurity at present jalilov et al 2013 and this phenomenon will be exacerbated in the future which will inhibit sdg achievement there have been serious water allocation conflicts between upstream and downstream countries in the aral sea basin asb in ca due to the limited water resources and different water use goals after the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 for instance upstream countries aimed to develop hydropower to meet energy demand but downstream countries required adequate water resources for agricultural irrigation ecology and domestic life moreover the increased crop water demand has increased water insecurity in the syr darya river basin ruan et al 2020 and the increasing population and global warming have exacerbated water stress and conflicts in this region siegfried et al 2012 tian and zhang 2020 according to the un the population in ca will increase to nearly 100 million by 2050 world population prospects 2019 and central asian countries will face increasing challenges in satisfying the growing wef demand previous studies in ca have focused on the analysis of the wef nexus in the amu darya and syr darya river basins based on hydrological models and basin scale water trading approaches granit et al 2012 jalilov et al 2016 ma et al 2020 these investigations have provided useful ideas for integrated wef management of transboundary rivers in ca some previous studies have indicated that there are synergistic and trade off relationships among the water energy and food sectors albrecht et al 2018 fader et al 2018 kaddoura and el khatib 2017 putra et al 2020 therefore potential synergies and trade offs can also be found in ca ma et al 2021 roidt and de strasser 2018 however few studies have analysed wef security for sustainable development at the country scale in ca and the synergies and trade offs among the three sectors remain unclear 3 3 data we obtained time series data for 2000 2014 from various open sources w2 w3 w4 e3 and e4 were obtained from the official sdg database https unstats un org sdgs indicators database and f1 f3 f4 cereal production and domestic supply quantity were acquired from faostat http www fao org faostat en home while the total internal available freshwater resources and total population were downloaded from the world bank https data worldbank org indicator moreover primary energy production and consumption were obtained from the eia https www eia gov w1 was calculated by dividing the total internal available freshwater by the population e1 was obtained by dividing primary energy production by the population e2 was determined by dividing primary energy production by primary energy consumption f2 was calculated by dividing cereal production by the domestic supply however note that the considered f3 and f4 data are 3 year averages e g the average dietary energy supply adequacy f4 in 2000 is the average value over the period from 2000 to 2002 http www fao org faostat en home 4 results 4 1 trends of change in security in the three sectors and overall wef security we observed various security change trends among the three sectors in ca figs 3 5 regarding the water sector the security degree in the five ca countries revealed a steady or slight increase except for kazakhstan fig 3 the security degrees in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan were higher than those in turkmenistan and uzbekistan the average water security scores in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan were 0 75 0 77 0 68 0 22 and 0 13 respectively in addition the minimum values in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan were higher than 0 65 but the maximum values in turkmenistan and uzbekistan were lower than 0 30 from 2000 to 2014 the water security levels in turkmenistan kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan increased by 32 15 and 13 respectively with higher change rates than those observed in kazakhstan and tajikistan in the energy sector kazakhstan and turkmenistan attained significantly higher security degrees than tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan fig 4 the average energy security degrees in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan were 0 77 0 45 0 49 0 64 and 0 42 respectively moreover the minimum values in kazakhstan and turkmenistan were higher than 0 55 but the maximum values in kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan were lower than 0 50 from 2000 to 2014 there were significant increases in energy security in uzbekistan and turkmenistan with change rates of 68 and 43 respectively in contrast energy sector security remained constant in kyrgyzstan in addition there was a larger fluctuation range for energy security than for water sector security which increased by more than 20 from 2000 to 2014 in the five ca countries except for kyrgyzstan in the food sector the change trends varied significantly among the five ca countries fig 5 in general tajikistan attained the lowest food security degree the average food security levels in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan reached 0 76 0 67 0 27 0 80 and 0 69 respectively in addition we observed fluctuating decreasing trends in food security in kazakhstan and turkmenistan and a steady trend in kyrgyzstan moreover food security varied within a wider range than that observed in the water sector which indicated that variation rates were higher than 20 between the minimum and maximum values in kazakhstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan although there was no significant increase or decrease in wef security it varied among the five central asian countries fig 6 additionally kazakhstan and tajikistan attained the highest and lowest wef security levels respectively among the five countries the average wef security scores in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan were 0 79 0 71 0 58 0 62 and 0 59 respectively compared to that in 2000 wef security in 2014 in tajikistan increased by 11 which was the largest improvement in contrast wef security slightly decreased by 5 and 3 from 2000 to 2014 in kazakhstan and turkmenistan respectively further wef security in tajikistan ranged from 0 53 at the bottom to 0 62 at the top and exhibited the largest fluctuation range fig 6 4 2 yearly rates of change in wef security and security in the three sectors the results indicated that in the five central asian countries food security fluctuated significantly more than water and energy security fig 7 in kazakhstan the numbers of years with increased and decreased wef security levels were five and nine respectively with wef security remaining relatively constant the numbers of years with increased and decreased water security levels were eight and six respectively energy security decreased slightly in only two years food security increased slightly in 2006 2009 2010 2013 and 2014 in kyrgyzstan the numbers of years with increased and decreased wef and energy sector security levels were eight and six respectively with wef and energy security levels also remaining steady in addition increases and decreases in the wef and energy sector security levels occurred in the same years from 2000 to 2014 water security continuously increased the number of years with increased and decreased food security levels were 6 and 8 respectively in tajikistan the numbers of years with increased and decreased wef and food sector security levels were eight and six respectively water security continuously increased from 2000 to 2014 energy security decreased in only 2004 2012 and 2014 in turkmenistan the number of years with increased and decreased wef security levels was seven water security decreased in only 2001 2002 and 2004 energy security continuously increased except in 2003 and 2009 in the food sector the numbers of years with increased and decreased security levels were six and eight respectively in uzbekistan the numbers of years with increased and decreased wef security levels were 6 and 8 respectively the numbers of years with increased and decreased water sector security levels were 8 and 6 respectively energy security decreased in only 2002 and 2011 the numbers of years with increased and decreased food security levels were 8 and 6 respectively 4 3 patterns of change in wef security and security in the three sectors to identify the patterns of change in wef security in each country this investigation defined the steady type in which the security change rate in 2014 varied between 10 and 10 with respect to the 2000 level moreover we defined the continuous ascent type in which two conditions were satisfied the change rate was higher than 10 and the absolute value of the number of positive annual change rates minus the number of negative annual change rates was larger than seven when the change rate was higher than 10 and the absolute value of the number of positive annual change rates minus the number of negative annual change rates was smaller than seven these conditions defined the fluctuating ascent type in addition we defined the continuous decrease type as having both a change rate lower than 10 and an absolute value of the number of positive yearly change rates minus the number of negative yearly change rates larger than seven when the change rate was lower than 10 and the absolute value of the number of years with positive change rates minus the number of years with negative change rates was smaller than seven these conditions defined the fluctuating decrease type finally this investigation concluded that wef security revealed stability in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan table 4 in regard to water sector security kyrgyzstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan indicated ascending change patterns energy sector security manifested ascending change patterns in kazakhstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan in contrast in the food sector two countries namely kazakhstan and turkmenistan exhibited decreases in security table 4 although not all ca countries were facing a serious food crisis we can infer that food stress may have been one of the negative factors for improvement in sustainable wef development from 2000 to 2014 4 4 synergies and trade offs of the wef security indicators we observed the same shares of synergies and trade offs among the three sectors in ca and the largest share of unclassified relationships accounting for 54 of all relationships reflecting the inconsistent trends of change in the wef indicators furthermore at the country scale the shares of the synergies were larger than those of the trade offs in kazakhstan and turkmenistan while the opposite was the case in kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan figs 8 and 9 respectively in kazakhstan w1 and f1 attained larger shares of trade offs with another indicator than of synergies suggesting that progress in w1 and f1 poses a potential threat to wef security and sustainable development although kazakhstan contains the largest available water resources in ca the freshwater resources per capita w1 are at the intermediate level with population growth and a growing demand for water in the energy and food sectors the negative effect of water resources could be considerable note that the quantity of the food supply f1 exhibited a continuing downward trend in kazakhstan which could be affected by food policy and dietary habits in kyrgyzstan the energy sector showed unclassified relationships in terms of both the water and food sectors suggesting that the energy sector did not provide adequate support to the water and food sector over the past few years although kyrgyzstan has a high potential for hydroelectricity generation it contains the smallest amount of fossil fuels in ca and the residential sector currently accounts for the largest share of electricity meyer et al 2019 rakhmatullaev et al 2018 as a result the energy sector hinders the sustainability of the water and food sectors in kyrgyzstan between the water and food sectors there was a larger share of trade offs than of synergies in kyrgyzstan which reflects the unmatched relationships between water and land resources kyrgyzstan contains the smallest cultivable area with the lowest ratio of cultivable area to total land area in the asb zhang et al 2019a in contrast kyrgyzstan possesses sufficient water resources limited land resources impede maximizing the utilization of water resources in tajikistan the share of trade offs was slightly larger than that of synergies the wef security degrees relationships and related rationales in tajikistan are comparable to those in kyrgyzstan as an upstream country in the asb the cultivable area and ratio of cultivable area to total area in tajikistan are slightly greater than those in kyrgyzstan zhang et al 2019a moreover we observed that most of the indicators attained nearly equal shares of trade offs and synergies with another indicator and e4 and f2 exhibited unclassified relationships with almost all other wef security indicators hence there is great potential for synchronous development of the three sectors in turkmenistan there was a larger share of synergies than of trade offs among the three sectors however in the water sector the share of trade offs was larger than that of synergies indicating that the water crisis was a great challenge to wef security turkmenistan contains the smallest amount of water resources per capita and experiences high water stress zhang et al 2020 meyer et al 2019 in contrast in the asb the cultivable area of turkmenistan is at the intermediate level zhang et al 2019a furthermore turkmenistan contains the most abundant fossil fuels there are poor matching relationships among water cultivable area and energy resources the water sector poses a threat to energy and food security although uzbekistan attained a slightly larger share of trade offs than of synergies it displayed the largest share of unclassified relationships among the five central asian countries furthermore w2 e2 e4 f1 and f2 revealed unclassified relationships with almost all other wef security indicators therefore the positive and negative mutual relationships of the wef security indicators are not significant in uzbekistan there is an urgent need to integrate the management of the three sectors in uzbekistan 5 discussion 5 1 possible factors inhibiting wef security and security in the three sectors the shares of wef synergies and trade offs were smaller than those of unclassified relationships in the ca countries from 2000 to 2014 figs 8 and 9 respectively until recently the three sectors have provided little support for each other which indicates that the security in these three sectors does not exhibit a significant synchronized increasing trend although we cannot gain insights into wef security from the perspective of interactions we can identify the factors that possibly inhibit sustainable wef development in the three sectors by analysing the relationships between the wef indicator scores and associated sector security degrees throughout 2000 2014 in this investigation i e using entropy weights and topsis rather than decision maker preferences the greatest wef security challenges involved the water sector in turkmenistan and uzbekistan fig 10 a consistent with a lack of water resources in both countries zuo et al 2020 however in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan there was an urgent need to improve the performance of the energy and food sectors jalilov et al 2016 furthermore considering the water sector fig 10b although tajikistan and kyrgyzstan attained the two highest levels of freshwater resources per capita the water security in these two countries was mainly limited by the following factors water accessibility w4 and water use efficiency w3 chen et al 2020 fao 2018a both turkmenistan and uzbekistan were negatively influenced by indicators w1 w2 and w3 fao 2018a fao 2018b zuo et al 2020 moreover due to the lack of safely managed drinking water services uzbekistan exhibited low water accessibility w4 with a security score of 0 41 regarding the energy sector fig 10c energy availability e1 and self sufficiency e2 constrained energy sustainability in kyrgyzstan with security scores of 0 24 and 0 01 respectively the availability of energy e1 with a score of 0 005 posed a threat to energy security in tajikistan the availability e1 and productivity e3 of energy imposed a negative influence on energy sustainability in uzbekistan with security scores of 0 42 and 0 13 respectively interestingly although turkmenistan is globally an important natural gas producing and exporting country energy sustainability is constrained by a low energy productivity e3 with a score of 0 40 considering the food sector fig 10d the food supply quantity f1 continuously decreased from 2000 to 2014 which poses a potential threat to food sustainability in kazakhstan self sufficiency with respect to food f2 was the most negative indicator of food sustainability in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan with security scores of 0 30 and 0 respectively due to limited land resources in contrast although f2 also threatened food security in turkmenistan and uzbekistan the food insecurity in these two countries was mainly attributed to insufficient water resources for irrigation and consequent low food production zhang et al 2020 5 2 wef security patterns wef security patterns are the integrated results of the available resources management performance technology level and relationships among the three sectors these factors and associated wef security indicators can be classified as either natural or socioeconomic factors table 1 there are strong correlations between the income level and wef security and the sdgs with international trade good management performance and advanced technology developed countries can significantly improve their sustainable development levels gain et al 2016 xu et al 2020b in general developed countries exhibit higher levels of sustainable development related to the three sectors than developing countries gain et al 2016 wada and bierkens 2014 we find that both the gross domestic product gdp and per capita gdp of kazakhstan are the highest among the five central asian countries which is consistent with wef security being the highest in kazakhstan in contrast the gdp and per capita gdp in tajikistan are the lowest along with its wef security uzbekistan attains the second lowest wef security level but the gdp and per capita gdp in uzbekistan are the second and third highest respectively in ca we observe that sustainable water and energy development levels are low in uzbekistan for instance the water stress level is the highest in uzbekistan across ca in addition the water use efficiency in uzbekistan has decreased over the past few years chen et al 2020 this investigation aimed to identify the negative factors that are considered obstacles to wef security in ca synthesizing the above results figs 8 10 we classified the wef security patterns as water constrained energy constrained food constrained water energy constrained water food constrained energy food constrained and water energy food constrained furthermore based on the group of critical indicators table 1 we revealed the wef security patterns from the perspective of natural and socioeconomic factors as indicated in table 5 we conclude that the water sector is the critical sector of wef security in ca in general the water crisis is an obstacle to sustainable development in ca even in water rich countries on the natural side the total available freshwater resources are the constraining factor on wef security in turkmenistan and uzbekistan however in the upstream countries of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan the wef security patterns are energy food constrained on the socioeconomic side the wef security patterns in kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan are food constrained and water food constrained respectively turkmenistan attains a low security degree in both the water and energy sectors tajikistan has the potential for integrated management of the three sectors on both the natural and socioeconomic sides the wef security patterns in uzbekistan are water energy food constrained which suggests that the most effort is required for wef sustainable development in uzbekistan the previous paragraphs highlight that natural factors pose a great challenge for wef security in ca regarding the natural conditions of resources wef security could be improved by negotiating the water allocation and energy supply amounts between the upstream and downstream countries in the asb jalilov et al 2016 regarding socioeconomic aspects there remains great potential to improve the overall wef sustainability score via international trade good management performance and advanced technology especially in kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan 5 3 uncertainties and limitations although the 12 selected indicators demonstrate wef security to a large extent some uncertainties need to be clarified table 2 first due to data unavailability some indicators may not capture all aspects of wef security we do not consider unconventional water resources due to missing or few data this may underestimate the water availability w1 water loss is difficult to calculate accurately but it may increase water withdrawal and reduce water self sufficiency w2 access to water w4 may be overestimated because access to agricultural and industrial water is not considered food availability f1 may have some uncertainties because we focus on cereals second wef security is a complicated system problem to increase the applicability and reproducibility of the introduced framework we make several assumptions and simplifications although e1 represents the real availability of primary energy in the past potential fossil and renewable energy may enhance energy availability in the future meyer et al 2019 energy and food self sufficiency e2 and f2 may be overestimated since consumption may not be entirely equal to real demand energy and food accessibility e4 and f4 may be overestimated as we assume that everyone could afford energy and food moreover the electricity supply guarantee rate may also undermine access to electricity third we focus on wef security for sustainable development but do not pay much attention to the environment and ecology water and energy productivity w3 and e3 do not consider environmental and ecological costs associated with water and energy use this situation is consistent with food production f3 environmental and ecological extensions are beyond the scope of this study despite the abovementioned uncertainties the indicator system captures key aspects of wef security at the country level table 2 and systematically evaluates the degree of wef security furthermore the developed framework faces certain limitations although correlation analysis illustrates the relationships among the wef security indicators causality is not determined putra et al 2020 in addition we classify wef security patterns from the perspective of natural and socioeconomic factors but the contributions of these two factors are not quantified due to the complex interactions between the natural conditions of resources and human activities 6 conclusions in this study we proposed a hybrid framework involving topsis spearman s rank correlation and radar graphs to analyse wef security and the corresponding relationships this approach was applied in the five central asian countries to better understand wef security and sustainable development at the country scale our results indicated that wef security and the degree of security in the three sectors exhibited steady trends continuous increasing and decreasing trends and fluctuating increasing and decreasing trends within the five ca countries moreover the water sector was the most critical variable regarding wef security in ca which was verified by the fact that water insecurity poses a threat not only to upstream water resource rich countries tajikistan and kyrgyzstan but also to downstream water resource poor countries turkmenistan uzbekistan and kazakhstan furthermore the wef crisis in the asb is a major issue in ca the potential utilization of hydropower is a beneficial method to ensure energy security in the upstream countries of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan but this may result in a water and food crisis in kazakhstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan moreover sustainable wef development is a goal associated with a whole country and should be addressed at the country scale therefore integrative wef research at the country and basin scales should be conducted to gain insights into the wef security and nexus mechanisms and to achieve win win cooperation among the asb countries data availability data used in this study are publicly available from the websites

3568,rainfall partitioning by plant canopies can play key roles in dryland ecohydrology by altering the amount timing and patterns of water receipt to soils here we synthesized interception throughfall and stemflow observations from 2 297 rainfall events across 40 dryland sites including 48 plant species then we developed general empirical models able to predict the response of rainfall partitioning into interception throughfall and stemflow as a function of rainfall event size considering different functional factors life form bark type twelve linear models explained significant variability across all synthesized observations in all cases interception throughfall and stemflow linearly increased as a function of rainfall event size with slope ranges of 0 149 0 174 mm of interception per mm of rainfall 0 776 0 829 mm of throughfall per mm of rainfall and 0 026 0 063 mm of stemflow per mm of rainfall on the one hand shrubs and rough barked species presented more interception than trees and smooth barked species respectively on the other hand shrubs and smooth barked species presented less throughfall than trees and rough barked species respectively finally shrubs and smooth barked species presented more stemflow than trees and rough barked species respectively our models confirm the scientific evidence found so far by other global meta analyses but also allow us to explore the partitioning of rainfall against different scenarios our findings can be useful to help to predict and manage ecohydrological change in water limited ecosystems in the context of shifting vegetation cover and climate conditions keywords arid desertification ecohydrology fertility islands net primary productivity water limited environments 1 introduction drylands occur where limited precipitation represents the main control of primary production and its myriad of associated ecological and economic processes newman et al 2006 schimel 2010 drylands represent a major growing portion from 41 to 45 of the global land surface as a consequence of the recent concomitant reduction in rainfall inputs and increase of atmospheric moisture demand by neighboring sub humid regions feng and fu 2013 huang et al 2016 prăvălie 2016 dryland expansion has also been accompanied by inward structural changes such as the replacement of native species by monospecific crops encroachment or livestock intensification all of which pose additional threats to sustaining net primary production in these ecosystems lal 2004 zika and erb 2009 bestelmeyer et al 2015 the ecohydrology of drylands and its link with primary production rates and partitioning e g across life forms or above and below ground is becoming increasingly important for effective rangeland management by scientific management and policy communities newman et al 2006 wilcox and thurow 2006 particularly as rangeland degradation continues to progress in a significant portion of the world s semiarid regions reynolds et al 2007 primary production and water fluxes in drylands especially in those regions where groundwater is not available by roots have as their master control the portion of rainfall that effectively

topography antecedent moisture braud et al 2003 wilcox et al 2003 ludwig et al 2005 fig 1 as a result of these interactions a portion of rainfall is evaporated as interception a net water loss from the surface while the rest of the rainwater reaches the topsoil along two pathways directly through gaps and or by dripping through the canopy as throughfall or by flowing to the surface in contact with plant bark all the way down to the plant base as stemflow magliano et al 2019b cortés et al 2020 net rainfall beneath vegetation is therefore the sum of throughfall and stemflow both fluxes depending on the amount of storage and evaporation in the litter layer gerrits and savenije 2011 may also be considered the effective rainfall because they represent the fraction of rainfall that can be effectively transpired by vegetation huxman et al 2004 dunkerley 2021 so far rainfall partitioning into interception throughfall and stemflow has been largely explored for isolated plant species and or specific sites making it difficult not only to identify general patterns but also to integrate datasets with consistent predictive power however recent global reviews and meta analyses showed three important patterns that help us to understand some key rainfall partitioning aspects firstly meta analyses of precipitation partitioning by plant canopies across the globe suggest that interception throughfall and stemflow can vary substantially depending on plant type i e tree shrub crop grass and canopy morphology sadeghi et al 2020 yue et al 2021 secondly drylands present higher stemflow amounts and lower throughfall amounts than other vegetated ecosystems qualls 2020 sadeghi et al 2020 mainly caused by the higher proportion of shrubs which have high specific rates of stemflow generation than trees magliano et al 2019a finally a large number of invasive species generate relatively more stemflow than native ones co occurring in the same ecoregion whitworth hulse et al 2021 although these recent meta analyses provided a general perspective of the relative proportions of rainfall partitioning fluxes they did not generate models or equations with consistent predictive power needed to explore rainfall partitioning under different current and projected scenarios in this paper we generated a global database of 2 297 rainfall events that occurred at 40 different dryland sites around the world including 48 plant species based on these data we developed general empirical models that are able to predict how rainfall partitioning into interception throughfall and stemflow responds to rainfall event size considering different functional factors life form bark type 2 materials and methods we generated a global dataset based on scientific articles that met the following criteria first rainfall partitioning data was obtained from field experiments modeled or estimated values were not considered and measurements were reported per event and as water thickness mm or inches event 1 we did not try to convert or calculate values expressed as proportions or volume with no areal reference we only used the initial raw data before any transformation by the authors second field experiments used the same methodology which involved stemflow measured with helicoidally or cylindrical collars throughfall measured with gauge collectors at the soil surface and interception as the difference between rainfall and stemflow plus throughfall zhang et al 2015 third study sites were located in drylands defined by rainfall to potential evapotranspiration ratios 0 65 unep 1997 trabucco and zomer 2009 fig 2 fourth publications presented graphic or tabular data of rainfall partitioning for individual rainfall events and for individual plant species multi specific stands where rainfall partition could not be attributed to a single species were not considered fifth only papers published in peer reviewed journals in english language were considered after the selection and filtering processes 40 papers were retained to construct the database table 1 to minimize human transcription errors a data extraction software was used to extract the information from figures tummers 2006 extracted data were checked with 450 values corresponding to magliano et al 2019 whitworth hulse et al 2020 and cortés et al 2020 for which the authors have the original data on average the error was 1 for each species at each study site we extracted the values of interception throughfall and stemflow at each rainfall event then we classified each plant species according to its life form shrubs or trees and its bark type rough or smooth these classifications were based on the missouri botanical garden www missouribotanicalgarden org identification guide for the wild trees of the canary archipelago http www arbolappcanarias es and efloras http www efloras org botanical databases in those cases where the species bark type is smooth in the early stages and becomes rough with time e g some artemisia and larrea species we used the information provided by the authors or other publications focused on those species in similar sites models were constructed using generalized least squares gls we opted for this technique because the raw data presented heterogeneity in the variance of residuals gls was used to determine the effect of the explanatory variable rainfall events on each response variable amount of interception throughfall and stemflow for each factor life form shrub and tree and bark type smooth and rough statistical analyses were performed using r v 4 0 2 r core team 2020 and the packages nlme pinheiro et al 2014 ggplot2 ggeffects and nagelkerke were used all analyses were used restricted maximum likelihood reml tests with a significance level of 1 the models fitted included a variance structure i e varconstpower varpower to account for the heteroscedasticity observed in the residuals the best fitting model was selected with the optimum model being the one that presented the lowest akaike information criterion value akaike 1974 statistical differences between models were tested for using anova with a significance level of 1 models were constructed with the raw data reported in all the publications listed in table 1 except for ligustrum lucidum whitworth hulse et al 2020 and acacia aneura pressland 1976 regarding the life form factor l lucidum is classified as a shrub by the databases consulted and other papers fernandez et al 2020 but in the specific conditions of the site where the authors developed the study it develops a tree form a aneura can be considered as a tree but its data also presented a statistically different behavior once developed model validation was performed using the bootstrap method zuur et al 2009 for each model 100 iterations were developed and the same values of the parameters generated with the gls were obtained as a result the standard errors of validation did not statistically differ from 0 assuming a significance level of 0 01 3 results interception throughfall and stemflow linearly increased as a function of rainfall event size considering life form and bark type factors fig 3 and table 2 interception displayed slopes from 0 149 to 0 174 mm of interception per mm of rainfall in this case shrubs and rough barked species presented more interception losses than trees and smooth barked species respectively p 0 01 in both cases throughfall displayed slopes from 0 776 to 0 829 mm of throughfall per mm of rainfall in this case shrubs and smooth barked species presented less throughfall than trees and rough barked species respectively p 0 01 in both cases stemflow was the most variable flux displaying slopes from 0 026 to 0 063 mm of stemflow per mm of rainfall in this case shrubs and smooth barked species presented more stemflow than trees and rough barked species respectively p 0 01 in both cases the twelve general models presented statistical differences in their slopes table 2 although the interception with the y axis was statistically different from zero in almost all models their values were very low so in terms of ecological or hydrological implications these models can be reduced to the slope β of the function and its associated standard error se in addition the overall mass balance has not been conserved for the sum of the three fluxes since the models included data from some reports that did not measure the three fluxes on the same species 4 discussion rainfall partitioning by vegetation is an important control of primary production and the rest of the water fluxes in drylands here we developed twelve models that synthesize rainfall partitioning into interception throughfall and stemflow based on 2 297 rainfall events comprising a widespread sample of the global drylands fig 3 table 2 our results suggested that interception throughfall and stemflow are controlled by rainfall event size and by biotic factors such as life form and bark type as well these findings can be incorporated into the current body of dryland ecohydrological theories such as the island fertility paradigm and can also have practical implications that may allow scientists to enhance modeling predictions although there is a general consensus about the positive linear relationship between throughfall and rainfall event size xiao et al 2000 eliades et al 2018 cheng et al 2020 interception and stemflow fluxes can display different relationships in the case of interception whitworth hulse et al 2020 and dong et al 2020 found a logarithmic and polynomial relationship respectively between interception and rainfall event size in both non linear relations proportionally high and low interception values can be found for smaller and larger rainfall events respectively the non linear relationship can respond to the canopy wetting process i e canopy storage capacity that takes place at the beginning of rainfall events and represents a large part of small rainfall events in this sense interception results in a difficult flux to quantify with high precision because it is usually estimated indirectly as the difference of gross rainfall and net rainfall i e the sum of throughfall and stemflow and net rainfall values are often underestimated zhang et al 2015 shachnovich et al 2008 in our study linear relationship between interception and rainfall events could be explained due to multiple species and sites were mixed and overlapping nonlinear clouds of varying shapes tend to obscure nonlinearities furthermore the known nonlinearity is strongest in the small events but the model fits are dominated by large events where there is near linearity in the case of stemflow livesley et al 2014 and yang et al 2008 found exponential relationships between stemflow and rainfall event size while li et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 and navar 1999 found a linear relationship but with a threshold to start stemflow generation in our study no general stemflow threshold could be detected more generally it is important to mention that our linear general models presented in table 2 can be masking individual non linear effects of some specific species and sites stemflow has been studied in 558 papers worldwide presenting a median global value of 2 2 2 7 of rainfall inputs sadeghi et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 but increasing towards dry sites magliano et al 2019a sadeghi et al 2020 in drylands the combination of high values of stemflow and root induced preferential flow a process commonly described as double funneling johnson and lehmann 2006 could be a critical mechanism that maximizes the flow of water close to roots in deeper soil layers providing an adaptative advantage to survive in water stressed periods reynolds et al 1999 in line with this previous studies found that shrubs have more stemflow than trees yang and wei 2019 yue et al 2021 and smooth barked species have more stemflow than rough ones whitworth hulse et al 2021 our results confirm these global patterns fig 3 table 2 but also are able to predict stemflow or more general rainfall partitioning for different scenarios in other words they are able to predict the response of hypothetical situations e g climate change predictions in different parts of the globe and for different species understanding water entering into the soil has been one of the most important issues in drylands due to it being a strong control of evapotranspiration flux that directly affects net primary production vivoni et al 2021 nosetto et al 2020 because of the importance that spatial scale displays in vegetation and soil conditions in drylands hydrological models specifically developed for these sites operate in small cells e g 1 m2 communicated by runoff and runon fluxes beeson et al 2001 wang et al 2011a however common scientifically accepted hydrological models for example hydrus 2d skaggs et al 2004 splash urgeghe et al 2010 or crest wang et al 2011a do not consider rainfall partitioning into interception throughfall and stemflow to predict water reaching the soil surface they only consider interception losses as a threshold of each rainfall event depending on the leaf area index of vegetation our linear models can be incorporated into these complex hydrological models to enhance the prediction and accuracy of water reaching soil surface where i each cell can be affected by the specific model depending on the vegetation characteristics e g shrubs trees or smooth rough bark and ii rainfall partitioning will be affected by the size of rainfall event 5 conclusions this study based on a global database of 2 297 rainfall events that took place at 40 different dry sites around the world found that interception throughfall and stemflow amounts linearly increased as a function of rainfall event size shrubs and rough barked species presented more interception losses than trees and smooth barked species respectively shrubs and smooth barked species presented less throughfall but more stemflow than trees and rough barked species respectively this study presented for the first time general regression models that globally summarize the information of all the species for which the rainfall partition has been quantified based on field data these models can be useful to improve

topography antecedent moisture braud et al 2003 wilcox et al 2003 ludwig et al 2005 fig 1 as a result of these interactions a portion of rainfall is evaporated as interception a net water loss from the surface while the rest of the rainwater reaches the topsoil along two pathways directly through gaps and or by dripping through the canopy as throughfall or by flowing to the surface in contact with plant bark all the way down to the plant base as stemflow magliano et al 2019b cortés et al 2020 net rainfall beneath vegetation is therefore the sum of throughfall and stemflow both fluxes depending on the amount of storage and evaporation in the litter layer gerrits and savenije 2011 may also be considered the effective rainfall because they represent the fraction of rainfall that can be effectively transpired by vegetation huxman et al 2004 dunkerley 2021 so far rainfall partitioning into interception throughfall and stemflow has been largely explored for isolated plant species and or specific sites making it difficult not only to identify general patterns but also to integrate datasets with consistent predictive power however recent global reviews and meta analyses showed three important patterns that help us to understand some key rainfall partitioning aspects firstly meta analyses of precipitation partitioning by plant canopies across the globe suggest that interception throughfall and stemflow can vary substantially depending on plant type i e tree shrub crop grass and canopy morphology sadeghi et al 2020 yue et al 2021 secondly drylands present higher stemflow amounts and lower throughfall amounts than other vegetated ecosystems qualls 2020 sadeghi et al 2020 mainly caused by the higher proportion of shrubs which have high specific rates of stemflow generation than trees magliano et al 2019a finally a large number of invasive species generate relatively more stemflow than native ones co occurring in the same ecoregion whitworth hulse et al 2021 although these recent meta analyses provided a general perspective of the relative proportions of rainfall partitioning fluxes they did not generate models or equations with consistent predictive power needed to explore rainfall partitioning under different current and projected scenarios in this paper we generated a global database of 2 297 rainfall events that occurred at 40 different dryland sites around the world including 48 plant species based on these data we developed general empirical models that are able to predict how rainfall partitioning into interception throughfall and stemflow responds to rainfall event size considering different functional factors life form bark type 2 materials and methods we generated a global dataset based on scientific articles that met the following criteria first rainfall partitioning data was obtained from field experiments modeled or estimated values were not considered and measurements were reported per event and as water thickness mm or inches event 1 we did not try to convert or calculate values expressed as proportions or volume with no areal reference we only used the initial raw data before any transformation by the authors second field experiments used the same methodology which involved stemflow measured with helicoidally or cylindrical collars throughfall measured with gauge collectors at the soil surface and interception as the difference between rainfall and stemflow plus throughfall zhang et al 2015 third study sites were located in drylands defined by rainfall to potential evapotranspiration ratios 0 65 unep 1997 trabucco and zomer 2009 fig 2 fourth publications presented graphic or tabular data of rainfall partitioning for individual rainfall events and for individual plant species multi specific stands where rainfall partition could not be attributed to a single species were not considered fifth only papers published in peer reviewed journals in english language were considered after the selection and filtering processes 40 papers were retained to construct the database table 1 to minimize human transcription errors a data extraction software was used to extract the information from figures tummers 2006 extracted data were checked with 450 values corresponding to magliano et al 2019 whitworth hulse et al 2020 and cortés et al 2020 for which the authors have the original data on average the error was 1 for each species at each study site we extracted the values of interception throughfall and stemflow at each rainfall event then we classified each plant species according to its life form shrubs or trees and its bark type rough or smooth these classifications were based on the missouri botanical garden www missouribotanicalgarden org identification guide for the wild trees of the canary archipelago http www arbolappcanarias es and efloras http www efloras org botanical databases in those cases where the species bark type is smooth in the early stages and becomes rough with time e g some artemisia and larrea species we used the information provided by the authors or other publications focused on those species in similar sites models were constructed using generalized least squares gls we opted for this technique because the raw data presented heterogeneity in the variance of residuals gls was used to determine the effect of the explanatory variable rainfall events on each response variable amount of interception throughfall and stemflow for each factor life form shrub and tree and bark type smooth and rough statistical analyses were performed using r v 4 0 2 r core team 2020 and the packages nlme pinheiro et al 2014 ggplot2 ggeffects and nagelkerke were used all analyses were used restricted maximum likelihood reml tests with a significance level of 1 the models fitted included a variance structure i e varconstpower varpower to account for the heteroscedasticity observed in the residuals the best fitting model was selected with the optimum model being the one that presented the lowest akaike information criterion value akaike 1974 statistical differences between models were tested for using anova with a significance level of 1 models were constructed with the raw data reported in all the publications listed in table 1 except for ligustrum lucidum whitworth hulse et al 2020 and acacia aneura pressland 1976 regarding the life form factor l lucidum is classified as a shrub by the databases consulted and other papers fernandez et al 2020 but in the specific conditions of the site where the authors developed the study it develops a tree form a aneura can be considered as a tree but its data also presented a statistically different behavior once developed model validation was performed using the bootstrap method zuur et al 2009 for each model 100 iterations were developed and the same values of the parameters generated with the gls were obtained as a result the standard errors of validation did not statistically differ from 0 assuming a significance level of 0 01 3 results interception throughfall and stemflow linearly increased as a function of rainfall event size considering life form and bark type factors fig 3 and table 2 interception displayed slopes from 0 149 to 0 174 mm of interception per mm of rainfall in this case shrubs and rough barked species presented more interception losses than trees and smooth barked species respectively p 0 01 in both cases throughfall displayed slopes from 0 776 to 0 829 mm of throughfall per mm of rainfall in this case shrubs and smooth barked species presented less throughfall than trees and rough barked species respectively p 0 01 in both cases stemflow was the most variable flux displaying slopes from 0 026 to 0 063 mm of stemflow per mm of rainfall in this case shrubs and smooth barked species presented more stemflow than trees and rough barked species respectively p 0 01 in both cases the twelve general models presented statistical differences in their slopes table 2 although the interception with the y axis was statistically different from zero in almost all models their values were very low so in terms of ecological or hydrological implications these models can be reduced to the slope β of the function and its associated standard error se in addition the overall mass balance has not been conserved for the sum of the three fluxes since the models included data from some reports that did not measure the three fluxes on the same species 4 discussion rainfall partitioning by vegetation is an important control of primary production and the rest of the water fluxes in drylands here we developed twelve models that synthesize rainfall partitioning into interception throughfall and stemflow based on 2 297 rainfall events comprising a widespread sample of the global drylands fig 3 table 2 our results suggested that interception throughfall and stemflow are controlled by rainfall event size and by biotic factors such as life form and bark type as well these findings can be incorporated into the current body of dryland ecohydrological theories such as the island fertility paradigm and can also have practical implications that may allow scientists to enhance modeling predictions although there is a general consensus about the positive linear relationship between throughfall and rainfall event size xiao et al 2000 eliades et al 2018 cheng et al 2020 interception and stemflow fluxes can display different relationships in the case of interception whitworth hulse et al 2020 and dong et al 2020 found a logarithmic and polynomial relationship respectively between interception and rainfall event size in both non linear relations proportionally high and low interception values can be found for smaller and larger rainfall events respectively the non linear relationship can respond to the canopy wetting process i e canopy storage capacity that takes place at the beginning of rainfall events and represents a large part of small rainfall events in this sense interception results in a difficult flux to quantify with high precision because it is usually estimated indirectly as the difference of gross rainfall and net rainfall i e the sum of throughfall and stemflow and net rainfall values are often underestimated zhang et al 2015 shachnovich et al 2008 in our study linear relationship between interception and rainfall events could be explained due to multiple species and sites were mixed and overlapping nonlinear clouds of varying shapes tend to obscure nonlinearities furthermore the known nonlinearity is strongest in the small events but the model fits are dominated by large events where there is near linearity in the case of stemflow livesley et al 2014 and yang et al 2008 found exponential relationships between stemflow and rainfall event size while li et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 and navar 1999 found a linear relationship but with a threshold to start stemflow generation in our study no general stemflow threshold could be detected more generally it is important to mention that our linear general models presented in table 2 can be masking individual non linear effects of some specific species and sites stemflow has been studied in 558 papers worldwide presenting a median global value of 2 2 2 7 of rainfall inputs sadeghi et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 but increasing towards dry sites magliano et al 2019a sadeghi et al 2020 in drylands the combination of high values of stemflow and root induced preferential flow a process commonly described as double funneling johnson and lehmann 2006 could be a critical mechanism that maximizes the flow of water close to roots in deeper soil layers providing an adaptative advantage to survive in water stressed periods reynolds et al 1999 in line with this previous studies found that shrubs have more stemflow than trees yang and wei 2019 yue et al 2021 and smooth barked species have more stemflow than rough ones whitworth hulse et al 2021 our results confirm these global patterns fig 3 table 2 but also are able to predict stemflow or more general rainfall partitioning for different scenarios in other words they are able to predict the response of hypothetical situations e g climate change predictions in different parts of the globe and for different species understanding water entering into the soil has been one of the most important issues in drylands due to it being a strong control of evapotranspiration flux that directly affects net primary production vivoni et al 2021 nosetto et al 2020 because of the importance that spatial scale displays in vegetation and soil conditions in drylands hydrological models specifically developed for these sites operate in small cells e g 1 m2 communicated by runoff and runon fluxes beeson et al 2001 wang et al 2011a however common scientifically accepted hydrological models for example hydrus 2d skaggs et al 2004 splash urgeghe et al 2010 or crest wang et al 2011a do not consider rainfall partitioning into interception throughfall and stemflow to predict water reaching the soil surface they only consider interception losses as a threshold of each rainfall event depending on the leaf area index of vegetation our linear models can be incorporated into these complex hydrological models to enhance the prediction and accuracy of water reaching soil surface where i each cell can be affected by the specific model depending on the vegetation characteristics e g shrubs trees or smooth rough bark and ii rainfall partitioning will be affected by the size of rainfall event 5 conclusions this study based on a global database of 2 297 rainfall events that took place at 40 different dry sites around the world found that interception throughfall and stemflow amounts linearly increased as a function of rainfall event size shrubs and rough barked species presented more interception losses than trees and smooth barked species respectively shrubs and smooth barked species presented less throughfall but more stemflow than trees and rough barked species respectively this study presented for the first time general regression models that globally summarize the information of all the species for which the rainfall partition has been quantified based on field data these models can be useful to improve

3569,the long term changes in composition and export of particulate organic carbon poc by rivers due to dam construction are poorly known based on observations incubation experiments and modelling this study analyzed the sources spatial and temporal distribution and annual export of poc in the changjiang river during recent decades to explore the poc changes due to dam construction changes in poc composition resulted from both increasing poc sequestration and carbon fixation in the river basin the allochthonous poc from terrestrial input export by the changjiang river to its estuary decreased by 90 between 1956 and 2002 and 2013 2019 we estimated that 2 3 0 5 mt c yr allochthonous poc has been sequestered in the changjiang watershed since 2013 the autochthonous entirely from in stream riverine primary production contribution increased from 1 to 55 of total poc export during the same period due to improved light transparency caused by decreased sediment discharge global poc trapping in nine large rivers strongly impacted by dams is 12 of the global riverine poc export the reduced poc export and increase in labile autochthonous poc strongly impact the estuarine carbon cycle therefore with continued dam construction in the future important changes in the riverine and estuarine carbon cycle can be expected keywords particulate organic carbon carbon source changjiang

with approximately 10 50 of total poc poctot being labile and the complement more resistant to degradation pocres fabre et al 2019 ittekkot and laane 1991 li et al 2015 anthropogenic perturbations such as dam construction water diversion sand mining and land use change in river basins have substantially changed the poc delivery to inland waters and its export to coastal waters butman et al 2015 catalán et al 2016 dean and gorham 1998 maavara et al 2017 regnier et al 2013 walling 2006 dams may have an important impact on poc export li et al 2015 maavara et al 2017 mendonça et al 2012 mulholland and elwood 1982 by increasing the travel time of water by promoting sedimentation and thus interrupting the transport of poc battin et al 2009 dean and gorham 1998 stallard 1998 and by enhancing primary production in reservoirs mendonça et al 2012 such changes of riverine poc flux and composition have important impacts on the ecology of coastal waters especially in estuaries bauer et al 2013 many global large rivers experienced a marked decrease of suspended sediment discharge walling and fang 2003 walling 2011 some rivers like the yellow river indus river and krishna river show a progressive decline of sediment and water discharge after the construction of large dams rao et al 2010 walling 2011 wang et al 2016 this combined reduction in sediment and water discharge may also be related to water diversion and climatic change also play vital roles kong et al 2015 milliman et al 1984a zhang et al 2017 other rivers including the changjiang red chao phraya godavari mississippi danube and pearl rivers have experienced a decrease of sediment load without significant decrease in annual runoff during the past decades das et al 2021 meade and moody 2010 vinh et al 2014 wu et al 2019 previous studies show that the reduction in sediment discharge due to damming in the red chao phraya godavari mississippi danube and pearl rivers fall into the range of 60 80 das et al 2021 keown et al 1986 le et al 2007 walling 2006 walling 2011 wu et al 2012 which is less than in the changjiang river basin up to 99 yang et al 2018 therefore the changjiang river could be regarded as a typical example to explore the impact of river damming on poc export from rivers to the sea the changjiang river yangtze river is the third largest river in the world with respect to discharge with a considerable contribution to the global material flux from land to the oceans chetelat et al 2008 milliman and meade 1983 viers et al 2008 rapid dam construction in the changjiang

yang et al 2018 as a consequence the total suspended sediment tss export from the changjiang river has decreased since the 1970 s chen et al 2008 yang et al 2011 with a sharp decline after the closure of the three gorges dam tgd and filling of the three gorges reservoir tgr in 2003 yang et al 2007 in 2012 the completion of cascade dams cds in jinshajiang river the headwater zone of the changjiang river basin stretching from wudongxi to xiangjiaba dams further increased the trapping of sediment li et al 2015 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2015 wu et al 2007 yang et al 2018 yu et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 however the effect of these different dams on the amount of poc trapping is poorly understood in this study we characterized poc tss and chlorophyll a chl a in the mainstream of the changjiang river to investigate the factors controlling the spatial distribution of poc delivery decomposition and transport along the river continuum incubation experiments were used to estimate decomposition rates of autochthonous poc monthly labile and recalcitrant poc fluxes c stable isotopes and tss variation close to the river mouth were analyzed to estimate different poc sources and their seasonal variability to understand the long term poc alteration due to damming we modelled the allochthonous supply autochthonous production and burial of poc in the whole changjiang river basin during the past 60 years finally comparisons were made with nine global rivers strongly impacted by reservoirs 2 methods 2 1 study area the changjiang river basin covers an area of 1 8 million km2 which is 20 of china s land area fig 1 the mountainous jinshajiang subbasin has relatively low temperatures and a dry climate while the middle and lower reaches mainly consist of fluvial plains with wet and warm climates chetelat et al 2008 the changjiang river downstream of datong about 500 km from the river mouth is influenced by the tidal range most of the changjiang river basin is dominated by the subtropical monsoon climate and 70 80 of rainfall and water and sediment discharge occur in the flood season from may to september the vegetation cover along the river is diverse and abundant yu et al

employed in this study include water sampling and incubation experiments to analyze decomposition rates and dissolution of c nitrate and phosphate and the analytical techniques to determine c and stable c isotope concentrations 2 2 1 sampling water samples were collected in april 2017 low flow season and july 2018 flood season at a range of stations 1 11 to obtain longitudinal profiles along the changjiang river fig 1 to study the seasonality monthly samples were taken at station 11 jiangyin in the lower reach of the changjiang river in 2013 2014 and 2018 2019 high turbidity can shrink the thickness of the photic zone cloern 1987 cole and cloern 1987 to make sure water samples come from the photic zone and avoid the pollution caused by vehicle emission all water samples were

autochthonous poc in the river channel were simulated at the spatial scale of ten sub basins and aggregated to the main stream divided into upstream midstream and downstream reach fig 1 soil erosion is a primary source of allochthonous poc in the changjiang river wang et al 2012 yu et al 2011 estimation of allochthonous poc was therefore based on soil erosion and associated oc contents in different soil types figure s1 table s1 the average soc content of each sub basin was calculated using the weighted average of soc contents in different soil types and their corresponding areas 1 soc

uncertainty at the 95 confidence level 3 results 3 1 observed poc concentrations and fluxes 3 1 1 spatial distribution of poc δ 13c chl a and tss along the changjiang river in april 2017 the tss concentration in the mainstream of the changjiang river ranged from 4 3 to 83 9 mg l 1 with an average value of 30 3 mg l 1 fig 2 the highest value occurred at station 1 located in the jinshajiang river along the river continuum the first low value of tss concentration occurred at station 2 downstream of the cds and the tss concentration gradually increased from station 2 to station 4 the head of three gorges reservoir the tss concentration reached the lowest value at station 6 and from there it gradually increased downstream along the river in august 2018 the tss concentration ranged between 17 and 191 mg l 1 and maintained a high level without clear differences between the stations in april 2017 the poctot content in the mainstream of the changjiang river ranged from 1 2 to 5 1 with an average of 2 5 high poctot contents observed at stations 2 and 6 correspond to low tss concentrations fig 2a in july 2018 the content of poctot averaged 1 3 and ranged from 0 9 to 2 1 the poc content was lower in july 2018 than in april 2017 at nearly all stations fig 2b the difference between the stations in the poctot content in july 2018 was small in april 2017 the δ 13ctot values varied from 27 60 to 24 70 with high values mainly at the upstream stations fig 2c however in july 2018 the range of δ 13ctot values was 32 15 26 63 fig 2d the chl a concentration in the changjiang river ranged between 3 7 and 9 3 µg l 1 in april 2017 and was much lower 0 06 2 64 µg l 1 in august 2018 fig 2e f the chl a concentration was generally higher in the low flow season than in the flood season the highest value in the low flow season was at station 5 in the upstream reach of the tgd the chl a concentration gradually increased downstream towards the estuary both in the flood and low flow season 3 1 2 seasonal variation in poc content δ 13c and tss in the lower reach of the changjiang river according to the monthly investigations during two hydrological periods from may 2013 to may 2014 and from may 2018 to august 2019 fig 3 a the poctot content in the downstream reach of the changjiang river ranged from 1 1 to 4 6 with an average of 2 4 fig 3b during the whole sampling period there was an inverse pattern between the monthly poctot content and water sediment discharge the observed δ 13ctot value ranged from 26 97 to 25 54 the pocres content varied from 0 3 to 1 5 with an average of 1 0 during the period from may 2018 to august 2019 the variation of the δ 13cres was small from 27 03 to 25 84 similar to that of the δ 13ctot fig 3c 3 1 3 poc export to coastal waters based on the monthly tss fluxes and poc contents in the downstream reach of the changjiang river we calculated the monthly poc fluxes of the changjiang river during 2013 2014 and 2018 2019 the monthly fluxes of poctot in the changjiang river ranged from 0 04 mt c month 1 to 0 8 mt c month 1 and were higher during the period may august table 1 similar to the monthly variations in the sediment flux the calculated annual fluxes of pocres during may 2018 to april 2019 and during september 2018 to august 2019 contributed 37 and 50 to the poctot fluxes of that year respectively 3 1 4 poc decomposition the poctot concentration decreased with time with a sharp drop from 96 µmol l 1 to 73 µmol l 1 in the first four days and a slow decrease afterwards fig 4 after the 15th day of incubation the poctot concentration was constant at 66 3 µmol l 1 close to the pocres concentration in jiangyin station 61 5 µmol l 1 the remineralization rate of poclabile was 7 6 µmol l 1 day 1 during the period from day 0 to day 4 and 0 67 µmol l 1 day 1 during days 5 15 the high correlation coefficients r 0 8 indicated that the loss rate of poclabile and the variation in po4 3 no3 and nh4 are strongly correlated on the basis of the declining of nh4 and poc and the parallel increase of po4 3 and no3 in the incubation experiment we calculated that the ratio of c poc n no3 nh4 p po4 3 for removed organic material ranged from 83 6 1 to 83 13 1 based on the incubation experiment we estimated a value of 0 14 for parameter k re for the rapid removal dissolution decomposition function in the changjiang river see equation 4 fig 4a 3 2 simulated and observed poctot inputs trapping and export the simulated average poctot flux sum of allochthonous and autochthonous poc at datong station is 2 7 0 7 mt c yr 1 during 1956 2002 fig 5 a this number decreased to 0 9 0 1 mt c yr 1 during 2003 2009 after 2010 the poctot flux at datong station was stable and increased by 20 relative to the average value of the period 2003 2009 with an average annual value of 1 1 0 2 mt c yr 1 due to declining allochthonous and increasing autochthonous poc comparison of the simulated poctot fluxes at datong station and observed poctot fluxes at datong and jiangyin stations fig 5a shows that the model properly describes the observed poctot fluxes before 2012 all fall into the 95 confidence interval and the spatial distribution of simulated chl a concentration in the mainstream is also consistent with the observations fig 5b the long term changes in the poc flux and its spatial distribution is related to changes of its composition and delivery patterns in the changjiang river during different historical periods fig 6 poctot trapping in the upstream reach increased from 2 to 5 before 2003 to 66 88 during the post tgd period since the autochthonous poc production further increased the proportion of autochthonous poc also increased before 2003 the fraction autochthonous of total poc was 2 in the whole river basin while this fraction increased to 10 13 25 27 and 26 41 in the upstream midstream and downstream reaches of the changjiang during the period 2003 2012 respectively poc transport from the jinshajiang subbasin decreased by 80 88 in the post cds period compared to the years between 2003 and 2012 the combined retention in tgd and cds aggravated the riverbed erosion intensity in the midstream reach poctot export from the whole river basin to coastal waters declined by 1 7 0 6 mt c yr 1 from 1956 to 2002 to 2013 2019 but also altered the poctot composition from allochthonous dominant to equal proportions of allochthonous and autochthonous poc observed ratios of poclabile poctot at jiangyin station during may 2018 to april 2019 63 and september 2018 to august 2019 50 table 1 are close to our simulated range of autochthonous poc poctot ratio 46 71 for the same period fig 6 and incubation experiments fig 4 3 3 simulated allochthonous and autochthonous poc 3 3 1 simulated allochthonous poc supply and trapping during the years prior to the tgd closure i e before 2003 the simulated allochthonous poc flux at yichang representing the outflow from the upstream reach hankou outflow from midstream to downstream and datong downstream stations fig 1 was 3 1 0 4 2 5 0 5 and 2 7 0 7 mt c yr 1 respectively about 97 of the allochthonous poc was transported from upstream to the mid and downstream reaches of the changjiang however the model suggests that after the tgd closure the allochthonous poc flux decreased by 89 82 and 75 at yichang hankou and datong stations respectively due to trapping in the tgr fig 7 according to the model the jinshajiang subbasin was the major source of allochthonous poc before 2012 due to its high sediment load and soc content dai and lu 2014 wu et al 2003 however after the operation of the cds in 2012 almost no allochthonous poc was exported from the xiangjiaba reservoir fig 7d as a consequence after 2012 large masses of allochthonous poc that would otherwise be trapped in the tgr were actually deposited upstream of the tgr the allochthonous poc fluxes at yichang hankou and datong stations further decreased by 70 48 and 43 respectively between the periods 2013 2019 and 2003 2012 fig 7a c the model results indicate that compared to the allochthonous poc flux during the period 1955 2003 on average approximately 85 2 3 0 5 mt c yr 1 of allochthonous poc has been trapped within the changjiang basin since 2013 3 3 2 simulated autochthonous poc supply after the closure of tgd in 2003 the annual total autochthonous poc load in the upstream midstream and downstream reaches increased by over 2 7 and 15 times compared with the average values for the period 1960 2002 respectively fig 8 a correspondingly the net autochthonous poc fluxes from the upstream midstream and downstream reaches increased from 0 02 0 02 and 0 02 mt c yr 1 during 1960 2002 to 0 04 0 13 and 0 30 mt c yr 1 after 2003 respectively fig 8b after 2013 the autochthonous poc production in the downstream reach of the changjiang river further increased by more than a factor of 20 compared to the average value before 2003 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 characterization of poc export from the changjiang river poc and tss flux are closely related fig 9 a and c a positive correlation between poc and tss flux is clear during the whole time period with two significant changes 1 poc fluxes decreased sharply after 2003 2 the poctot export flux from the changjiang river has increased during the recent decade as a result the proportion of poctot in sediment export gradually increased from 0 5 to 2 since 2003 fig 9b 4 1 1 decline of poc export our model results show that the longitudinal pattern of the simulated allochthonous poc was in line with that of the observed tss dai and lu 2014 wu et al 2003 fig 7a d the sediment discharge in the upstream and downstream reaches decreased by 96 and 74 in 2006 2017 compared to 1950 1985 respectively guo et al 2019 nearly all tss was trapped in the upstream reach after the operation of tgd and cds guo et al 2018 yang et al 2018 our model suggests that the rapidly decreasing allochthonous poc flux dominates the changes of poctot flux before and after 2003 in addition the high trapping efficiency in the upstream reach caused a decline of transport which induced a shift from a system with poc retention to one dominated by riverbed poc erosion in the midstream reach although riverbed erosion supplied 41 of the tss export from the midstream reach yang et al 2014 the re suspended poc flux only added 16 23 of the poctot export from the midstream to downstream reach due to the low poc content of sediment in the riverbed fig 6 4 1 2 increased poc tss ratio and autochthonous poc the poc content of tss generally decreases with increasing tss concentrations meybeck 1982a thurman 2012 due to dilution in water with high sediment loads and improved light transparency and production at low sediment loads this is also shown in the changjiang river to understand the change of the poc tss ratio we analyzed the differences in erosion intensity driven by different hydrological patterns the δ13ctot range in the flood season july 2018 fig 2d is more negative than the δ13ctot range in the low flow season april 2017 fig 2c and is within the δ13c range of c3 plants in the changjiang river basin fig 10 the δ13ctot range in the low flow season is consistent with the δ13c range of the overlap of c3 plants and primary production mixing and the higher chl a concentration is due to more primary production compared to the flood season fig 10 this indicates that higher soil erosion rates in the flood season lead to more allochthonous poc compared with the low flow season with a more strongly negative δ 13c signal stemming from terrestrial c3 plants higher turbidity fig 2 limits algal growth i e causes a decrease in autochthonous poc production in contrast a low erosion intensity would effectively enhance the production of autochthonous poc sullivan et al 2001 especially with near optimal temperature conditions in the low flow season in april garnier et al 1999 zhong et al 2016 however the comparison of the poc characteristics before and after reservoir filling indicates that damming has gradually become the dominant factor controlling water turbidity and poc according to the spatial distribution along the mainstream of changjiang river in different years the poctot contents of tss began to increase in the tgr area in the post tgd period after 2003 fig 11 a despite the sharp decrease from midstream to downstream in 2006 2008 and 2017 the poc tss ratio 1 7 in the downstream reach was still higher than that in 1993 and 2003 1 this indicates that the increasing poc tss ratio in the downstream reach is related to dam construction in the upstream reach in 2006 and 2017 the chl a poctot ratios in the midstream and downstream reaches are higher than those in 2003 fig 11c which indicates that the proportion of autochthonous poc increased in the midstream and downstream reaches after tgr filling moreover the c n p ratio obtained from the incubation experiment redfield 1963 zhang et al 2018 fig 4 the approximation of observed ratios of poclabile poctot at jiangyin station during may 2018 to august 2019 table 1 and the simulated autochthonous poc poctot ratio for the same period fig 6 all confirm that most of the labile poc is autochthonous poc in the changjiang river reservoirs prolong the water residence time create conditions prone to settling of material which decreases turbidity he et al 2017 and thus improve the light transparency providing suitable conditions for primary production maavara et al 2020 maneux et al 2001 as observed in the tgr area after the operation of tgd gao et al 2018 liu et al 2012 ran et al 2013 a drop of δ 13ctot occurred downstream the tgd in 2007 and 2017 fig 11b deposition of coarse particles such as carbonate interlayered black shale which is widespread in the changjiang river basin jiang et al 2012 with a less negative δ 13c 21 5 7 values compared to other poc sources in the river basin hartmann and moosdorf 2012 li et al 2015 fig 10 could lead to declining δ 13ctot in the water column this is confirmed by the decrease in the mean particle size at yichang station downstream of tgd fig 1 from 8 µm in 2003 to 3 µm in 2008 dai and lu 2014 which points to intensive particle size sorting in tgr therefore dam construction through increasing primary production and sedimentation of coarse particles leads to an increase in the ratio of poc tss ratio in the downstream reaches of the changjiang 4 2 uncertainties of poc fluxes li et al 2015 estimated a trapping flux of poctot of 9 0 2 8 mt c yr 1 in the changjiang basin after 2003 which exceeds our estimated poctot trapping of 2 1 0 5 mt c yr 1 during the same period by more than a factor of 4 li et al 2015 used the linear poctot tss relationship to estimate the reduction of poctot export from the changjiang river to the estuary which was regarded as the amount of poctot trapping in the river basin however the poctot content of tss before 2000 used by li et al 2015 was based on two cruises per year in the changjiang estuary with salinity 5 cauwet and mackenzie 1993 milliman et al 1984b using higher poc content of tss 10 in the estuary than in jiangyin and datong stations fig 9 results in overestimation of poc trapping in the whole river basin moreover combining our estimated poctot trapping with the silica si retention in the changjiang river basin during the same period reported by liu et al 2020 we estimate a ratio of c si retention ranging between 1 7 and 9 which is within the ranges found for freshwater systems conley et al 1989 ran et al 2017 in our study uncertainties of poc fluxes calculated from monitoring data in the downstream reach of the changjiang largely depend on uncertainties of water discharge and poc content estimates associated with differences in the frequency of observations the estimates in table 1 are based on monthly poc concentration measurements and daily discharge assuming that one single poc observation represents the monthly average this ignores the temporal variability of the poc concentration between two observations across days months seasons however it is difficult to estimate the uncertainty due to sampling frequency without a statistical comparison of different measurement frequencies for the model simulations we calculated the uncertainty of poc flux from the uncertainty of oc adsorption on suspended sediment however our uncertainty neglects the effect of particle size change and other factors leading to the decline in tss fluxes e g afforestation sand mining and climate change and does not include uncertainties in the processes of production decomposition and sedimentation 4 3 implications in inland and coastal waters dams have dramatically altered poc sources and composition in the changjiang river and thus changed the c export to the estuary and coastal waters fang et al 2019 liu et al 2019 xu et al 2020b zhao et al 2021a along with the declining allochthonous poc export by the changjiang river the decreasing poc burial has been observed in sediment cores in the changjiang estuary li et al 2016 liu et al 2019 a recent study reported that the terrestrial biomarker content in surficial sediment in the changjiang estuary decreased by 80 after the construction of tgd wang et al 2020 although the increase in autochthonous poc flux partly compensates for the increasing burial of allochthonous poc in reservoirs most of this labile poc is not preserved due to rapid oxidation in the estuary galy et al 2015 ittekkot 1988 li et al 2014 as a result the function of the changjiang estuary as a site for terrestrial oc burial has substantially decreased with more c trapping in river basins and less c burial in coastal ecosystems the spatial distribution of c burial shifted meanwhile the previous estimate of terrestrial oc burial flux in the changjiang estuary and the east china sea inner shelf decreased by 1 64 1 78 mt yr from the pre tgd to the post tgd period deng et al 2006 zhao et al 2021b which is less than our estimation of terrestrial poc burial flux in the changjiang river basin reduction of poc loss during poc transport in the downstream implies more efficient burial rate of terrestrial poc in the river basin battin et al 2009 li et al 2015 the decreases in poc and tss export from the changjiang river may also influence the in situ c biogeochemistry related to primary production and decomposition in the coastal waters li et al 2016 zhao et al 2021a the reduction in tss discharge creates better light conditions for photosynthesis uptake of atmospheric co2 and oxygen production which increases the capability of seasonal in situ c fixation in the coastal ecosystem the decrease in river poc export may reduce the oxygen consumption related to its decomposition chen et al 2017 dai et al 2016 li et al 2016 yang et al 2011 the seasonal hypoxia and acidification in the coastal waters near changjiang estuary may thus be relieved to some extent many other large rivers in the world including the danube mississippi godavari chao phraya krishna red yellow pearl and indus rivers panda et al 2011 walling 2011 wang et al 2011 table s3 have experienced reduction in sediment discharge due to dam construction during the past decades walling and fang 2003 with drastically decreased sediment load in rivers with strong human interference in the hydrology due to dam construction the poc tss relationship seems to have changed fig 12 a the overall range of poc content of tss does not change much while the median value of poc content of tss in global rivers with dams is 16 higher than those in global rivers lacking dams fig 12b although the change of poc content is limited it can have important impact on river poc export to the coastal waters based on the empirical relationship shown in fig 12 we estimated that total poc export from these nine intensively dammed rivers has declined by about 27 9 mt c yr 1 equivalent to 12 of the global riverine poc export blair and aller 2012 kandasamy and nagender nath 2016 middelburg 2019 figure s2 which includes the 3 4 mt c yr 1 increase in the export of more labile allochthonous poc the increased autochthonous poc in the yellow river and krishnia river is negligible contributed 1 to the poctot flux figure s2 the increase of autochthonous poc in the indus river contributed 14 to the poctot flux which is less than that of the red chao phraya godavari mississippi danube and pearl rivers 21 35 figure s2 the current autochthonous poc export by the changjiang river increased much more 50 70 of the poctot flux during the past two decades hence the impact of the dams in the changjiang river is probably larger than in other rivers in the world which may have profound consequences for biogeochemistry in the changjiang estuarine ecosystems 5 conclusion and perspective the combination of modelling and observations of poc and tss fluxes in the changjiang river basin reveals a dramatic impact of the construction of dams on poc export to the changjiang estuary about 90 of allochthonous poc is trapped within the river basin while the export of more labile autochthonous poc has increased by a factor of 20 and makes up about half of the total poc flux in recent years the decrease in total poc export and increase in the labile poc fraction in the export has reduced the sink strength for terrestrial oc of the changjiang estuary the decline of poc export by nine intensively dammed rivers is 12 of the global riverine poc export with increasing fractions of labile oc with more c trapping in river basins and less c burial in coastal ecosystems the spatial distribution of c burial has been shifted our estimation of poc trapping in reservoirs is uncertain however our analysis clearly shows that the changes of river poc transport and their impact on the estuarine c cycle in many large river basins are strongly affected by dams whereby the influence of the dams on the c cycle in the changjiang river is probably larger than in other rivers in the world with the projected increasing demand for renewable energy dam construction for hydropower generation will continue worldwide grill et al 2015 mulligan et al 2020 with major consequences for riverine and estuarine c cycles these changes in the c cycle of river basins and estuaries need to be considered when assessing the impact of dams for hydropower generation water storage and other purposes on the global c cycle credit authorship

3569,the long term changes in composition and export of particulate organic carbon poc by rivers due to dam construction are poorly known based on observations incubation experiments and modelling this study analyzed the sources spatial and temporal distribution and annual export of poc in the changjiang river during recent decades to explore the poc changes due to dam construction changes in poc composition resulted from both increasing poc sequestration and carbon fixation in the river basin the allochthonous poc from terrestrial input export by the changjiang river to its estuary decreased by 90 between 1956 and 2002 and 2013 2019 we estimated that 2 3 0 5 mt c yr allochthonous poc has been sequestered in the changjiang watershed since 2013 the autochthonous entirely from in stream riverine primary production contribution increased from 1 to 55 of total poc export during the same period due to improved light transparency caused by decreased sediment discharge global poc trapping in nine large rivers strongly impacted by dams is 12 of the global riverine poc export the reduced poc export and increase in labile autochthonous poc strongly impact the estuarine carbon cycle therefore with continued dam construction in the future important changes in the riverine and estuarine carbon cycle can be expected keywords particulate organic carbon carbon source changjiang river damming 1 introduction rivers play an important role in the global carbon c cycle by transporting terrestrial organic carbon oc to the ocean battin et al 2009 galy et al 2015 global river oc export from the land to the ocean is 300 tg c yr 1 of which 140 tg c yr 1 is particulate organic carbon poc seitzinger et al 2010 and the remainder is dissolved organic carbon doc derrien et al 2019 szymczycha et al 2017 during c transport in rivers transformations of doc and poc occur as well as burial adsorption desorption and aggregation dissolution he et al 2016 the burial of poc in river sediments is a long term sink of atmospheric co2 bouchez et al 2014 galy et al 2007 while poc decomposition is a co2 source fearnside and pueyo 2012 maavara et al 2019 riverine poc has different origins i e allochthonous poc from terrestrial vegetation in riparian and flooded areas or from eroded soil material galy et al 2015 hilton 2017 and autochthonous poc derived from in situ primary production ittekkot 1988 meybeck 1982b schlesinger and melack 1981 van hoek et al 2019 generally autochthonous poc is more easily decomposable than allochthonous poc lin et al 2019 mendonça et al 2012 with approximately 10 50 of total poc poctot being labile and the complement more resistant to degradation pocres fabre et al 2019 ittekkot and laane 1991 li et al 2015 anthropogenic perturbations such as dam construction water diversion sand mining and land use change in river basins have substantially changed the poc delivery to inland waters and its export to coastal waters butman et al 2015 catalán et al 2016 dean and gorham 1998 maavara et al 2017 regnier et al 2013 walling 2006 dams may have an important impact on poc export li et al 2015 maavara et al 2017 mendonça et al 2012 mulholland and elwood 1982 by increasing the travel time of water by promoting sedimentation and thus interrupting the transport of poc battin et al 2009 dean and gorham 1998 stallard 1998 and by enhancing primary production in reservoirs mendonça et al 2012 such changes of riverine poc flux and composition have important impacts on the ecology of coastal waters especially in estuaries bauer et al 2013 many global large rivers experienced a marked decrease of suspended sediment discharge walling and fang 2003 walling 2011 some rivers like the yellow river indus river and krishna river show a progressive decline of sediment and water discharge after the construction of large dams rao et al 2010 walling 2011 wang et al 2016 this combined reduction in sediment and water discharge may also be related to water diversion and climatic change also play vital roles kong et al 2015 milliman et al 1984a zhang et al 2017 other rivers including the changjiang red chao phraya godavari mississippi danube and pearl rivers have experienced a decrease of sediment load without significant decrease in annual runoff during the past decades das et al 2021 meade and moody 2010 vinh et al 2014 wu et al 2019 previous studies show that the reduction in sediment discharge due to damming in the red chao phraya godavari mississippi danube and pearl rivers fall into the range of 60 80 das et al 2021 keown et al 1986 le et al 2007 walling 2006 walling 2011 wu et al 2012 which is less than in the changjiang river basin up to 99 yang et al 2018 therefore the changjiang river could be regarded as a typical example to explore the impact of river damming on poc export from rivers to the sea the changjiang river yangtze river is the third largest river in the world with respect to discharge with a considerable contribution to the global material flux from land to the oceans chetelat et al 2008 milliman and meade 1983 viers et al 2008 rapid dam construction in the changjiang river basin since the 1950 s has resulted in the current 50 000 reservoirs with a total storage volume of 140 km3 which is 16 of the average annual water discharge dai and lu 2014 nilsson et al 2005 yang et al 2018 as a consequence the total suspended sediment tss export from the changjiang river has decreased since the 1970 s chen et al 2008 yang et al 2011 with a sharp decline after the closure of the three gorges dam tgd and filling of the three gorges reservoir tgr in 2003 yang et al 2007 in 2012 the completion of cascade dams cds in jinshajiang river the headwater zone of the changjiang river basin stretching from wudongxi to xiangjiaba dams further increased the trapping of sediment li et al 2015 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2015 wu et al 2007 yang et al 2018 yu et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 however the effect of these different dams on the amount of poc trapping is poorly understood in this study we characterized poc tss and chlorophyll a chl a in the mainstream of the changjiang river to investigate the factors controlling the spatial distribution of poc delivery decomposition and transport along the river continuum incubation experiments were used to estimate decomposition rates of autochthonous poc monthly labile and recalcitrant poc fluxes c stable isotopes and tss variation close to the river mouth were analyzed to estimate different poc sources and their seasonal variability to understand the long term poc alteration due to damming we modelled the allochthonous supply autochthonous production and burial of poc in the whole changjiang river basin during the past 60 years finally comparisons were made with nine global rivers strongly impacted by reservoirs 2 methods 2 1 study area the changjiang river basin covers an area of 1 8 million km2 which is 20 of china s land area fig 1 the mountainous jinshajiang subbasin has relatively low temperatures and a dry climate while the middle and lower reaches mainly consist of fluvial plains with wet and warm climates chetelat et al 2008 the changjiang river downstream of datong about 500 km from the river mouth is influenced by the tidal range most of the changjiang river basin is dominated by the subtropical monsoon climate and 70 80 of rainfall and water and sediment discharge occur in the flood season from may to september the vegetation cover along the river is diverse and abundant yu et al

employed in this study include water sampling and incubation experiments to analyze decomposition rates and dissolution of c nitrate and phosphate and the analytical techniques to determine c and stable c isotope concentrations 2 2 1 sampling water samples were collected in april 2017 low flow season and july 2018 flood season at a range of stations 1 11 to obtain longitudinal profiles along the changjiang river fig 1 to study the seasonality monthly samples were taken at station 11 jiangyin in the lower reach of the changjiang river in 2013 2014 and 2018 2019 high turbidity can shrink

autochthonous poc in the river channel were simulated at the spatial scale of ten sub basins and aggregated to the main stream divided into upstream midstream and downstream reach fig 1 soil erosion is a primary source of allochthonous poc in the changjiang river wang et al 2012 yu et al 2011 estimation of allochthonous poc was therefore based on soil erosion and associated oc contents in different soil types figure s1 table s1 the average soc content of each sub basin was calculated using the weighted average of soc contents in different soil types and their corresponding areas 1 soc

occupied area of soil type i in sub basin j we linked the sediment erosion and deposition fluxes from recent reports yang et al 2014 yang et al 2007 the weighted average soc contents in different soil

datong station http www cjw gov cn we applied the load estimator loadest to calculate the monthly and yearly poctot and pocres fluxes to the estuary based on a time series of streamflow and constituent concentration loadest can estimate constituent loads in rivers through developing a regression model runkel et al 2004 by adjusted maximum likelihood estimation amle including the uncertainty at the 95 confidence level 3 results 3 1 observed poc concentrations and fluxes 3 1 1 spatial distribution of poc δ 13c chl a and tss along the changjiang river in april 2017 the tss concentration in the mainstream of the changjiang river ranged from 4 3 to 83 9 mg l 1 with an average value of 30 3 mg l 1 fig 2 the highest value occurred at station 1 located in the jinshajiang river along the river continuum the first low value of tss concentration occurred at station 2 downstream of the cds and the tss concentration gradually increased from station 2 to station 4 the head of three gorges reservoir the tss concentration reached the lowest value at station 6 and from there it gradually increased downstream along the river in august 2018 the tss concentration ranged between 17 and 191 mg l 1 and maintained a high level without clear differences between the stations in april 2017 the poctot content in the mainstream of the changjiang river ranged from 1 2 to 5 1 with an average of 2 5 high poctot contents observed at stations 2 and 6 correspond to low tss concentrations fig 2a in july 2018 the content of poctot averaged 1 3 and ranged from 0 9 to 2 1 the poc content was lower in july 2018 than in april 2017 at nearly all stations fig 2b the difference between the stations in the poctot content in july 2018 was small in april 2017 the δ 13ctot values varied from 27 60 to 24 70 with high values mainly at the upstream stations fig 2c however in july 2018 the range of δ 13ctot values was 32 15 26 63 fig 2d the chl a concentration in the changjiang river ranged between 3 7 and 9 3 µg l 1 in april 2017 and was much lower 0 06 2 64 µg l 1 in august 2018 fig 2e f the chl a concentration was generally higher in the low flow season than in the flood season the highest value in the low flow season was at station 5 in the upstream reach of the tgd the chl a concentration gradually increased downstream towards the estuary both in the flood and low flow season 3 1 2 seasonal variation in poc content δ 13c and tss in the lower reach of the changjiang river according to the monthly investigations during two hydrological periods from may 2013 to may 2014 and from may 2018 to august 2019 fig 3 a the poctot content in the downstream reach of the changjiang river ranged from 1 1 to 4 6 with an average of 2 4 fig 3b during the whole sampling period there was an inverse pattern between the monthly poctot content and water sediment discharge the observed δ 13ctot value ranged from 26 97 to 25 54 the pocres content varied from 0 3 to 1 5 with an average of 1 0 during the period from may 2018 to august 2019 the variation of the δ 13cres was small from 27 03 to 25 84 similar to that of the δ 13ctot fig 3c 3 1 3 poc export to coastal waters based on the monthly tss fluxes and poc contents in the downstream reach of the changjiang river we calculated the monthly poc fluxes of the changjiang river during 2013 2014 and 2018 2019 the monthly fluxes of poctot in the changjiang river ranged from 0 04 mt c month 1 to 0 8 mt c month 1 and were higher during the period may august table 1 similar to the monthly variations in the sediment flux the calculated annual fluxes of pocres during may 2018 to april 2019 and during september 2018 to august 2019 contributed 37 and 50 to the poctot fluxes of that year respectively 3 1 4 poc decomposition the poctot concentration decreased with time with a sharp drop from 96 µmol l 1 to 73 µmol l 1 in the first four days and a slow decrease afterwards fig 4 after the 15th day of incubation the poctot concentration was constant at 66 3 µmol l 1 close to the pocres concentration in jiangyin station 61 5 µmol l 1 the remineralization rate of poclabile was 7 6 µmol l 1 day 1 during the period from day 0 to day 4 and 0 67 µmol l 1 day 1 during days 5 15 the high correlation coefficients r 0 8 indicated that the loss rate of poclabile and the variation in po4 3 no3 and nh4 are strongly correlated on the basis of the declining of nh4 and poc and the parallel increase of po4 3 and no3 in the incubation experiment we calculated that the ratio of c poc n no3 nh4 p po4 3 for removed organic material ranged from 83 6 1 to 83 13 1 based on the incubation experiment we estimated a value of 0 14 for parameter k re for the rapid removal dissolution decomposition function in the changjiang river see equation 4 fig 4a 3 2 simulated and observed poctot inputs trapping and export the simulated average poctot flux sum of allochthonous and autochthonous poc at datong station is 2 7 0 7 mt c yr 1 during 1956 2002 fig 5 a this number decreased to 0 9 0 1 mt c yr 1 during 2003 2009 after 2010 the poctot flux at datong station was stable and increased by 20 relative to the average value of the period 2003 2009 with an average annual value of 1 1 0 2 mt c yr 1 due to declining allochthonous and increasing autochthonous poc comparison of the simulated poctot fluxes at datong station and observed poctot fluxes at datong and jiangyin stations fig 5a shows that the model properly describes the observed poctot fluxes before 2012 all fall into the 95 confidence interval and the spatial distribution of simulated chl a concentration in the mainstream is also consistent with the observations fig 5b the long term changes in the poc flux and its spatial distribution is related to changes of its composition and delivery patterns in the changjiang river during different historical periods fig 6 poctot trapping in the upstream reach increased from 2 to 5 before 2003 to 66 88 during the post tgd period since the autochthonous poc production further increased the proportion of autochthonous poc also increased before 2003 the fraction autochthonous of total poc was 2 in the whole river basin while this fraction increased to 10 13 25 27 and 26 41 in the upstream midstream and downstream reaches of the changjiang during the period 2003 2012 respectively poc transport from the jinshajiang subbasin decreased by 80 88 in the post cds period compared to the years between 2003 and 2012 the combined retention in tgd and cds aggravated the riverbed erosion intensity in the midstream reach poctot export from the whole river basin to coastal waters declined by 1 7 0 6 mt c yr 1 from 1956 to 2002 to 2013 2019 but also altered the poctot composition from allochthonous dominant to equal proportions of allochthonous and autochthonous poc observed ratios of poclabile poctot at jiangyin station during may 2018 to april 2019 63 and september 2018 to august 2019 50 table 1 are close to our simulated range of autochthonous poc poctot ratio 46 71 for the same period fig 6 and incubation experiments fig 4 3 3 simulated allochthonous and autochthonous poc 3 3 1 simulated allochthonous poc supply and trapping during the years prior to the tgd closure i e before 2003 the simulated allochthonous poc flux at yichang representing the outflow from the upstream reach hankou outflow from midstream to downstream and datong downstream stations fig 1 was 3 1 0 4 2 5 0 5 and 2 7 0 7 mt c yr 1 respectively about 97 of the allochthonous poc was transported from upstream to the mid and downstream reaches of the changjiang however the model suggests that after the tgd closure the allochthonous poc flux decreased by 89 82 and 75 at yichang hankou and datong stations respectively due to trapping in the tgr fig 7 according to the model the jinshajiang subbasin was the major source of allochthonous poc before 2012 due to its high sediment load and soc content dai and lu 2014 wu et al 2003 however after the operation of the cds in 2012 almost no allochthonous poc was exported from the xiangjiaba reservoir fig 7d as a consequence after 2012 large masses of allochthonous poc that would otherwise be trapped in the tgr were actually deposited upstream of the tgr the allochthonous poc fluxes at yichang hankou and datong stations further decreased by 70 48 and 43 respectively between the periods 2013 2019 and 2003 2012 fig 7a c the model results indicate that compared to the allochthonous poc flux during the period 1955 2003 on average approximately 85 2 3 0 5 mt c yr 1 of allochthonous poc has been trapped within the changjiang basin since 2013 3 3 2 simulated autochthonous poc supply after the closure of tgd in 2003 the annual total autochthonous poc load in the upstream midstream and downstream reaches increased by over 2 7 and 15 times compared with the average values for the period 1960 2002 respectively fig 8 a correspondingly the net autochthonous poc fluxes from the upstream midstream and downstream reaches increased from 0 02 0 02 and 0 02 mt c yr 1 during 1960 2002 to 0 04 0 13 and 0 30 mt c yr 1 after 2003 respectively fig 8b after 2013 the autochthonous poc production in the downstream reach of the changjiang river further increased by more than a factor of 20 compared to the average value before 2003 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 characterization of poc export from the changjiang river poc and tss flux are closely related fig 9 a and c a positive correlation between poc and tss flux is clear during the whole time period with two significant changes 1 poc fluxes decreased sharply after 2003 2 the poctot export flux from the changjiang river has increased during the recent decade as a result the proportion of poctot in sediment export gradually increased from 0 5 to 2 since 2003 fig 9b 4 1 1 decline of poc export our model results show that the longitudinal pattern of the simulated allochthonous poc was in line with that of the observed tss dai and lu 2014 wu et al 2003 fig 7a d the sediment discharge in the upstream and downstream reaches decreased by 96 and 74 in 2006 2017 compared to 1950 1985 respectively guo et al 2019 nearly all tss was trapped in the upstream reach after the operation of tgd and cds guo et al 2018 yang et al 2018 our model suggests that the rapidly decreasing allochthonous poc flux dominates the changes of poctot flux before and after 2003 in addition the high trapping efficiency in the upstream reach caused a decline of transport which induced a shift from a system with poc retention to one dominated by riverbed poc erosion in the midstream reach although riverbed erosion supplied 41 of the tss export from the midstream reach yang et al 2014 the re suspended poc flux only added 16 23 of the poctot export from the midstream to downstream reach due to the low poc content of sediment in the riverbed fig 6 4 1 2 increased poc tss ratio and autochthonous poc the poc content of tss generally decreases with increasing tss concentrations meybeck 1982a thurman 2012 due to dilution in water with high sediment loads and improved light transparency and production at low sediment loads this is also shown in the changjiang river to understand the change of the poc tss ratio we analyzed the differences in erosion intensity driven by different hydrological patterns the δ13ctot range in the flood season july 2018 fig 2d is more negative than the δ13ctot range in the low flow season april 2017 fig 2c and is within the δ13c range of c3 plants in the changjiang river basin fig 10 the δ13ctot range in the low flow season is consistent with the δ13c range of the overlap of c3 plants and primary production mixing and the higher chl a concentration is due to more primary production compared to the flood season fig 10 this indicates that higher soil erosion rates in the flood season lead to more allochthonous poc compared with the low flow season with a more strongly negative δ 13c signal stemming from terrestrial c3 plants higher turbidity fig 2 limits algal growth i e causes a decrease in autochthonous poc production in contrast a low erosion intensity would effectively enhance the production of autochthonous poc sullivan et al 2001 especially with near optimal temperature conditions in the low flow season in april garnier et al 1999 zhong et al 2016 however the comparison of the poc characteristics before and after reservoir filling indicates that damming has gradually become the dominant factor controlling water turbidity and poc according to the spatial distribution along the mainstream of changjiang river in different years the poctot contents of tss began to increase in the tgr area in the post tgd period after 2003 fig 11 a despite the sharp decrease from midstream to downstream in 2006 2008 and 2017 the poc tss ratio 1 7 in the downstream reach was still higher than that in 1993 and 2003 1 this indicates that the increasing poc tss ratio in the downstream reach is related to dam construction in the upstream reach in 2006 and 2017 the chl a poctot ratios in the midstream and downstream reaches are higher than those in 2003 fig 11c which indicates that the proportion of autochthonous poc increased in the midstream and downstream reaches after tgr filling moreover the c n p ratio obtained from the incubation experiment redfield 1963 zhang et al 2018 fig 4 the approximation of observed ratios of poclabile poctot at jiangyin station during may 2018 to august 2019 table 1 and the simulated autochthonous poc poctot ratio for the same period fig 6 all confirm that most of the labile poc is autochthonous poc in the changjiang river reservoirs prolong the water residence time create conditions prone to settling of material which decreases turbidity he et al 2017 and thus improve the light transparency providing suitable conditions for primary production maavara et al 2020 maneux et al 2001 as observed in the tgr area after the operation of tgd gao et al 2018 liu et al 2012 ran et al 2013 a drop of δ 13ctot occurred downstream the tgd in 2007 and 2017 fig 11b deposition of coarse particles such as carbonate interlayered black shale which is widespread in the changjiang river basin jiang et al 2012 with a less negative δ 13c 21 5 7 values compared to other poc sources in the river basin hartmann and moosdorf 2012 li et al 2015 fig 10 could lead to declining δ 13ctot in the water column this is confirmed by the decrease in the mean particle size at yichang station downstream of tgd fig 1 from 8 µm in 2003 to 3 µm in 2008 dai and lu 2014 which points to intensive particle size sorting in tgr therefore dam construction through increasing primary production and sedimentation of coarse particles leads to an increase in the ratio of poc tss ratio in the downstream reaches of the changjiang 4 2 uncertainties of poc fluxes li et al 2015 estimated a trapping flux of poctot of 9 0 2 8 mt c yr 1 in the changjiang basin after 2003 which exceeds our estimated poctot trapping of 2 1 0 5 mt c yr 1 during the same period by more than a factor of 4 li et al 2015 used the linear poctot tss relationship to estimate the reduction of poctot export from the changjiang river to the estuary which was regarded as the amount of poctot trapping in the river basin however the poctot content of tss before 2000 used by li et al 2015 was based on two cruises per year in the changjiang estuary with salinity 5 cauwet and mackenzie 1993 milliman et al 1984b using higher poc content of tss 10 in the estuary than in jiangyin and datong stations fig 9 results in overestimation of poc trapping in the whole river basin moreover combining our estimated poctot trapping with the silica si retention in the changjiang river basin during the same period reported by liu et al 2020 we estimate a ratio of c si retention ranging between 1 7 and 9 which is within the ranges found for freshwater systems conley et al 1989 ran et al 2017 in our study uncertainties of poc fluxes calculated from monitoring data in the downstream reach of the changjiang largely depend on uncertainties of water discharge and poc content estimates associated with differences in the frequency of observations the estimates in table 1 are based on monthly poc concentration measurements and daily discharge assuming that one single poc observation represents the monthly average this ignores the temporal variability of the poc concentration between two observations across days months seasons however it is difficult to estimate the uncertainty due to sampling frequency without a statistical comparison of different measurement frequencies for the model simulations we calculated the uncertainty of poc flux from the uncertainty of oc adsorption on suspended sediment however our uncertainty neglects the effect of particle size change and other factors leading to the decline in tss fluxes e g afforestation sand mining and climate change and does not include uncertainties in the processes of production decomposition and sedimentation 4 3 implications in inland and coastal waters dams have dramatically altered poc sources and composition in the changjiang river and thus changed the c export to the estuary and coastal waters fang et al 2019 liu et al 2019 xu et al 2020b zhao et al 2021a along with the declining allochthonous poc export by the changjiang river the decreasing poc burial has been observed in sediment cores in the changjiang estuary li et al 2016 liu et al 2019 a recent study reported that the terrestrial biomarker content in surficial sediment in the changjiang estuary decreased by 80 after the construction of tgd wang et al 2020 although the increase in autochthonous poc flux partly compensates for the increasing burial of allochthonous poc in reservoirs most of this labile poc is not preserved due to rapid oxidation in the estuary galy et al 2015 ittekkot 1988 li et al 2014 as a result the function of the changjiang estuary as a site for terrestrial oc burial has substantially decreased with more c trapping in river basins and less c burial in coastal ecosystems the spatial distribution of c burial shifted meanwhile the previous estimate of terrestrial oc burial flux in the changjiang estuary and the east china sea inner shelf decreased by 1 64 1 78 mt yr from the pre tgd to the post tgd period deng et al 2006 zhao et al 2021b which is less than our estimation of terrestrial poc burial flux in the changjiang river basin reduction of poc loss during poc transport in the downstream implies more efficient burial rate of terrestrial poc in the river basin battin et al 2009 li et al 2015 the decreases in poc and tss export from the changjiang river may also influence the in situ c biogeochemistry related to primary production and decomposition in the coastal waters li et al 2016 zhao et al 2021a the reduction in tss discharge creates better light conditions for photosynthesis uptake of atmospheric co2 and oxygen production which increases the capability of seasonal in situ c fixation in the coastal ecosystem the decrease in river poc export may reduce the oxygen consumption related to its decomposition chen et al 2017 dai et al 2016 li et al 2016 yang et al 2011 the seasonal hypoxia and acidification in the coastal waters near changjiang estuary may thus be relieved to some extent many other large rivers in the world including the danube mississippi godavari chao phraya krishna red yellow pearl and indus rivers panda et al 2011 walling 2011 wang et al 2011 table s3 have experienced reduction in sediment discharge due to dam construction during the past decades walling and fang 2003 with drastically decreased sediment load in rivers with strong human interference in the hydrology due to dam construction the poc tss relationship seems to have changed fig 12 a the overall range of poc content of tss does not change much while the median value of poc content of tss in global rivers with dams is 16 higher than those in global rivers lacking dams fig 12b although the change of poc content is limited it can have important impact on river poc export to the coastal waters based on the empirical relationship shown in fig 12 we estimated that total poc export from these nine intensively dammed rivers has declined by about 27 9 mt c yr 1 equivalent to 12 of the global riverine poc export blair and aller 2012 kandasamy and nagender nath 2016 middelburg 2019 figure s2 which includes the 3 4 mt c yr 1 increase in the export of more labile allochthonous poc the increased autochthonous poc in the yellow river and krishnia river is negligible contributed 1 to the poctot flux figure s2 the increase of autochthonous poc in the indus river contributed 14 to the poctot flux which is less than that of the red chao phraya godavari mississippi danube and pearl rivers 21 35 figure s2 the current autochthonous poc export by the changjiang river increased much more 50 70 of the poctot flux during the past two decades hence the impact of the dams in the changjiang river is probably larger than in other rivers in the world which may have profound consequences for biogeochemistry in the changjiang estuarine ecosystems 5 conclusion and perspective the combination of modelling and observations of poc and tss fluxes in the changjiang river basin reveals a dramatic impact of the construction of dams on poc export to the changjiang estuary about 90 of allochthonous poc is trapped within the river basin while the export of more labile autochthonous poc has increased by a factor of 20 and makes up about half of the total poc flux in recent years the decrease in total poc export and increase in the labile poc fraction in the export has reduced the sink strength for terrestrial oc of the changjiang estuary the decline of poc export by nine intensively dammed rivers is 12 of the global riverine poc export with increasing fractions of labile oc with more c trapping in river basins and less c burial in coastal ecosystems the spatial distribution of c burial has been shifted our estimation of poc trapping in reservoirs is uncertain however our analysis clearly shows that the changes of river poc transport and their impact on the estuarine c cycle in many large river basins are strongly affected by dams whereby the influence of the dams on the c cycle in the changjiang river is probably larger than in other rivers in the world with the projected increasing demand for renewable energy dam construction for hydropower generation will continue worldwide grill et al 2015 mulligan et al 2020 with major consequences for riverine and estuarine c cycles these changes in the c cycle of river basins and estuaries need to be considered when assessing the impact of dams for hydropower generation water storage and other purposes on the global c cycle credit authorship
