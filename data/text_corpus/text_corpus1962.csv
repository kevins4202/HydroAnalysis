9810,the accurate and efficient management of water and nitrogen is essential for the effective intensive production of greenhouse watermelon in order to determine the optimal application of water and nitrogen to promote the growth and yield of watermelon under the increasing co2 concentration in the future we conducted an experiment with 12 treatments over two growing seasons in 2019 and 2020 to evaluate the effects of water and nitrogen coupling on the growth photosynthesis and yield of watermelon under carbon dioxide co2 enrichment the treatments included three irrigation levels i1 80 evaporation ep i2 100 ep and i3 120 ep two nitrogen levels n1 644 04 kg ha and n2 1288 09 kg ha and two co2 concentrations c1 400 ppm and c2 800 ppm the experimental results show that except for intercellular co2 concentration ci and chlorophyll irrigation exhibited a promoting effect on other indicators in two years and yield was most strongly improved with increased irrigation the interaction of water and nitrogen dramatically affected the net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration rate tr and ci in two years elevated co2 concentration alleviated the negative effect of low nitrogen on the number of leaves dry matter accumulation pn and ci with the biggest improvement on dry matter accumulation changes of 35 7 and 17 9 for two years meanwhile elevated co2 concentration also promoted pn under low irrigation with increases of 36 9 and 31 1 in two years eight indicators of growth and photosynthesis were used to evaluate comprehensive growth based on technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution topsis and dry matter accumulation achieved the largest combined weight of 0 241 and 0 232 followed by pn a positive correlation was found between comprehensive growth and yield different treatments were effective for overall promotion of growth and yield with 115 120 ep irrigation 976 07 1288 09 kg ha nitrogen fertilizer optimal for watermelon at 400 ppm co2 concentration and 114 120 ep irrigation 664 04 913 06 kg ha nitrogen fertilizer best for 800 ppm co2 these results suggest for the expected future higher co2 concentrations greenhouse watermelon production should reduce application of nitrogen fertilizers to save resources but maintain full irrigation keywords water nitrogen coupling co2 watermelon growth photosynthesis yield 1 introduction there has been rapid development of the greenhouse cultivation of small watermelons with watermelon becoming a popular fruit variety cultivated in modern greenhouses and facilities garcía mendívil and sorribas 2021 as two essential nutrients for crop growth water and nitrogen fertilizer significantly affect the growth and yield of crops wang et al 2008 however in northwest china water resources are scarce and unreasonable irrigation and nitrogen application are more common hochmuth et al 2015 this caused environmental pollution and waste of resources and also affected the growth and nutrient absorption of plant thereby affecting the yield and quality of crop li et al 2019 kaab et al 2019 therefore scientific and reasonable water and nitrogen management is always worth exploring in the process of watermelon production the growth of watermelon is highly sensitive to nitrogen level du et al 2013 excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer will lead to an imbalance of plant root and shoot growth significantly reducing the yield and nitrogen fertilizer utilization efficiency and also causing environmental pollution liu et al 2005 although watermelon is tolerant to high temperature and drought it requires a large amount of water and water stress will hinder plant growth yavuz et al 2020 hernandez santana et al 2017 li et al 2020 a sufficient water supply can enhance water and nutrient uptake xia et al 2021 both soil moisture and nitrogen content affect plant growth by promoting photosynthesis which in turn determines plant dry matter accumulation to ultimately affect plant growth yield and quality li et al 2010 water nitrogen coupling studies also found that appropriate water supply can increase the nitrogen harvest index plaut et al 2004 xu et al 2010 and supplemental irrigation can increase stomatal opening and transpiration and enhance nitrogen transfer from senescing vegetative organs to reproductive organs liu et al 2005 in recent years widespread industrial discharges and automobile exhaust emissions have caused a gradual increase in the concentration of co2 in the atmosphere ipcc 2013 this concentration is predicted to exceed 550 μmol mol 1 by 2050 and reach 700 μmol mol 1 by the end of 2100 zhang et al 2018 although elevated co2 concentration can have a positive effect on crop growth especially for c3 crops wang et al 2020 and also can increase crop biomass and yield lenka et al 2019 long et al 2006 but it remains unclear what changes will happen to the impact of water nitrogen coupling on crop growth under co2 enrichment the goal of this study was to investigate the effect of co2 enrichment to modulate the effects of water and nitrogen coupling on growth photosynthesis and yield of watermelon cultivated in a greenhouse and establish a scientific comprehensive evaluation system of watermelon growth and photosynthesis by topsis method and then determine the most appropriate water and nitrogen management plan under different co2 concentrations based on the correlation analysis of yield and comprehensive growth the results of this work should provide a theoretical basis for rational irrigation and fertilization strategies for greenhouse production of watermelon with high co2 concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 test site and materials this experiment was performed in two plastic greenhouses 34 17 n 108 02 e in yang ling shaanxi province from may to july in 2019 and 2020 each greenhouse was 8 m long 4 m wide and 2 1 m high the experimental area is located in the hinterland of the guan zhong plain in the central part of shaanxi province with abundant light and heat resources and large temperature difference between day and night which is conducive to the cultivation of watermelon there is a small weather station hobo event logger onset computer corporation usa in the greenhouse which can simultaneously record temperature humidity and light radiation intensity lux the temperature data are presented in fig 1 the watermelon qianding no 1 variety was selected for this experiment with excellent toughness storage and transportation resistance disease resistance and stress resistance ma et al 2013 in the experiment watermelon was cultivated with substrate and the basic physical and chemical properties of the substrate were measured before planting to calculate the actual nitrogen application amount table 1 according to the agronomic measures of local farmers double vine pruning was adopted and the main vine was selected for fruit retention the way to retain the melon was artificial pollination on the second and third female flowers of the main vine for each plant and only one left when the fruit grew to the size of an egg by discarding the weaker one ren et al 2021 2 2 experimental design this experiment manipulated three factors co2 concentration nitrogen application and irrigation the randomized split plot design was adopted with co2 concentrations

concentration detection recorder and two co2 concentrations were tested low co2 c1 400 ppm and high co2 c2 800 ppm the amount of nitrogen applied was determined based on the amount of nitrogen that a watermelon plant needs to absorb during its lifetime target yield method wang et al 2008 minus the amount of nitrogen present in the substrate and nutrient solution two nitrogen levels were tested low nitrogen n1 644 04 kg ha and high nitrogen n2 1288 09 kg ha the main calculation formula of the target yield method in this experiment is as follows 1 ty 1 n y where ty refers to the target yield kg

levels of irrigation were tested low water i1 80 ep intermediate water i2 100 ep and high water i3 120 ep the simplified formula used to calculate the amount of irrigation was the following 4 i a ep kcp where i is the amount of irrigation a is the surface area of the pot ep is the cumulative evaporation of φ20 cm standard evaporating pan and kcp is the evaporation pan coefficient 0 4 at the flowering and fruit setting stage 1 0 at the middle stage of the fruiting and 0 75 at the final stage of the fruiting drip irrigation was adopted with the frequency of once daily in addition we provided a nutrition solution of hoagland formula hoagland and arnon 1950 to ensure that the watermelon plants received sufficient nutrition during their growth period the whole experiment included a total of 12 treatments and 12 pots φ30 cm of watermelon per treatment with a minimum spacing of 50 cm between plant pots the cumulative irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer rates during the whole growth stage were showed in table 2 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 measuring plant growth growth indicators included leaf number leaf area and dry matter accumulation the number of leaves is the number of leaves on the main vine and is determined by manual counting to measure the leaf area leaves in the same leaf position on each plant are selected and photographed and then calculation of area from the images was performed using image j national institutes of health to measure dry matter accumulation the plant tissues were incubated in an oven temperature control range of 50 300 c volume of 650 l at 105 c for 40 min followed by incubation at 70 c until samples reached constant weight 2 3 2 measuring photosynthesis photosynthesis measurements included leaf net photosynthesis rate pn transpiration rate tr intercellular carbon dioxide ci stomatal conductance gs and chlorophyll content for measurement the third or fourth fully expanded leaf was attached to a portable photosynthesis measurement system li 6800 li cor inc during the ripening period absolute ethanol acetone and water volume ratio 4 5 4 5 1 was used for chlorophyll extraction and then a uv 2500 spectrophotometer shimadzu corporation japan was used for measurement measurements were performed three times 2 3 3 measuring yield one fruit was left per plant and the fruits were picked after ripening yield was calculated as the weight of all watermelons for each treatment and was converted to the weight per hectare 2 3 4 measuring the physical and chemical properties of the substrate nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen were

total porosity was calculated by weighing the air dried substrate and the completely wet substrate 2 4 data analysis microsoft excel office 2016 microsoft corp usa was used to organize data and perform calculations analysis of variance was conducted using the statistical package spss 23 0 spss inc chicago il usa origin 2018 origin lab massachusetts usa and matlab 2018 mathworks usa were used to construct figures analytic hierarchy process ahp was executed using yaahp shanxi yuan juece software technology co ltd china entropy and topsis comprehensive evaluation methods were executed using excel 3 results 3 1 the effect of water nitrogen coupling on watermelon plant growth under co2 enrichment the experiment results showed that nitrogen irrigation co2 and the interaction of the three factors obviously affected the number of leaves in the two seasons of 2019 and 2020 and increased application of nitrogen dramatically improved the number of leaves there were higher numbers of leaves when the irrigation was at medium and high levels table 3 and fig 2a meanwhile the number of leaves in low nitrogen respectively increased by 13 5 and 11 5 with increasing co2 concentration from 400 ppm to 800 ppm overall t6 was the optimal treatment for the number of leaves in both years fig 2a for the experiments conducted in two years irrigation significantly promoted leaf area and the leaf area generally increased with increasing irrigation however elevated co2 concentration dramatically inhibited leaf area and the leaf area was reduced by 37 0 and 25 7 for the two years table 3 and fig 2b for both years plants subjected to t6 and t3 treatments resulted in the largest leaf area measurements which were 88 2 and 77 4 higher than the lowest treatments respectively fig 2b the dry matter accumulation was significantly affected by irrigation and analysis of the effect of the irrigation level revealed that the dry matter accumulation basically showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with increasing irrigation volume with best accumulation under medium irrigation at the same time the dry matter accumulation under low nitrogen treatments was increased by 35 7 and 17 9 in two years with elevating co2 concentration table 3 and fig 2c the interaction of the three factors also dramatically changed the dry matter accumulation and t8 treatments gave the largest dry matter accumulation in both years table 3 and fig 2c 3 2 the effect of water and nitrogen coupling on photosynthesis of watermelon leaves under co2 enrichment the results from the experiments in 2019 and 2020 showed that irrigation dramatically changed the pn of watermelon leaves and although the pn for plants treated with medium irrigation was lower by 1 9 than that for plants grown with high irrigation in 2019 considering the results for both years the pn was the best under medium irrigation table 4 the pn in low irrigation was significantly promoted by elevated co2 concentration and this effect was bigger under high nitrogen with increases of 36 9 and 31 1 for the two years meanwhile pn in low nitrogen was improved by increased co2 concentration increases with 15 9 and 32 8 table 4 additionally our three way anova results showed significant interactive effect of nitrogen and irrigation on the pn and t11 and t9 treatments gave the highest pn for the two years tables 3 and 4 the tr gradually enhanced with increasing irrigation and nitrogen slightly affected the tr in the two years and the three way anova results showed that co2 irrigation and nitrogen irrigation obviously changed the tr in both years meantime tr was dramatically decreased by 53 1 and 41 2 under co2 enrichment for the both years table 4 additionally tr showed a higher value in low nitrogen level than that for high nitrogen level at 800 ppm co2 concentration in both years for 400 ppm co2 t3 was the maximum treatment in 2019 but t6 was highest in 2020 for 800 ppm co2 t9 got the largest tr in both years tables 3 and 4 the ci was only markedly affected by nitrogen and the overall ci for two years under high nitrogen that were 12 3 and 17 6 higher than those under low nitrogen table 4 the interaction of nitrogen and co2 and the interaction between nitrogen and irrigation also had significant impact on ci table 3 at 400 ppm co2 ci was higher under high nitrogen with maximum values for both years for t6 however with enriched co2 ci under low nitrogen treatment was improved with t8 giving maximum values for both years table 4 irrigation obviously impacted the gs and the gs increased with the increase of irrigation volume however the gs was strongly decreased by 40 1 and 88 7 under elevated co2 concentration in 2019 and 2020 respectively table 4 there were significant nitrogen and interactive effects of nitrogen and co2 on the gs in 2019 and obvious effects of interaction between water and co2 and the interaction of water and nitrogen on the gs in 2020 table 3 in both years the gs was the largest for low nitrogen and high water and t3 treatment gave the maximum value at 400 ppm co2 and t9 gave the maximum value at 800 ppm co2 so the effect of water nitrogen coupling was not changed by co2 enrichment table 4 although the chlorophyll was only slightly affected by a single factor co2 and improved by 4 6 in both years with obvious interactive effects of irrigation and co2 and the interaction of three factors on chlorophyll tables 4 and 3 when the co2 concentration was 400 ppm t4 treatment was second best in 2019 best in 2020 with the best for overall performance considering both years different results were achieved at co2 concentration of 800 ppm with t9 and t12 best in 2019 and 2020 respectively the t9 and t4 treatments resulted in the highest chlorophyll content in 2019 and 2020 respectively values that were 34 4 and 28 2 higher those achieved by the lowest treatment of t2 in both years table 4 3 3 comprehensive evaluation of watermelon growth based on multiple indexes using topsis analysis of the above results revealed that different treatments were optimal for each indicator additionally the results were not completely consistent with the two years therefore to better determine the amount of water and nitrogen application we performed a comprehensive evaluation all eight indicators of growth and photosynthesis 3 3 1 construction of comprehensive evaluation system for watermelon growth yaahp software was used to establish a hierarchical model for comprehensive evaluation of watermelon fig 3 the characteristic of analytic hierarchy process ahp is to decompose the problem to be decided into several levels and calculate the ranking weight of each scheme relative to the overall goal of the decision making system which especially suitable for occasions of difficult in measuring the decision result directly and accurately neissi et al 2020 as the pigment of photosynthetic reaction centers chlorophyll plays a dual role in capturing light energy and separating the photovoltaic charge gerischer 1979 which can lead to the accumulation of dry matter and increased yield bhattarai et al 2004 some studies also have found that leaf area is determined mainly by photosynthesis while fruit yield is largely determined by leaf area so photosynthesis and leaf area are the main variables to control growth without curtailing the yield hernandez santana et al 2017 the indicators that characterize the watermelon growth belong to different categories while they all affect the final yield with different effects therefore the comprehensive growth index target layer x is divided into growth indicators x 1 and photosynthetic indicators x 2 in the model growth indicators include three sub factors of leaf number x 11 leaf area x 12 and dry matter accumulation x 13 photosynthetic indicators include five sub factors of net photosynthetic rate x 21 transpiration rate x 22 intercellular carbon dioxide x 23 stomatal conductance x 24 and chlorophyll x 25 3 3 2 determination of the weights of watermelon growth indicators 1 determination of subjective weights by analytic hierarchy process ahp the judgment matrix was constructed and the weight of each indicator was calculated each evaluation index was then compared in pairs using a scale of 1 9 with a judgment matrix a as follows 5 a a 11 a 1 n a m 1 a nn where a ij represents the importance of x i relative to that of x j to a the value of a ij is usually scored by experts in related fields or based on questionnaire survey data and a ij a ji 1 detailed calculation methods have been described previously karami 2006 the subjective weights were set for each indicator of watermelon as listed in table 5 as shown dry matter accumulation has the largest weight followed by net photosynthetic rate 2 determination of object weights via the entropy method the entropy method is commonly used to determine the objective weight of each indicator this approach effectively reflects the information implied by the data and demonstrates strong operability he et al 2021 the entropy weight w ij of the j th subfactor is mainly determined as follows 6 w ij 1 e ij j 1 n 1 e ij 0 w ij 1 where eij 1 ln n i 1 n p ij ln p ij pij xij i 1 n x ij xij is the measured data i 1 n j 1 2 3 the objective weight of each indicator is obtained by calculation the largest objective weight is different for the two years with the number of leaves the largest in 2019 and stomatal conductance largest in 2020 table 5 3 combination weighting based on game theory to make the weight result more accurate and reliable the subjective weight and the objective weight are combined to obtain the comprehensive weight the main calculation steps are as follows 7 w k 1 m a k w k t where a k is the subjective weight w k is the objective weight using the comprehensive weights for both 2019 and 2020 dry matter accumulation is the most important indicator and net photosynthetic rate is the second table 5 3 3 3 evaluation of different condition of water nitrogen and co2 based on watermelon comprehensive growth the topsis method is widely used in multi objective evaluation with the advantages of being straightforward easier to understand more computational efficient in this study it used to comprehensively evaluate eight indicators of growth and photosynthesis and then rank the 12 treatments table 6 the main calculation was performed as follows wang et al 2011 ①normalization of growth and photosynthesis indicators 8 b b 11 b 1 n b m 1 b mn where bij x ij min x 1 j x mj max x 1 j x mj min x 1 j x mj i 1 2 m j 1 2 n ②determination of positive c and negative c ideal solutions the c and c are defined in terms of the normalized values c b1 b2 bj bn 9 max b ij j j 1 min b ij j j 2 i 1 2 m c b1 b2 bj bn 10 min b ij j j 1 max b ij j j 2 i 1 2 m where j 1 is a set of the greater the better growth and photosynthesis attributes and j 2 is a set of the smaller the better growth and photosynthesis attributes ③calculation of weighted euclidean distances the weighted euclidean distance d i between c i and positive ideal solution c 11 d i j 1 n w j b ij b j 2 i 1 2 m similarly the weighted euclidean distance di between c i and negative ideal solution c 12 d i j 1 n w j b ij b j 2 i 1 2 m where w j is the overall weight of jth attribute in respective to the comprehensive growth and photosynthesis of watermelon ④calculation of comprehensive growth and photosynthesis index for different treatments the relative closeness of growth and photosynthesis indicators vector of each treatment to the positive ideal solution is defined as the comprehensive growth and photosynthesis index e i 13 e i d i d i d i i 1 2 m note that 0 ei 1 c i c when ei 0 and c i c when ei 1 when e i is close to 1 watermelon had better comprehensive growth and photosynthesis the ranking results show that t9 is the top treatment giving optimal treatment of growth and photosynthesis followed by t5 in both years table 6 matlab software was carried out to draw a comprehensive evaluation value diagram fig 4 it can be seen for 400 ppm co2 the comprehensive evaluation value was best under upper middle level irrigation and increased with nitrogen levels in both years for 800 ppm co2 the comprehensive evaluation value was gradually increased with irrigation levels and was best under low nitrogen fertilizer in both years in general the change tendency in the two years was basically the same fig 4 3 4 correlation analysis between comprehensive growth and yield matlab software was performed to draw a yield diagram normalized data for two years fig 5 irrigation obviously affected yield in two years and under the two co2 concentrations yield improved with irrigation level table 3 and fig 5 there was a marked interactive effect of nitrogen and irrigation on yield in 2020 but this effect was not detected in 2019 the effects of co2 nitrogen and co2 irrigation on yield were opposite to the effect of the interaction of nitrogen and irrigation table 3 additionally at 400 ppm co2 the two year yield was better at a higher nitrogen level while at 800 ppm co2 the two year yield was basically higher at a lower nitrogen level all in all the optimal water nitrogen coupling area for the yield was basically the same in both years fig 5 it was recommended to set the water and nitrogen interval of more than 90 of the optimal value to ensure the applicability of the final results to actual production management from the simulation analysis the optimal strategy for yield were determined as follows at 400 ppm co2 115 120 ep irrigation and 976 07 1288 09 kg ha nitrogen fertilizer at 800 ppm co2 114 120 ep irrigation and 664 04 913 06 kg ha nitrogen fertilizer to explore the relationship between comprehensive growth and yield we established a linear simulation of the two indicators for both years fig 6 the results showed a good linear relationship between the comprehensive evaluation index and the final yield with a substantially similar trend seen for the two years fig 6 overall the linear results suggested that the higher the comprehensive evaluation value based on growth and photosynthesis the higher the yield therefore the optimal water and nitrogen management strategy for yield could be used as the recommended amount 4 discussion 4 1 effects of water and nitrogen coupling on growth of watermelon under co2 enrichment in this study we found that irrigation significantly promoted the number of leaves leaf area and dry matter accumulation with improvements in these three indicators under medium water and high water treatments in both years of the experiment table 3 and fig 2 this result can be supported by water deficit can cause a series of physiological changes in crops including stomata closure reduced photosynthesis reduced water potential of plants and damage to plant leaves talbi et al 2014 qiu et al 2021 the reason for this water deficit effect of is the decrease in nutrient solubility caused by the reduction of soil effective water content which inhibits the absorption of nutrients by crops thereby slowing down the growth of leaf area plant height and stem thickness resulting in a decrease in final biomass of crops niu et al 2013 nitrogen significantly affected the number of leaves and increased application of nitrogen dramatically improved the number of leaves under low irrigation conditions in two years table 3 and fig 2a dry matter accumulation was slightly increased by adding nitrogen fertilizer fig 2c this is consistent with studies showed that a moderate increase in the supply of nitrogen can also reduce the negative impact of insufficient water on plant nutrient absorption thereby promoting tomato plant growth and increasing plant leaf number leaf area plant height and stem thickness li et al 2019 studies have also shown significant effects of nitrogen application on the number of leaves of tomatoes and the total dry matter accumulation above ground of tomatoes increases first and then decreases with increased nitrogen application li et al 2019 this may be because excessive nitrogen application reduces the soil solute potential and water potential of the crop rhizosphere which hinders the transportation of crop water and nutrients thereby affecting the absorption of tissues nutrients and the formation of plant dry matter while a certain amount of nitrogen will improve the drought resistance of crops and promote the absorption of nutrients by plants li et al 2019 suitable nitrogen application directly promotes chlorophyll content speeds up light response and increases leaf protein content protein is the main component of enzymes so it is conducive to dark reactions and increases dry matter xia et al 2019 elevated co2 concentration may enable plants to intake more co2 to boost plant growth xu 2015 in this study we found a very strong co2 fertilization effect on the growth of watermelon as evidenced by enhanced number of leaves and dry matter accumulation with increasing co2 concentration from 400 ppm to 800 ppm table 3 and fig 2a and c this conclusion is consistent with co2 can promote the growth and yield of vegetables burkey et al 2012 and increase the number of leaves mckenzie et al 2016 the finding of a previous study that elevated co2 concentration markedly increased the plant biomass of potato by 30 50 mainly due to enhanced leaf photosynthesis and the depressed photorespiration under higher co2 concentration katny et al 2005 the coupling of water and nitrogen under co2 enrichment has a certain synergistic effect on crop growth our experimental results show that the number of leaves and dry matter accumulation under low nitrogen treatments were dramatically improved by co2 enrichment fig 2a and c these results are consistent with those of a study in cotton that found that increased co2 application significantly enhanced dry matter accumulation under moderate nitrogen fertilizers ning et al 2015 this is mainly because when the atmospheric co2 concentration elevates under reasonable nutrient supply the photosynthetic rate of the plant leaves increases and the stomatal conductance and transpiration decrease promoting a dramatically increase in plant biomass ning et al 2015 co2 supplementing could be used as a raw material for the dark reaction promotes the dark reaction appropriately and alleviates the limitation of low nitrogen on dry matter accumulation xia et al 2019 4 2 effects of water and nitrogen coupling on photosynthetic characteristics of watermelon under co2 enrichment increased irrigation and application of nitrogen fertilizer can significantly increase leaf nitrogen content thereby increasing the levels of leaf chlorophyll and photosynthetic key enzymes to improve the overall photosynthetic rate sun et al 2019 it has also been confirmed that the photosynthetic rate performed better under medium and high water treatments li et al 2021 in this study we found that irrigation greatly affected the net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate and stomatal conductance and the net photosynthetic rate was substantially better in medium and high irrigation than that achieved for low irrigation in both years tables 3 and 4 this is supported by the finding that water stress generally results in a decrease of leaf photosynthesis bencze et al 2014 as well as transpiration rate which was mainly due to stomatal limitation with stomatal closure salazar parra et al 2015 wang et al 2017 in addition previous studies have also shown that the inhibition of plant photosynthetic capacity under drought stress was the main reason for the reduction of stomatal conductance and intercellular co2 supply lawlor and cornic 2002 some previous studies found that enhanced co2 concentration can markedly stimulate leaf photosynthesis and increase plant growth drewry et al 2010 xu 2015 because elevated atmosphere co2 concentration increases plant intake of co2 for leaf photosynthesis ainsworth et al 2004 yu et al 2012 in this study we also found that elevated co2 concentration dramatically enhanced net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content and reduced transpiration rate and stomatal conductance table 4 the higher photosynthesis under co2 enrichment was driven by the acceleration of carboxylation and inhibition of oxygenation reaction through the modulation of rubisco activity at the chloroplast ainsworth and long 2005 while a decrease in canopy transpiration rate may cause by decreased plant stomatal conductance upon exposure to elevated co2 concentration kirschbaum and mcmillan 2018 locke et al 2013 for the role of co2 in water nitrogen coupling some researchers found the adverse effect of decreasing both the stomatal conductance and transpiration rate by water stress can be alleviated by elevated co2 concentration bencze et al 2014 robredo et al 2007 consistently we found that the net photosynthetic rate under low irrigation were promoted by elevated co2 concentration table 4 additionally we also found that the net photosynthetic rate of leaves under low nitrogen treatment was alleviated by increased co2 application table 4 this is likely because the effect of nitrogen on plant photosynthesis is mainly due to adverse effects of nitrogen on chloroplasts the photosynthetic organelles co2 enrichment can alleviate the effect of low nitrogen on chloroplast development for improved photosynthesis grigorova et al 2012 4 3 the effect of water and nitrogen coupling on watermelon yield under co2 enrichment yield is the final result of crop growth in this result only irrigation strongly impacted the yield in both years with substantially increased yield with increasing irrigation table 3 and fig 5 many studies have found that compared with deficit irrigation full irrigation can significantly increase yield kirda et al 2004 zegbe et al 2004 some studies also have shown that the yield of melon is higher when the irrigation is the largest cabello et al 2009 this is mainly because water deficit inhibits the expansion and division of pulp cells and the ability to absorb nutrients thereby reducing the single fruit weight and yield liu et al 2021 multi index comprehensive evaluation methods can reflect the overall situation of the evaluated things and provide effective means for people to correctly understand things and make scientific decisions nabavi pelesaraei et al 2018 in this study we performed comprehensive evaluation of watermelon growth and photosynthesis with final yield to explore the influence of the watermelon growth process on the final yield to improve the reliability and scientific of the weighting value and more accurately evaluate the overall growth of watermelon we perform combined weighting using subjective and objective weights we then comprehensively evaluated multiple indicators to determine the best production pattern for comprehensive growth and yield of watermelon we found the two year growth and photosynthetic comprehensive evaluation value and yield trends were roughly the same figs 4 and 5 furthermore a certain linear relationship between the comprehensive growth and the yield where higher comprehensive evaluation value corresponds to higher yield the trends were highly similar for the two years fig 6 5 conclusion except for ci and chlorophyll irrigation exhibited a promoting effect on other indicators of watermelon in two years especially yield was most strongly improved with increasing irrigation level and combined with the results of the two years the largest yields both appeared in the high water treatment the interaction of water and nitrogen dramatically affected the pn tr and ci and the interaction of the three factors significantly influenced the number of leaves dry matter accumulation and chlorophyll in two years the number of leaves dry matter accumulation pn and chlorophyll were significantly increased by co2 enrichment regarding the effect of water nitrogen coupling under co2 enrichment we found the growth of watermelon under low nitrogen was dramatically improved by co2 enrichment the biggest effect was on dry matter accumulation changes of 35 7 and 17 9 for the two years the pn in low irrigation was also promoted by elevated co2 concentration with increases of 36 9 and 31 1 in the two years the optimal water and nitrogen conditions required by each indicator were different the topsis method was used to comprehensive evaluate eight indicators of growth and photosynthetic and it was found that there was a good linear relationship between comprehensive growth and yield in this analysis dry matter accumulation had the largest combined weight followed by pn the results indicate an optimal recommended production plan of 115 120 ep irrigation 976 07 1288 09 kg ha nitrogen fertilizer for co2 concentration of 400 ppm and 114 120 ep irrigation 664 04 913 06 kg ha nitrogen fertilizer for co2 concentration of 800 ppm the optimal water and nitrogen management plan was determined based on high yield and its forming factors in this study the quality and other indicators could be further analyzed and considered in future research in addition factors such as climatic conditions and cultivation patterns would affect the application amounts of water and nitrogen in actual production but the method could be referred to as water and nitrogen management in other regions or other crops

9810,the accurate and efficient management of water and nitrogen is essential for the effective intensive production of greenhouse watermelon in order to determine the optimal application of water and nitrogen to promote the growth and yield of watermelon under the increasing co2 concentration in the future we conducted an experiment with 12 treatments over two growing seasons in 2019 and 2020 to evaluate the effects of water and nitrogen coupling on the growth photosynthesis and yield of watermelon under carbon dioxide co2 enrichment the treatments included three irrigation levels i1 80 evaporation ep i2 100 ep and i3 120 ep two nitrogen levels n1 644 04 kg ha and n2 1288 09 kg ha and two co2 concentrations c1 400 ppm and c2 800 ppm the experimental results show that except for intercellular co2 concentration ci and chlorophyll irrigation exhibited a promoting effect on other indicators in two years and yield was most strongly improved with increased irrigation the interaction of water and nitrogen dramatically affected the net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration rate tr and ci in two years elevated co2 concentration alleviated the negative effect of low nitrogen on the number of leaves dry matter accumulation pn and ci with the biggest improvement on dry matter accumulation changes of 35 7 and 17 9 for two years meanwhile elevated co2 concentration also promoted pn under low irrigation with increases of 36 9 and 31 1 in two years eight indicators of growth and photosynthesis were used to evaluate comprehensive growth based on technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution topsis and dry matter accumulation achieved the largest combined weight of 0 241 and 0 232 followed by pn a positive correlation was found between comprehensive growth and yield different treatments were effective for overall promotion of growth and yield with 115 120 ep irrigation 976 07 1288 09 kg ha nitrogen fertilizer optimal for watermelon at 400 ppm co2 concentration and 114 120 ep irrigation 664 04 913 06 kg ha nitrogen fertilizer best for 800 ppm co2 these results suggest for the expected future higher co2 concentrations greenhouse watermelon production should reduce application of nitrogen fertilizers to save resources but maintain full irrigation keywords water nitrogen coupling co2 watermelon growth photosynthesis yield 1 introduction there has been rapid development of the greenhouse cultivation of small watermelons with watermelon becoming a popular fruit variety cultivated in modern greenhouses and facilities garcía mendívil and sorribas 2021 as two essential nutrients for crop growth water and nitrogen fertilizer significantly affect the growth and yield of crops wang et al 2008 however in northwest china water resources are scarce and unreasonable irrigation and nitrogen application are more common hochmuth et al 2015 this caused environmental pollution and waste of resources and also affected the growth and nutrient absorption of plant thereby affecting the yield and quality of crop li et al 2019 kaab et al 2019 therefore scientific and reasonable water and nitrogen management is always worth exploring in the process of watermelon production the growth of watermelon is highly sensitive to nitrogen level du et al 2013 excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer will lead to an imbalance of plant root and shoot growth significantly reducing the yield and nitrogen fertilizer utilization efficiency and also causing environmental pollution liu et al 2005 although watermelon is tolerant to high temperature and drought it requires a large amount of water and water stress will hinder plant growth yavuz et al 2020 hernandez santana et al 2017 li et al 2020 a sufficient water supply can enhance water and nutrient uptake xia et al 2021 both soil moisture and nitrogen content affect plant growth by promoting photosynthesis which in turn determines plant dry matter accumulation to ultimately affect plant growth yield and quality li et al 2010 water nitrogen coupling studies also found that appropriate water supply can increase the nitrogen harvest index plaut et al 2004 xu et al 2010 and supplemental irrigation can increase stomatal opening and transpiration and enhance nitrogen transfer from senescing vegetative organs to reproductive organs liu et al 2005 in recent years widespread industrial discharges and automobile exhaust emissions have caused a gradual increase in the concentration of co2 in the atmosphere ipcc 2013 this concentration is predicted to exceed 550 μmol mol 1 by 2050 and reach 700 μmol mol 1 by the end of 2100 zhang et al 2018 although elevated co2 concentration can have a positive effect on crop growth especially for c3 crops wang et al 2020 and also can increase crop biomass and yield lenka et al 2019 long et al 2006 but it remains unclear what changes will happen to the impact of water nitrogen coupling on crop growth under co2 enrichment the goal of this study was to investigate the effect of co2 enrichment to modulate the effects of water and nitrogen coupling on growth photosynthesis and yield of watermelon cultivated in a greenhouse and establish a scientific comprehensive evaluation system of watermelon growth and photosynthesis by topsis method and then determine the most appropriate water and nitrogen management plan under different co2 concentrations based on the correlation analysis of yield and comprehensive growth the results of this work should provide a theoretical basis for rational irrigation and fertilization strategies for greenhouse production of watermelon with high co2 concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 test site and materials this experiment was performed in two plastic greenhouses 34 17 n 108 02 e in yang ling shaanxi province from may to july in 2019 and 2020 each greenhouse was 8 m long 4 m wide and 2 1 m high the experimental area is located in the hinterland of the guan zhong plain in the central part of shaanxi province with abundant light and heat resources and large temperature difference between day and night which is conducive to the cultivation of watermelon there is a small weather station hobo event logger onset computer corporation usa in the greenhouse which can simultaneously record temperature humidity and light radiation intensity lux

stress resistance ma et al 2013 in the experiment watermelon was cultivated with substrate and the basic physical and chemical properties of the substrate were measured before planting to calculate the actual nitrogen application amount table 1 according to the agronomic measures of local farmers double vine pruning was adopted and the main vine was selected for fruit retention the way to retain the melon was artificial pollination on the second and third female flowers of the main vine for each plant and only one left when the fruit grew to the size of an egg by discarding the weaker one ren et al 2021 2 2 experimental design this experiment manipulated three factors co2 concentration nitrogen application and irrigation the randomized split plot design was adopted with co2 concentrations

concentration detection recorder and two co2 concentrations were tested low co2 c1 400 ppm and high co2 c2 800 ppm the amount of nitrogen applied was determined based on the amount of nitrogen that a watermelon plant needs to absorb during its lifetime target yield method wang et al 2008 minus the amount of nitrogen present in the substrate and nutrient solution two nitrogen levels were tested low nitrogen n1 644 04 kg ha and high nitrogen n2 1288 09 kg ha the main calculation formula of the target yield method in this experiment is as follows 1 ty 1 n y where ty refers to the target yield kg

levels of irrigation were tested low water i1 80 ep intermediate water i2 100 ep and high water i3 120 ep the simplified formula used to calculate the amount of irrigation was the following 4 i a ep kcp where i is the amount of irrigation a is the surface area of the pot ep is the cumulative evaporation of φ20 cm standard evaporating pan and kcp is the evaporation pan coefficient 0 4 at the flowering and fruit setting stage 1 0 at the middle stage of the fruiting and 0 75 at the final stage of the fruiting drip irrigation was adopted with the frequency of once daily in addition we provided a nutrition solution of hoagland formula hoagland and arnon 1950 to ensure that the watermelon plants received sufficient nutrition during their growth period the whole experiment included a total of 12 treatments and 12 pots φ30 cm of watermelon per treatment with a minimum spacing of 50 cm between plant pots the cumulative irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer rates during the whole growth stage were showed in table 2 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 measuring plant growth growth indicators included leaf number leaf area and dry matter accumulation the number of leaves is the number of leaves on the main vine and is determined by manual counting to measure the leaf area leaves in the same leaf position on each plant are selected and photographed and then calculation of area from the images was performed using image j national institutes of health to measure dry matter accumulation the plant tissues were incubated in an oven temperature control range of 50 300 c volume of 650 l at 105 c for 40 min followed by incubation at 70 c until samples reached constant weight 2 3 2 measuring photosynthesis photosynthesis measurements included leaf net photosynthesis rate pn transpiration rate tr intercellular carbon dioxide ci stomatal conductance gs and chlorophyll content for measurement the third or fourth fully expanded leaf was attached to a portable photosynthesis measurement system li 6800 li cor inc during the ripening period absolute ethanol acetone and water volume ratio 4 5 4 5 1 was used for chlorophyll extraction and then a uv 2500 spectrophotometer shimadzu corporation japan was used for measurement measurements were performed three times 2 3 3 measuring yield one fruit was left per plant and the fruits were picked after ripening yield was calculated as the weight of all watermelons for each treatment and was converted to the weight per hectare 2 3 4 measuring the physical and chemical properties of the substrate nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen were

perform calculations analysis of variance was conducted using the statistical package spss 23 0 spss inc chicago il usa origin 2018 origin lab massachusetts usa and matlab 2018 mathworks usa were used to construct figures analytic hierarchy process ahp was executed using yaahp shanxi yuan juece software technology co ltd china entropy and topsis comprehensive evaluation methods were executed using excel 3 results 3 1 the effect of water nitrogen coupling on watermelon plant growth under co2 enrichment the experiment results showed that nitrogen irrigation co2 and the interaction of the three factors obviously affected the number of leaves in the two seasons of 2019 and 2020 and increased application of nitrogen dramatically improved the number of leaves there were higher numbers of leaves when the irrigation was at medium and high levels table 3 and fig 2a meanwhile the number of leaves in low nitrogen respectively increased by 13 5 and 11 5 with increasing co2 concentration from 400 ppm to 800 ppm overall t6 was the optimal treatment for the number of leaves in both years fig 2a for the experiments conducted in two years irrigation significantly promoted leaf area and the leaf area generally increased with increasing irrigation however elevated co2 concentration dramatically inhibited leaf area and the leaf area was reduced by 37 0 and 25 7 for the two years table 3 and fig 2b for both years plants subjected to t6 and t3 treatments resulted in the largest leaf area measurements which were 88 2 and 77 4 higher than the lowest treatments respectively fig 2b the dry matter accumulation was significantly affected by irrigation and analysis of the effect of the irrigation level revealed that the dry matter accumulation basically showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with increasing irrigation volume with best accumulation under medium irrigation at the same time the dry matter accumulation under low nitrogen treatments was increased by 35 7 and 17 9 in two years with elevating co2 concentration table 3 and fig 2c the interaction of the three factors also dramatically changed the dry matter accumulation and t8 treatments gave the largest dry matter accumulation in both years table 3 and fig 2c 3 2 the effect of water and nitrogen coupling on photosynthesis of watermelon leaves under co2 enrichment the results from the experiments in 2019 and 2020 showed that irrigation dramatically changed the pn of watermelon leaves and although the pn for plants treated with medium irrigation was lower by 1 9 than that for plants grown with high irrigation in 2019 considering the results for both years the pn was the best under medium irrigation table 4 the pn in low irrigation was significantly promoted by elevated co2 concentration and this effect was bigger under high nitrogen with increases of 36 9 and 31 1 for the two years meanwhile pn in low nitrogen was improved by increased co2 concentration increases with 15 9 and 32 8 table 4 additionally our three way anova results showed significant interactive effect of nitrogen and irrigation on the pn and t11 and t9 treatments gave the highest pn for the two years tables 3 and 4 the tr gradually enhanced with increasing irrigation and nitrogen slightly affected the tr in the two years and the three way anova results showed that co2 irrigation and nitrogen irrigation obviously changed the tr in both years meantime tr was dramatically decreased by 53 1 and 41 2 under co2 enrichment for the both years table 4 additionally tr showed a higher value in low nitrogen level than that for high nitrogen level at 800 ppm co2 concentration in both years for 400 ppm co2 t3 was the maximum treatment in 2019 but t6 was highest in 2020 for 800 ppm co2 t9 got the largest tr in both years tables 3 and 4 the ci was only markedly affected by nitrogen and the overall ci for two years under high nitrogen that were 12 3 and 17 6 higher than those under low nitrogen table 4 the interaction of nitrogen and co2 and the interaction between nitrogen and irrigation also had significant impact on ci table 3 at 400 ppm co2 ci was higher under high nitrogen with maximum values for both years for t6 however with enriched co2 ci under low nitrogen treatment was improved with t8 giving maximum values for both years table 4 irrigation obviously impacted the gs and the gs increased with the increase of irrigation volume however the gs was strongly decreased by 40 1 and 88 7 under elevated co2 concentration in 2019 and 2020 respectively table 4 there were significant nitrogen and interactive effects of nitrogen and co2 on the gs in 2019 and obvious effects of interaction between water and co2 and the interaction of water and nitrogen on the gs in 2020 table 3 in both years the gs was the largest for low nitrogen and high water and t3 treatment gave the maximum value at 400 ppm co2 and t9 gave the maximum value at 800 ppm co2 so the effect of water nitrogen coupling was not changed by co2 enrichment table 4 although the chlorophyll was only slightly affected by a single factor co2 and improved by 4 6 in both years with obvious interactive effects of irrigation and co2 and the interaction of three factors on chlorophyll tables 4 and 3 when the co2 concentration was 400 ppm t4 treatment was second best in 2019 best in 2020 with the best for overall performance considering both years different results were achieved at co2 concentration of 800 ppm with t9 and t12 best in 2019 and 2020 respectively the t9 and t4 treatments resulted in the highest chlorophyll content in 2019 and 2020 respectively values that were 34 4 and 28 2 higher those achieved by the lowest treatment of t2 in both years table 4 3 3 comprehensive evaluation of watermelon growth based on multiple indexes using topsis analysis of the above results revealed that different treatments were optimal for each indicator additionally the results were not completely consistent with the two years therefore to better determine the amount of water and nitrogen application we performed a comprehensive evaluation all eight indicators of growth and photosynthesis 3 3 1 construction of comprehensive evaluation system for watermelon growth yaahp software was used to establish a hierarchical model for comprehensive evaluation of watermelon fig 3 the characteristic of analytic hierarchy process ahp is to decompose the problem to be decided into several levels and calculate the ranking weight of each scheme relative to the overall goal of the decision making system which especially suitable for occasions of difficult in measuring the decision result directly and accurately neissi et al 2020 as the pigment of photosynthetic reaction centers chlorophyll plays a dual role in capturing light energy and separating the photovoltaic charge gerischer 1979 which can lead to the accumulation of dry matter and increased yield bhattarai et al 2004 some studies also have found that leaf area is determined mainly by photosynthesis while fruit yield is largely determined by leaf area so photosynthesis and leaf area are the main variables to control growth without curtailing the yield hernandez santana et al 2017 the indicators that characterize the watermelon growth belong to different categories while they all affect the final yield with different effects therefore the comprehensive growth index target layer x is divided into growth indicators x 1 and photosynthetic indicators x 2 in the model growth indicators include three sub factors of leaf number x 11 leaf area x 12 and dry matter accumulation x 13 photosynthetic indicators include five sub factors of net photosynthetic rate x 21 transpiration rate x 22 intercellular carbon dioxide x 23 stomatal conductance x 24 and chlorophyll x 25 3 3 2 determination of the weights of watermelon growth indicators 1 determination of subjective weights by analytic hierarchy process ahp the judgment matrix was constructed and the weight of each indicator was calculated each evaluation index was then compared in pairs using a scale of 1 9 with a judgment matrix a as follows 5 a a 11 a 1 n a m 1 a nn where a ij represents the importance of x i relative to that of x j to a the value of a ij is usually scored by experts in related fields or based on questionnaire survey data and a ij a ji 1 detailed calculation methods have been described previously karami 2006 the subjective weights were set for each indicator of watermelon as listed in table 5 as shown dry matter accumulation has the largest weight followed by net photosynthetic rate 2 determination of object weights via the entropy method the entropy method is commonly used to determine the objective weight of each indicator this approach effectively reflects the information implied by the data and demonstrates strong operability he et al 2021 the entropy weight w ij of the j th subfactor is mainly determined as follows 6 w ij 1 e ij j 1 n 1 e ij 0 w ij 1 where eij 1 ln n i 1 n p ij ln p ij pij xij i 1 n x ij xij is the measured data i 1 n j 1 2 3 the objective weight of each indicator is obtained by calculation the largest objective weight is different for the two years with the number of leaves the largest in 2019 and stomatal conductance largest in 2020 table 5 3 combination weighting based on game theory to make the weight result more accurate and reliable the subjective weight and the objective weight are combined to obtain the comprehensive weight the main calculation steps are as follows 7 w k 1 m a k w k t where a k is the subjective weight w k is the objective weight using the comprehensive weights for both 2019 and 2020 dry matter accumulation is the most important indicator and net photosynthetic rate is the second table 5 3 3 3 evaluation of different condition of water nitrogen and co2 based on watermelon comprehensive growth the topsis method is widely used in multi objective evaluation with the advantages of being straightforward easier to understand more computational efficient in this study it used to comprehensively evaluate eight indicators of growth and photosynthesis and then rank the 12 treatments table 6 the main calculation was performed as follows wang et al 2011 ①normalization of growth and photosynthesis indicators 8 b b 11 b 1 n b m 1 b mn where bij x ij min x 1 j x mj max x 1 j x mj min x 1 j x mj i 1 2 m j 1 2 n ②determination of positive c and negative c ideal solutions the c and c are defined in terms of the normalized values c b1 b2 bj bn 9 max b ij j j 1 min b ij j j 2 i 1 2 m c b1 b2 bj bn 10 min b ij j j 1 max b ij j j 2 i 1 2 m where j 1 is a set of the greater the better growth and photosynthesis attributes and j 2 is a set of the smaller the better growth and photosynthesis attributes ③calculation of weighted euclidean distances the weighted euclidean distance d i between c i and positive ideal solution c 11 d i j 1 n w j b ij b j 2 i 1 2 m similarly the weighted euclidean distance di between c i and negative ideal solution c 12 d i j 1 n w j b ij b j 2 i 1 2 m where w j is the overall weight of jth attribute in respective to the comprehensive growth and photosynthesis of watermelon ④calculation of comprehensive growth and photosynthesis index for different treatments the relative closeness of growth and photosynthesis indicators vector of each treatment to the positive ideal solution is defined as the comprehensive growth and photosynthesis index e i 13 e i d i d i d i i 1 2 m note that 0 ei 1 c i c when ei 0 and c i c when ei 1 when e i is close to 1 watermelon had better comprehensive growth and photosynthesis the ranking results show that t9 is the top treatment giving optimal treatment of growth and photosynthesis followed by t5 in both years table 6 matlab software was carried out to draw a comprehensive evaluation value diagram fig 4 it can be seen for 400 ppm co2 the comprehensive evaluation value was best under upper middle level irrigation and increased with nitrogen levels in both years for 800 ppm co2 the comprehensive evaluation value was gradually increased with irrigation levels and was best under low nitrogen fertilizer in both years in general the change tendency in the two years was basically the same fig 4 3 4 correlation analysis between comprehensive growth and yield matlab software was performed to draw a yield diagram normalized data for two years fig 5 irrigation obviously affected yield in two years and under the two co2 concentrations yield improved with irrigation level table 3 and fig 5 there was a marked interactive effect of nitrogen and irrigation on yield in 2020 but this effect was not detected in 2019 the effects of co2 nitrogen and co2 irrigation on yield were opposite to the effect of the interaction of nitrogen and irrigation table 3 additionally at 400 ppm co2 the two year yield was better at a higher nitrogen level while at 800 ppm co2 the two year yield was basically higher at a lower nitrogen level all in all the optimal water nitrogen coupling area for the yield was basically the same in both years fig 5 it was recommended to set the water and nitrogen interval of more than 90 of the optimal value to ensure the applicability of the final results to actual production management from the simulation analysis the optimal strategy for yield were determined as follows at 400 ppm co2 115 120 ep irrigation and 976 07 1288 09 kg ha nitrogen fertilizer at 800 ppm co2 114 120 ep irrigation and 664 04 913 06 kg ha nitrogen fertilizer to explore the relationship between comprehensive growth and yield we established a linear simulation of the two indicators for both years fig 6 the results showed a good linear relationship between the comprehensive evaluation index and the final yield with a substantially similar trend seen for the two years fig 6 overall the linear results suggested that the higher the comprehensive evaluation value based on growth and photosynthesis the higher the yield therefore the optimal water and nitrogen management strategy for yield could be used as the recommended amount 4 discussion 4 1 effects of water and nitrogen coupling on growth of watermelon under co2 enrichment in this study we found that irrigation significantly promoted the number of leaves leaf area and dry matter accumulation with improvements in these three indicators under medium water and high water treatments in both years of the experiment table 3 and fig 2 this result can be supported by water deficit can cause a series of physiological changes in crops including stomata closure reduced photosynthesis reduced water potential of plants and damage to plant leaves talbi et al 2014 qiu et al 2021 the reason for this water deficit effect of is the decrease in nutrient solubility caused by the reduction of soil effective water content which inhibits the absorption of nutrients by crops thereby slowing down the growth of leaf area plant height and stem thickness resulting in a decrease in final biomass of crops niu et al 2013 nitrogen significantly affected the number of leaves and increased application of nitrogen dramatically improved the number of leaves under low irrigation conditions in two years table 3 and fig 2a dry matter accumulation was slightly increased by adding nitrogen fertilizer fig 2c this is consistent with studies showed that a moderate increase in the supply of nitrogen can also reduce the negative impact of insufficient water on plant nutrient absorption thereby promoting tomato plant growth and increasing plant leaf number leaf area plant height and stem thickness li et al 2019 studies have also shown significant effects of nitrogen application on the number of leaves of tomatoes and the total dry matter accumulation above ground of tomatoes increases first and then decreases with increased nitrogen application li et al 2019 this may be because excessive nitrogen application reduces the soil solute potential and water potential of the crop rhizosphere which hinders the transportation of crop water and nutrients thereby affecting the absorption of tissues nutrients and the formation of plant dry matter while a certain amount of nitrogen will improve the drought resistance of crops and promote the absorption of nutrients by plants li et al 2019 suitable nitrogen application directly promotes chlorophyll content speeds up light response and increases leaf protein content protein is the main component of enzymes so it is conducive to dark reactions and increases dry matter xia et al 2019 elevated co2 concentration may enable plants to intake more co2 to boost plant growth xu 2015 in this study we found a very strong co2 fertilization effect on the growth of watermelon as evidenced by enhanced number of leaves and dry matter accumulation with increasing co2 concentration from 400 ppm to 800 ppm table 3 and fig 2a and c this conclusion is consistent with co2 can promote the growth and yield of vegetables burkey et al 2012 and increase the number of leaves mckenzie et al 2016 the finding of a previous study that elevated co2 concentration markedly increased the plant biomass of potato by 30 50 mainly due to enhanced leaf photosynthesis and the depressed photorespiration under higher co2 concentration katny et al 2005 the coupling of water and nitrogen under co2 enrichment has a certain synergistic effect on crop growth our experimental results show that the number of leaves and dry matter accumulation under low nitrogen treatments were dramatically improved by co2 enrichment fig 2a and c these results are consistent with those of a study in cotton that found that increased co2 application significantly enhanced dry matter accumulation under moderate nitrogen fertilizers ning et al 2015 this is mainly because when the atmospheric co2 concentration elevates under reasonable nutrient supply the photosynthetic rate of the plant leaves increases and the stomatal conductance and transpiration decrease promoting a dramatically increase in plant biomass ning et al 2015 co2 supplementing could be used as a raw material for the dark reaction promotes the dark reaction appropriately and alleviates the limitation of low nitrogen on dry matter accumulation xia et al 2019 4 2 effects of water and nitrogen coupling on photosynthetic characteristics of watermelon under co2 enrichment increased irrigation and application of nitrogen fertilizer can significantly increase leaf nitrogen content thereby increasing the levels of leaf chlorophyll and photosynthetic key enzymes to improve the overall photosynthetic rate sun et al 2019 it has also been confirmed that the photosynthetic rate performed better under medium and high water treatments li et al 2021 in this study we found that irrigation greatly affected the net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate and stomatal conductance and the net photosynthetic rate was substantially better in medium and high irrigation than that achieved for low irrigation in both years tables 3 and 4 this is supported by the finding that water stress generally results in a decrease of leaf photosynthesis bencze et al 2014 as well as transpiration rate which was mainly due to stomatal limitation with stomatal closure salazar parra et al 2015 wang et al 2017 in addition previous studies have also shown that the inhibition of plant photosynthetic capacity under drought stress was the main reason for the reduction of stomatal conductance and intercellular co2 supply lawlor and cornic 2002 some previous studies found that enhanced co2 concentration can markedly stimulate leaf photosynthesis and increase plant growth drewry et al 2010 xu 2015 because elevated atmosphere co2 concentration increases plant intake of co2 for leaf photosynthesis ainsworth et al 2004 yu et al 2012 in this study we also found that elevated co2 concentration dramatically enhanced net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content and reduced transpiration rate and stomatal conductance table 4 the higher photosynthesis under co2 enrichment was driven by the acceleration of carboxylation and inhibition of oxygenation reaction through the modulation of rubisco activity at the chloroplast ainsworth and long 2005 while a decrease in canopy transpiration rate may cause by decreased plant stomatal conductance upon exposure to elevated co2 concentration kirschbaum and mcmillan 2018 locke et al 2013 for the role of co2 in water nitrogen coupling some researchers found the adverse effect of decreasing both the stomatal conductance and transpiration rate by water stress can be alleviated by elevated co2 concentration bencze et al 2014 robredo et al 2007 consistently we found that the net photosynthetic rate under low irrigation were promoted by elevated co2 concentration table 4 additionally we also found that the net photosynthetic rate of leaves under low nitrogen treatment was alleviated by increased co2 application table 4 this is likely because the effect of nitrogen on plant photosynthesis is mainly due to adverse effects of nitrogen on chloroplasts the photosynthetic organelles co2 enrichment can alleviate the effect of low nitrogen on chloroplast development for improved photosynthesis grigorova et al 2012 4 3 the effect of water and nitrogen coupling on watermelon yield under co2 enrichment yield is the final result of crop growth in this result only irrigation strongly impacted the yield in both years with substantially increased yield with increasing irrigation table 3 and fig 5 many studies have found that compared with deficit irrigation full irrigation can significantly increase yield kirda et al 2004 zegbe et al 2004 some studies also have shown that the yield of melon is higher when the irrigation is the largest cabello et al 2009 this is mainly because water deficit inhibits the expansion and division of pulp cells and the ability to absorb nutrients thereby reducing the single fruit weight and yield liu et al 2021 multi index comprehensive evaluation methods can reflect the overall situation of the evaluated things and provide effective means for people to correctly understand things and make scientific decisions nabavi pelesaraei et al 2018 in this study we performed comprehensive evaluation of watermelon growth and photosynthesis with final yield to explore the influence of the watermelon growth process on the final yield to improve the reliability and scientific of the weighting value and more accurately evaluate the overall growth of watermelon we perform combined weighting using subjective and objective weights we then comprehensively evaluated multiple indicators to determine the best production pattern for comprehensive growth and yield of watermelon we found the two year growth and photosynthetic comprehensive evaluation value and yield trends were roughly the same figs 4 and 5 furthermore a certain linear relationship between the comprehensive growth and the yield where higher comprehensive evaluation value corresponds to higher yield the trends were highly similar for the two years fig 6 5 conclusion except for ci and chlorophyll irrigation exhibited a promoting effect on other indicators of watermelon in two years especially yield was most strongly improved with increasing irrigation level and combined with the results of the two years the largest yields both appeared in the high water treatment the interaction of water and nitrogen dramatically affected the pn tr and ci and the interaction of the three factors significantly influenced the number of leaves dry matter accumulation and chlorophyll in two years the number of leaves dry matter accumulation pn and chlorophyll were significantly increased by co2 enrichment regarding the effect of water nitrogen coupling under co2 enrichment we found the growth of watermelon under low nitrogen was dramatically improved by co2 enrichment the biggest effect was on dry matter accumulation changes of 35 7 and 17 9 for the two years the pn in low irrigation was also promoted by elevated co2 concentration with increases of 36 9 and 31 1 in the two years the optimal water and nitrogen conditions required by each indicator were different the topsis method was used to comprehensive evaluate eight indicators of growth and photosynthetic and it was found that there was a good linear relationship between comprehensive growth and yield in this analysis dry matter accumulation had the largest combined weight followed by pn the results indicate an optimal recommended production plan of 115 120 ep irrigation 976 07 1288 09 kg ha nitrogen fertilizer for co2 concentration of 400 ppm and 114 120 ep irrigation 664 04 913 06 kg ha nitrogen fertilizer for co2 concentration of 800 ppm the optimal water and nitrogen management plan was determined based on high yield and its forming factors in this study the quality and other indicators could be further analyzed and considered in future research in addition factors such as climatic conditions and cultivation patterns would affect the application amounts of water and nitrogen in actual production but the method could be referred to as water and nitrogen management in other regions or other crops

9811,the water markets as an institution for water demand and supply management has been extensively documented both theoretically and empirically the application of successful water market models of developed economies in developing economies has also gained much attention of the researchers and policy makers globally however the studies in different regions have stated a number of arguments both in favour and against the water markets as an economic instrument for water use efficiency and equity particularly in the irrigation sector the present study conducts a systematic review and meta analysis for identifying different ways in which the water markets impact irrigation water use in different regions and analyse the various factors of water markets that impact irrigation water use efficiency and equity the results show that all the studies that confirm the trade off between water use efficiency and equity are based on markets with inter sectoral trade specifically formal markets only about 27 of the reviewed studies found that both the objectives of equity and efficiency can be achieved simultaneously with water trading the impact of water markets on efficiency depends on five factors viz soft infrastructure institutional governance hard infrastructure physical water scarcity reliability trust in the water market system and social acceptance the difference in the very nature of the buyers and sellers in the formal and informal markets largely explains the difference in the functioning of the respective markets thus this study highlights the range of factors behind the heterogeneity in the results of the reviewed studies on the given theme that can support the policy makers in framing the customized water trading policies keywords water markets irrigation water use efficiency equity systematic review prisma 1 introduction the market based mechanisms and pricing approach to govern the water resources has gained much attention from policy makers and other stakeholders in recent times in developed countries like australia this approach is being followed in water scarce regions since the beginning of the 20th century the water market system in the developed countries was primarily formalized during the 1980s however the set of rules for the water market differs across countries because of their hydro geological system social structure institutional set up technical knowledge financial viability and information accessibility varady et al 2016 wheeler et al 2016 a number of studies have been conducted in the developed and developing economies to examine the structure and effectiveness of the different approaches singh and singh 2006 grafton et al 2010 palomo hierro et al 2015 bruno 2018 the research on the organized and formal markets like the rio grande region in the us shows that the water markets that put price and cap on water use can shift cropping pattern towards an average higher value or more water productive crops the farmers buying water in the rio grande region of the us resorted to more productive and non irrigated crops debaere et al 2020 the water trading helped the irrigators to respond to seasonal conditions and manage risk according to a study by fargher 2012 in the murray darling basin region of southern australia dairy farmers trade their water allocation 1 1 the allocation usage and transferability of the water user rights depend upon the doctrine that the economy follows the two major doctrines are riparian and appropriation doctrine under the riparian doctrine the individuals along the rivers have complete right to extract unlimited water given that the quantity and quality of water flowing back into the rivers is maintained and do not disturb the natural flow downstream the appropriation doctrine can be prior or proportional in the appropriation doctrine a fixed share of water is allotted as private property to the water users for a fixed period the difference between the two appropriation approach is in dealing with the scarcity in the prior appropriation doctrine the user rights issued on the later dates are cancelled first that is the priority is given to senior user rights in the time of shortage of water on the other hand in proportional appropriation system the total water is distributed proportionately among all the users in the system during scarcity grafton et al 2010 donohew 2009 to the horticulturists and get handsome returns at the time of drought the formal water markets in california us have served as a tool for private benefits and ecological gains the economic surplus with water trade 2 2 water trading under cap and trade system involved an authorised limit on the annual water extractions from the source in the form of allocated water user rights and trading of these rights grafton et al 2010 is over three times greater than that under the command and control system bruno 2018 the studies conducted in informal markets also conclude that water trading improves the water use efficiency among the farming community shah and ballabh 1997 manjunatha et al 2009 2016 wang et al 2016 razzaq et al 2019 with the growing research in this area several other dimensions like equity and sustainability are being explored to assess the overall impact of the water markets on the stakeholders in general and the farming community in particular the water trading provides a reliable source of irrigation water to the small and marginal farmers incapable of installing capital intensive water extraction mechanisms fujita and hossain 1995 shah and ballabh 1997 bjornlund and mckay 2002 manjunatha et al 2016 razzaq et al 2019 singh et al 2020 in the regions where farmers have no supply of surface water irrigation groundwater trading is an insurance against deficit rains moreover the studies find a higher yield amongst the water buyers in comparison to sellers and non participants shah and ballabh 1997 manjunatha et al 2016 saleth 1998 razzaq et al 2019 the insured source of irrigation enhances the crop intensity motivates farmers for perennial agriculture and provides employment to landless labourers in rural areas shah and raju 1988 meinzen dick and ali 1993 shah and ballabh 1997 manjunatha et al 2009 saleth 1998 thus there are empirical evidences supporting the equity benefits of water markets among the farmers however some researchers have traced another vital point that though the water trading enhances the equity and efficiency in water use the farmers with the traditional form of irrigation are crowded out from farm business from these markets they are not only at a loss technologically but also economically they can neither afford the cost of deep tube wells nor earn any surplus income like farmers with water extraction machines shah and raju 1988 sarkar 2011 another study on social economic and community impacts of water markets in southern australia by edwards et al 2008 highlights the negative impact of water trading on a particular irrigation community he finds that people with water entitlements 3 3 the long term water rights are called the water entitlements or nominal water share and the short term water rights are called as water allocations or actual water share the allocations are some proportion of entitlements that are variable in nature depending upon the availability of water in the basin breviglieri et al 2018 are selling water in water deficit regions to exchange for higher returns and leave the farm jobs this practice has led to limited water left for the local farmers and has contracted the region s economic opportunities the studies in different regions have stated many arguments both in favour and against the water markets as an institution for water demand and supply management while some studies support water markets as an effective instrument in improving the economic status of small and marginal farmers zhang et al 2008 manjunatha et al 2009 razzaq et al 2019 other studies reveal the rising inequalities among the farming community because of these markets edwards et al 2008 hadjigeorgalis 2008 bauer 2004 bruno 2018 mukherji 2004 singh and singh 2006 wang et al 2014 sarkar 2011 breviglieri et al 2018 states as institutions markets are humanly devised rules embedded in a social and political context and do not always lead to efficient or effective solutions for the management of resources the researches on the impact of water markets on water use efficiency and equity focus mainly on country specific empirical studies narrative comparison of two or three developed water markets identifying the factors required for successful water markets through thematic analysis review studies based on narratives gis and modelling in this article we intend to do a systematic review quantitatively through meta analysis identifying the impact of formal and informal markets on irrigation water use efficiency and the factors influencing these impacts thereof we address the following questions do the water markets impact equity and efficiency in irrigation water use or is there a trade off between the two objectives how do irrigation water markets impact water use efficiency does the impact on efficiency and equity differ for formal and informal markets what factors influence irrigation efficiency and equity in different water markets it is important to note that irrigation water rights 4 4 a legal authority to take water from a water body and to retain the benefits of its use the nature of such rights varies greatly they are referred to in different jurisdictions as licences concessions permits access entitlements or allocations productivity commission 2004 share a major stake in the majority of the water markets for instance the share of agriculture water withdrawals in the total water withdrawals in chile australia india and china is around 83 63 90 and 64 respectively 5 5 http www fao org aquastat en as discussed above these markets may impact both equity and efficiency in irrigation water use simultaneously but there is also a trade off between them the definition and measurement of water use efficiency varies across disciplines stanhill 1986 in the present context the water use efficiency is defined as the economic efficiency of water use by achieving maximum output with given level of water input and at minimum cost economic efficiency is also defined as the product of technical efficiency that is maximum possible output at given level of input and allocative efficiency which means minimizing the cost of inputs in a production process qureshi et al 2011 manjunatha et al 2016 further equity is defined as distributive efficiency by allocating the resources according to who need them the most the present study uses the concept of equity in terms of equal opportunity gains to all the stakeholders involved in the water trade dinar et al 1997 access of water to resource poor farmers shah and ballabh 1997 equal access of water to all irrespective of economic status bauer 2004 razzaq et al 2019 inter sectoral equity in water access rosegrant and binswanger 1994 we extract the different ways in which the water markets impact irrigation water use in different regions further these impacts are not only influenced by the economic dimensions in silos but also by multiple factors such as hydro geological status socio cultural norms political variables types of water rights proportionate riparian priority based or mixed etc and governing institutions fig 1 presents the framework of this study indicating the critical factors and variables 2 methodology we follow the guidelines of preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma to conduct a systematic review on the theme the databases for reviewing literature included scopus science direct jstor and web of science 07 08 july 2020 we excluded google scholar for our study due to many results and even after multiple search string trials there were ample irrelevant studies after multiple iterations the finalized search phrase is water markets and equity and efficiency and agriculture or irrigation for identification of the relevant literature the inclusion criteria included 1 journal articles in the english language in peer reviewed journals 2 original or empirical researches 2 subject area economics water resource management agricultural economics environment and development studies broadly in all the mentioned databases further for screening and eligibility the articles were excluded based on the following criteria 1 impact study based on simulations 2 did not assess direct impact of water trading on irrigation water use 3 review articles and 4 any grey literature to identify all the relevant literature the list of references in all the finalized articles was checked and the eligible articles were included in the final list for data extraction the prisma flowchart summarising the search results and screening workflow is shown in fig 2 the present study deals explicitly with the cases where water trading takes place therefore all the studies that focused on water pricing as a tool for water use efficiency are excluded from this review since in many regions of the world the local or central authority set water prices but do not allow water trading for example israel moreover in the informal markets like india the groundwater pricing in trade is individually determined on the basis of electricity tariff or fixed cost of installation shah and raju 1988 singh and singh 2006 shah and chowdhury 2017 the studies included in the review range from the year 1988 2020 we do not apply the time period filter since the implementation of water user rights and water trading in different economies differ significantly for instance in australia water trading related reforms began in the 1980s and water act was introduced in 2007 6 6 www agriculture gov au water markets history whereas in the west usa reforms started in the late 1880s hanemann 2014 2 1 data extraction and coding we apply the inductive approach to identify the variables defining the different economic efficiency and equity impacts of water markets on irrigation water use these variables are broadly classified into four categories namely water use efficiency equity inefficiency and inequity the efficiency category includes the findings of reviewed studies on how water trading impacts the water use efficiency the equity category defines how transacting water or water rights ensure equity in the farming community in the inefficiency category we include the variables that explain both the inefficiency in irrigation water use as a result of water availability through trade and the market inefficiencies that hinder the efficient use of water as evident from the studies cited in the previous section the water markets can be a factor for inequity among the farming community this dimension has been covered by the variables extracted under the inequity category further categorical coding was done to identify the factors unique in all the studies based on institutional socio economic and climatic factors 3 results this section is divided into five parts the first part presents an overview of 26 reviewed papers which includes the frequency of studies from different countries and a summarised description of various institutional economic and physical factors the subsequent parts address the research questions posed in this study 3 1 description of reviewed papers we analysed the frequency of studies on water markets across the globe during the period 1980 2020 which is shown in fig 3 it shows that 22 of the studies are from australia specifically from the murray darling basin region this basin is widely studied due to the successful implementation of a water user rights system and water trading at a large scale asian continent shares 53 of studies on the theme out of which 42 are from the emerging economies beyond the asian continent including chile a fare share 39 is from emerging economies of world eleven studies 29 are from different regions in india four studies 10 each are from the western usa and northern china to avoid the complexity in the analysis we have not added the sub regions in this figure but the regional differences examined in the reviewed studies are referred in the discussion section fig 4 shows a summary of institutional factors in different countries the total number of studies on formal semi formal 7 7 semi formal markets have been defined to categories the water economies that are in transitioning stage from informal to formal or are experimenting with the formal market models and informal markets are 16 4 and 17 respectively the implementation of water users rights differs within a country due to studies based on other basins or completely different regions for instance in australia as concluded by three studies based on the southern part of the mdb basin wheeler et al 2014a 2014b wheeler and garrick 2020 the implementation of water users rights wurs are highly effective whereas three studies on goulborn murray irrigation district in victoria found it effective brooks and harris 2008 bjornlund and mckay 2002 hadjigeorgalis 2008 and one of the studies in the north mdb wheeler et al 2014b reported partially effective in implementation the wurs implementation category is not applicable in seventeen studies on informal markets due to private ownership of groundwater traded in the case of canal irrigation in these regions the wurs or more specifically the allocated water is not tradable different countries follow different water rights doctrine and governance structure irrespective of the type of water market in the usa and chile riparian and prior appropriation doctrine is followed and that in spain is priority based in china s case although all four studies were on northern china irrigation water use two of them analysed the impact of water markets where water users rights and trading were implemented as a pilot project moore 2015 zhang 2007 and two studies assessed the impact of the informal water market wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2008 in the case of economic factors as indicated in fig 5 none of the studies is from a low income country the size of the bubble shows the level of infrastructure in water markets it indicates that high income countries have advanced levels of infrastructure all the studies in a particular country find a similar infrastructure the water banking system is well developed in the western usa only the studies in other high income countries mention the development of water exchanges or water move in australia and inter and intra sectoral trading australian government instituted the water exchanges or water move for smooth water trading but water banks are not in the system as per the literature reviewed spain has water banks but they are functional only during exceptional circumstances or droughts palomo hierro et al 2015 among the lower middle income countries only south africa has implemented the national water law where both inter and intra sectoral water trade infrastructure are active in certain regions all the studies in india bangladesh and pakistan indicate the informal and unorganized nature of water markets based mainly on local transactions as presented in fig 4 these countries have private ownership of water beneath their lands that is unbundled land and water rights fig 6 shows the physical factors of the specific regions of countries covered in the reviewed papers all the formal water economies that is australia usa chile and spain have a semi arid climate south africa and china water market regions have an arid climate in india s case eight studies are from tropical dry and wet regions shah and raju 1988 diwakara and nagaraj 2003 kajisa and sakurai 2005 manjunatha et al 2016 yashodha 2020 pant 2005 shah et al 2009 deepak et al 2005 two studies are from arid and semi arid regions singh et al 2020 sharma and sharma 2006 and one of the studies is conducted in a tropical monsoon climate region shah and ballabh 1997 further studies of pakistan razzaq et al 2019 shah et al 2009 qureshi et al 2003 meinzen dick and ali 1993 and bangladesh mottaleb et al 2019 fujita and hossain 1995 shah et al 2009 are also from tropical dry and wet regions the marked labels on the map show the sources of irrigation in the water market regions and several studies in the bracket six studies in south western australia are from the regions with both surface and groundwater access wheeler et al 2014a 2014b grafton et al 2014 wheeler and garrick 2020 debaere et al 2014 bjornlund and mckay 2002 and two cases studied the regions with only surface water availability brooks and harris 2008 hadjigeorgalis 2008 in the western usa all four studies report both surface and groundwater availability debaere et al 2014 thompson et al 2009 bjornlund and mckay 2002 howitt 1994 in most of the regions both surface and groundwater are available as a source of irrigation however the variable major source of irrigation is important here since in maximum cases despite the availability of both the sources more than 80 of irrigation is done through either surface water or groundwater 3 2 equity and efficiency in irrigation water use of water market and their trades off out of 37 studies 18 studies confirm the positive impact of water trading on efficiency and equity refer table 1 however eight studies out of the 18 studies find some form of inequity along with the equity factor refer table 5 so effectively we can say that only 10 studies confirm both efficiency and equity impacts in the case of trade off four studies show a clear trade off between efficiency and equity objectives interestingly although all the studies concur that water markets positively impact irrigation water use efficiency in some form or the other 16 studies report that these markets can also lead to inefficient water use in agriculture 3 3 impact of irrigation water markets on its water use efficiency as mentioned in the section 3 1 we extracted a number of indicators that explain the impact of water markets on irrigation water use efficiency the maximum number of studies n 15 find that water markets lead to an increase in water productivity refer table 1 these studies show that in comparison to the non participants the output per unit of water is high among the water market participants the second major indicator is change in the cropping pattern by shifting from low value crop to high value crop n 13 the third significant impact is the adoption of on farm effective technology n 8 the water trading provides the incentive to adopt better irrigation technology to the buyers for economising water consumption in agriculture and the sellers for gains from trading the surplus water another significant indicator is the transfer of water from low value to high value use n 8 the regions facilitating the inter sectoral trade or trade from staple crops to horticulture and dairy farming have shown such impact specifically further four studies conclude that water trading increases the cropping intensity by providing a reliable water source for irrigation in dry seasons change in cropping pattern from high water intensive to low water intensive crops is identified by four studies in order to reduce the expenses in response to high water price the buyers tend to cultivate crops that require less irrigation these studies also report the reduction in other inputs use n 3 specifically in the case of the water buyers category further investment in infrastructure to reduce conveyance loss was found only in two studies 3 4 impacts of formal and informal water markets on the efficiency and equity in the previous section we discussed different ways at which the water markets impact the water use efficiency in agriculture and the frequency of each impact with reference to the number of studies reviewed however these results are influenced by multiple factors in this section we intended to examine if the frequency and nature of efficiency and equity factors differ in different market types table 2 summarises the efficiency factors identified within the different market types in the formal markets the transfer of water from low value use to high value use is dominant but it is not found in the informal markets except in a study by diwakara and nagaraj 2003 where the water transfer was prominent from peri urban to urban areas all types of water market show a positive impact on water productivity few studies that did not find the positive impact of water trading on average water use have also explained the reason for it for instance bauer 1997 states that although in chile the water allocation system has incentivized the shift from low value to high value crop the high transaction cost and other barriers limit the scope for water transactions the study does not find any significant improvement in water productivity per se along with high water use efficiency in the buyers category three studies from china moore 2015 and india kajisa and sakurai 2005 manjunatha et al 2016 show the reduced consumption of other inputs which further promotes less water consumption however this impact is not visible in the case of formal and semi formal markets another significant impact of water market type is noticeable in the way the cropping pattern changes in the formal markets farmers tend to shift from low value to high value crops whereas in the case of informal markets some studies singh et al 2020 shah et al 2009 deepak et al 2005 shah and raju 1988 found the shift from high water intensive to low water intensive crops by the buyers further there is evidence of the adoption of on farm technology for efficient water use majorly in the formal and semi formal markets it can be related to farmers economic viability in the high income countries and reliable returns on investment in water trading in organized market system on similar lines investment in conveyance infrastructure to save the water traded is found in the formal markets only in australia and the usa where water governance is highly effective bjornlund and mckay 2002 hadjigeorgalis 2008 thompson et al 2009 wheeler et al 2014a in case of informal markets shah et al 2009 reports the investment on water saving technologies and conveyance infrastructure by the small land holding farmers to minimize the cost of irrigation in response to rise in irrigation water price to study the interdependence of the water market type and efficiency factor we also conducted the fisher exact test since both the variables are of nominal category chi square test was not possible in our case due to less number of samples per factor the fisher exact test shows a highly significant interdependence between these two variables at 1 significance level table 3 shows the factors extracted from reviewed literature on equity impacts of water markets in irrigation as mentioned in the previous section not many studies have focused on the equity dimension of the water markets it is evident from the number of black dots that most studies in the informal markets discussed the equity aspect directly or indirectly we can assess the difference in equity dimension across market types from the table in the case of formal markets although there are results on high agricultural productivity among the buyers category but no case in sellers or both categories on the other side studies in informal markets report all three categories in different regions notably in a majority of the cases n 17 the major source of water in these markets is groundwater see fig 6 moreover the second and third factors prominent in informal markets also reflect the same difference therefore the very nature of the buyers and sellers differ in formal informal and semi formal markets another critical factor that promotes equity is the generation of employment opportunities in the water importing regions in the formal markets and the same local region in the informal markets some of the studies focused on the buyers bargaining power or market structure as an important determinant of equity in the water markets bjornlund and mckay 2002 kajisa and sakurai 2005 shah and raju 1988 we term it as balanced bargaining power relationship referring to the market s non monopolistic nature where all the participants get a fair deal through mutual consent organized structure or through the governing bodies in the case of formal markets like australia and the usa water banks and water exchanges ensure a better price for both parties some of the studies in india provide evidence of balanced bargaining power among buyers and sellers in the regions where either the buyers have higher bargaining power due to alternative sellers or both the parties agree to a mutual price due to social and cultural reasons kajisa and sakurai 2005 we also run fisher s exact test for market type and equity factor the results show the significant interdependence at 10 significance level 3 5 factors influencing efficiency and equity in different water markets from the above results it can be clearly inferred that the efficiency factor differs in different markets even in the case of equity only the studies on informal markets have highlighted the equity impact among the farming community explicitly in this objective we identify specific factors that result in these differences it is essential to state here that there can be several other reasons like political and cultural differences but they have not been captured in this review before defining the results of this objective it is imperative to specify the water use inefficiencies and market inefficiencies identified in different economies it is so because despite similar institutional physical and economic factors the studies recorded the different impacts thus table 4 shows the country wise inefficient factors with the number of studies for each case to solve the aforementioned problem these factors have been discussed in the following sub sections 3 5 1 water use efficiency a number of studies have summarized the determinants of the efficient water markets system wheeler and garrick 2020 grafton et al 2011 wheeler et al 2016 as only journal articles are considered for this study all other studies on the domain have not been added to the reviewed list a thorough examination of studies conducted on this dimension shows numerous layers of factors that contribute to the efficiency results wheeler and garrick 2020 have comprehensively listed the factors that result in the difference between the water trading frequency and impacts on the community in smdb and nmdb australia it is important to emphasize that despite an organized water governance framework in the formal water markets the difference in impacts is still a major research area we have segregated our findings into five broad categories physical scarcity of water is the common factor in all studies n 36 except one study from india s tropical monsoon climate region shah and ballabh 1997 therefore all the heads have this common determinant 3 5 1 1 physical water scarcity but lack of governance no governance poor governance under this category governance means establishing a well defined framework and structure defining the power relationships and the process of policy formulation decision making and accountability unesco 2008 the lack of governance or poor governance was found majorly in semi formal markets two studies from china zhang 2007 moore 2015 and south africa each nieuwoudt et al 2005 nieuwoudt and armitage 2004 fall under this category all the studies in developing economies suggest the case of no governance that defines the informal markets further a particular governance structure cannot be attributed to efficiency or equity in water use as shown in fig 4 implementation of the water user rights can be ineffective even in the case of a decentralized governance structure in china s case moore 2015 and zhang 2007 shows that despite the introduction of a decentralized system the wurs implementation proved ineffective although successful water market models operating in the usa and australia are under mixed and decentralized systems this strategy is not effective in implementing the wur system in all the economies conclusively one of the determinants which impact this difference is poor governance china experimented with the formal market system with a decentralized structure but the studies report the lack of monitoring and accountability for an ineffective water market system moore 2015 zhang 2007 even in australia nmdb region wheeler and garrick 2020 shows the ineffective wurs implementation and one of the reasons quoted is lack of water use monitoring and enforcement system thus poor governance is a prominent factor explaining the differences in the efficiency results 3 5 1 2 physical water scarcity but institutional barriers in the mature water economies there is an organized and defined water governance system however these economies are also prone to some institutional fallacies that lead to water market inefficiencies and water use inefficiency thereof the institutional barriers are defined by any policy regulation or organizational structure that inhibits the smooth functioning of the water market functioning a majority of the studies from formal markets fall under this category high transaction cost is a significant factor that highlights the institutional drawbacks in implementing water rights trading effectively transaction cost includes cost of information bargaining enforcement and contracting hearne and easter 1997 garrick et al 2013 high transaction cost negates the efficiency gains from the water markets bjornlund and mckay 2002 wheeler and garrick 2020 reports that water markets in western usa are less efficient and active in comparison to australia as the transactions are complex and involve huge cost to the irrigators due to ownership of water rights with the irrigation districts in the former country barriers to trade is another major factor in spain s case palomo hierro et al 2015 find that the trade is restricted to only equivalent or high priority users and no trade is permitted from non consumptive to consumptive use in the case of nmdb in australia wheeler and garrick 2020 one of the significant institutional barriers is non transferable rights since many rivers and a third of water licenses are unregulated debaere et al 2014 states that lack of transparency in information on water availability and price listing leads to inefficiency in water market functioning since the buyers and sellers are unable to determine whether trading their water rights is economically viable or not thus asymmetric information among the market participants is another institutional barrier that hinders efficient use of water lack of hard infrastructure is another major determinant in the formal market set up in china moore 2015 zhang 2007 and the other established formal markets lack of water storage and water exchange centers which leads to high transaction cost has been found in some studies brooks and harris 2008 hearne and easter 1997 hard infrastructure is the key to have a free flow of water exchange and information exchange not all formal water economies have water banks or exchange centers for regular trade for instance spain has water banks but they are active only during droughts palomo hierro et al 2015 3 5 1 3 physical water scarcity but lack of social acceptance not many studies have identified this dimension one of the studies from smdb australia finds a strong social acceptance of the water reforms as a major factor for water trading success in the efficient irrigation water uses wheeler and garrick 2020 on differences in water market impacts in smdb and nmdb australia finds that the system is not trustworthy and politically not acceptable in the latter and hence lesser trade frequency there wheeler and garrick 2020 the lack of trust in the water market governance is crucial in the non acceptability of water trading as a regular activity in northern china formal markets moore 2015 there has been social resistance even on the metering of tube wells in china bauer 1997 recorded that people in some parts of chile finds the market logic for water as inappropriate since it is scarce and vital for survival moreover brooks and harris 2008 in their study in australia s gmid victoria region highlights the structural changes in the rural economy due to water trading the trading activities in this region accelerate in times of higher scarcity resulting in high water prices consequently eliminating the small farming community of the low value crop cultivators it also creates resistance in the local community to trade the water entitlements permanently and puts social restrictions on the interested water sellers these findings underscore the importance of social acceptance more broadly we can say that local customary laws may have a critical role in the effectiveness and sustainability of the water markets in the water use efficiency 3 5 1 4 physical water scarcity but other hydro geological differences this factor indicates the feasibility of water market operations due to hydro geological factors despite physical water scarcity the rivers are connected in some of the water trading regions however the poor connectivity of rivers and the difference in water quality is a dominant hindrance in water trading in some of the regions bjornlund and mckay 2002 brooks and harris 2008 along with the host of reasons mentioned above this is also the case with nmdb in australia the rivers in the nmdb are not hydro geologically connected like in smdb therefore the farming community is more dependent upon unregulated groundwater in nmdb in gmid victoria the water is highly saline in west gmid that makes trade from east to west possible not the other way round the studies show that due to the difference in the quality of water and land in the gmid the water moved from low to high productivity areas and high value use bjornlund and mckay 2002 brooks and harris 2008 in the case of informal market regions like indian states since the water transactions are local the hydro geological differences do not impact the water trading and efficiency as in the formal markets this factor is found significant in regional trade for the determination of water price which further impacts the water use efficiency among the buyers and sellers category the sellers tend to charge a higher price if no other irrigation alternative is available or groundwater is not easily accessible 3 5 2 equity factor the equity component is majorly discussed in the informal water markets studies as shown in table 3 the difference in wurs doctrine and the institutional framework of formal and informal markets explain why some of the key results extracted from the review are mentioned under this head one of the factors traced in the literature is the difference in the type of buyers and sellers in respective market types the buyer in the formal markets are mostly the high value crop cultivators horticulturists or dairy farmers who have big estates in agriculture and the sellers are the farmers who have low quality lands low value crop cultivation or higher opportunity cost of agriculture in comparison to selling water rights thompson et al 2009 wheeler et al 2014a palomo hierro et al 2015 the scenario is entirely different in the case of informal and to some extent in the semi formal markets the buyers in these markets are the marginal and small farmers who cannot afford to install the tube wells or water extraction mechanisms meinzen dick and ali 1993 bjornlund and mckay 2002 singh and singh 2006 pant 2005 another critical factor is the mechanism of water pricing it is determined from the results that major factor that leads to inequitable market conditions like loss of land and water rights of water selling community in the formal water economies refer table 5 is the water pricing mechanism in the regions where water prices are either unregulated or freely determined by monopolistic entities the buyers are penalized by high prices sharma and sharma 2006 qureshi et al 2003 singh et al 2020 shah and raju 1988 they tend to lose a significant chunk of their income in the case of informal markets like india and sellers with low value crops are driven out of the irrigation community in the case of formal markets in the latter case the inter sectoral wurs transfer due to high returns specifically during droughts also leads to large scale unemployment in the water exporting regions howitt 1994 hearne and easter 1997 wheeler et al 2014b the aggressive trading practices in the formal markets during droughts are the key factor leading to inequity among the farming community in the long run however it is important to note that the very concept of water markets is to economise the water use by allocating it to the highest returning activities 4 discussion based on the above results less than 50 of the 37 selected papers find that the equity and efficiency objectives can be achieved simultaneously with water trading all the studies that confirm the trade off between water use efficiency and equity are based on markets with inter sectoral trade specifically formal markets in the informal market diwakara and nagaraj 2003 find the inequity factor due to water trade from rural to urban areas it is important to note that not many studies explicitly deal with the equity factor we looked into the conclusions and observations of the reviewed papers and coded the equity factors the results on this dimension alone cannot determine whether the water markets promote efficiency and equity or trade off between the two objectives water trading impacts water use efficiency in multiple ways and results on the second objective explicitly show different impacts examined in the reviewed studies the majority of studies confirming the increase in water productivity of the water market participants underscores the markets role in the efficient water allocation however bjornlund and mckay 2002 point out that the proceeds from sold water are not used by most of the sellers to further improve their irrigation efficiency in some regions farmers sell the water rights far below the value of the marginal product of water keeping land fallow and clearing their debt from sales howitt 1994 on the other hand buyers tend to save money by investing in effective technologies howitt 1994 hearne and easter 1997 grafton and horne 2014 manjunatha et al 2016 most of the studies in australia find that a higher price during the drought period results in effective water conservation technologies and higher water productivity among buyers it highlights that less water use for given output in the sellers case is mainly due to economic returns and in the case of buyers it is due to economic savings we also observe that the mere functioning of water markets cannot serve the purpose it is equally crucial that water pricing serves the economic as well as ecological purposes in the case of both sellers and buyers another important efficiency factor is the change in cropping pattern a significant number of studies show the shift from low value to high value crop but surprisingly only one study reported a shift from high water intensive to low water intensive crop if we look at the broader picture this may be due to water availability through trading itself that facilitates the farmers to prefer the crops based on economic value rather than the water input factor we identify the major difference in this factor among formal and informal water economies due to institutional factors that have been discussed in the subsequent paragraphs the transfer of water from low value use to high value use shows the allocative efficiency of water markets five studies that too from formal economies find this impact however it is important to mention that some of the studies reporting this factor also find that inter sectoral trading in times of severe scarcity has led to structural changes in the agrarian economy leaving the inefficient or small and medium sized farmers out of this sector hearne and easter 1997 wheeler et al 2014b brooks and harris 2008 an increase in cropping intensity in some studies shows how the same water unit which is applied for a higher level of total production due to water trading would otherwise be consumed for low production levels this factor corresponds to better water productivity in the case of the market participants the farmers engaged in water trading are found to use the water more optimally meinzen dick and ali 1993 shah and raju 1988 manjunatha et al 2016 razzaq et al 2019 in case of differences in efficiency and equity impacts in formal and informal markets we observe some key differences in these two market conditions a shift from low value use to high value use is prominent only in the case of formal markets we can infer from the above results figs 4 and 5 that this trend is due to inter sectoral and convenient water transfers in long distances in the formal markets and transferable water user rights system in informal markets there are only local transactions with private ownership of water by farmers beneath their lands or canal irrigation although an increase in irrigation water productivity is recorded in most of the studies it is also noted that there are several bottlenecks in this case high transaction cost lack of infrastructure lack of complete information and barriers to inter sectoral or inter regional trade paralyze the efficient allocation of water howitt 1994 brooks and harris 2008 wheeler et al 2014b grafton and horne 2014 reduced consumption of other inputs is observed in the case of informal markets only it is apparently due to the difference in the nature of transactions in both the markets since the water in the formal market is traded at the inter sectoral level the buyers may not necessarily belong to the agriculture sector only the farmers in informal markets like india do not have much incentive to shift the cropping pattern due to several factors for instance the government s minimum support price is not attractive for other crops or there is more risk associated with horticulture since it requires well equipped support systems like cold stores which are not available near all the villages an increase in cropping intensity is more evident in informal markets since the small and marginal farmers in these markets get a reliable source of irrigation through local water trade looking at the water user rights we observe that the individual ownership makes it lucrative for the sellers farmers with tube wells to share water with the neighbouring farmers buyers without tube wells since small and marginal farmers can rely on tube well owners for water irrespective of the crop season their farms cropping intensity increases leading to higher income thereof adoption of on farm technologies and investment in conveyance infrastructure is evident in the high income countries with highly effective governance this impact specific to the formal economies can be anticipated due to the farmers financial viability in high income countries nevertheless the large scale agriculture in these economies ensures much higher returns on investment than in developing economies like india in case of the difference in formal and informal water markets on equity quotient we note that there is not much focused research on this dimension in the reviewed studies as discussed above the difference in the institutional physical and economic factors makes the very nature of the market players different sellers and buyers in the formal water markets may not necessarily belong to the irrigation sector a farmer can conveniently sell his water rights to other sector buyers given the respective trading policy in the case of developed markets like australia the studies show that equity among the community per se is not the objective of water trading nevertheless the very concept of formal markets is to utilize water as an economic good we could observe one common factor from studies on the informal markets reporting equity among farmers that is groundwater as a source of irrigation with individual ownership it gives the power of water use rights in the hands of a few farmers who can afford the installation of tube wells thereby making the equitable distribution of water a vital element of studies a dependable irrigation source also provides opportunities for landless labourers to work in the field due to perennial agriculture supported by water trading in the informal markets in the formal markets this factor is observed where the water importing regions expand their scale of operation subsequently employment opportunities for the population are generated we also looked into rational pricing as an equity factor since the markets monopolistic nature lead to the skewed distribution of resources that is more profits in sellers hands formal markets are more active in ensuring better bargaining power for buyers and sellers due to platforms like water exchanges however there are cases in the formal markets also where severe drought conditions drive the indebted farmers out of the market brooks and harris 2008 rational pricing is rarely possible in informal markets due to no regulation or monitoring of water pricing in local transactions after observing the differences in the factors and impacts of water markets in irrigation among different economies one of the major objectives of the study was to examine the reasons behind these differences this study do not intend to provide a framework for an efficient water market system rather extracts specific factors that result in different water use efficiency and equity particularly in the irrigation sector we foremost observe that the physical scarcity of water is a common factor in all the studies except one however there are regions where there is extreme scarcity but the water use efficiency results are not positive nieuwoudt and armitage 2004 examined two regions of south africa with similar hydro geological conditions and water policies but one region had active water trading and the other region did not engage in water trading in such cases globally soft infrastructure wheeler and garrick 2020 is the major reason the potential buyers in the latter region do not grow high value crops and the potential sellers save unused water for droughts or uncertain periods moreover the centrally regulated water pricing system in south africa dis incentivises the potential water sellers to quit agriculture in exchange for returns from the water trade evidently without a reliable water rights system accountable implementation mechanism and banking system like the us even the physical scarcity of water cannot promote water trading as an economic good in northern china the wurs system failed at the ground level to ensure the water use efficiency or any form of change in the cropping pattern due to poor governance and lack of effective conveyance channels zhang 2007 zhang et al 2008 moore 2015 two of the studies in northern china in the formal market set up find inactive water trading which is explained by the poor local governance lack of information and lack of infrastructure consequently there is no improvement in water productivity in this case in case of factors determining the differences in water equity the type of market has the dominant role since the informal markets transactions are local the farmers with the marginal and small land holdings or those without water extraction mechanisms are significantly dependent upon the water trade so it becomes interesting to assess if the equity impact of the irrigation water markets is essential only in the context of informal water economies which are mainly middle income countries table 5 shows us the points of inequity majorly in the formal water economies loss of jobs and land in the water exporting region particularly during droughts are some of the limitations of markets in the case of resources like water as discussed in the above paragraphs this trade off between water use efficiency and equity is so peculiar that it has led to complete structural changes in the agrarian sector however despite these differences wheeler et al 2014b find that there is a larger acceptance of water markets among the irrigation community the reasons behind this evidence are beyond the scope of this article 5 policy implications and scope for future studies the above findings and discussion conclude that the impact of water markets on efficiency is based on the confluence of five factors soft infrastructure institutional governance hard infrastructure physical water scarcity reliability trust in the water market system and social acceptance the heterogeneity in physical economic and social parameters within an economy mandates the customized water trading policies since water trading has become a successful alternative only in areas with scarcity creating artificial shortages and regulation with strict monitoring in surplus water areas can provide an effective solution in order to ensure equity in the water markets the water prices need to be regulated specifically in times of scarcity one of the significant observations of our study particularly in developing economies is that mere water pricing and trade cannot serve the purpose of efficient water use unless all the factors are constituted effectively the priority must be water accounting defined water rights and water metering prior to any form of regulation of irrigation water use moreover even the current water trading system in these economies can lead to efficient and equitable water use if the government or public authorities become the trustee of the water resources the private ownership of water resources is the primary culprit the developing economies should resort to local solutions instead of heavy financial investments in water transfer infrastructures one it is financially not viable to invest in the present scenario second water trading involves huge transaction costs which are not affordable for most farming communities in these countries third the development and implementation of institutional governance for effective water markets demand time which is again not affordable keeping in view the present status of water resources although water pricing as a policy to manage water resources in the informal markets particularly developing economies can be a productive tool for efficient water allocation its impacts similar to the formal markets cannot be expected unless a complete institutional physical and economic infrastructure function efficiently and effectively it is important to emphasise the terms efficiency and effectiveness here as specified in the discussion already there are cases where despite all the facilities water markets are not functioning actively and appropriately water as an economic good for irrigation purposes in developing and under developed economies mandates the prior research on the cost and benefit analysis of water markets at the local level the research on developing economies needs to be based on regional practices rather than applying the formal water market models since the ultimate objective of any water management approach is the sustainability of this crucial resource and water markets are not devoid of limitations some of the negative externalities of water markets relevant for the policy implications are loss of jobs in the water supplying regions palomo hierro et al 2015 shift from irrigated to rain fed agriculture or fallowing land by water sellers palomo hierro et al 2015 wheeler et al 2014a reduction in natural water flows and uneven progress that is not all the sellers invest the proceeds from the water on efficient irrigation technology many case studies observe that the sellers find water selling more profitable than cultivating the low value crops thereby leaving land fallow and paying off their debts from revenue in the end these farmers are driven out from the farming sector and this leads to structural changes in the water supplying region here water markets play a role like conventional goods markets where inefficient firms are driven out of the market by the efficient firms in the long run thus the economics of regional practices for water conservation in the developing and under developed economies is fundamental this review study identifies the factors that result in the trade off between efficiency and equity and factors that lead to both efficiency and equity impact of water markets in irrigation water use both formal and informal water economies need to frame the policies to mitigate the factors that lead to trade offs the negatives of water markets on the agricultural economy in exchange for economic returns can bring food security issues into the picture 6 research gaps and scope for future studies based on the reviewed studies the following research gaps are identified that can potentially guide for future research on this subject there is dearth of literature that incorporates cultural social and political factors in determining the success of water markets as a tool for efficient water use these strongly influence the perceptions and attitudes of the stakeholders towards trading water as an economic good although it is observed during the review that there is shift intensity of the researches from economic efficiency gains to the environmental sustainability of water trading a number of studies wheeler et al 2014b grafton et al 2016 correa parra et al 2020 on developed water markets have strongly emphasized upon the environmental impacts of water trading however the social sustainability is also critically important in the present scenario we need to research the impacts of inter sectoral water trade on food security in the long run it is observed that there is lack of empirical studies on determining the opportunity cost of implementing water rights system in formal markets since the transaction costs are significantly high in the developed water markets the efficiency gains from water allocation to high value use need to be weighed against the cost incurred for implementing the water rights system in case of informal markets also the over exploitation of groundwater accompanied with surging water prices in the semi arid and arid regions have become socially and environmentally unsustainable the problem is more peculiar in the regions with no alternative source of irrigation thus the empirical studies need to be extensively conducted on the regional water economics for designing the localized water trading models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a supporting information

9811,the water markets as an institution for water demand and supply management has been extensively documented both theoretically and empirically the application of successful water market models of developed economies in developing economies has also gained much attention of the researchers and policy makers globally however the studies in different regions have stated a number of arguments both in favour and against the water markets as an economic instrument for water use efficiency and equity particularly in the irrigation sector the present study conducts a systematic review and meta analysis for identifying different ways in which the water markets impact irrigation water use in different regions and analyse the various factors of water markets that impact irrigation water use efficiency and equity the results show that all the studies that confirm the trade off between water use efficiency and equity are based on markets with inter sectoral trade specifically formal markets only about 27 of the reviewed studies found that both the objectives of equity and efficiency can be achieved simultaneously with water trading the impact of water markets on efficiency depends on five factors viz soft infrastructure institutional governance hard infrastructure physical water scarcity reliability trust in the water market system and social acceptance the difference in the very nature of the buyers and sellers in the formal and informal markets largely explains the difference in the functioning of the respective markets thus this study highlights the range of factors behind the heterogeneity in the results of the reviewed studies on the given theme that can support the policy makers in framing the customized water trading policies keywords water markets irrigation water use efficiency equity systematic review prisma 1 introduction the market based mechanisms and pricing approach to govern the water resources has gained much attention from policy makers and other stakeholders in recent times in developed countries like australia this approach is being followed in water scarce regions since the beginning of the 20th century the water market system in the developed countries was primarily formalized during the 1980s however the set of rules for the water market differs across countries because of their hydro geological system social structure institutional set up technical knowledge financial viability and information accessibility varady et al 2016 wheeler et al 2016 a number of studies have been conducted in the developed and developing economies to examine the structure and effectiveness of the different approaches singh and singh 2006 grafton et al 2010 palomo hierro et al 2015 bruno 2018 the research on the organized and formal markets like the rio grande region in the us shows that the water markets that put price and cap on water use can shift cropping pattern towards an average higher value or more water productive crops the farmers buying water in the rio grande region of the us resorted to more productive and non irrigated crops debaere et al 2020 the water trading helped the irrigators to respond to seasonal conditions and manage risk according to a study by fargher 2012 in the murray darling basin region of southern australia dairy farmers trade their water allocation 1 1 the allocation usage and transferability of the water user rights depend upon the doctrine that the economy follows the two major doctrines are riparian and appropriation doctrine under the riparian doctrine the individuals along the rivers have complete right to extract unlimited water given that the quantity and quality of water flowing back into the rivers is maintained and do not disturb the natural flow downstream the appropriation doctrine can be prior or proportional in the appropriation doctrine a fixed share of water is allotted as private property to the water users for a fixed period the difference between the two appropriation approach is in dealing with the scarcity in the prior appropriation doctrine the user rights issued on the later dates are cancelled first that is the priority is given to senior user rights in the time of shortage of water on the other hand in proportional appropriation system the total water is distributed proportionately among all the users in the system during scarcity grafton et al 2010 donohew 2009 to the horticulturists and get handsome returns at the time of drought the formal water markets in california us have served as a tool for private benefits and ecological gains the economic surplus with water trade 2 2 water trading under cap and trade system involved an authorised limit on the annual water extractions from the source in the form of allocated water user rights and trading of these rights grafton et al 2010 is over three times greater than that under the command and control system bruno 2018 the studies conducted in informal markets also conclude that water trading improves the water use efficiency among the farming community shah and ballabh 1997 manjunatha et al 2009 2016 wang et al 2016 razzaq et al 2019 with the growing research in this area several other dimensions like equity and sustainability are being explored to assess the overall impact of the water markets on the stakeholders in general and the farming community in particular the water trading provides a reliable source of irrigation water to the small and marginal farmers incapable of installing capital intensive water extraction mechanisms fujita and hossain 1995 shah and ballabh 1997 bjornlund and mckay 2002 manjunatha et al 2016 razzaq et al 2019 singh et al 2020 in the regions where farmers have no supply of surface water irrigation groundwater trading is an insurance against deficit rains moreover the studies find a higher yield amongst the water buyers in comparison to sellers and non participants shah and ballabh 1997 manjunatha et al 2016 saleth 1998 razzaq et al 2019 the insured source of irrigation enhances the crop intensity motivates farmers for perennial agriculture and provides employment to landless labourers in rural areas shah and raju 1988 meinzen dick and ali 1993 shah and ballabh 1997 manjunatha et al 2009 saleth 1998 thus there are empirical evidences supporting the equity benefits of water markets among the farmers however some researchers have traced another vital point that though the water trading enhances the equity and efficiency in water use the farmers with the traditional form of irrigation are crowded out from farm business from these markets they are not only at a loss technologically but also economically they can neither afford the cost of deep tube wells nor earn any surplus income like farmers with water extraction machines shah and raju 1988 sarkar 2011 another study on social economic and community impacts of water markets in southern australia by edwards et al 2008 highlights the negative impact of water trading on a particular irrigation community he finds that people with water entitlements 3 3 the long term water rights are called the water entitlements or nominal water share and the short term water rights are called as water allocations or actual water share the allocations are some proportion of entitlements that are variable in nature depending upon the availability of water in the basin breviglieri et al 2018 are selling water in water deficit regions to exchange for higher returns and leave the farm jobs this practice has led to limited water left for the local farmers and has contracted the region s economic opportunities the studies in different regions have stated many arguments both in favour and against the water markets as an institution for water demand and supply management while some studies support water markets as an effective instrument in improving the economic status of small and marginal farmers zhang et al 2008 manjunatha et al 2009 razzaq et al 2019 other studies reveal the rising inequalities among the farming community because of these markets edwards et al 2008 hadjigeorgalis 2008 bauer 2004 bruno 2018 mukherji 2004 singh and singh 2006 wang et al 2014 sarkar 2011 breviglieri et al 2018 states as institutions markets are humanly devised rules embedded in a social and political context and do not always lead to efficient or effective solutions for the management of resources the researches on the impact of water markets on water use efficiency and equity focus mainly on country specific empirical studies narrative comparison of two or three developed water markets identifying the factors required for successful water markets through thematic analysis review studies based on narratives gis and modelling in this article we intend to do a systematic review quantitatively through meta analysis identifying the impact of formal and informal markets on irrigation water use efficiency and the factors influencing these impacts thereof we address the following questions do the water markets impact equity and efficiency in irrigation water use or is there a trade off between the two objectives how do irrigation water markets impact water use efficiency does the impact on efficiency and equity differ for formal and informal markets what factors influence irrigation efficiency and equity in different water markets it is important to note that irrigation water rights 4 4 a legal authority to take water from a water body and to retain the benefits of its use the nature of such rights varies greatly they are referred to in different jurisdictions as licences concessions permits access entitlements or allocations productivity commission 2004 share a major stake in the majority of the water markets for instance the share of agriculture water withdrawals in the total water withdrawals in chile australia india and china is around 83 63 90 and 64 respectively 5 5 http www fao org aquastat en as discussed above these markets may impact both equity and efficiency in irrigation water use simultaneously but there is also a trade off between them the definition and measurement of water use efficiency varies across disciplines stanhill 1986 in the present context the water use efficiency is defined as the economic efficiency of water use by achieving maximum output with given level of water input and at minimum cost economic efficiency is also defined as the product of technical efficiency that is maximum possible output at given level of input and allocative efficiency which means minimizing the cost of inputs in a production process qureshi et al 2011 manjunatha et al 2016 further equity is defined as distributive efficiency by allocating the resources according to who need them the most the present study uses the concept of equity in terms of equal opportunity gains to all the stakeholders involved in the water trade dinar et al 1997 access of water to resource poor farmers shah and ballabh 1997 equal access of water to all irrespective of economic status bauer 2004 razzaq et al 2019 inter sectoral equity in water access rosegrant and binswanger 1994 we extract the different ways in which the water markets impact irrigation water use in different regions further these impacts are not only influenced by the economic dimensions in silos but also by multiple factors such as hydro geological status socio cultural norms political variables types of water rights proportionate riparian priority based or mixed etc and governing institutions fig 1 presents the framework of this study indicating the critical factors and variables 2 methodology we follow the guidelines of preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma to conduct a systematic review on the theme the databases for reviewing literature included scopus science direct jstor and web of science 07 08 july 2020 we excluded google scholar for our study due to many results and even after multiple search string trials there were ample irrelevant studies after multiple iterations the finalized search phrase is water markets and equity and efficiency and agriculture or irrigation for identification of the relevant literature the inclusion criteria included 1 journal articles in the english language in peer reviewed journals 2 original or empirical researches 2 subject area economics water resource management agricultural economics environment and development studies broadly in all the mentioned databases further for screening and eligibility the articles were excluded based on the following criteria 1 impact study based on simulations 2 did not assess direct impact of water trading on irrigation water use 3 review articles and 4 any grey literature to identify all the relevant literature the list of references in all the finalized articles was checked and the eligible articles were included in the final list for data extraction the prisma flowchart summarising the search results and screening workflow is shown in fig 2 the present study deals explicitly with the cases where water trading takes place therefore all the studies that focused on water pricing as a tool for water use efficiency are excluded from this review since in many regions of the world the local or central authority set water prices but do not allow water trading for example israel moreover in the informal markets like india the groundwater pricing in trade is individually determined on the basis of electricity tariff or fixed cost of installation shah and raju 1988 singh and singh 2006 shah and chowdhury 2017 the studies included in the review range from the year 1988 2020 we do not apply the time period filter since the implementation of water user rights and water trading in different economies differ significantly for instance in australia water trading related reforms began in the 1980s and water act was introduced in 2007 6 6 www agriculture gov au water markets history whereas in the west usa reforms started in the late 1880s hanemann 2014 2 1 data extraction and coding we apply the inductive approach to identify the variables defining the different economic efficiency and equity impacts of water markets on irrigation water use these variables are broadly classified into four categories namely water use efficiency equity inefficiency and inequity the efficiency category includes the findings of reviewed studies on how water trading impacts the water use efficiency the equity category defines how transacting water or water rights ensure equity in the farming community in the inefficiency category we include the variables that explain both the inefficiency in irrigation water use as a result of water availability through trade and the market inefficiencies that hinder the efficient use of water as evident from the studies cited in the previous section the water markets can be a factor for inequity among the farming community this dimension has been covered by the variables extracted under the inequity category further categorical coding was done to identify the factors unique in all the studies based on institutional socio economic and climatic factors 3 results this section is divided into five parts the first part presents an overview of 26 reviewed papers which includes the frequency of studies from different countries and a summarised description of various institutional economic and physical factors the subsequent parts address the research questions posed in this study 3 1 description of reviewed papers we analysed the frequency of studies on water markets across the globe during the period 1980 2020 which is shown in fig 3 it shows that 22 of the studies are from australia specifically from the murray darling basin region this basin is widely studied due to the successful implementation of a water user rights system and water trading at a large scale asian continent shares 53 of studies on the theme out of which 42 are from the emerging economies beyond the asian continent including chile a fare share 39 is from emerging economies of world eleven studies 29 are from different regions in india four studies 10 each are from the western usa and northern china to avoid the complexity in the analysis we have not added the sub regions in this figure but the regional differences examined in the reviewed studies are referred in the discussion section fig 4 shows a summary of institutional factors in different countries the total number of studies on formal semi formal 7 7 semi formal markets have been defined to categories the water economies that are in transitioning stage from informal to formal or are experimenting with the formal market models and informal markets are 16 4 and 17 respectively the implementation of water users rights differs within a country due to studies based on other basins or completely different regions for instance in australia as concluded by three studies based on the southern part of the mdb basin wheeler et al 2014a 2014b wheeler and garrick 2020 the implementation of water users rights wurs are highly effective whereas three studies on goulborn murray irrigation district in victoria found it effective brooks and harris 2008 bjornlund and mckay 2002 hadjigeorgalis 2008 and one of the studies in the north mdb wheeler et al 2014b reported partially effective in implementation the wurs implementation category is not applicable in seventeen studies on informal markets due to private ownership of groundwater traded in the case of canal irrigation in these regions the wurs or more specifically the allocated water is not tradable different countries follow different water rights doctrine and governance structure irrespective of the type of water market in the usa and chile riparian and prior appropriation doctrine is followed and that in spain is priority based in china s case although all four studies were on northern china irrigation water use two of them analysed the impact of water markets where water users rights and trading were implemented as a pilot project moore 2015 zhang 2007 and two studies assessed the impact of the informal water market wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2008 in the case of economic factors as indicated in fig 5 none of the studies is from a low income country the size of the bubble shows the level of infrastructure in water markets it indicates that high income countries have advanced levels of infrastructure all the studies in a particular country find a similar infrastructure the water banking system is well developed in the western usa only the studies in other high income countries mention the development of water exchanges or water move in australia and inter and intra sectoral trading australian government instituted the water exchanges or water move for smooth water trading but water banks are not in the system as per the literature reviewed spain has water banks but they are functional only during exceptional circumstances or droughts palomo hierro et al 2015 among the lower middle income countries only south africa has implemented the national water law where both inter and intra sectoral water trade infrastructure are active in certain regions all the studies in india bangladesh and pakistan indicate the informal and unorganized nature of water markets based mainly on local transactions as presented in fig 4 these countries have private ownership of water beneath their lands that is unbundled land and water rights fig 6 shows the physical factors of the specific regions of countries covered in the reviewed papers all the formal water economies that is australia usa chile and spain have a semi arid climate south africa and china water market regions have an arid climate in india s case eight studies are from tropical dry and wet regions shah and raju 1988 diwakara and nagaraj 2003 kajisa and sakurai 2005 manjunatha et al 2016 yashodha 2020 pant 2005 shah et al 2009 deepak et al 2005 two studies are from arid and semi arid regions singh et al 2020 sharma and sharma 2006 and one of the studies is conducted in a tropical monsoon climate region shah and ballabh 1997 further studies of pakistan razzaq et al 2019 shah et al 2009 qureshi et al 2003 meinzen dick and ali 1993 and bangladesh mottaleb et al 2019 fujita and hossain 1995 shah et al 2009 are also from tropical dry and wet regions the marked labels on the map show the sources of irrigation in the water market regions and several studies in the bracket six studies in south western australia are from the regions with both surface and groundwater access wheeler et al 2014a 2014b grafton et al 2014 wheeler and garrick 2020 debaere et al 2014 bjornlund and mckay 2002 and two cases studied the regions with only surface water availability brooks and harris 2008 hadjigeorgalis 2008 in the western usa all four studies report both surface and groundwater availability debaere et al 2014 thompson et al 2009 bjornlund and mckay 2002 howitt 1994 in most of the regions both surface and groundwater are available as a source of irrigation however the variable major source of irrigation is important here since in maximum cases despite the availability of both the sources more than 80 of irrigation is done through either surface water or groundwater 3 2 equity and efficiency in irrigation water use of water market and their trades off out of 37 studies 18 studies confirm the positive impact of water trading on efficiency and equity refer table 1 however eight studies out of the 18 studies find some form of inequity along with the equity factor refer table 5 so effectively we can say that only 10 studies confirm both efficiency and equity impacts in the case of trade off four studies show a clear trade off between efficiency and equity objectives interestingly although all the studies concur that water markets positively impact irrigation water use efficiency in some form or the other 16 studies report that these markets can also lead to inefficient water use in agriculture 3 3 impact of irrigation water markets on its water use efficiency as mentioned in the section 3 1 we extracted a number of indicators that explain the impact of water markets on irrigation water use efficiency the maximum number of studies n 15 find that water markets lead to an increase in water productivity refer table 1 these studies show that in comparison to the non participants the output per unit of water is high among the water market participants the second major indicator is change in the cropping pattern by shifting from low value crop to high value crop n 13 the third significant impact is the adoption of on farm effective technology n 8 the water trading provides the incentive to adopt better irrigation technology to the buyers for economising water consumption in agriculture and the sellers for gains from trading the surplus water another significant indicator is the transfer of water from low value to high value use n 8 the regions facilitating the inter sectoral trade or trade from staple crops to horticulture and dairy farming have shown such impact specifically further four studies conclude that water trading increases the cropping intensity by providing a reliable water source for irrigation in dry seasons change in cropping pattern from high water intensive to low water intensive crops is identified by four studies in order to reduce the expenses in response to high water price the buyers tend to cultivate crops that require less irrigation these studies also report the reduction in other inputs use n 3 specifically in the case of the water buyers category further investment in infrastructure to reduce conveyance loss was found only in two studies 3 4 impacts of formal and informal water markets on the efficiency and equity in the previous section we discussed different ways at which the water markets impact the water use efficiency in agriculture and the frequency of each impact with reference to the number of studies reviewed however these results are influenced by multiple factors in this section we intended to examine if the frequency and nature of efficiency and equity factors differ in different market types table 2 summarises the efficiency factors identified within the different market types in the formal markets the transfer of water from low value use to high value use is dominant but it is not found in the informal markets except in a study by diwakara and nagaraj 2003 where the water transfer was prominent from peri urban to urban areas all types of water market show a positive impact on water productivity few studies that did not find the positive impact of water trading on average water use have also explained the reason for it for instance bauer 1997 states that although in chile the water allocation system has incentivized the shift from low value to high value crop the high transaction cost and other barriers limit the scope for water transactions the study does not find any significant improvement in water productivity per se along with high water use efficiency in the buyers category three studies from china moore 2015 and india kajisa and sakurai 2005 manjunatha et al 2016 show the reduced consumption of other inputs which further promotes less water consumption however this impact is not visible in the case of formal and semi formal markets another significant impact of water market type is noticeable in the way the cropping pattern changes in the formal markets farmers tend to shift from low value to high value crops whereas in the case of informal markets some studies singh et al 2020 shah et al 2009 deepak et al 2005 shah and raju 1988 found the shift from high water intensive to low water intensive crops by the buyers further there is evidence of the adoption of on farm technology for efficient water use majorly in the formal and semi formal markets it can be related to farmers economic viability in the high income countries and reliable returns on investment in water trading in organized market system on similar lines investment in conveyance infrastructure to save the water traded is found in the formal markets only in australia and the usa where water governance is highly effective bjornlund and mckay 2002 hadjigeorgalis 2008 thompson et al 2009 wheeler et al 2014a in case of informal markets shah et al 2009 reports the investment on water saving technologies and conveyance infrastructure by the small land holding farmers to minimize the cost of irrigation in response to rise in irrigation water price to study the interdependence of the water market type and efficiency factor we also conducted the fisher exact test since both the variables are of nominal category chi square test was not possible in our case due to less number of samples per factor the fisher exact test shows a highly significant interdependence between these two variables at 1 significance level table 3 shows the factors extracted from reviewed literature on equity impacts of water markets in irrigation as mentioned in the previous section not many studies have focused on the equity dimension of the water markets it is evident from the number of black dots that most studies in the informal markets discussed the equity aspect directly or indirectly we can assess the difference in equity dimension across market types from the table in the case of formal markets although there are results on high agricultural productivity among the buyers category but no case in sellers or both categories on the other side studies in informal markets report all three categories in different regions notably in a majority of the cases n 17 the major source of water in these markets is groundwater see fig 6 moreover the second and third factors prominent in informal markets also reflect the same difference therefore the very nature of the buyers and sellers differ in formal informal and semi formal markets another critical factor that promotes equity is the generation of employment opportunities in the water importing regions in the formal markets and the same local region in the informal markets some of the studies focused on the buyers bargaining power or market structure as an important determinant of equity in the water markets bjornlund and mckay 2002 kajisa and sakurai 2005 shah and raju 1988 we term it as balanced bargaining power relationship referring to the market s non monopolistic nature where all the participants get a fair deal through mutual consent organized structure or through the governing bodies in the case of formal markets like australia and the usa water banks and water exchanges ensure a better price for both parties some of the studies in india provide evidence of balanced bargaining power among buyers and sellers in the regions where either the buyers have higher bargaining power due to alternative sellers or both the parties agree to a mutual price due to social and cultural reasons kajisa and sakurai 2005 we also run fisher s exact test for market type and equity factor the results show the significant interdependence at 10 significance level 3 5 factors influencing efficiency and equity in different water markets from the above results it can be clearly inferred that the efficiency factor differs in different markets even in the case of equity only the studies on informal markets have highlighted the equity impact among the farming community explicitly in this objective we identify specific factors that result in these differences it is essential to state here that there can be several other reasons like political and cultural differences but they have not been captured in this review before defining the results of this objective it is imperative to specify the water use inefficiencies and market inefficiencies identified in different economies it is so because despite similar institutional physical and economic factors the studies recorded the different impacts thus table 4 shows the country wise inefficient factors with the number of studies for each case to solve the aforementioned problem these factors have been discussed in the following sub sections 3 5 1 water use efficiency a number of studies have summarized the determinants of the efficient water markets system wheeler and garrick 2020 grafton et al 2011 wheeler et al 2016 as only journal articles are considered for this study all other studies on the domain have not been added to the reviewed list a thorough examination of studies conducted on this dimension shows numerous layers of factors that contribute to the efficiency results wheeler and garrick 2020 have comprehensively listed the factors that result in the difference between the water trading frequency and impacts on the community in smdb and nmdb australia it is important to emphasize that despite an organized water governance framework in the formal water markets the difference in impacts is still a major research area we have segregated our findings into five broad categories physical scarcity of water is the common factor in all studies n 36 except one study from india s tropical monsoon climate region shah and ballabh 1997 therefore all the heads have this common determinant 3 5 1 1 physical water scarcity but lack of governance no governance poor governance under this category governance means establishing a well defined framework and structure defining the power relationships and the process of policy formulation decision making and accountability unesco 2008 the lack of governance or poor governance was found majorly in semi formal markets two studies from china zhang 2007 moore 2015 and south africa each nieuwoudt et al 2005 nieuwoudt and armitage 2004 fall under this category all the studies in developing economies suggest the case of no governance that defines the informal markets further a particular governance structure cannot be attributed to efficiency or equity in water use as shown in fig 4 implementation of the water user rights can be ineffective even in the case of a decentralized governance structure in china s case moore 2015 and zhang 2007 shows that despite the introduction of a decentralized system the wurs implementation proved ineffective although successful water market models operating in the usa and australia are under mixed and decentralized systems this strategy is not effective in implementing the wur system in all the economies conclusively one of the determinants which impact this difference is poor governance china experimented with the formal market system with a decentralized structure but the studies report the lack of monitoring and accountability for an ineffective water market system moore 2015 zhang 2007 even in australia nmdb region wheeler and garrick 2020 shows the ineffective wurs implementation and one of the reasons quoted is lack of water use monitoring and enforcement system thus poor governance is a prominent factor explaining the differences in the efficiency results 3 5 1 2 physical water scarcity but institutional barriers in the mature water economies there is an organized and defined water governance system however these economies are also prone to some institutional fallacies that lead to water market inefficiencies and water use inefficiency thereof the institutional barriers are defined by any policy regulation or organizational structure that inhibits the smooth functioning of the water market functioning a majority of the studies from formal markets fall under this category high transaction cost is a significant factor that highlights the institutional drawbacks in implementing water rights trading effectively transaction cost includes cost of information bargaining enforcement and contracting hearne and easter 1997 garrick et al 2013 high transaction cost negates the efficiency gains from the water markets bjornlund and mckay 2002 wheeler and garrick 2020 reports that water markets in western usa are less efficient and active in comparison to australia as the transactions are complex and involve huge cost to the irrigators due to ownership of water rights with the irrigation districts in the former country barriers to trade is another major factor in spain s case palomo hierro et al 2015 find that the trade is restricted to only equivalent or high priority users and no trade is permitted from non consumptive to consumptive use in the case of nmdb in australia wheeler and garrick 2020 one of the significant institutional barriers is non transferable rights since many rivers and a third of water licenses are unregulated debaere et al 2014 states that lack of transparency in information on water availability and price listing leads to inefficiency in water market functioning since the buyers and sellers are unable to determine whether trading their water rights is economically viable or not thus asymmetric information among the market participants is another institutional barrier that hinders efficient use of water lack of hard infrastructure is another major determinant in the formal market set up in china moore 2015 zhang 2007 and the other established formal markets lack of water storage and water exchange centers which leads to high transaction cost has been found in some studies brooks and harris 2008 hearne and easter 1997 hard infrastructure is the key to have a free flow of water exchange and information exchange not all formal water economies have water banks or exchange centers for regular trade for instance spain has water banks but they are active only during droughts palomo hierro et al 2015 3 5 1 3 physical water scarcity but lack of social acceptance not many studies have identified this dimension one of the studies from smdb australia finds a strong social acceptance of the water reforms as a major factor for water trading success in the efficient irrigation water uses wheeler and garrick 2020 on differences in water market impacts in smdb and nmdb australia finds that the system is not trustworthy and politically not acceptable in the latter and hence lesser trade frequency there wheeler and garrick 2020 the lack of trust in the water market governance is crucial in the non acceptability of water trading as a regular activity in northern china formal markets moore 2015 there has been social resistance even on the metering of tube wells in china bauer 1997 recorded that people in some parts of chile finds the market logic for water as inappropriate since it is scarce and vital for survival moreover brooks and harris 2008 in their study in australia s gmid victoria region highlights the structural changes in the rural economy due to water trading the trading activities in this region accelerate in times of higher scarcity resulting in high water prices consequently eliminating the small farming community of the low value crop cultivators it also creates resistance in the local community to trade the water entitlements permanently and puts social restrictions on the interested water sellers these findings underscore the importance of social acceptance more broadly we can say that local customary laws may have a critical role in the effectiveness and sustainability of the water markets in the water use efficiency 3 5 1 4 physical water scarcity but other hydro geological differences this factor indicates the feasibility of water market operations due to hydro geological factors despite physical water scarcity the rivers are connected in some of the water trading regions however the poor connectivity of rivers and the difference in water quality is a dominant hindrance in water trading in some of the regions bjornlund and mckay 2002 brooks and harris 2008 along with the host of reasons mentioned above this is also the case with nmdb in australia the rivers in the nmdb are not hydro geologically connected like in smdb therefore the farming community is more dependent upon unregulated groundwater in nmdb in gmid victoria the water is highly saline in west gmid that makes trade from east to west possible not the other way round the studies show that due to the difference in the quality of water and land in the gmid the water moved from low to high productivity areas and high value use bjornlund and mckay 2002 brooks and harris 2008 in the case of informal market regions like indian states since the water transactions are local the hydro geological differences do not impact the water trading and efficiency as in the formal markets this factor is found significant in regional trade for the determination of water price which further impacts the water use efficiency among the buyers and sellers category the sellers tend to charge a higher price if no other irrigation alternative is available or groundwater is not easily accessible 3 5 2 equity factor the equity component is majorly discussed in the informal water markets studies as shown in table 3 the difference in wurs doctrine and the institutional framework of formal and informal markets explain why some of the key results extracted from the review are mentioned under this head one of the factors traced in the literature is the difference in the type of buyers and sellers in respective market types the buyer in the formal markets are mostly the high value crop cultivators horticulturists or dairy farmers who have big estates in agriculture and the sellers are the farmers who have low quality lands low value crop cultivation or higher opportunity cost of agriculture in comparison to selling water rights thompson et al 2009 wheeler et al 2014a palomo hierro et al 2015 the scenario is entirely different in the case of informal and to some extent in the semi formal markets the buyers in these markets are the marginal and small farmers who cannot afford to install the tube wells or water extraction mechanisms meinzen dick and ali 1993 bjornlund and mckay 2002 singh and singh 2006 pant 2005 another critical factor is the mechanism of water pricing it is determined from the results that major factor that leads to inequitable market conditions like loss of land and water rights of water selling community in the formal water economies refer table 5 is the water pricing mechanism in the regions where water prices are either unregulated or freely determined by monopolistic entities the buyers are penalized by high prices sharma and sharma 2006 qureshi et al 2003 singh et al 2020 shah and raju 1988 they tend to lose a significant chunk of their income in the case of informal markets like india and sellers with low value crops are driven out of the irrigation community in the case of formal markets in the latter case the inter sectoral wurs transfer due to high returns specifically during droughts also leads to large scale unemployment in the water exporting regions howitt 1994 hearne and easter 1997 wheeler et al 2014b the aggressive trading practices in the formal markets during droughts are the key factor leading to inequity among the farming community in the long run however it is important to note that the very concept of water markets is to economise the water use by allocating it to the highest returning activities 4 discussion based on the above results less than 50 of the 37 selected papers find that the equity and efficiency objectives can be achieved simultaneously with water trading all the studies that confirm the trade off between water use efficiency and equity are based on markets with inter sectoral trade specifically formal markets in the informal market diwakara and nagaraj 2003 find the inequity factor due to water trade from rural to urban areas it is important to note that not many studies explicitly deal with the equity factor we looked into the conclusions and observations of the reviewed papers and coded the equity factors the results on this dimension alone cannot determine whether the water markets promote efficiency and equity or trade off between the two objectives water trading impacts water use efficiency in multiple ways and results on the second objective explicitly show different impacts examined in the reviewed studies the majority of studies confirming the increase in water productivity of the water market participants underscores the markets role in the efficient water allocation however bjornlund and mckay 2002 point out that the proceeds from sold water are not used by most of the sellers to further improve their irrigation efficiency in some regions farmers sell the water rights far below the value of the marginal product of water keeping land fallow and clearing their debt from sales howitt 1994 on the other hand buyers tend to save money by investing in effective technologies howitt 1994 hearne and easter 1997 grafton and horne 2014 manjunatha et al 2016 most of the studies in australia find that a higher price during the drought period results in effective water conservation technologies and higher water productivity among buyers it highlights that less water use for given output in the sellers case is mainly due to economic returns and in the case of buyers it is due to economic savings we also observe that the mere functioning of water markets cannot serve the purpose it is equally crucial that water pricing serves the economic as well as ecological purposes in the case of both sellers and buyers another important efficiency factor is the change in cropping pattern a significant number of studies show the shift from low value to high value crop but surprisingly only one study reported a shift from high water intensive to low water intensive crop if we look at the broader picture this may be due to water availability through trading itself that facilitates the farmers to prefer the crops based on economic value rather than the water input factor we identify the major difference in this factor among formal and informal water economies due to institutional factors that have been discussed in the subsequent paragraphs the transfer of water from low value use to high value use shows the allocative efficiency of water markets five studies that too from formal economies find this impact however it is important to mention that some of the studies reporting this factor also find that inter sectoral trading in times of severe scarcity has led to structural changes in the agrarian economy leaving the inefficient or small and medium sized farmers out of this sector hearne and easter 1997 wheeler et al 2014b brooks and harris 2008 an increase in cropping intensity in some studies shows how the same water unit which is applied for a higher level of total production due to water trading would otherwise be consumed for low production levels this factor corresponds to better water productivity in the case of the market participants the farmers engaged in water trading are found to use the water more optimally meinzen dick and ali 1993 shah and raju 1988 manjunatha et al 2016 razzaq et al 2019 in case of differences in efficiency and equity impacts in formal and informal markets we observe some key differences in these two market conditions a shift from low value use to high value use is prominent only in the case of formal markets we can infer from the above results figs 4 and 5 that this trend is due to inter sectoral and convenient water transfers in long distances in the formal markets and transferable water user rights system in informal markets there are only local transactions with private ownership of water by farmers beneath their lands or canal irrigation although an increase in irrigation water productivity is recorded in most of the studies it is also noted that there are several bottlenecks in this case high transaction cost lack of infrastructure lack of complete information and barriers to inter sectoral or inter regional trade paralyze the efficient allocation of water howitt 1994 brooks and harris 2008 wheeler et al 2014b grafton and horne 2014 reduced consumption of other inputs is observed in the case of informal markets only it is apparently due to the difference in the nature of transactions in both the markets since the water in the formal market is traded at the inter sectoral level the buyers may not necessarily belong to the agriculture sector only the farmers in informal markets like india do not have much incentive to shift the cropping pattern due to several factors for instance the government s minimum support price is not attractive for other crops or there is more risk associated with horticulture since it requires well equipped support systems like cold stores which are not available near all the villages an increase in cropping intensity is more evident in informal markets since the small and marginal farmers in these markets get a reliable source of irrigation through local water trade looking at the water user rights we observe that the individual ownership makes it lucrative for the sellers farmers with tube wells to share water with the neighbouring farmers buyers without tube wells since small and marginal farmers can rely on tube well owners for water irrespective of the crop season their farms cropping intensity increases leading to higher income thereof adoption of on farm technologies and investment in conveyance infrastructure is evident in the high income countries with highly effective governance this impact specific to the formal economies can be anticipated due to the farmers financial viability in high income countries nevertheless the large scale agriculture in these economies ensures much higher returns on investment than in developing economies like india in case of the difference in formal and informal water markets on equity quotient we note that there is not much focused research on this dimension in the reviewed studies as discussed above the difference in the institutional physical and economic factors makes the very nature of the market players different sellers and buyers in the formal water markets may not necessarily belong to the irrigation sector a farmer can conveniently sell his water rights to other sector buyers given the respective trading policy in the case of developed markets like australia the studies show that equity among the community per se is not the objective of water trading nevertheless the very concept of formal markets is to utilize water as an economic good we could observe one common factor from studies on the informal markets reporting equity among farmers that is groundwater as a source of irrigation with individual ownership it gives the power of water use rights in the hands of a few farmers who can afford the installation of tube wells thereby making the equitable distribution of water a vital element of studies a dependable irrigation source also provides opportunities for landless labourers to work in the field due to perennial agriculture supported by water trading in the informal markets in the formal markets this factor is observed where the water importing regions expand their scale of operation subsequently employment opportunities for the population are generated we also looked into rational pricing as an equity factor since the markets monopolistic nature lead to the skewed distribution of resources that is more profits in sellers hands formal markets are more active in ensuring better bargaining power for buyers and sellers due to platforms like water exchanges however there are cases in the formal markets also where severe drought conditions drive the indebted farmers out of the market brooks and harris 2008 rational pricing is rarely possible in informal markets due to no regulation or monitoring of water pricing in local transactions after observing the differences in the factors and impacts of water markets in irrigation among different economies one of the major objectives of the study was to examine the reasons behind these differences this study do not intend to provide a framework for an efficient water market system rather extracts specific factors that result in different water use efficiency and equity particularly in the irrigation sector we foremost observe that the physical scarcity of water is a common factor in all the studies except one however there are regions where there is extreme scarcity but the water use efficiency results are not positive nieuwoudt and armitage 2004 examined two regions of south africa with similar hydro geological conditions and water policies but one region had active water trading and the other region did not engage in water trading in such cases globally soft infrastructure wheeler and garrick 2020 is the major reason the potential buyers in the latter region do not grow high value crops and the potential sellers save unused water for droughts or uncertain periods moreover the centrally regulated water pricing system in south africa dis incentivises the potential water sellers to quit agriculture in exchange for returns from the water trade evidently without a reliable water rights system accountable implementation mechanism and banking system like the us even the physical scarcity of water cannot promote water trading as an economic good in northern china the wurs system failed at the ground level to ensure the water use efficiency or any form of change in the cropping pattern due to poor governance and lack of effective conveyance channels zhang 2007 zhang et al 2008 moore 2015 two of the studies in northern china in the formal market set up find inactive water trading which is explained by the poor local governance lack of information and lack of infrastructure consequently there is no improvement in water productivity in this case in case of factors determining the differences in water equity the type of market has the dominant role since the informal markets transactions are local the farmers with the marginal and small land holdings or those without water extraction mechanisms are significantly dependent upon the water trade so it becomes interesting to assess if the equity impact of the irrigation water markets is essential only in the context of informal water economies which are mainly middle income countries table 5 shows us the points of inequity majorly in the formal water economies loss of jobs and land in the water exporting region particularly during droughts are some of the limitations of markets in the case of resources like water as discussed in the above paragraphs this trade off between water use efficiency and equity is so peculiar that it has led to complete structural changes in the agrarian sector however despite these differences wheeler et al 2014b find that there is a larger acceptance of water markets among the irrigation community the reasons behind this evidence are beyond the scope of this article 5 policy implications and scope for future studies the above findings and discussion conclude that the impact of water markets on efficiency is based on the confluence of five factors soft infrastructure institutional governance hard infrastructure physical water scarcity reliability trust in the water market system and social acceptance the heterogeneity in physical economic and social parameters within an economy mandates the customized water trading policies since water trading has become a successful alternative only in areas with scarcity creating artificial shortages and regulation with strict monitoring in surplus water areas can provide an effective solution in order to ensure equity in the water markets the water prices need to be regulated specifically in times of scarcity one of the significant observations of our study particularly in developing economies is that mere water pricing and trade cannot serve the purpose of efficient water use unless all the factors are constituted effectively the priority must be water accounting defined water rights and water metering prior to any form of regulation of irrigation water use moreover even the current water trading system in these economies can lead to efficient and equitable water use if the government or public authorities become the trustee of the water resources the private ownership of water resources is the primary culprit the developing economies should resort to local solutions instead of heavy financial investments in water transfer infrastructures one it is financially not viable to invest in the present scenario second water trading involves huge transaction costs which are not affordable for most farming communities in these countries third the development and implementation of institutional governance for effective water markets demand time which is again not affordable keeping in view the present status of water resources although water pricing as a policy to manage water resources in the informal markets particularly developing economies can be a productive tool for efficient water allocation its impacts similar to the formal markets cannot be expected unless a complete institutional physical and economic infrastructure function efficiently and effectively it is important to emphasise the terms efficiency and effectiveness here as specified in the discussion already there are cases where despite all the facilities water markets are not functioning actively and appropriately water as an economic good for irrigation purposes in developing and under developed economies mandates the prior research on the cost and benefit analysis of water markets at the local level the research on developing economies needs to be based on regional practices rather than applying the formal water market models since the ultimate objective of any water management approach is the sustainability of this crucial resource and water markets are not devoid of limitations some of the negative externalities of water markets relevant for the policy implications are loss of jobs in the water supplying regions palomo hierro et al 2015 shift from irrigated to rain fed agriculture or fallowing land by water sellers palomo hierro et al 2015 wheeler et al 2014a reduction in natural water flows and uneven progress that is not all the sellers invest the proceeds from the water on efficient irrigation technology many case studies observe that the sellers find water selling more profitable than cultivating the low value crops thereby leaving land fallow and paying off their debts from revenue in the end these farmers are driven out from the farming sector and this leads to structural changes in the water supplying region here water markets play a role like conventional goods markets where inefficient firms are driven out of the market by the efficient firms in the long run thus the economics of regional practices for water conservation in the developing and under developed economies is fundamental this review study identifies the factors that result in the trade off between efficiency and equity and factors that lead to both efficiency and equity impact of water markets in irrigation water use both formal and informal water economies need to frame the policies to mitigate the factors that lead to trade offs the negatives of water markets on the agricultural economy in exchange for economic returns can bring food security issues into the picture 6 research gaps and scope for future studies based on the reviewed studies the following research gaps are identified that can potentially guide for future research on this subject there is dearth of literature that incorporates cultural social and political factors in determining the success of water markets as a tool for efficient water use these strongly influence the perceptions and attitudes of the stakeholders towards trading water as an economic good although it is observed during the review that there is shift intensity of the researches from economic efficiency gains to the environmental sustainability of water trading a number of studies wheeler et al 2014b grafton et al 2016 correa parra et al 2020 on developed water markets have strongly emphasized upon the environmental impacts of water trading however the social sustainability is also critically important in the present scenario we need to research the impacts of inter sectoral water trade on food security in the long run it is observed that there is lack of empirical studies on determining the opportunity cost of implementing water rights system in formal markets since the transaction costs are significantly high in the developed water markets the efficiency gains from water allocation to high value use need to be weighed against the cost incurred for implementing the water rights system in case of informal markets also the over exploitation of groundwater accompanied with surging water prices in the semi arid and arid regions have become socially and environmentally unsustainable the problem is more peculiar in the regions with no alternative source of irrigation thus the empirical studies need to be extensively conducted on the regional water economics for designing the localized water trading models declaration of competing interest the authors

9812,the use of soil matric potential ψ sensors to support irrigation decisions has become common practice among many producers however ψ values at which irrigation should be initiated ψ lim based on a pre defined irrigation depth is still lacking the main objectives of this study were i evaluate the impact of different negligible drainage flux on estimated ψ at field capacity ψ fc using hydrus 1d simulations ii identify ψ lim values and its corresponded irrigation depth under different soil profile depth at representative soil types in northwest and southeast alabama the ψ θ relation at field capacity ψ fc and θ fc respectively were estimated by a numerical internal drainage flux experiment for multilayered soils using hydrus 1d software simulations among the different negligible drainage fluxes q fc tested a q fc value of 0 01 and 0 025 cm d 1 yielded the best results for the soil located at northwest and southeast alabama respectively for a soil water depletion of 35 and a soil profile depth of 0 6 m the ψ lim ranged from 103 to 133 kpa for the soils located at northwest alabama and 38 to 51 kpa for soils located in southeast alabama it returned an irrigation depth varying from 20 to 24 mm for northwest alabama soils and 15 33 mm for southeast alabama soils for a same irrigation depth it was observed that the ψ lim increased became less negative as soil profile depth considered for irrigation calculations increased additionally if the same pre defined irrigation depth is used during the entire growing season there is a high change that plants could be under stress due to the high level of water deficit using the same irrigation depth during the entire crop growth season could be a flawed irrigation management strategy therefore irrigation depth should dynamically change over the growth season as the plant roots reach deeper soil layers keywords irrigation timing upper limit of soil water holding capacity negligible drainage flux soil water depletion 1 introduction the amount of water that a soil can hold in the vadose zone is a topic of interest for many research areas such as surface hydrology carretta et al 2021 groundwater recharge sasidharan et al 2020 irrigation management létourneau et al 2015 çakir and cangir 2021 and crop yield simulations bonfante et al 2017 for irrigation purposes the identification of the upper and lower limits of soil water holding capacity is required for improving irrigation management and water use efficiency the upper and lower limits are traditionally known as the soil matric potential ψ at field capacity fc and ψ at permanent wilting point pwp respectively the soil water content θ held between these two limits is assumed to represent the range of soil available water for plant transpiration also known as available water capacity awc de jong van lier 2017 romano et al 2011 savage et al 1996 physically based determinations of these limits allow better irrigation management practices identification of deficit irrigation strategies and more reliable simulations of bucket type soil water balance models irmak et al 2016 pinheiro et al 2019 the lower limit of soil available water is customarily defined at ψ 1500 kpa ψ pwp representing the dry range of the soil water retention curve swrc therefore its corresponding θ pwp will be less sensitive to ψ variations tolk 2003 savage et al 1996 on the other hand the assessment of the upper limit the pressure head at fc ψ fc or its corresponding θ fc is widely discussed among researchers e g de jong van lier 2017 reynolds 2018 romano et al 2011 ψ fc can be estimated from field observations brito et al 2011 fazackerley and lawrence 2012 with the drawback of being highly time consuming alternatively when the soil hydraulic properties relations are known ψ fc can be efficiently predicted by internal drainage simulations based on a pre defined negligible drainage flux q fc at an arbitrarily chosen depth of the soil profile de jong van lier 2017 twarakavi et al 2009 although twarakavi et al 2009 have reported that ψ fc can be obtained for a q fc of 0 01 cm d 1 for a 1 cm soil profile depth for a wide range of soil located in the usa information regarding the effect of different q fc on calculated irrigation depth is lacking determining an accurate q fc that uses site specific soil properties is therefore imperative to improve ψ fc estimations using a drainage flux method because of the difficulties assessing ψ fc a static ψ value of 33 kpa for fine textured soil 35 100 clay content and 10 kpa for coarse textured soil 70 100 sand content has been traditionally used to represent fc status rivers and shipp 1972 united states department of agriculture 1987 however studies have suggested ψ fc values may vary from 5 to 50 kpa romano and santini 2002 brito et al 2011 jabro et al 2009 these discrepancies indicate that the idea of a universal static value of ψ fc is flawed nemes et al 2011 mainly because of the dynamic nature of ψ fc ahuja et al 2008 site specific assessment of soil hydraulic properties water retention θ ψ and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k ψ is highly desired for flux based predictions of ψ fc by process based models such as hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2016 and swap kroes et al 2017 a well defined k θ ψ relation reduces the uncertainties regarding ψ fc determination and therefore improvements in irrigation scheduling depth and timing is expected to occur among the many options of sensors to measure the matric potential status of a soil watermark sensors irrometer company inc riverside ca usa has been successfully adopted to track the ψ status of cropping systems grown in different soil types irmak 2010 jabro et al 2020 although these soil sensors can accurately measure the soil water status the knowledge of soil k θ ψ relations and its mechanistic application in irrigation management is hardly ever implemented by farmers and crop consultants hence more attention regarding irrigation scheduling based on well defined ψ at which irrigation should initiate irrigation tension threshold ψ lim is needed to effectively improve irrigation decisions the literature provides some recommended ψ lim such as 50 kpa for a very fine sandy loam soils leininger et al 2019 from 20 to 25 kpa for a fine sand soils and from 90 to 110 kpa for heterogeneous silt loam and silty clay loam soils irmak et al 2014 we hypothesize therefore that these values may not hold for soils with different site specific characteristics and the ψ lim determination based on site specific soil physical and hydraulic characteristics may promote better irrigation decisions although the total irrigated area is still small in alabama state 66 100 ha when compared with other usa states alabama ranked at the top ten in irrigated lands increase 40 according to the 2012 2018 irrigation census usda nass 2019 as the interest in irrigation rises in the state the adoption of best irrigation management practices is required to improve irrigation water use efficiency and farmers profitability and to reduce the pressure for natural freshwater resources one way to achieve these goals is through increasing the adoption of sensor based methods to guide irrigation management and through the correct assessment of the data produced by soil sensors given that less than 10 of irrigation decisions in the usa are guided by soil water sensor responses usda nass 2019 irrigation scheduling using soil sensor data not only improves the determination of the correct irrigation depth and timing irmak et al 2010 but also allows the best water allocation when using a variable rate irrigation system o shaughnessy et al 2015 sui and yan 2017 sharma and irmak 2020 given the need of site specific data for the assessment of soil available water and soil matric potential thresholds for irrigation scheduling investigations that take into consideration field specific features such as soil hydraulic properties and climate conditions are highly desired the increase in irrigation management efficiency in addition to enhancing crop and water yields also reduces the risks related to runoff erosion and groundwater pollution therefore the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the impact of different q fc on estimated ψ fc using hydrus 1d simulations and ii identify ψ lim values and its corresponded irrigation depth under different soil profile depth at representative soil types in northwest and southeast alabama 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and description four cropped soils across alabama state were selected for the determination of soil hydraulic properties particle size distribution and soil bulk density the selected soils were sampled at four dominantly crop production rows of each field fig 1 shows the location of field 1 34 43 06 46 n and 87 23 13 53 w 2 34 41 30 51 n and 87 00 54 81 w and 3 34 43 17 73 n and 81 01 16 02 w located at the northwest al and field 4 31 07 02 83 n and 86 05 31 77 w located at southeast al both regions are classified as subtropical humid cfa kottek et al 2006 with long term mean of annual accumulated rainfall of 1380 and 1360 mm for northwest and southeast alabama respectively 2 2 assessment of soil textural classes and taxonomy several field campaigns were conducted during the first half of 2018 to characterize some soil physical properties of major soil types in alabama a total of nine two four and five soil sampling locations were selected at fields 1 2 3 and 4 respectively fig 1 at each sampling site disturbed soil samples were collected at 0 15 0 3 and 0 6 m soil depth totalizing 60 samples 20 sites x 3 soil depths which were sent to a private laboratory for soil texture determination using the hydrometer method bouyoucos 1962 values of sand clay and silt content for each sample were input into the soil textural triangle to study commonalities or differences of soil textural classes among samples and fields fig 2 two distinctive soil textural classes were found in which soils from southeast alabama field 4 presented a coarser texture than the sampled fields located in the northwest of the state the soil texture soil series and soil family for each sampling site are given in table 1 fields located in northwest al are classified as decatur and abernathy emory soil families with predominant content of silt and clay particles whereas the main soil series found at field 4 were eunola and alpin with large sand content ssurgo 2021 2 3 soil hydraulic properties assessment undisturbed soil samples were collected using a stainless steel sampler ring of 5 cm height and 8 cm diameter 251 33 cm3 the samples were collected at the same locations and soil depths as the samples for soil texture determination one sample per depth per location was collected totaling 60 undisturbed soil samples the ring was inserted into the soil so that the ring height midpoint was at the desired depth 0 15 0 3 and 0 6 m after carefully removing the surrounding soil the rings were stored in a container for proper sample transportation the semi automated measurements of the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity pairs were performed by using the popular version of the evaporation method the hyprop measurement system peters et al 2015 peters and durner 2008 the ring containing the undisturbed soil sample was placed on the hydraulic proper analyzer hyprop 2 meter group pullman washington fig 3a after been saturated for 24 h then placed on top of a 0 01 g weighting capacity scale the soil sample weight and the ψ collected from two tensiometers located at different heights within the soil sample were automatically recorded every 30 min by the hyprop view software version 4 2 2 0 meter group pullman washington until ψ reached the maximum values the tensiometers could read the ψ measurement by this method ranged from 1 to 100 kpa the sample was removed from hydraulic proper analyzer and placed into an oven at 105 c until it reached constant mass the dry weight of the sample was recorded and bulk density was determined soil bulk density from each sample was input into hyprop fit software version 4 2 2 0 meter group pullman washington and it automatically displays k ψ θ pairs in order to obtain a swrc representative of the entire range of plant available water the dry range of the swrc was determined using a dew point hygrometer wp4c potentiameter meter group pullman washington fig 3b measuring ψ in the range of 600 and 2500 kpa undisturbed soil sample was placed the chamber of the dew point hygrometer once the equipment was reading the target ψ of the samples based on the aforementioned range the wet weight was immediately determined in a 0 0001 g scale and later placed into the oven for the dry weight determination ψ recorded at the dew point hygrometer and the wet and dry of the samples were input into hyprop fit software for the determination of the ψ θ pairs at least three ψ θ pairs were determined per location and each pair represented an average of three replication a representative fitted swrc generated using the hyprop fit software is shown in fig 3c for fields 1 2 and 3 characterized for fine soil texture the k θ ψ relations of all sampling locations were satisfactorily described by the analytical single porosity functions defined by mualem 1976 and van genuchten 1980 vgm eqs 1 and 2 for field 4 in contrast characterized for coarse soil texture the k θ ψ relations were better represented by the van genuchten mualem dual porosity model as presented by dunner 1994 eqs 3 and 4 these analytical functions will be referred to as the unimodal eqs 1 and 2 and bimodal eqs 3 and 4

factors w 1 and w 2 for two overlapping regions θ1 defined by α 1 and n 1 and θ2 defined by α 2 and n 2 the hydraulic parameters and bulk density for all sampling location and soil depth is given in appendix a 2 4 internal drainage flux based field capacity simulation 2 4 1 estimation of field capacity a numerical internal drainage experiment simulated using the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2016 was conducted for the estimation of ψ fc and θ fc for the model setup a soil profile 1 m deep with three soil materials sm corresponding to the sampled layers were used for each simulated soil profile representing the sampling location the soil hydraulic parameters estimated for each sampling location at 0 15 0 3 and 0 6 m soil depths were used as input parameters for the hydrus 1d simulations as sm1 sm2 and sm3 respectively the layer thickness of sm1 was 0 0 22 m representing the midpoint between the soil samples collected at 0 15 and 0 3 m soil depth similarly the layer thickness of sm2 was 0 22 0 45 and it represented the midpoint between the soil samples collected at 0 3 and 0 6 m soil depth ultimately the distance between the bottom of sm2 starting at 0 45 m soil depth and 1 m soil depth represented the layer thickness of sm3 0 45 1 m even though the soil profile could have presented differences in soil hydraulic properties between locations we assumed that these properties were the same within each soil series study therefore the thickness of all sms were maintained constant among all locations allowing further results comparison constant zero flux and free drainage for the upper and the lower boundary conditions respectively and pressure head of 10 cmh2o 0 98 kpa as initial condition were selected the soil was assumed to reach fc when the bottom layer of a given depth reached a q fc in order to allow dynamic irrigation scheduling calculations for crops the q fc target depth defining the bottom of the soil profile must change following the root system growth over the growing season i e soil layers are added for the irrigation calculation as the roots are growing deeper consequently the target depth for q fc will change depending on the considered soil profile thickness which is dynamically defined by the root depth fig 4 shows how ψ fc and θ fc determinations vary as the root depth reaches a specific sm layer considering an effective root system depth of 0 6 m when the root depth is restricted to the sm1 target depth for ψ fc was set at 0 22 m soil depth and the mean values of ψ and θ within 0 0 22 m layer were used to represent the ψ fc and θ fc when the root system reaches the sm2 layer the target depth for q fc was set at 0 45 m soil depth and mean values of ψ and θ within 0 0 22 and 0 22 0 45 m layers represented the ψ fc and θ fc of these two soil materials finally when the root system reaches the third soil material the target depth for q fc was set at 0 6 m and the mean values of ψ and θ within 0 0 22 0 22 0 45 and 0 45 0 6 m layers were assumed to represent the ψ fc and θ fc for sm1 sm2 and sm3 respectively 2 4 2 negligible flux criteria evaluation although twarakavi et al 2009 suggested that for north america soils ψ fc can be satisfactorily estimated by internal drainage simulations using a flux density q fc of 0 01 cm d 1 we implemented a simple analysis in order to evaluate the impact of different q fc values on irrigation recommendations the purpose of this analysis was to identify which q fc values would be further used for the determination of ψ fc and θ fc the q fc values of 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 cm d 1 were tested for the soils located at northwest field 1 and southeast alabama field 4 for the soils located southeast alabama which were classified as coarser soil texture a small change of q fc was found to output a large change of ψ fc and θ fc therefore we have also tested the q fc values 0 025 cm d 1 to improve the accuracy of ψ fc and θ fc estimation for the soils located at southeast alabama the analysis was performed based on the following steps i an array of three soil matric potential sensors watermark irrometer company inc riverside ca usa placed at 0 15 0 3 and 0 6 m soil depth were installed at multiple locations at field 1 and field 4 to track ψ during the 2018 2019 and 2020 corn growing season for field 1 and the 2018 and 2019 corn growing season for field 4 ii required irrigation water for selected periods during the growing season was calculated as the amount of water required to replenish ψ measured with soil sensor back to ψ fc only period with no rainfall events were selected fig 5 iii the required irrigation water amount was calculated based on ψ fc and θ fc estimated for different q fc values evaluated and iv for the same period in which required irrigation water amount was calculated accumulated actual crop evapotranspiration et c was also calculated daily et c was calculated as allen et al 1998 5 et c k s k c et 0 where k s water stress coefficient dimensionless k c crop coefficient dimensionless and et 0 reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 a soil water depletion fraction for no stress p of 0 55 for grain corn was used and adjusted based on the calculated daily et c that differed from 5 mm d 1 a daily crop coefficient k c of 1 1 for corn was selected which represents the values for reproductive growth stages r1 r5 irmak 2017 daily grass based standard reference evapotranspiration et 0 fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 was estimated using agrometeorological parameters determined at 15 min intervals using a vantage pro 2 plus weather station model 6163 davis instruments hayward california located close to the field 1 and a watchdog weather station model 2700 spectrum technologies inc aurora il located close to the field 4 accumulated et c was calculated as the sum of the daily et c eq 5 for the chosen periods between irrigations fig 5 shows an example ψ measured with a soil sensor during the period of peak of water demand for corn at filed 1 based on measured ψ required irrigation water amount and accumulated et c were calculated for selected periods without rainfall required irrigation amounts based on different q fc values were compared with accumulated et c for the selected periods using a regression model 2 5 comparison of estimated field capacity with empirical methods two proposed empirical methods for the estimation of ψ fc were selected and compared with ψ fc estimated using hydrus 1d model simulations additionally irrigation recommendation based on the estimated ψ fc using hydrus 1d model simulation and from the two proposed methods were also compared the first empirical method was developed by twarakavi et al 2009 and uses the θ s θ r n and k s parameters of the vgm equation mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 as input in the estimation of θ fc its correspondent ψ fc can be determined using eq 1 the second empirical method developed by liang et al 2016 is based on the tangent to the inflection point of the fitted vgm equation at the wet end of the swrc and at ψ of 1500 kpa to estimate θ fc for more details about both methods readers are referred to twarakavi et al 2009 and liang et al 2016 irrigation recommendations generated from these three methods were also compared to the ones estimated using the benchmarked ψ fc values of 10 kpa for alpin and eunola soil series and 33 kpa for decatur and abernathy emory soil series mean difference of ψ fc and irrigation depth among hydrus 1d simulations twarakavi et al 2009 liang et al 2016 and benchmarked values were tested using tukey s hsd test haynes 2013 at 5 level of probability p 0 05 using r software r core team 2019 2 6 irrigation thresholds determination the soil water content or the equivalent soil matric potential values that could be used as irrigation scheduling thresholds ψ lim were determined based on two irrigation management scenarios i pre defined soil water depletion swd i and ii fixed irrigation depth i x the scenario i is the most common one among irrigation specialists where irrigation trigger and depth are determined by a maximum allowed swd i which prevents crop water stress that could potentially result in yield losses allen et al 1998 however the scenario ii is traditionally adopted by irrigation operators especially in the state of alabama in which the irrigation management consists of applying a fixed irrigation depth for every irrigation event therefore defining the irrigation triggering thresholds for fixed irrigation depths i x is crucial to avoid either under or over irrigation using a pre defined swd i the corresponding soil water content θ swdi is calculated by eq 6 and its equivalent matric potential by eq 7 the subsequent step consists in calculating the irrigation depth which is given by eq 8 for a multilayered soil profile 6 θ s w d i θ f c i s w d i θ f c i θ p w p i 7 ψ s w d i θ s w d i θ r i θ s i θ r i n i 1 n i 1 1 n i α i 8 i s w d i 1 j θ f c i θ s w d i z i where θ swdi l3 l 3 is the soil water content defining the irrigation triggering for a pre defined soil water depletion swd i θ fc and θ pwp are the soil water content at field capacity and at permanent wilting point respectively l3 l 3 ψ is the equivalent soil matric potential l θ r θ s and α are the vgm parameters i swd is the irrigation depth l z is the soil layer thickness l both subscript and superscript i indicate the corresponding soil layer and j represents the total number of soil layers for fixed irrigation depth i x the θ value corresponding to the irrigation triggering can be estimated by eq 9 while its associated soil water depletion is given by eq 10 9 θ i x i 1 j θ f c i z i i x i 1 j z i 10 s w d i x i 1 j θ f c i θ i x i 1 j θ f c i θ p w p i where θ ix is the soil water content for irrigation triggering l3 l 3 i x is the fixed irrigation depth l and s w d i x is the average soil profile water depletion corresponding to the i x the practical application of eqs 5 7 scenario i and 8 9 scenario ii for a homogeneous soil layer is given in fig 6a and b respectively once the θ ψ relation at field capacity and permanent wilting point were identified the upper and lower limits of swd i ranging from 0 to 1 for soil layer i can be determined in fig 6a the volumetric water content θ swdi soil matric potential ψ swdi and irrigation amount i swdi for a pre defined allowable soil water depletion swd i were determined the fig 6b shows the inverse path for a pre defined i x returning the ψ ix and swd ix values 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of negligible flux density for field capacity simulations the criterion of assuming a negligible flux density q fc at an arbitrarily soil profile depth for fc simulations should consider the influence of other soil processes that might include soil water movement regarding fc determination as an upper limit of soil available water for irrigation management a possible criterion to select for the q fc value is to assume that it corresponds to a small fraction negligible of daily crop transpiration negligible q fc ranging from 0 001 cm d 1 to 1 cm d 1 has been tested for highly weathered tropical soils de jong van lier and wendroth 2016 turek et al 2020 for north america soils twarakavi et al 2009 used a q fc value of 0 01 cm d 1 however their fc simulations were performed for only homogeneous soil profiles 1 cm deep fig 7 shows the relationship between accumulated et c and required irrigation water amount using three fc values determined based on different q fc values for northwest fig 7a and southeast fig 7b alabama this relationship was best represented by a logarithmic model for all tested q fc the differences on required irrigation water amount values highlighted the effect of the q fc choice whereas the required irrigation water amount increased as q fc increases these findings are explained by the estimated ψ fc based on the q fc value considered the higher the q fc value the higher the ψ fc estimated less negative or closer to zero and therefore the amount of water to replenish the soil water content back to fc from a given ψ will be larger as ψ fc gets closer to zero plotting the relationship between accumulated et c and the required irrigation water amount for different selected q fc we could observe that the q fc of 0 01 and 0 025 cm d 1 resulted in the stronger correlation and closer proximity to the 1 1 line for field 1 fig 7a and field 4 fig 7b respectively even though a few studies have suggested different negligible drainage flux to assess ψ fc dirksen and matula 1994 hillel 1998 meyer and gee 1999 twarakavi et al 2009 information about the impact of such values on irrigation recommendations is still lacking the q fc suggested by twarakavi et al 2009 was hold for the fine textured soils evaluated in this study but higher q fc values were found for soils coarse textured soils these finding suggests that the evaluation of the impact of different q fc on the irrigation recommendation can potentially improve the assessment of an accurate q fc based on these results we adopted a q fc value of 0 01 and 0 025 cm d 1 for our further field capacity simulations for the fields located in northwest and southeast alabama respectively 3 2 flux based field capacity estimation and comparison with other empirical methods estimated ψ fc values using the negligible flux density hy twarakavi et al 2009 tw and liang et al 2016 li methods for the 20 sampling locations from four agricultural fields of northwest and southeast alabama are given in table 2 for hy two soil profile depths 0 0 45 m and 0 0 6 m were considered in order to better represent the effective soil depth according to the root growth system average of fc estimated at sm1 and sm2 was used to represent the 0 0 45 m soil profile depth while the average of fc estimated at sm1 sm2 and sm3 represented the 0 0 6 m soil profile depth as given in fig 4 since tw and li methods use the soil hydraulic properties to estimate soil at fc ψ fc was estimated individually for each soil depth of sampling location where the soil hydraulic properties were assessed in order to compare the results from the flux based fc simulations based on the two soil profile depths 0 0 45 and 0 0 6 m ψ fc determined at 0 15 and 0 3 m soil depth estimated by each empirical method tw and li was average and this value represented ψ fc for the 0 0 45 m soil profile depth for the 0 0 6 m soil profile depth ψ fc was represented by the average of ψ fc estimated at 0 15 0 3 and 0 6 m soil depth for hy method considering q fc target depth at 0 45 m the lowest ψ fc average of 43 2 standard deviation kpa was registered for the abernathy emory soil series whereas the highest ψ fc average 13 2 kpa occurred for the eunola and alpin soil series when the q fc target depth was increased to 0 6 m by adding the soil hydraulic properties of layer 0 45 0 6 m a ψ fc reduction was found the difference between ψ fc simulated for the two q fc target depths occurred because of the dynamic processes of soil water flow simulated by the hydrus 1d model although the soil profile depth was kept constant at 1 m for all simulations the q fc target depth was set at the bottom of each sampled layer 0 0 22 m 0 22 0 45 m and 0 45 0 60 m with ψ fc represented by the upward average of ψ values when the targeted q fc value was reached for heterogeneous soil profile adding extra soil material implies in increasing the vertical soil heterogeneity moreover deeper q fc target depth results in more negative ψ fc values because of the occurrence of drier layers toward the soil surface as observed in our simulation results these differences in ψ fc may considerably impact irrigation management therefore for irrigation purposes of annual crops it is desirable to define the simulated field capacity for different q fc target depths in order to reasonably track the crop water demand as the root system reaches deeper soil layers the ψ fc values estimated by hy method were fairly similar to benchmarked values bm 33 and 10 kpa for fine and coarse soil textures for all the soil series studied except for abernathy emory soil series that the estimated ψ fc values were about 10 and 19 kpa lower than the bm value of 33 kpa for a soil profile depth of 0 0 45 and 0 0 6 m respectively the tw method yielded more negative ψ fc values for decatur and eunola soil series than those values achieved by hy method for the eunola soil series tw method estimated inconsistent ψ fc values below 300 kpa considerably deviating from the other methods as an indication that the empirical equation proposed by tw method failed for the eunola soil series of our studied site irmak et al 2014 studying a soil with similar soil textural properties in nebraska recommended irrigation triggering at 20 kpa which suggests that ψ fc of this soil should be higher than 20 kpa regarding the li method it yielded lower ψ fc for decatur and eunola and larger for ψ fc for abernathy emory and alpin soil series than the hy method table 2 interestingly for alpin soil family li method table 2 was quite close to the bm value of 10 kpa for this soil type this method was calibrated and validated for agronomic soils located in south georgia which are very similar to the alpin soil family of our studied sites therefore it is expected that their method will perform better for soils with higher sand content for the abernathy emory soil family ψ fc estimated by hy method were marginally lower than the values calculated by the other two empirical equations the decatur soil series for example presented higher standard deviation of ψ fc values for both empirical methods 13 kpa in comparison with hy method 11 kpa because of the empirical methods use a few hydraulic parameters of the vgm equation the models could present higher sensitivity to small changes of these parameters which in turns yielded higher fluctuation of the estimated ψ fc values on the other hand hy method uses an internal drainage flux model approach to simulate water flow in the soil profile which is dependent on all soil hydraulic parameters that define the soil water retention and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity therefore producing more reliable ψ fc estimation the mean ψ fc value simulated by hy method for the decatur soil series with q fc target depth at 0 45 m was statistically different p 0 05 from that simulated by the li method significant differences between these two methods also occurred for the alpin soil series independently of the q fc target depth the results presented in table 2 show that the estimated ψ fc values may differ among the methods selected which could potentially impact on the calculated irrigation recommendations therefore we evaluated the impact of estimated ψ fc values based on the selected methods to identify whether or not these values would result in significant differences on the irrigation depth fig 8 the calculation was performed for an arbitrary swd i value of 35 applied for two soil profile depths 0 3 and 0 6 m for the 0 3 and 0 6 m deep soil profile of the alpin soil series the mean values of irrigation depth based on the ψ fc estimated by hy method and using a bm value of 10 kpa were statistically lower p 0 05 from that estimated by the li method for the other soil series decatur and abernathy emory no significant differences p 0 05 between irrigation depths were observed no statistical test was performed for the eunola soil series irrigation depths because of the low number of replications only two the results shown in fig 8 are explained by the combined effect of shape of the swrc and the estimated ψ fc values lying within the swrc for example fine textured soils decatur and abernathy emory are less sensitivity to changes in awc than coarse textured soils eunola and alpin within the wet end of the swrc it is assumed therefore that a large difference in ψ fc value for fine textured soils may result in smaller impact on irrigation triggering and depth than for coarse textured soils considering a 0 6 m soil profile depth for the decatur soil series the difference of irrigation depth between hy and li method was about 3 mm for a ψ fc difference of 17 kpa on the other hand for the alpin soil series and for the same soil profile depth irrigation depth deviation between the same methods was 15 mm for a ψ fc difference of only 7 kpa in fig 9 is shown the impact of different ψ fc values on hypothetical irrigation depths assuming a 35 swd i and a soil profile depth of 0 6 m to the four soils series analyzed in this study it can be noticed that the less sensitive soil series to changes of ψ fc values are the decatur and abernathy emory fine textured soils where the irrigation depth values remained within a narrow range while the ψ fc ranged from 20 kpa to 50 kpa which is a common range for these soil types romano and santini 2002 twarakavi et al 2009 on the other hand the irrigation depth of the other soil series eunola and alpin coarse textured soils showed considerably larger sensitivity to changes of ψ fc values mainly within the range of 5 and 15 kpa usually found for coarse textured soils liang et al 2016 romano and santini 2002 the decatur and abernathy emory soils series have larger clay content than the alpin and eunola soils table 1 which grants larger quantity of micropores and therefore a less sharp reduction of θ with small decrement of ψ more negative on the other hand the alpin and eunola soils have at least 90 and 76 sand respectively implying that even under a small decrease of ψ near soil saturation is followed by a sharp reduction in θ consequently altering the awc values considerably accordingly the correct ψ fc assessment for coarse textured soils is essential to prevent either over irrigation depths or drought stresses the ψ fc values reported in previous studies for similar soil texture as alpin and eunola soil series rivers and shipp 1972 liang et al 2016 are a somewhat higher than the values reported in this study table 2 such differences may be due to site specific soil hydraulic variability indicating that ψ fc determination for coarse textured soils requires the local assessment of soil hydraulic properties giving that biased ψ fc may lead to erroneous irrigation recommendations these results suggest that a more robust and reliable assessment of ψ fc values can be obtained when using internal drainage numerical experiments using process based models e g hydrus 1d in comparison with other empirical methods especially when using site specific soil properties for these numerical simulations it is important to emphasize however that the impact of ψ fc values reported in this study on crop yield and water use efficiency was not tested however future evaluations are required in order to include these state variables in more comprehensive simulation scenarios 3 3 ψ lim based on pre defined irrigation depths the determination of ψ fc is the first step to achieve efficient irrigation management especially when tracking ψ using soil sensors site specific knowledge of k ψ θ relations is needed to estimate of ψ fc because of the need to reliably determine irrigation triggers for fixed irrigation depths these irrigation triggers may considerably improve irrigation water efficiency and facilitate producer s adoption of sensor based irrigation scheduling given their preference for fixed irrigation depth in the following the hydrus 1d flux based ψ fc values were applied to investigate ψ lim that corresponds to replenishing the soil with a specific irrigation depth of the studied soil series the calculated ψ lim values for pre defined irrigation depths ranging from 5 mm to 25 mm with 2 5 mm increment for the decatur abernathy emory eunola and alpin soils series at two soils depths are shown in table 3 as expected the estimated ψ lim decreased and its equivalent swd i for the four soil types and profile depths increased accordingly to the irrigation depth increment however the decreased pattern of ψ lim and increased patten of swd i changed by soil type the differences in ψ lim and swd i between soils were mainly because of the awc for a given ψ fc value which was controlled by the k ψ θ relations for the decatur and abernathy emory soil series that presented similar physic and hydraulic behavior and similar awc 0 12 cm3 cm 3 the swd i response to changes in irrigation depth was fairly similar table 3 however because of the estimated ψ fc value for the abernathy emory soil series was about 20 kpa lower than the decatur soil series table 2 lower ψ lim values for abernathy emory soil series were found within the range of 0 50 swd i where most of irrigation scenarios will occur although the estimated ψ fc values were similar for eunola and alpin soil series table 2 a faster decrease in ψ lim and increase in swd i as irrigation depth increased was observed for the alpin soil in relation to the eunola soil table 3 this was mainly due to the larger awc for the eunola soil 0 17 cm3 cm 3 than that of the alpin soil 0 08 cm3 cm 3 many irrigation practitioners traditionally prefer to manage their irrigated fields by applying fixed irrigation depths throughout the growing season usually relying on empirical assessment of soil water stress to trigger their irrigation systems although less labor intensive and requiring less investment this irrigation scheme may substantially reduce crop yield because of either under or over estimation of irrigation depth in contracts if a pre defined irrigation depth based on site specific awc thresholds is used the overall irrigation water efficiency is expected to increase due to better irrigation timing the data shown in table 3 is a plausible strategy to improve irrigation scheduling allowing the correct irrigation timing based on ψ lim values that meet fixed irrigation depths based on an acceptable swd i range selecting an allowable 35 swd i irmak et al 2014 and a rooted soil profile depth of 0 3 m representing a cropping system in the early vegetative stage the ψ lim for the soil series decatur abernathy emory eunola and alpin was 92 121 42 and 32 kpa respectively corresponding to an irrigation depths of 10 12 16 and 8 mm maintaining the same 35 swd i but increasing the rooted soil profile depth to 0 6 m fully developed crop the ψ lim became slightly more negative 103 133 51 and 39 kpa followed by the irrigation depths 20 24 33 and 15 mm for decatur abernathy emory eunola and alpin soils respectively in one of the few available studies that reported ψ lim and its correspondent irrigation depth for a 0 3 m deep under a 35 swd i irmak et al 2014 have recommended ψ lim values of 23 kpa for fine sand soils and 50 kpa for fine sandy loam soils these values were about 9 kpa higher and 8 kpa lower than those presented in our study for alpin sand soils and eunola sandy loam soils soil series respectively interestingly the corresponding irrigation depth for the ψ lim and the awc reported by these authors were the same as those found in our study for alpin soil 8 mm and 0 08 cm3 cm 3 these results could be explained by the differences in the ψ θ relation in the upper and lower limit of the swrc in which these authors may have found higher ψ fc θ fc and ψ pwp θ pwp relation than the ones reported in our study consequently it may have led to a shift the ψ lim but maintaining similar irrigation depth and awc in comparison to the alpin soil although these authors did not report ψ lim values for clay loam soils the authors have suggested values ranging from 90 to 110 kpa for silt loam silty clay loam soils with correspondent irrigation depth of 22 mm while the ψ lim values were found to be similar from those observed for decatur and abernathy emory soils series clay loam found in our study its corresponding irrigation depth was about 11 mm higher than the ones found for the same soil series these discrepancies in recommended irrigation depth were explained by the differences of awc values where these authors have reported a awc about 0 06 cm3 cm 3 larger than those found for the soil in northwest alabama and consequently granting larger irrigation for a same swd i value information about ψ lim and its corresponding recommended irrigation depth based on an allowable swd i is still lacking in the literature which could be associated the fact that the estimation of a swrc is labor intensive time consuming and costly instead studies have been mainly focused on the evaluation of different ψ lim as irrigation timing on yield due to its opportunity to improve in situ irrigation scheduling regardless of the irrigation depth or the allowable swd i considered in a study that investigated the response curve for irrigation triggering values varying from 5 to 80 kpa and different nitrogen application levels in a fine texture vertisols soil rivera hernández et al 2010 have observed that a ψ lim of 30 kpa yielded larger irrigation water use efficiency for sweet corn recently leininger et al 2019 have evaluated different ψ lim as irrigation triggering for furrow irrigated peanuts for a fine sand texture in mississippi usa and they found that yield and irrigation water use efficiency were maximized for an irrigation triggering of 50 kpa in a literature review conducted by shock and want 2011 the authors have cited a wide list of ψ lim that can vary from 6 to 800 kpa depending on the crops irrigation systems and soil texture class although the aforementioned ψ lim values are invaluable to improve irrigation decisions and have the potential to reduce yield losses by timely start irrigation a proper irrigation scheduling depth and timing is still highly dependent on soil hydraulic properties that control the water flow processes in the vadose zone therefore an efficient irrigation management is only achieved when the empirical decisions are replaced with meaningful strategies that will maximize crop yield reduce water loss and provide higher profits to farmers such strategies can be supported when in situ ψ lim and its corresponding irrigation depth are defined as given in table 3 3 4 ψ lim based on pre defined soil profile depth as mentioned before producers have been traditionally applying water based on a fixed irrigation event the results shown in table 3 could be useful to promote best irrigation management practice by providing ψ lim values for pre defined irrigation depths however this strategy may fail if plant root depth and an allowable swd i are not taken into consideration which could promote larger water deficit stress late irrigation triggering or over irrigation early irrigation triggering in order to further evaluate the ψ lim of the studied soils series fig 9 is shown the absolute number of ψ lim ψ lim and its respective swd i for five fixed irrigation depths and rooted soil profiles ranging from 0 15 to 0 6 m with 0 075 m increment the root depth range allows to assess the ψ lim and swd i for a given irrigation depth throughout the crop growth season as the plants root system grows deeper from fig 10 two main findings were observed for the analyzed soils i for the same irrigation depth a decreasing pattern of ψ lim as the root depth increases and ii for the same soil depth an increasing pattern of ψ lim as the irrigation depth increases these observed patterns may not hold for other soil types given that they depend on the upper and lower limits of awc ψ fc and ψ pwp of the added soil layers as the root system grows small values of awc will return lower ψ lim more negative and higher swd i to illustrate this result when the irrigation depth is 10 6 mm for the decatur soil series fig 10a the calculated swd i eq 10 was 50 30 and 20 at 0 15 0 3 and 0 6 m soil depths respectively meaning that ψ lim becomes less positive from top to bottom 200 100 and 50 kpa respectively given that for all analyzed soils the surface layer 0 0 22 m presented narrow awc values the returned swd i was larger than that of the weighted awc as deeper layers were added following the same rationale for a given soil depth higher irrigation depth will allow higher swd i thus more positive values of ψ lim will occur considering a fixed irrigation depth scenario of 20 3 mm for every irrigation event the returned swd i thresholds for decatur fig 10a abernathy emory fig 10b eunola fig 10c and alpin fig 10d soils with root depth at 0 6 m were 35 31 25 and 53 respectively however if the same irrigation depth 20 3 mm was applied for crops with root depth at 0 15 m the returned swd i values for the decatur abernathy emory eunola and alpin fig 10d were 98 95 89 and 100 respectively which are at or close to ψ pwp these results emphasized that using the same irrigation depth during the entire crop growth season could be a flawed irrigation management strategy thus confirming the hypothesis that the irrigation depth should dynamically change over the growth season as the plant roots reach deeper soil layers to further highlight this issue assuming that a 35 swd i is an adequate threshold dashed gray lines in fig 10 the irrigation depth that corresponds to such swd i can be easily selected based on the root depth range from 0 15 to 0 6 m it is worth noting that the relatively large awc value for the eunola soil returned higher irrigation depths than the values reported for its counterpart also coarse textured alpin soil fig 10d as a result irrigation scheme should be managed with high frequency and low depth in the early stages of the plant growth root system constrained to the top soil at later phenological stages deeper root system the irrigation depth can be increased while its frequency is reduced however in case of calculated irrigation depth is higher than the irrigation system capacity or the application rate exceeding the soil water infiltration rate the irrigation depth must be reduced while its frequency is increased therefore fixed irrigation depth schemes without taking into consideration the vertical soil heterogeneity and root depth variation over the growth season may not be recommended as an efficient strategy in this sense the most adequate irrigation scheme that reduces the chances of exposing crops to drought stress consists in trigger irrigation whenever the soil water content reaches the maximum allowable swd i following this scheme the irrigation depth consists in the water depth necessary to bring the soil water content at ψ lim back to field capacity ψ fc 4 conclusions the soil matric potential at field capacity ψ fc estimated with an internal drainage numerical experiment using a negligible drainage flux q fc of 0 01 and 0 025 cm d 1 yielded best results for the irrigation recommendation vs accumulated estimated crop evapotranspiration relationship for the soils located at northwest and southeast alabama respectively such q fc values were used for the calculation of irrigation tension threshold values ψ lim based on different pre defined irrigation depths and soil profile depths for the soils located at northwest alabama fine textured soils the ψ fc ranged from 26 to 43 kpa for a 0 0 45 m soil profile depth and from 31 to 52 kpa for a 0 0 6 m soil profile depth in southeast alabama coarse textured soils ψ fc was higher less negative than the soil from northwest alabama for this region ψ fc was 13 kpa for a 0 0 45 m soil profile depth and ranged from 14 to 15 kpa for a 0 0 6 m soil profile depth the returned value of ψ lim and its corresponding soil water depletion for pre defined irrigation depths ranging from 5 to 25 mm changed for all agronomic soil evaluated the ψ lim decreased more negative as irrigation depth increased for all soils evaluated for the same irrigation depth ψ lim increased as more soil layers were considered for irrigation calculations additionally soils with larger sand content southeast alabama yielded higher ψ lim in comparison with the soils with lower sand content northwest alabama for the same pre defined irrigation depth it was observed that depending on the soil hydraulic properties and the depth of the root system using the same fixed irrigation amount during the growing season could potentially reduce yield due to a high level of soil water stress the differences of ψ lim values and irrigation depth among the soil series evaluated highlighted the importance of determining ψ lim values considering site specific soil hydraulic characteristics to promote best irrigation management practices declaration of

9812,the use of soil matric potential ψ sensors to support irrigation decisions has become common practice among many producers however ψ values at which irrigation should be initiated ψ lim based on a pre defined irrigation depth is still lacking the main objectives of this study were i evaluate the impact of different negligible drainage flux on estimated ψ at field capacity ψ fc using hydrus 1d simulations ii identify ψ lim values and its corresponded irrigation depth under different soil profile depth at representative soil types in northwest and southeast alabama the ψ θ relation at field capacity ψ fc and θ fc respectively were estimated by a numerical internal drainage flux experiment for multilayered soils using hydrus 1d software simulations among the different negligible drainage fluxes q fc tested a q fc value of 0 01 and 0 025 cm d 1 yielded the best results for the soil located at northwest and southeast alabama respectively for a soil water depletion of 35 and a soil profile depth of 0 6 m the ψ lim ranged from 103 to 133 kpa for the soils located at northwest alabama and 38 to 51 kpa for soils located in southeast alabama it returned an irrigation depth varying from 20 to 24 mm for northwest alabama soils and 15 33 mm for southeast alabama soils for a same irrigation depth it was observed that the ψ lim increased became less negative as soil profile depth considered for irrigation calculations increased additionally if the same pre defined irrigation depth is used during the entire growing season there is a high change that plants could be under stress due to the high level of water deficit using the same irrigation depth during the entire crop growth season could be a flawed irrigation management strategy therefore irrigation depth should dynamically change over the growth season as the plant roots reach deeper soil layers keywords irrigation timing upper limit of soil water holding capacity negligible drainage flux soil water depletion 1 introduction the amount of water that a soil can hold in the vadose zone is a topic of interest for many research areas such as surface hydrology carretta et al 2021 groundwater recharge sasidharan et al 2020 irrigation management létourneau et al 2015 çakir and cangir 2021 and crop yield simulations bonfante et al 2017 for irrigation purposes the identification of the upper and lower limits of soil water holding capacity is required for improving irrigation management and water use efficiency the upper and lower limits are traditionally known as the soil matric potential ψ at field capacity fc and ψ at permanent wilting point pwp respectively the soil water content θ held between these two limits is assumed to represent the range of soil available water for plant transpiration also known as available water capacity awc de jong van lier 2017 romano et al 2011 savage et al 1996 physically based determinations of these limits allow better irrigation management practices identification of deficit irrigation strategies and more reliable simulations of bucket type soil water balance models irmak et al 2016 pinheiro et al 2019 the lower limit of soil available water is customarily defined at ψ 1500 kpa ψ pwp representing the dry range of the soil water retention curve swrc therefore its corresponding θ pwp will be less sensitive to ψ variations tolk 2003 savage et al 1996 on the other hand the assessment of the upper limit the pressure head at fc ψ fc or its corresponding θ fc is widely discussed among researchers e g de jong van lier 2017 reynolds 2018 romano et al 2011 ψ fc can be estimated from field observations brito et al 2011 fazackerley and lawrence 2012 with the drawback of being highly time consuming alternatively when the soil hydraulic properties relations are known ψ fc can be efficiently predicted by internal drainage simulations based on a pre defined negligible drainage flux q fc at an arbitrarily chosen depth of the soil profile de jong van lier 2017 twarakavi et al 2009 although twarakavi et al 2009 have reported that ψ fc can be obtained for a q fc of 0 01 cm d 1 for a 1 cm soil profile depth for a wide range of soil located in the usa information regarding the effect of different q fc on calculated irrigation depth is lacking determining an accurate q fc that uses site specific soil properties is therefore imperative to improve ψ fc estimations using a drainage flux method because of the difficulties assessing ψ fc a static ψ value of 33 kpa for fine textured soil 35 100 clay content and 10 kpa for coarse textured soil 70 100 sand content has been traditionally used to represent fc status rivers and shipp 1972 united states department of agriculture 1987 however studies have suggested ψ fc values may vary from 5 to 50 kpa romano and santini 2002 brito et al 2011 jabro et al 2009 these discrepancies indicate that the idea of a universal static value of ψ fc is flawed nemes et al 2011 mainly because of the dynamic nature of ψ fc ahuja et al 2008 site specific assessment of soil hydraulic properties water retention θ ψ and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k ψ is highly desired for flux based predictions of ψ fc by process based models such as hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2016 and swap kroes et al 2017 a well defined k θ ψ relation reduces the uncertainties regarding ψ fc determination and therefore improvements in irrigation scheduling depth and timing is expected to occur among the many options of sensors to measure the matric potential status of a soil watermark sensors irrometer company inc riverside ca usa has been successfully adopted to track the ψ status of cropping systems grown in different soil types irmak 2010 jabro et al 2020 although these soil sensors can accurately measure the soil water status the knowledge of soil k θ ψ relations and its mechanistic application in irrigation management is hardly ever implemented by farmers and crop consultants hence more attention regarding irrigation scheduling based on well defined ψ at which irrigation should initiate irrigation tension threshold ψ lim is needed to effectively improve irrigation decisions the literature provides some recommended ψ lim such as 50 kpa for a very fine sandy loam soils leininger et al 2019 from 20 to 25 kpa for a fine sand soils and from 90 to 110 kpa for heterogeneous silt loam and silty clay loam soils irmak et al 2014 we hypothesize therefore that these values may not hold for soils with different site specific characteristics and the ψ lim determination based on site specific soil physical and hydraulic characteristics may promote better irrigation decisions although the total irrigated area is still small in alabama state 66 100 ha when compared with other usa states alabama ranked at the top ten in irrigated lands increase 40 according to the 2012 2018 irrigation census usda nass 2019 as the interest in irrigation rises in the state the adoption of best irrigation management practices is required to improve irrigation water use efficiency and farmers profitability and to reduce the pressure for natural freshwater resources one way to achieve these goals is through increasing the adoption of sensor based methods to guide irrigation management and through the correct assessment of the data produced by soil sensors given that less than 10 of irrigation decisions in the usa are guided by soil water sensor responses usda nass 2019 irrigation scheduling using soil sensor data not only improves the determination of the correct irrigation depth and timing irmak et al 2010 but also allows the best water allocation when using a variable rate irrigation system o shaughnessy et al 2015 sui and yan 2017 sharma and irmak 2020 given the need of site specific data for the assessment of soil available water and soil matric potential thresholds for irrigation scheduling investigations that take into consideration field specific features such as soil hydraulic properties and climate conditions are highly desired the increase in irrigation management efficiency in addition to enhancing crop and water yields also reduces the risks related to runoff erosion and groundwater pollution therefore the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the impact of different q fc on estimated ψ fc using hydrus 1d simulations and ii identify ψ lim values and its corresponded irrigation depth under different soil profile depth at representative soil types in northwest and southeast alabama 2 material and methods

the first half of 2018 to characterize some soil physical properties of major soil types in alabama a total of nine two four and five soil sampling locations were selected at fields 1 2 3 and 4 respectively fig 1 at each sampling site disturbed soil samples were collected at 0 15 0 3 and 0 6 m soil depth totalizing 60 samples 20 sites x 3 soil depths which were sent to a private laboratory for soil texture determination using the hydrometer method bouyoucos 1962 values of sand clay and silt content for each sample were input into the soil textural triangle to study commonalities or differences of soil textural classes among samples and fields fig 2 two distinctive soil textural classes were found in which soils from southeast alabama field 4 presented a coarser texture than the sampled fields located in the northwest of the state the soil texture soil series and soil family for each sampling site are given in table 1 fields located in northwest al are classified as decatur and abernathy emory soil families with predominant content of silt and clay particles whereas the main soil series found at field 4 were eunola and alpin with large sand content ssurgo 2021 2 3 soil hydraulic properties assessment undisturbed soil samples were collected using a stainless steel sampler ring of 5 cm height and 8 cm diameter 251 33 cm3 the samples were collected at the same locations and soil depths as the samples for soil texture determination one sample per depth per location was collected totaling 60 undisturbed soil samples the ring was inserted into the soil so that the ring height midpoint was at the desired depth 0 15 0 3 and 0 6 m after carefully removing the surrounding soil the rings were stored in a container for proper sample transportation the semi automated measurements of the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity pairs were performed by using the popular version of the evaporation method the hyprop measurement system peters et al 2015 peters and durner 2008 the ring containing the undisturbed soil sample was placed on the hydraulic proper analyzer hyprop 2 meter group pullman washington fig 3a after been saturated for 24 h then placed on top of a 0 01 g weighting capacity scale the soil sample weight and the ψ collected from two tensiometers located at different heights within the soil sample were automatically recorded every 30 min by the hyprop view software version 4 2 2 0 meter group pullman washington until ψ reached the maximum values the tensiometers could read the ψ measurement by this method ranged from 1 to 100 kpa the sample was removed from hydraulic proper analyzer and placed into an oven at 105 c until it reached constant mass the dry weight of the sample was recorded and bulk density was determined soil bulk density from each sample was input into hyprop fit software version 4 2 2 0 meter group pullman washington and it automatically displays k ψ θ pairs in order to obtain a swrc representative of the entire range of plant available water the dry range of the swrc was determined using a dew point hygrometer wp4c potentiameter meter group pullman washington fig 3b measuring ψ in the range of 600 and 2500 kpa undisturbed soil sample was placed the chamber of the dew point hygrometer once the equipment was reading the target ψ of the samples based on the aforementioned range the wet weight was immediately determined in a 0 0001 g scale and later placed into the oven for the dry weight determination ψ recorded at the dew point hygrometer and the wet and dry of the samples were input into hyprop fit software for the determination of the ψ θ pairs at least three ψ θ pairs were determined per location and each pair represented an average of three replication a representative fitted swrc generated using the hyprop fit software is shown in fig 3c for fields 1 2 and 3 characterized for fine soil texture the k θ ψ relations of all sampling locations were satisfactorily described by the analytical single porosity functions defined by mualem 1976 and van genuchten 1980 vgm eqs 1 and 2 for field 4 in contrast characterized for coarse soil texture the k θ ψ relations were better represented by the van genuchten mualem dual porosity model as presented by dunner 1994 eqs 3 and 4 these analytical functions will be referred to as the unimodal eqs 1 and 2 and bimodal eqs 3 and 4

appendix a 2 4 internal drainage flux based field capacity simulation 2 4 1 estimation of field capacity a numerical internal drainage experiment simulated using the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2016 was conducted for the estimation of ψ fc and θ fc for the model setup a soil profile 1 m deep with three soil materials sm corresponding to the sampled layers were used for each simulated soil profile representing the sampling location the soil hydraulic parameters estimated for each sampling location at 0 15 0 3 and 0 6 m soil depths were used as input parameters for the hydrus 1d simulations as sm1 sm2 and sm3 respectively the layer thickness of sm1 was 0 0 22 m representing the midpoint between the soil samples collected at 0 15 and 0 3 m soil depth similarly the layer thickness of sm2 was 0 22 0 45 and it represented the midpoint between the soil samples collected at 0 3 and 0 6 m soil depth ultimately the distance between the bottom of sm2 starting at 0 45 m soil depth and 1 m soil depth represented the layer thickness of sm3 0 45 1 m even though the soil profile could have presented differences in soil hydraulic properties between locations we assumed that these properties were the same within each soil series study therefore the thickness of all sms were maintained constant among all locations allowing further results comparison constant zero flux and free drainage for the upper and the lower boundary conditions respectively and pressure head of 10 cmh2o 0 98 kpa as initial condition were selected the soil was assumed to reach fc when the bottom layer of a given depth reached a q fc in order to allow dynamic irrigation scheduling calculations for crops the q fc target depth defining the bottom of the soil profile must change following the root system growth over the growing season i e soil layers are added for the irrigation calculation as the roots are growing deeper consequently the target depth for q fc will change depending on the considered soil profile thickness which is dynamically defined by the root depth fig 4 shows how ψ fc and θ fc determinations vary as the root depth reaches a specific sm layer considering an effective root system depth of 0 6 m when the root depth is restricted to the sm1 target depth for ψ fc was set at 0 22 m soil depth and the mean values of ψ and θ within 0 0 22 m layer were used to represent the ψ fc and θ fc when the root system reaches the sm2 layer the target depth for q fc was set at 0 45 m soil depth and mean values of ψ and θ within 0 0 22 and 0 22 0 45 m layers represented the ψ fc and θ fc of these two soil materials finally when the root system reaches the third soil material the target depth for q fc was set at 0 6 m and the mean values of ψ and θ within 0 0 22 0 22 0 45 and 0 45 0 6 m layers were assumed to represent the ψ fc and θ fc for sm1 sm2 and sm3 respectively 2 4 2 negligible flux criteria evaluation although twarakavi et al 2009 suggested that for north america soils ψ fc can be satisfactorily estimated by internal drainage simulations using a flux density q fc of 0 01 cm d 1 we implemented a simple analysis in order to evaluate the impact of different q fc values on irrigation recommendations the purpose of this analysis was to identify which q fc values would be further used for the determination of ψ fc and θ fc the q fc values of 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 cm d 1 were tested for the soils located at northwest field 1 and southeast alabama field 4 for the soils located southeast alabama which were classified as coarser soil texture a small change of q fc was found to output a large change of ψ fc and θ fc therefore we have also tested the q fc values 0 025 cm d 1 to improve the accuracy of ψ fc and θ fc estimation for the soils located at southeast alabama the analysis was performed based on the following steps i an array of three soil matric potential sensors watermark irrometer company inc riverside ca usa placed at 0 15 0 3 and 0 6 m soil depth were installed at multiple locations at field 1 and field 4 to track ψ during the 2018 2019 and 2020 corn growing season for field 1 and the 2018 and 2019 corn growing season for field 4 ii required irrigation water for selected periods during the growing season was calculated as the amount of water required to replenish ψ measured with soil sensor back to ψ fc only period with no rainfall events were selected fig 5 iii the required irrigation water amount was calculated based on ψ fc and θ fc estimated for different q fc values evaluated and iv for the same period in which required irrigation water amount was calculated accumulated actual crop evapotranspiration et c was also calculated daily et c was calculated as allen et al 1998 5 et c k s k c et 0 where k s water stress coefficient dimensionless k c crop coefficient dimensionless and et 0 reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 a soil water depletion fraction for no stress p of 0 55 for grain corn was used and adjusted based on the calculated daily et c that differed from 5 mm d 1 a daily crop coefficient k c of 1 1 for corn was selected which represents the values for reproductive growth stages r1 r5 irmak 2017 daily grass based standard reference evapotranspiration et 0 fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 was estimated using agrometeorological parameters determined at 15 min intervals using a vantage pro 2 plus weather station model 6163 davis instruments hayward california located close to the field 1 and a watchdog weather station model 2700 spectrum technologies inc aurora il located close to the field 4 accumulated et c was calculated as the sum of the daily et c eq 5 for the chosen periods between irrigations fig 5 shows an example ψ measured with a soil sensor during the period of peak of water demand for corn at filed 1 based on measured ψ required irrigation water amount and accumulated et c were calculated for selected periods without rainfall required irrigation amounts based on different q fc values were compared with accumulated et c for the selected periods using a regression model 2 5 comparison of estimated field capacity with empirical methods two proposed empirical methods for the estimation of ψ fc were selected and compared with ψ fc estimated using hydrus 1d model simulations additionally irrigation recommendation based on the estimated ψ fc using hydrus 1d model simulation and from the two proposed methods were also compared the first empirical method was developed by twarakavi et al 2009 and uses the θ s θ r n and k s parameters of the vgm equation mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 as input in the estimation of θ fc its correspondent ψ fc can be determined using eq 1 the second empirical method developed by liang et al 2016 is based on the tangent to the inflection point of the fitted vgm equation at the wet end of the swrc and at ψ of 1500 kpa to estimate θ fc for more details about both methods readers are referred to twarakavi et al 2009 and liang et al 2016 irrigation recommendations generated from these three methods were also compared to the ones estimated using the benchmarked ψ fc values of 10 kpa for alpin and eunola soil series and 33 kpa for decatur and abernathy emory soil series mean difference of ψ fc and irrigation depth among hydrus 1d simulations twarakavi et al 2009 liang et al 2016 and benchmarked values were tested using tukey s hsd test haynes 2013 at 5 level of probability p 0 05 using r software r core team 2019 2 6 irrigation thresholds determination the soil water content or the equivalent soil matric potential values that could be used as irrigation scheduling thresholds ψ lim were determined based on two irrigation management scenarios i pre defined soil water depletion swd i and ii fixed irrigation depth i x the scenario i is the most common one among irrigation specialists where irrigation trigger and depth are determined by a maximum allowed swd i which prevents crop water stress that could potentially result in yield losses allen et al 1998 however the scenario ii is traditionally adopted by irrigation operators especially in the state of alabama in which the irrigation management consists of applying a fixed irrigation depth for every irrigation event therefore defining the irrigation triggering thresholds for fixed irrigation depths i x is crucial to avoid either under or over irrigation using a pre defined swd i the corresponding soil water content θ swdi is calculated by eq 6 and its equivalent matric potential by eq 7 the subsequent step consists in calculating the irrigation depth which is given by eq 8 for a multilayered soil profile 6 θ s w d i θ f c i s w d i θ f c i θ p w p i 7 ψ s w d i θ s w d i θ r i θ s i θ r i n i 1 n i 1 1 n i α i 8 i s w d i 1 j θ f c i θ s w d i z i where θ swdi l3 l 3 is the soil water content defining the irrigation triggering for a pre defined soil water depletion swd i θ fc and θ pwp are the soil water content at field capacity and at permanent wilting point respectively l3 l 3 ψ is the equivalent soil matric potential l θ r θ s and α are the vgm parameters i swd is the irrigation depth l z is the soil layer thickness l both subscript and superscript i indicate the corresponding soil layer and j represents the total number of soil layers for fixed irrigation depth i x the θ value corresponding to the irrigation triggering can be estimated by eq 9 while its associated soil water depletion is given by eq 10 9 θ i x i 1 j θ f c i z i i x i 1 j z i 10 s w d i x i 1 j θ f c i θ i x i 1 j θ f c i θ p w p i where θ ix is the soil water content for irrigation triggering l3 l 3 i x is the fixed irrigation depth l and s w d i x is the average soil profile water depletion corresponding to the i x the practical application of eqs 5 7 scenario i and 8 9 scenario ii for a homogeneous soil layer is given in fig 6a and b respectively once the θ ψ relation at field capacity and permanent wilting point were identified the upper and lower limits of swd i ranging from 0 to 1 for soil layer i can be determined in fig 6a the volumetric water content θ swdi soil matric potential ψ swdi and irrigation amount i swdi for a pre defined allowable soil water depletion swd i were determined the fig 6b shows the inverse path for a pre defined i x returning the ψ ix and swd ix values 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of negligible flux density for field capacity simulations the criterion of assuming a negligible flux density q fc at an arbitrarily soil profile depth for fc simulations should consider the influence of other soil processes that might include soil water movement regarding fc determination as an upper limit of soil available water for irrigation management a possible criterion to select for the q fc value is to assume that it corresponds to a small fraction negligible of daily crop transpiration negligible q fc ranging from 0 001 cm d 1 to 1 cm d 1 has been tested for highly weathered tropical soils de jong van lier and wendroth 2016 turek et al 2020 for north america soils twarakavi et al 2009 used a q fc value of 0 01 cm d 1 however their fc simulations were performed for only homogeneous soil profiles 1 cm deep fig 7 shows the relationship between accumulated et c and required irrigation water amount using three fc values determined based on different q fc values for northwest fig 7a and southeast fig 7b alabama this relationship was best represented by a logarithmic model for all tested q fc the differences on required irrigation water amount values highlighted the effect of the q fc choice whereas the required irrigation water amount increased as q fc increases these findings are explained by the estimated ψ fc based on the q fc value considered the higher the q fc value the higher the ψ fc estimated less negative or closer to zero and therefore the amount of water to replenish the soil water content back to fc from a given ψ will be larger as ψ fc gets closer to zero plotting the relationship between accumulated et c and the required irrigation water amount for different selected q fc we could observe that the q fc of 0 01 and 0 025 cm d 1 resulted in the stronger correlation and closer proximity to the 1 1 line for field 1 fig 7a and field 4 fig 7b respectively even though a few studies have suggested different negligible drainage flux to assess ψ fc dirksen and matula 1994 hillel 1998 meyer and gee 1999 twarakavi et al 2009 information about the impact of such values on irrigation recommendations is still lacking the q fc suggested by twarakavi et al 2009 was hold for the fine textured soils evaluated in this study but higher q fc values were found for soils coarse textured soils these finding suggests that the evaluation of the impact of different q fc on the irrigation recommendation can potentially improve the assessment of an accurate q fc based on these results we adopted a q fc value of 0 01 and 0 025 cm d 1 for our further field capacity simulations for the fields located in northwest and southeast alabama respectively 3 2 flux based field capacity estimation and comparison with other empirical methods estimated ψ fc values using the negligible flux density hy twarakavi et al 2009 tw and liang et al 2016 li methods for the 20 sampling locations from four agricultural fields of northwest and southeast alabama are given in table 2 for hy two soil profile depths 0 0 45 m and 0 0 6 m were considered in order to better represent the effective soil depth according to the root growth system average of fc estimated at sm1 and sm2 was used to represent the 0 0 45 m soil profile depth while the average of fc estimated at sm1 sm2 and sm3 represented the 0 0 6 m soil profile depth as given in fig 4 since tw and li methods use the soil hydraulic properties to estimate soil at fc ψ fc was estimated individually for each soil depth of sampling location where the soil hydraulic properties were assessed in order to compare the results from the flux based fc simulations based on the two soil profile depths 0 0 45 and 0 0 6 m ψ fc determined at 0 15 and 0 3 m soil depth estimated by each empirical method tw and li was average and this value represented ψ fc for the 0 0 45 m soil profile depth for the 0 0 6 m soil profile depth ψ fc was represented by the average of ψ fc estimated at 0 15 0 3 and 0 6 m soil depth for hy method considering q fc target depth at 0 45 m the lowest ψ fc average of 43 2 standard deviation kpa was registered for the abernathy emory soil series whereas the highest ψ fc average 13 2 kpa occurred for the eunola and alpin soil series when the q fc target depth was increased to 0 6 m by adding the soil hydraulic properties of layer 0 45 0 6 m a ψ fc reduction was found the difference between ψ fc simulated for the two q fc target depths occurred because of the dynamic processes of soil water flow simulated by the hydrus 1d model although the soil profile depth was kept constant at 1 m for all simulations the q fc target depth was set at the bottom of each sampled layer 0 0 22 m 0 22 0 45 m and 0 45 0 60 m with ψ fc represented by the upward average of ψ values when the targeted q fc value was reached for heterogeneous soil profile adding extra soil material implies in increasing the vertical soil heterogeneity moreover deeper q fc target depth results in more negative ψ fc values because of the occurrence of drier layers toward the soil surface as observed in our simulation results these differences in ψ fc may considerably impact irrigation management therefore for irrigation purposes of annual crops it is desirable to define the simulated field capacity for different q fc target depths in order to reasonably track the crop water demand as the root system reaches deeper soil layers the ψ fc values estimated by hy method were fairly similar to benchmarked values bm 33 and 10 kpa for fine and coarse soil textures for all the soil series studied except for abernathy emory soil series that the estimated ψ fc values were about 10 and 19 kpa lower than the bm value of 33 kpa for a soil profile depth of 0 0 45 and 0 0 6 m respectively the tw method yielded more negative ψ fc values for decatur and eunola soil series than those values achieved by hy method for the eunola soil series tw method estimated inconsistent ψ fc values below 300 kpa considerably deviating from the other methods as an indication that the empirical equation proposed by tw method failed for the eunola soil series of our studied site irmak et al 2014 studying a soil with similar soil textural properties in nebraska recommended irrigation triggering at 20 kpa which suggests that ψ fc of this soil should be higher than 20 kpa regarding the li method it yielded lower ψ fc for decatur and eunola and larger for ψ fc for abernathy emory and alpin soil series than the hy method table 2 interestingly for alpin soil family li method table 2 was quite close to the bm value of 10 kpa for this soil type this method was calibrated and validated for agronomic soils located in south georgia which are very similar to the alpin soil family of our studied sites therefore it is expected that their method will perform better for soils with higher sand content for the abernathy emory soil family ψ fc estimated by hy method were marginally lower than the values calculated by the other two empirical equations the decatur soil series for example presented higher standard deviation of ψ fc values for both empirical methods 13 kpa in comparison with hy method 11 kpa because of the empirical methods use a few hydraulic parameters of the vgm equation the models could present higher sensitivity to small changes of these parameters which in turns yielded higher fluctuation of the estimated ψ fc values on the other hand hy method uses an internal drainage flux model approach to simulate water flow in the soil profile which is dependent on all soil hydraulic parameters that define the soil water retention and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity therefore producing more reliable ψ fc estimation the mean ψ fc value simulated by hy method for the decatur soil series with q fc target depth at 0 45 m was statistically different p 0 05 from that simulated by the li method significant differences between these two methods also occurred for the alpin soil series independently of the q fc target depth the results presented in table 2 show that the estimated ψ fc values may differ among the methods selected which could potentially impact on the calculated irrigation recommendations therefore we evaluated the impact of estimated ψ fc values based on the selected methods to identify whether or not these values would result in significant differences on the irrigation depth fig 8 the calculation was performed for an arbitrary swd i value of 35 applied for two soil profile depths 0 3 and 0 6 m for the 0 3 and 0 6 m deep soil profile of the alpin soil series the mean values of irrigation depth based on the ψ fc estimated by hy method and using a bm value of 10 kpa were statistically lower p 0 05 from that estimated by the li method for the other soil series decatur and abernathy emory no significant differences p 0 05 between irrigation depths were observed no statistical test was performed for the eunola soil series irrigation depths because of the low number of replications only two the results shown in fig 8 are explained by the combined effect of shape of the swrc and the estimated ψ fc values lying within the swrc for example fine textured soils decatur and abernathy emory are less sensitivity to changes in awc than coarse textured soils eunola and alpin within the wet end of the swrc it is assumed therefore that a large difference in ψ fc value for fine textured soils may result in smaller impact on irrigation triggering and depth than for coarse textured soils considering a 0 6 m soil profile depth for the decatur soil series the difference of irrigation depth between hy and li method was about 3 mm for a ψ fc difference of 17 kpa on the other hand for the alpin soil series and for the same soil profile depth irrigation depth deviation between the same methods was 15 mm for a ψ fc difference of only 7 kpa in fig 9 is shown the impact of different ψ fc values on hypothetical irrigation depths assuming a 35 swd i and a soil profile depth of 0 6 m to the four soils series analyzed in this study it can be noticed that the less sensitive soil series to changes of ψ fc values are the decatur and abernathy emory fine textured soils where the irrigation depth values remained within a narrow range while the ψ fc ranged from 20 kpa to 50 kpa which is a common range for these soil types romano and santini 2002 twarakavi et al 2009 on the other hand the irrigation depth of the other soil series eunola and alpin coarse textured soils showed considerably larger sensitivity to changes of ψ fc values mainly within the range of 5 and 15 kpa usually found for coarse textured soils liang et al 2016 romano and santini 2002 the decatur and abernathy emory soils series have larger clay content than the alpin and eunola soils table 1 which grants larger quantity of micropores and therefore a less sharp reduction of θ with small decrement of ψ more negative on the other hand the alpin and eunola soils have at least 90 and 76 sand respectively implying that even under a small decrease of ψ near soil saturation is followed by a sharp reduction in θ consequently altering the awc values considerably accordingly the correct ψ fc assessment for coarse textured soils is essential to prevent either over irrigation depths or drought stresses the ψ fc values reported in previous studies for similar soil texture as alpin and eunola soil series rivers and shipp 1972 liang et al 2016 are a somewhat higher than the values reported in this study table 2 such differences may be due to site specific soil hydraulic variability indicating that ψ fc determination for coarse textured soils requires the local assessment of soil hydraulic properties giving that biased ψ fc may lead to erroneous irrigation recommendations these results suggest that a more robust and reliable assessment of ψ fc values can be obtained when using internal drainage numerical experiments using process based models e g hydrus 1d in comparison with other empirical methods especially when using site specific soil properties for these numerical simulations it is important to emphasize however that the impact of ψ fc values reported in this study on crop yield and water use efficiency was not tested however future evaluations are required in order to include these state variables in more comprehensive simulation scenarios 3 3 ψ lim based on pre defined irrigation depths the determination of ψ fc is the first step to achieve efficient irrigation management especially when tracking ψ using soil sensors site specific knowledge of k ψ θ relations is needed to estimate of ψ fc because of the need to reliably determine irrigation triggers for fixed irrigation depths these irrigation triggers may considerably improve irrigation water efficiency and facilitate producer s adoption of sensor based irrigation scheduling given their preference for fixed irrigation depth in the following the hydrus 1d flux based ψ fc values were applied to investigate ψ lim that corresponds to replenishing the soil with a specific irrigation depth of the studied soil series the calculated ψ lim values for pre defined irrigation depths ranging from 5 mm to 25 mm with 2 5 mm increment for the decatur abernathy emory eunola and alpin soils series at two soils depths are shown in table 3 as expected the estimated ψ lim decreased and its equivalent swd i for the four soil types and profile depths increased accordingly to the irrigation depth increment however the decreased pattern of ψ lim and increased patten of swd i changed by soil type the differences in ψ lim and swd i between soils were mainly because of the awc for a given ψ fc value which was controlled by the k ψ θ relations for the decatur and abernathy emory soil series that presented similar physic and hydraulic behavior and similar awc 0 12 cm3 cm 3 the swd i response to changes in irrigation depth was fairly similar table 3 however because of the estimated ψ fc value for the abernathy emory soil series was about 20 kpa lower than the decatur soil series table 2 lower ψ lim values for abernathy emory soil series were found within the range of 0 50 swd i where most of irrigation scenarios will occur although the estimated ψ fc values were similar for eunola and alpin soil series table 2 a faster decrease in ψ lim and increase in swd i as irrigation depth increased was observed for the alpin soil in relation to the eunola soil table 3 this was mainly due to the larger awc for the eunola soil 0 17 cm3 cm 3 than that of the alpin soil 0 08 cm3 cm 3 many irrigation practitioners traditionally prefer to manage their irrigated fields by applying fixed irrigation depths throughout the growing season usually relying on empirical assessment of soil water stress to trigger their irrigation systems although less labor intensive and requiring less investment this irrigation scheme may substantially reduce crop yield because of either under or over estimation of irrigation depth in contracts if a pre defined irrigation depth based on site specific awc thresholds is used the overall irrigation water efficiency is expected to increase due to better irrigation timing the data shown in table 3 is a plausible strategy to improve irrigation scheduling allowing the correct irrigation timing based on ψ lim values that meet fixed irrigation depths based on an acceptable swd i range selecting an allowable 35 swd i irmak et al 2014 and a rooted soil profile depth of 0 3 m representing a cropping system in the early vegetative stage the ψ lim for the soil series decatur abernathy emory eunola and alpin was 92 121 42 and 32 kpa respectively corresponding to an irrigation depths of 10 12 16 and 8 mm maintaining the same 35 swd i but increasing the rooted soil profile depth to 0 6 m fully developed crop the ψ lim became slightly more negative 103 133 51 and 39 kpa followed by the irrigation depths 20 24 33 and 15 mm for decatur abernathy emory eunola and alpin soils respectively in one of the few available studies that reported ψ lim and its correspondent irrigation depth for a 0 3 m deep under a 35 swd i irmak et al 2014 have recommended ψ lim values of 23 kpa for fine sand soils and 50 kpa for fine sandy loam soils these values were about 9 kpa higher and 8 kpa lower than those presented in our study for alpin sand soils and eunola sandy loam soils soil series respectively interestingly the corresponding irrigation depth for the ψ lim and the awc reported by these authors were the same as those found in our study for alpin soil 8 mm and 0 08 cm3 cm 3 these results could be explained by the differences in the ψ θ relation in the upper and lower limit of the swrc in which these authors may have found higher ψ fc θ fc and ψ pwp θ pwp relation than the ones reported in our study consequently it may have led to a shift the ψ lim but maintaining similar irrigation depth and awc in comparison to the alpin soil although these authors did not report ψ lim values for clay loam soils the authors have suggested values ranging from 90 to 110 kpa for silt loam silty clay loam soils with correspondent irrigation depth of 22 mm while the ψ lim values were found to be similar from those observed for decatur and abernathy emory soils series clay loam found in our study its corresponding irrigation depth was about 11 mm higher than the ones found for the same soil series these discrepancies in recommended irrigation depth were explained by the differences of awc values where these authors have reported a awc about 0 06 cm3 cm 3 larger than those found for the soil in northwest alabama and consequently granting larger irrigation for a same swd i value information about ψ lim and its corresponding recommended irrigation depth based on an allowable swd i is still lacking in the literature which could be associated the fact that the estimation of a swrc is labor intensive time consuming and costly instead studies have been mainly focused on the evaluation of different ψ lim as irrigation timing on yield due to its opportunity to improve in situ irrigation scheduling regardless of the irrigation depth or the allowable swd i considered in a study that investigated the response curve for irrigation triggering values varying from 5 to 80 kpa and different nitrogen application levels in a fine texture vertisols soil rivera hernández et al 2010 have observed that a ψ lim of 30 kpa yielded larger irrigation water use efficiency for sweet corn recently leininger et al 2019 have evaluated different ψ lim as irrigation triggering for furrow irrigated peanuts for a fine sand texture in mississippi usa and they found that yield and irrigation water use efficiency were maximized for an irrigation triggering of 50 kpa in a literature review conducted by shock and want 2011 the authors have cited a wide list of ψ lim that can vary from 6 to 800 kpa depending on the crops irrigation systems and soil texture class although the aforementioned ψ lim values are invaluable to improve irrigation decisions and have the potential to reduce yield losses by timely start irrigation a proper irrigation scheduling depth and timing is still highly dependent on soil hydraulic properties that control the water flow processes in the vadose zone therefore an efficient irrigation management is only achieved when the empirical decisions are replaced with meaningful strategies that will maximize crop yield reduce water loss and provide higher profits to farmers such strategies can be supported when in situ ψ lim and its corresponding irrigation depth are defined as given in table 3 3 4 ψ lim based on pre defined soil profile depth as mentioned before producers have been traditionally applying water based on a fixed irrigation event the results shown in table 3 could be useful to promote best irrigation management practice by providing ψ lim values for pre defined irrigation depths however this strategy may fail if plant root depth and an allowable swd i are not taken into consideration which could promote larger water deficit stress late irrigation triggering or over irrigation early irrigation triggering in order to further evaluate the ψ lim of the studied soils series fig 9 is shown the absolute number of ψ lim ψ lim and its respective swd i for five fixed irrigation depths and rooted soil profiles ranging from 0 15 to 0 6 m with 0 075 m increment the root depth range allows to assess the ψ lim and swd i for a given irrigation depth throughout the crop growth season as the plants root system grows deeper from fig 10 two main findings were observed for the analyzed soils i for the same irrigation depth a decreasing pattern of ψ lim as the root depth increases and ii for the same soil depth an increasing pattern of ψ lim as the irrigation depth increases these observed patterns may not hold for other soil types given that they depend on the upper and lower limits of awc ψ fc and ψ pwp of the added soil layers as the root system grows small values of awc will return lower ψ lim more negative and higher swd i to illustrate this result when the irrigation depth is 10 6 mm for the decatur soil series fig 10a the calculated swd i eq 10 was 50 30 and 20 at 0 15 0 3 and 0 6 m soil depths respectively meaning that ψ lim becomes less positive from top to bottom 200 100 and 50 kpa respectively given that for all analyzed soils the surface layer 0 0 22 m presented narrow awc values the returned swd i was larger than that of the weighted awc as deeper layers were added following the same rationale for a given soil depth higher irrigation depth will allow higher swd i thus more positive values of ψ lim will occur considering a fixed irrigation depth scenario of 20 3 mm for every irrigation event the returned swd i thresholds for decatur fig 10a abernathy emory fig 10b eunola fig 10c and alpin fig 10d soils with root depth at 0 6 m were 35 31 25 and 53 respectively however if the same irrigation depth 20 3 mm was applied for crops with root depth at 0 15 m the returned swd i values for the decatur abernathy emory eunola and alpin fig 10d were 98 95 89 and 100 respectively which are at or close to ψ pwp these results emphasized that using the same irrigation depth during the entire crop growth season could be a flawed irrigation management strategy thus confirming the hypothesis that the irrigation depth should dynamically change over the growth season as the plant roots reach deeper soil layers to further highlight this issue assuming that a 35 swd i is an adequate threshold dashed gray lines in fig 10 the irrigation depth that corresponds to such swd i can be easily selected based on the root depth range from 0 15 to 0 6 m it is worth noting that the relatively large awc value for the eunola soil returned higher irrigation depths than the values reported for its counterpart also coarse textured alpin soil fig 10d as a result irrigation scheme should be managed with high frequency and low depth in the early stages of the plant growth root system constrained to the top soil at later phenological stages deeper root system the irrigation depth can be increased while its frequency is reduced however in case of calculated irrigation depth is higher than the irrigation system capacity or the application rate exceeding the soil water infiltration rate the irrigation depth must be reduced while its frequency is increased therefore fixed irrigation depth schemes without taking into consideration the vertical soil heterogeneity and root depth variation over the growth season may not be recommended as an efficient strategy in this sense the most adequate irrigation scheme that reduces the chances of exposing crops to drought stress consists in trigger irrigation whenever the soil water content reaches the maximum allowable swd i following this scheme the irrigation depth consists in the water depth necessary to bring the soil water content at ψ lim back to field capacity ψ fc 4 conclusions the soil matric potential at field capacity ψ fc estimated with an internal drainage numerical experiment using a negligible drainage flux q fc of 0 01 and 0 025 cm d 1 yielded best results for the irrigation recommendation vs accumulated estimated crop evapotranspiration relationship for the soils located at northwest and southeast alabama respectively such q fc values were used for the calculation of irrigation tension threshold values ψ lim based on different pre defined irrigation depths and soil profile depths for the soils located at northwest alabama fine textured soils the ψ fc ranged from 26 to 43 kpa for a 0 0 45 m soil profile depth and from 31 to 52 kpa for a 0 0 6 m soil profile depth in southeast alabama coarse textured soils ψ fc was higher less negative than the soil from northwest alabama for this region ψ fc was 13 kpa for a 0 0 45 m soil profile depth and ranged from 14 to 15 kpa for a 0 0 6 m soil profile depth the returned value of ψ lim and its corresponding soil water depletion for pre defined irrigation depths ranging from 5 to 25 mm changed for all agronomic soil evaluated the ψ lim decreased more negative as irrigation depth increased for all soils evaluated for the same irrigation depth ψ lim increased as more soil layers were considered for irrigation calculations additionally soils with larger sand content southeast alabama yielded higher ψ lim in comparison with the soils with lower sand content northwest alabama for the same pre defined irrigation depth it was observed that depending on the soil hydraulic properties and the depth of the root system using the same fixed irrigation amount during the growing season could potentially reduce yield due to a high level of soil water stress the differences of ψ lim values and irrigation depth among the soil series evaluated highlighted the importance of determining ψ lim values considering site specific soil hydraulic characteristics to promote best irrigation management practices declaration of

9813,slope runoff acts as a driving force for soil erosion on the loess plateau but is also an important water source for alleviating water shortages and maintaining vegetation growth identifying how to regulate runoff can help solve the problems of water shortages and soil erosion this study aimed to determine the effectiveness of conservation measures on controlling slope runoff and soil loss in a 20 runoff plot using scouring experiments the treatments included plots with bare slope ck and three typical soil and water conservation swc measures engineering measures fish scale pits fsps vegetation measures grass revegetation by alfalfa gr and agricultural measures straw mulching sm the results showed that the swc practices significantly p 0 05 controlled runoff and soil loss the gr fsps and sm significantly delayed runoff start time by 150 250 200 300 and 250 400 respectively compared with ck and reduced runoff coefficients by 25 60 7 50 and 40 80 respectively the runoff reduction rate rrb and sediment reduction rate srb averaged 33 6 and 82 1 43 7 and 76 4 and 82 3 and 94 0 respectively for the gr fsps and sm treatments however the effectiveness decreased with increasing inflow rate especially for the fsps as they were gradually destroyed and lost their ability to control runoff scour at 7 0 m3 h 1 the rrb and srb were most affected by sm compared with fsps and gr all three swc measures increased the darcy weisbach friction coefficients f and reduced the velocity v reynolds re and froude fr numbers except for fsps at 7 0 m3 h 1 all swc treatments had a laminar flow regime and subcritical flow state gray correlation analysis gra showed that stream power and reynolds number had better relational degrees with erosion rate for conservation measures followed by shear stress indicating that they may be preferred descriptors of the erosional process these results provide meaningful guidance on measures for preventing soil erosion on sloping farmland in the loess plateau keywords overland flow loess plateau soil erosion soil and water conservation hydraulic characteristics 1 introduction soil erosion is a global environmental problem that can lead to land degradation reduce agricultural productivity deteriorate water quality and cause flood risks all of which threaten the sustainable development of human society issaka and ashraf 2017 li and wei 2014 wei et al 2010 extreme storms are expected to become more frequent with global climate change exacerbating water erosion in arid and semi arid regions due to their low vegetation cover especially on china s loess plateau wei et al 2018 the hilly region of the loess plateau is one of the most severely eroded areas in china and possibly the world due to its unique precipitation characteristics high soil erodibility and intensive human activities shi and shao 2000 generally heavy rainfall from july to september causes runoff on hillslopes which is the driving force for soil erosion but is also a critical water resource for alleviating drought and water shortages in this region researchers have proposed engineering vegetation and agricultural measures such as fish scale pits fsps grass restoration and mulching respectively to protect the soil against further degradation and regulate surface runoff wen and zhen 2020 these measures are typically used to regulate surface runoff control erosion and harvest rainwater at the hillslope scale on the loess plateau li et al 2018 suo et al 2019 liao et al 2021 fish scale pits improve soil moisture and reduce surface runoff and sediment transport during heavy rainstorms by altering the slope micro landform increase surface roughness and weaken the impact of raindrop kinetic energy on soil song et al 2020 thus promoting vegetation survival rates and indirectly help maintain soil fertility guo et al 2019 han et al 2018 found that land with fsps had significantly less runoff and sediment than bare land the application of fsps in forest and steppe zones of the loess plateau increased soil organic matter capillary porosity and soil nitrogen content thereby enhancing land productivity and increasing species diversity of plant communities fu et al 2010 however fsps can be damaged by high intensity runoff which dramatically decreases their erosion reduction benefits vegetation restoration is the most effective measure for controlling water erosion and decreasing soil nutrient losses worldwide especially in arid and semiarid regions liang et al 2020 han et al 2021 taking the loess plateau as an example vegetation restoration after implementing the grain for green project increased plant species diversity canopy coverage and biomass consequently decreasing runoff and soil erosion wang et al 2019 many studies have discussed the effectiveness of different vegetation species on water erosion control zhu et al 2021 found that the shrub community controlled runoff and soil erosion whereas the grass community reduced soil erosion while increasing rainwater infiltration the dense canopies of forestlands and shrublands can intercept rainfall significantly reducing soil and water losses song et al 2014 however forestlands generally consume high soil moisture leading to soil desiccation and degradation in semiarid areas yu et al 2018 wang et al 2012 showed that anthropogenic forest plantations are not beneficial for mitigating water stress whereas grasslands were better than plantation forestlands and shrublands for flow deceleration and erosion control while using minimal water liu et al 2020 grass coverage regulates the formation of concentrated flow and sediment transport by limiting the water available for slope runoff dorioz et al 2006 aboveground vegetation increases surface roughness enhancing infiltration and reducing surface scouring by runoff kurothe et al 2014 macropores formed by the root system create conditions for preferential water flow in addition de baets et al 2009 indicated that grasslands have a shallow but dense lateral spreading rooting pattern increasing the resistance of topsoil against concentrated flow erosion and reducing potential erosion therefore grasslands appear to be better for conserving soil and water in semiarid regions mulching is an effective conversation practice for reducing runoff and soil losses over long periods giller et al 2009 mulching comprises a layer of material other than soil or growing vegetation applied to the bare soil or around existing plants therefore mulching protects soil resources from erosion by promoting infiltration during rainfall decreasing runoff amount velocity and connectivity and preventing the soil surface from raindrop impact and runoff crusting prosdocimi et al 2017 rahma et al 2019 tested two typical soils in the loess plateau of china a silt loam and a clay loam to show that covering the soil with mulch reduced runoff amounts compared with no mulch cover dai et al 2018 tested the effectiveness of straw mulching on regulating runoff and sediment under heavy rainfall and found that runoff depths and sediment yields declined by 81 and 97 respectively mulching influences soil and water losses in complex ways thus it is imperative to deepen our knowledge of the processes and mechanisms of mulching to prevent soil and water loss according to the literature reviewed above soil and water conservation swc practices can modify sediment transport processes to change the flow characteristics and dynamic mechanisms of soil erosion analyzing slope runoff hydraulics during the erosion process is necessary to characterize soil erosion quantitatively swc measures can increase slope surface roughness consequently leading to an increase in the darcy weisbach friction coefficient and decrease in flow velocity reynolds number and froude number zhang et al 2010a flow hydraulics are directly related to sediment detachment transport deposition and rill development aksoy and kavvas 2005 although these results are reported elsewhere the differences in overland flow hydraulics under different runoff scouring conditions is unclear therefore exploring the hydraulic characteristics and dynamic erosion mechanisms of overland flow under different swc practices on steep hillslopes is necessary the conservation measures mentioned above can contribute to minimizing soil erosion however suitable conditions for their application vary with the individual conservation practice few studies have systematically compared the efficiency of various swc practices on soil water erosion control and there is a lack of knowledge on the applicability of these conservation measures in sediment reduction and runoff maintenance under varied rainfall causing runoff processes to increase the effectiveness of swc practices and their adoption rate promising conservation measures must be identified by evaluating the impact of swc practices on runoff and soil erosion the hydraulic characteristics of these complicated underlying surfaces under various rainfall causing runoff processes also need further analysis this study aimed to determine the optimal soil erosion control practices for the commonly used swc measures on the loess plateau three typical swc practices on the loess plateau fish scale pits grass restoration by alfalfa and straw mulching were selected to 1 evaluate their effectiveness on reducing runoff and sediment losses and 2 clarify their hydraulic characteristics to reveal the mechanisms controlling soil erosion the findings of these runoff scouring experiments will provide theoretical guidance to achieve the combined goal of reducing runoff and sediment in semiarid areas 2 material and methods 2 1 test location the experiments were conducted at a field site in yan an shaanxi province china 36 11 37 09 n 109 21 110 03 e fig 1a b yan an is in the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau with high terrain elevation in the northwest and low elevation in the southeast average elevation 1200 m the area has an arid to semiarid climate the mean annual precipitation is approximately 500 mm with 60 70 occurring from july to september in the form of high intensity short duration rain storms the soil is loessal soil the fractions of clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 063 mm and sand 0 063 2 mm are 10 2 59 4 and 30 4 respectively soil texture is classified as silty loam soil according to the international soil texture classification criteria iuss working group wrb 2015 fish scale pits can be used for afforestation and land preparation in broken terrain areas and have been used extensively to control soil erosion at the hillslope scale on the northern loess plateau they are semicircular pits joined in a triangular shape similar to a fish scale arrangement constructed on steep slopes sun et al 2019 fig 1d straw mulching can be used to conserve soil and water in this region corn straw is easily accessible because corn is widely planted in local areas as part of the grain for green project yan an returned about 71 800 ha of farmland to forestland and grassland by the end of 2016 accounting for 19 4 of the total farmland area zhang et al 2020 revegetation species included purple alfalfa medicago sativa sea buckthorn hipporhae rhamnoides economic forest malus pumila and black locust robinia pseudoacacia in addition revegetation of degraded arable land with legume pasture alfalfa improves vegetation conditions and controls soil and water losses on the loess plateau dong et al 2020 in yan an more than 13 300 ha on average has been revegetated annually with alfalfa since 2000 song 2013 2 2 experimental devices and design runoff scouring experiments were conducted in the field under different inflow intensities to evaluate the effect of swc measures on water erosion at the hillslope scale the erosion scouring experimental treatments are shown in fig 1c and d each runoff plot was 20 0 m long and 3 0 m wide the hillslopes were relatively gentle 25 zhang et al 2019 tang et al 1998 suggested that slope gradients exceeding 20 should be banned from farming as it is considered the critical slope for developing gully erosion hence we set the slope of each runoff plot at 20 steel plates were used to isolate experimental slopes by inserting the plates approximately 0 2 m deep the experimental devices included an overflow buffering tank water supply system and a runoff collecting device fig 1c the overflow tank for supplying inflow was placed on the upper end of the runoff plots clear water was pumped into the buffering tank using the water supply system to eliminate runoff turbulence before discharging water onto the runoff plots the flow rate was controlled by valves installed on a flow diversion box and measured directly using a flow meter when the runoff generated on the slope the runoff collection device was used to collect runoff and sediment samples hillslope soil erosion is usually induced by water flow in response to short duration high intensity rainfall given the propensity for short duration high intensity summer rainfall events on the loess plateau to cause severe soil erosion maximum 10 min rainfall intensity r10 0 7 2 8 mm min 1 guo et al 2021 the experimental rainfall intensity treatments were set to 30 50 60 80 100 and 120 mm h 1 the experimental inflow rate of concentrated flow q m3 h 1 was calculated by multiplying the rainfall intensity r mm h 1 by the plot area a 60 m2 therefore the experimental inflow rates were 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 m3 h 1 prior to the experiment inflow intensities were calibrated to ensure that the tested inflow rate reached the requirement the relative errors of the inflow rates were less than 5 the four experimental treatments included bare slope ck slope with grass revegetation by alfalfa gr slope with straw mulching sm and slope with fish scale pits fsps all treatments were replicated three times with 72 runoff scouring experiments conducted in total the gr plots were planted with alfalfa medicago sativa liu et al 2020 examined the benefits of controlling soil erosion in grasslands using published data and found that the effectiveness of vegetation restoration increased with increasing vegetation cover and tended to be stable when the coverage exceeded 60 nearly 65 vegetation coverage was selected in this research study and the canopy height was approximately 15 cm the fsps had multiple semicircular pits arranged in a triangular pattern pits were dug in the soil trough in the slope direction using a hoe fig 1d each pit was 100 cm in diameter 50 cm long and 50 cm deep rahma et al 2019 analyzed the efficacy of applying mulch to save soil and water from cultivated soils and concluded that silt loam could be treated with a mulch rate as low as 0 4 kg m 2 to prevent 60 90 of soil losses on short slopes the runoff and sediment reduction benefit would increase slightly when the straw mulching rate reached 0 8 kg m 2 hence the sm plots were covered with 0 75 kg m 2 dry straw equating to approximately 85 mulch coverage the soil bulk densities of the 0 20 cm soil layer for ck fsps sm and gr were 1 31 1 26 1 30 and 1 23 g cm 3 and the antecedent soil moisture contents at the start of the experiment were 11 0 11 3 12 1 and 10 4 respectively 2 3 measurements each scouring experiment lasted 30 min when runoff was generated from the slope a timer was started and the time of runoff initiation was recorded runoff samples were collected continuously in barrels at the plot outlet fig 1c for each experiment duration at one minute intervals to ensure accurate runoff and sediment measurements flow velocity was measured using the dye method kmno4 in four 1 m long observation sections positioned from upslope 0 5 m to downslope 19 5 m the average of the measured flow velocities on the four sections was corrected by multiplying by the error correction factor of 0 75 zhang et al 2010b after the erosion scouring events ended the runoff sample volumes were measured and weighed and the sediments were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to calculate sediment yield and sediment discharge runoff rates and sediment discharges are determined by dividing the runoff volume and sediment weight collected from the outlet respectively by the collection time the sediment concentration was calculated as the ratio of sediment weight to runoff volume cumulative runoff and soil loss data were obtained based on the measured runoff time interval and sediment concentration prosdocimi et al 2017 the volumetric soil water contents 0 20 cm in the upslope 0 6 5 m middle slope 6 5 13 5 m and downslope 13 5 20 0 m for each treatment were measured before and after the scouring experiment using a portable soil moisture measurement instrument diviner2000 sentek australia which were used to calculate the percentage change in soil moisture before and after the experiment to explain the water storage effect of the swc measures 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 runoff and sediment reduction rate the runoff reduction benefit rrb and sediment reduction benefit srb were used to measure the performance of swc practices on controlling soil and water losses relative to ck zhao et al 2014 higher rrb and srb values indicate more effective runoff maintenance and sediment reductions 1 rrb r ck r tm r ck 100 where rck and rtm are the runoff rates of the ck and treated slopes respectively 2 srb s ck s tm s ck 100 where sck and stm are the sediment yields of the ck and treated slopes respectively 2 4 2 hydraulic parameters average water depth was calculated by assuming the slope flow is uniform 3 h q bv where h is average water depth m q is runoff rate m3 s 1 b is average width of

ω τ v 2 4 3 gray relational analysis gra the gra method is used to evaluate the closeness of the relationship by determining the correlation degree of a gray system with incomplete information and uncertain relationships lu et al 2021 the method is used widely in the information theory field due to its less strict requirement for sample size and typical statistical distribution and ease of calculation the slope erosion system can be regarded as a gray system therefore we used the gra method to calculate the gray relational degrees matrix representing the degree of correlation between hydraulic parameters and erosion rate the procedures were as follows 1 identify the factor series and initialize experimental data the reference sequence x 0 was erosion rate and the comparison sequences x i were the five hydraulic parameters the initial values of different series were normalized due to the different units such that 10 x 0 k x 0 k 1 n k 1 n x 0 k 11 x i k x i k 1 n k 1 n x i k 2 calculate the absolute values δ0i k between x 0 and x i expressed as 12 0 i k x 0 k x i k 13 min min 0 min i 0 i k 14 max max 0 max i 0 i k 3 calculate the gray relational coefficient which shows the relative closeness of indicators x i and x 0 calculated as 15 ξ 0 i k min λ max 0 i k λ max where λ is a distinguishing coefficient varying from 0 to 1 used to enlarge or compress the range of the gray relational coefficient a value of 0 5 is usually adopted 4 calculate the gray relational degree the arithmetic mean of gray relational coefficients is used to represent the gray relational degree for the x i series given by 16 γ 0 i 1 n t 1 n ξ 0 i k 2 5 statistical analysis scatter plots and bar charts were used to provide a visual comparison for runoff sediment runoff and sediment reduction benefit at different flow scouring rates for different treatments a duncan s least significant difference lsd test was conducted to examine significant differences in runoff soil loss and hydrodynamic parameters between ck and swc practices all statistical tests were considered significant at the p 0 05 level the above analyses were undertaken with spss v25 0 spss inc chicago usa and all graphs were drawn in sigma plot v12 5 systat software inc san jose usa 3 results 3 1 runoff responses to different swc practices the runoff start times and runoff coefficients for the different management practices under scouring are in table 1 no runoff occurred with fsps under the 2 0 m3 h 1 inflow rate or sm under the 2 0 4 0 m3 h 1 inflow rate therefore they are not shown in the tables or figures the runoff start times and runoff coefficients varied significantly p 0 05 between treatments for the bare slope ck the runoff scouring experiments always had earlier runoff start times and higher runoff coefficients than fsps gr and sm under scouring rates from 2 0 to 7 0 m3 h 1 for example at 5 0 m3 h 1 the gr fsps and sm treatments increased the runoff start time by 2 8 3 9 and 6 3 times and decreased the runoff coefficients by 29 42 and 83 respectively compared to ck conservation practices increased the time to runoff by increasing the surface roughness and decreased the runoff coefficient by reducing steady runoff rates and increasing the time required to achieve steady runoff rates as inflow rate increased differences in runoff start times and runoff coefficients decreased for all four surfaces especially for the scouring experiments at 7 0 m3 h 1 there were no significant differences p 0 05 in the runoff start times for swc practices at this inflow rate 5 9 min for gr 5 9 min for fsps and 6 8 min for sm but they prolonged the time to runoff by 1 8 times than ck however runoff coefficients for the swc treatments differed the fsps had a higher runoff coefficient 0 80 than gr 0 59 and sm 0 52 at 7 0 m3 h 1 and was close to the values observed in the bare plots 0 86 according to the experimental recorded data rills erosion occurred on bare slopes at 4 7 m3 h 1 and fsp slopes at 6 7 m3 h 1 with the formation of rills surface flow gradually converted into concentrated flow leading to high runoff coefficients runoff amounts differed significantly for the swc plots relative to the bare slope 0 54 3 02 m3 fig 2 the swc practices raised the surface roughness of the hillslope increasing infiltration runoff amount was coupled with the spatial variability of surface conditions which hindered the formation of surface runoff and attenuated the scouring of runoff along the slope runoff rates followed similar trends in all treatments under different scouring rates fig 3 generally three distinct stages in the runoff process were observed stage i was prior to the start of runoff when water infiltrated the soil but no runoff occurred stage ii was a rapid decline in infiltration and runoff started and increased rapidly stage iii was the beginning of a relatively constant runoff rate indicating a constant infiltration rate clear differences occurred in temporal variations in runoff rate between water discharge rates and conservation measures the bare slope ck always had the highest runoff rate in stage iii which initially experienced a sharp increase before gradually rising with scouring duration until reaching a steady state runoff rate ranging from 30 to 100 l min 1 under different scouring rates for the swc treatments runoff rates increased more gradually during the observation period and sm always had the lowest runoff rate 3 2 sediment responses to different swc practices the swc practices produced less sediment than bare land with significant differences in total sediment between treatments p 0 05 in response to different water discharge rates fig 4 the temporal change of sediment rates varied between treatments fig 5 due to abundant loose material in the slope surface ck had extremely high erosion rates during the initial scouring stage fig 5 which subsequently declined with scouring duration rills emerged on ck slopes when the inflow rate reached 4 0 m3 h 1 and evolved into the main erosion type at higher inflow rates 5 0 m3 h 1 for the gr and sm treatments only sheet erosion occurred at the different inflow rates such that the variation in erosion rates with scouring remained stable over time for most treatments the greater the inflow rate the higher the erosion rate especially for fsp slopes fig 5 inflow rates higher than 6 0 m3 h 1 gradually damaged the structure of fsps with runoff scouring as the rills evolved relatively rapidly increasing the erosion rate differences in sediment yield rates between the swc practices decreased with increasing water discharge rates the maximum erosion rates were 6696 g min 1 for fsps 2338 g min 1 for gr and 1921 g min 1 for sm at an inflow rate of 7 0 m3 h 1 the fsps gr and sm treatments had significantly less sediment than ck nonetheless when the inflow rate increased e g 6 0 and 7 0 m3 h 1 the sediment rates of gr fsps and sm gradually approached those of ck the effectiveness of fsps was less pronounced than the other swc treatments with increasing inflow rate as rills appeared and developed into the main erosion type runoff and sediment yield rates increased with increasing inflow rates for all four slope surfaces figs 3 and 5 show that fsps gr and sm had lower runoff and sediment yield rates than ck at the same scouring rate the sm treatment had the lowest total runoff and sediment yield due to its ability to regulate runoff and erosion the fsps dramatically decreased the erosion rate at low inflow rates but performed ineffectively at high inflow rates exceeding ck 3 3 runoff and sediment reduction benefits for different swc practices the rrb ranged from 62 0 to 22 6 for gr 100 7 3 for fsps and 100 39 6 for sm at inflow rates ranging from 2 0 to 7 0 m3 h 1 fig 6 the srb ranged from 89 2 to 76 7 for gr 100 56 3 for fsps and 100 81 2 for sm at inflow discharges ranging from 2 0 to 7 0 m3 h 1 fig 6 all three swc treatments had very high rrbs and srbs at 2 m3 h 1 under fsps and sm no runoff occurred and consequently no soil was lost however the rrbs for the different swc measures decreased noticeably with increasing inflow discharge especially for fsps which decreased to 7 3 at 7 0 m3 h 1 the srbs for the different swc practices also slightly decreased with increasing inflow discharge fig 6 shows that srb was higher than rrb for all treatments overall sm slopes had the highest rrbs and srbs 40 and 80 respectively during the runoff scouring experiment overall mulch had a significant beneficial effect on runoff and sediment reduction and an increase in inflow discharge counteracted the reduction effect of swcs on sediment rate 3 4 runoff hydraulic characteristics and relationships with soil erosion rate surface runoff is the main driver of water erosion but vegetation topography and mulching can alter the erosion dynamics of surface water flow and ultimately influence sediment detachment and transport the mean values of hydraulic parameters were compared among treatments table 2 the sm slope had significantly lower v re and fr and significantly higher f than the bare slope and other swc treatments overall v re and fr increased and f decreased with increasing inflow rate the mean flow velocity for the bare slope increased from 0 12 to 0 24 m s 1 with increasing flow rate a pronounced decrease in flow velocity occurred in the swc plots the bare soil plots had the highest v 0 24 m s 1 at an inflow rate of 7 0 m3 h 1 approximately twice that in the sm treatment the gr fsps and sm plots had flow velocities of 0 16 0 19 and 0 12 m s 1 respectively the swc practices and discharge intensity influenced the range of re and fr table 2 the re ranged from 78 to 407 for the gr slope 168 569 for the fsps slope and 131 322 for the sm slope fr followed a similar variation trend as re except for fsps at an inflow rate of 7 0 m3 h 1 re was less than 500 and fr was less than 1 indicating that all treatments produced a laminar flow pattern and a subcritical flow type bare land had the highest re and fr which significantly differed from the values in the swc plots the decrease in re and fr for the swc practices indicated the predominance of viscous force and gravity of flow weakened disturbance of water flow and stable water flow resulting in weak scouring of surface soil particles and slight soil erosion the darcy weisbach resistance coefficient was lowest for the bare soil ranging from 1 08 to 2 09 the fsps sm and gr plots had stronger flow resistance than the bare slope more so at the lower inflow rate as flow resistance for all treatments decreased with increasing inflow rate under different inflow rates the average resistance coefficient decreased from 16 85 to 2 83 for gr 8 26 2 62 for fsps and 7 04 5 95 for sm the impact of swc practices on the erosion dynamics of flow shear stress τ and stream power ω is shown in table 2 except for gr τ and ω increased with discharge rate ck had lower τ than the swc treatments under different scouring intensities with values ranging from 4 11 to 8 49 higher shear stress τ occurred in gr and fsps than ck increasing by 40 130 and 20 60 respectively sm had lower τ than gr and fsps with values ranging from 6 00 to 10 60 the swc practices increased surface roughness delayed runoff generation decreased flow velocity and increased flow depth and water shear stress especially for gr and fsps plant stems mulch and fish scale pits hindered water flow causing surface ponding inreasing the water level and impacting the flow shear stress results for ω differed from those for τ ck had significantly higher ω than the other treatments except fsps at inflow rates of 6 0 and 7 0 m3 h 1 stream power ranged from 0 49 to 2 04 n m 1 s 1 for ck 0 29 1 65 n m 1 s 1 for gr 0 68 2 44 n m 1 s 1 for fsps and 0 49 1 24 n m 1 s 1 for sm the three swc practices led to different intensities of reduction in stream power under different discharge rates however ω was larger for fsps than ck at an inflow rate of 7 0 m3 h 1 because fsps effectiveness gradually declined with increasing discharge rate the gra was used to estimate the influence of hydraulic parameters on erosion rate over time the gray correlation coefficients between hydraulic properties re fr f τ and ω and soil erosion rate in the ck plots and swc plots at six scouring rates 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 m3 h 1 are in table 3 the relational degrees of the erosion rate and hydrodynamic parameters for ck were ranked flow shear stress 0 858 stream power 0 847 reynolds number 0 836 froude number 0 743 darcy weisbach coefficient 0 566 for the swc measures stream power had greater gray relational degrees with erosion rate than reynolds number and flow shear stress indicating that these hydrodynamic parameters may be the preferred descriptors for the erosional process 4 discussion 4 1 soil and water conservation performance sediment detachment and transport are associated with slope runoff runoff generation is influenced by various factors including rainfall soil moisture and slope microtopography the desired impacts of swc measures are to delay surface runoff generation control soil erosion increase infiltration rate and improve soil fertility fig 7 shows that the swc practices significantly affected the amount of water infiltrating the soil as did the inflow scouring intensity the initial soil moisture from 0 to 20 cm depth did not vary among treatments 11 2 on average after the experiment soil moisture increased from 0 3 to 1 5 for all treatments fig 7 all swc practices increased soil infiltration relative to ck sm plots had significantly higher soil moisture variation at 0 20 cm depth than the other treatments a previous study suggested that straw mulching reduces the formation of soil physical crust by filtering soil particles during rainstorms lin and chen 2015 straw itself forms a runoff collection and absorption layer and additional barriers on the soil surface liao et al 2021 increasing soil water content prosdocimi et al 2017 reported that straw mulch prevented the formation of surface ponds and runoff however infiltration at the end of the experiment differed between fsps and gr when light inflow causing runoff occurred fsps always had more infiltration than gr because fsps can strengthen the roughness of slopes enhancing vertical infiltration of overland flow by intercepting runoff fu et al 2010 when heavy inflow causing runoff occurred the efficiency of the fsps stored soil moisture declined compared to gr because they were gradually destroyed and lost their ability to control runoff grassland restoration can effectively change infiltration pathways by developing root systems and lengthening the runoff path huang et al 2017 concluded that grass roots near the surface soil increase soil infiltration capacity by improving the topsoil s physical and chemical properties such as soil bulk density soil porosity and organic matter fig 8 illustrates the basic statistics for runoff and soil loss by comparing the surface slopes the three swc practices decreased soil and water losses indicating that they are suitable for the fragmented terrain on the loess plateau the sm had the greatest effect on controlling water erosion producing the highest rrb 40 100 and srb 80 100 fig 6 the fsps had higher rrb 40 100 than gr 30 60 but lower srb 50 80 than gr 80 90 under low inflow discharges however each swc practice had its own characteristics and ability to reduce rainfall power and intercept runoff therefore their efficiency for controlling soil water erosion needs further analysis understanding the impact of these conservation practices on soil erosion is important for planning natural resource management and the associated decision making sediment yield significantly declined under gr compared with bare land preventing soil and water losses the effectiveness was relatively stable only slightly changing as inflow increased these results are consistent with jin et al 2021 who demonstrated that vegetation significantly decreased soil erosion and improved soil physical chemical and biological properties alfalfa stems can slow the flow velocity and weaken the erosive force of runoff and its roots can increase the resistance to soil erosion gyssels et al 2005 zimmermann et al 2006 these factors reduced soil erosion on the gr slopes however grasslands had relatively lower rrb than srb fig 6 the runoff reduction rate associated with the planted grass slopes decreased as inflow intensity increased in some cases grasslands had higher surface runoff than bare land likely due to the presence of root systems leung et al 2015 found that roots occupied soil pores during initial growth affecting both saturated hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rate and leading to increased runoff in general grasslands had positive effects on sediment reduction and runoff maintenance ultimately improving the local environment when cultivating plants water resources should be able to maintain the long term natural growth of plants otherwise plants on slopes may die thus failing to achieve a sustainable effect as a typical vegetation type for vegetation restoration grasslands could be considered for soil loss control and water resource conservation in semiarid areas where water is limited bare slopes had more runoff and sediment than fsp slopes indicating that fsps positively affected water and soil conservation during rainwater scouring as zheng et al 2019 reported the fsp technology is often combined with afforestation technology to increase soil moisture and afforestation survival rate thus promoting the grain for green program on the arid and semiarid loess plateau since 1999 the positive effects of fsp practices are closely related to the resistance force on a slope generated from the unique topography that it creates the thin sheet flow on a slope is prone to resistance action due to the extreme shallowness of the surface runoff moreover fsps ensure that runoff does not flow in one direction reducing the runoff concentration runoff erosion capacity and soil erosion guo et al 2019 in our research the fsps performed well in regulating runoff and controlling sediment at low inflow rates with rrb ranging from 45 to 100 and srb ranging from 80 to 100 at inflow rates of 2 0 4 0 m3 h 1 however the fsps gradually lost their effectiveness when subjected to higher discharge scouring under intensive scouring conditions runoff and sediment on slopes exceeded the pits interception capacity such that excess runoff and sediment overflowed due to the limited capacity of fsps they are often destroyed by high inflow events because they become filled with sediment and runoff the rrb and srb decreased to 7 and 50 respectively at an inflow rate of 7 0 m3 h 1 fig 6 we can speculate that there is a threshold for the effect of fsps when filled with sediment and destroyed by runoff the fsp benefits of reduced erosion declined rapidly and the sediment yield exceeded that of ck by twofold sun et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to consider the influencing factors in an area such as local topography and typical rainfall characteristics to reasonably plan and arrange fsps straw mulching is a natural product that enhances long term soil function and has an immediate effect on soil erosion so it is an important option for achieving erosion control goals in a recent study on land management cerda et al 2017 straw mulching immediately reduced erosion and water loss as seen in the present study sm had superior performance in reducing runoff and sediment under almost all inflow rates this finding is in line with sadeghi et al 2015 who showed that applying sm in the alborz mountains of northern iran reduced runoff and sediment yield by 96 71 and 100 respectively under simulated rainfall intensities of 90 mm h 1 the sm treatment also increased the time to ponding and how long the ponded surfaces took to generate overflow table 1 the sm treatment had less soil particle detachment than the other treatments because mulching protected the soil surface from runoff scouring the presence of sm also formed barriers to runoff flow and created more potential ponding surfaces that intercepted runoff and delayed soil surface wetting water interception by straw could help explain the delay in runoff initiation and the decline in total runoff thus curbing water erosion directly or indirectly straw also increases soil organic matter and improves soil physical properties soil moisture and soil temperature mulumba and lal 2008 wang et al 2015 yin et al 2016 straw also positively affected nitrogen management liu et al 2017 and soil microbial biomass wang et al 2020 in addition straw mulch is a local natural agricultural product that could be an efficient solution for achieving sustainable management 4 2 hydraulic characteristics of water erosion on swc slopes this study showed that v re and fr tended to increase and f tended to decrease with increasing discharge flow rate on bare and swc slopes the variation in v with increasing discharges flow rate is similar to ali et al 2012 who showed the strong dependency of mean flow velocity on flow discharge overland flow velocity is the basis for calculating other hydrodynamic parameters according to eq 7 the darcy weisbach coefficient positively correlated with flow depth and negatively correlated with flow velocity in addition flow depth and velocity increased with increasing inflow rate table 2 explaining the decreasing darcy weisbach friction factor with increasing inflow rate table 2 gr fsps and sm significantly increased overland flow resistance reduced water flow velocity and diminished stream power table 2 compared to bare land implying that more energy from runoff was consumed to overcome flow resistance with less energy left for soil detachment and sediment transportation soil surface roughness is generally considered a key factor affecting flow resistance with a potentially positive correlation between these two factors shang et al 2020 surface cover gr and sm and fsps increase surface roughness omidvar et al 2019 guo et al 2021 shang et al 2020 prolonging the flow path improving soil resistance to the shearing force of overland flow and reducing flow erosivity the re and fr numbers decreased on all swc slopes relative to ck except fsps suffering from high inflow scouring as reported by pan and shangguan 2006 liang et al 2014 and omidvar et al 2019 the reduced re and fr can be attributed to the increase in flow depth and simultaneous decrease in flow velocity due to the increase in soil surface roughness however the effect of fsps was gradually lost as the structure became damaged and rills occurred under high inflow scouring causing relatively large re quantifying the hydrodynamic flow properties and sediment detachment rate is critical for understanding water erosion processes and sediment prediction in this study the gra showed that among many hydrodynamic factors runoff power best reflects the soil erosion rate on swc slopes and shear stress simulates the erosion process on bare slopes shear stress expresses the driving force whereas stream power represents the energy available for soil detachment they are most often adopted in hydrodynamic models for predicting soil detachment knapen et al 2007 previous studies pan and shangguan 2006 omidvar et al 2019 reported significant relationships between sediment and hydraulic characteristics in the presence of different covers such as vegetation and rock fragments or bare soil the current study identified these relationships under swc practices overall the results showed that straw mulching improved hydraulic properties more than grass restoration and fish scale pits 4 3 limitations and implications identifying the benefits of soil and water conservation measures can aid in designing more cost effective programs and evaluating programs policies and practices in this research we evaluated the effectiveness of different soil and water conservation measures some questions remain on the ecological and economic benefits and cost assessment of swc practices unlike environmental benefits it is difficult to quantify the effectiveness of swc practices when considering economic costs and ecological benefits grass restoration has gained increasing attention due to its low cost and long term high eco sustainability dong et al 2020 wu et al 2021 vegetation restoration can improve ecological factors such as vegetation productivity soil aggregation microbial community properties and soil physicochemical properties which favor environmental improvements and soil c sequestration in degraded ecosystems he et al 2016 a study on china s loess plateau indicated that restored grassland sequestrates more soil c than restored forest jin et al 2014 fsps had superior rainwater harvesting capacity which improved plant survival feng et al 2018 in addition fsps improve the soil environment including soil organic matter capillary porosity and nitrogen content increasing land productivity zhang et al 2007 however fsp construction must meet the standard distribution rules otherwise the edge is at risk of being destroyed which is accelerated by sedimentation over time periodic maintenance is indispensable for fsps to maintain their function fu et al 2010 consuming more labor and costs than the other two measures straw mulching can improve soil structure and organic matter content karami et al 2012 regulate topsoil temperature awe et al 2015 decrease evaporation li et al 2018 and enhance enzyme activity and crop performance akhtar et al 2018 increasing crop productivity the tradeoff between mulching costs and soil water conservation benefits is an important consideration we used corn straw as the mulching material in this study as it is widely planted in local areas and inexpensive moreover the application of straw mulching does not have a high labor demand sm has preferable potential to improve soil and moisture conditions and prevent soil and water losses on semiarid hillslopes providing economic and ecological benefits to farmlands however identifying the most appropriate mulch type and application rate requires further research the economic feasibility of mulching application is another fundamental aspect that should be addressed 5 conclusions we investigated the efficiency of typical soil and water conservation swc practices on the loess plateau under runoff scouring based on our data swc practices reduce soil and water losses straw mulching had the most prominent effects on controlling water erosion producing the highest runoff and sediment reduction benefits grass revegetation reduced sediment more efficient than runoff gra was used to assess the influence of hydrodynamic parameters on erosion rate revealing that stream power may be the preferred erosion process descriptor for different conservation measures overall

9813,slope runoff acts as a driving force for soil erosion on the loess plateau but is also an important water source for alleviating water shortages and maintaining vegetation growth identifying how to regulate runoff can help solve the problems of water shortages and soil erosion this study aimed to determine the effectiveness of conservation measures on controlling slope runoff and soil loss in a 20 runoff plot using scouring experiments the treatments included plots with bare slope ck and three typical soil and water conservation swc measures engineering measures fish scale pits fsps vegetation measures grass revegetation by alfalfa gr and agricultural measures straw mulching sm the results showed that the swc practices significantly p 0 05 controlled runoff and soil loss the gr fsps and sm significantly delayed runoff start time by 150 250 200 300 and 250 400 respectively compared with ck and reduced runoff coefficients by 25 60 7 50 and 40 80 respectively the runoff reduction rate rrb and sediment reduction rate srb averaged 33 6 and 82 1 43 7 and 76 4 and 82 3 and 94 0 respectively for the gr fsps and sm treatments however the effectiveness decreased with increasing inflow rate especially for the fsps as they were gradually destroyed and lost their ability to control runoff scour at 7 0 m3 h 1 the rrb and srb were most affected by sm compared with fsps and gr all three swc measures increased the darcy weisbach friction coefficients f and reduced the velocity v reynolds re and froude fr numbers except for fsps at 7 0 m3 h 1 all swc treatments had a laminar flow regime and subcritical flow state gray correlation analysis gra showed that stream power and reynolds number had better relational degrees with erosion rate for conservation measures followed by shear stress indicating that they may be preferred descriptors of the erosional process these results provide meaningful guidance on measures for preventing soil erosion on sloping farmland in the loess plateau keywords overland flow loess plateau soil erosion soil and water conservation hydraulic characteristics 1 introduction soil erosion is a global environmental problem that can lead to land degradation reduce agricultural productivity deteriorate water quality and cause flood risks all of which threaten the sustainable development of human society issaka and ashraf 2017 li and wei 2014 wei et al 2010 extreme storms are expected to become more frequent with global climate change exacerbating water erosion in arid and semi arid regions due to their low vegetation cover especially on china s loess plateau wei et al 2018 the hilly region of the loess plateau is one of the most severely eroded areas in china and possibly the world due to its unique precipitation characteristics high soil erodibility and intensive human activities shi and shao 2000 generally heavy rainfall from july to september causes runoff on hillslopes which is the driving force for soil erosion but is also a critical water resource for alleviating drought and water shortages in this region researchers have proposed engineering vegetation and agricultural measures such as fish scale pits fsps grass restoration and mulching respectively to protect the soil against further degradation and regulate surface runoff wen and zhen 2020 these measures are typically used to regulate surface runoff control erosion and harvest rainwater at the hillslope scale on the loess plateau li et al 2018 suo et al 2019 liao et al 2021 fish scale pits improve soil moisture and reduce surface runoff and sediment transport during heavy rainstorms by altering the slope micro landform increase surface roughness and weaken the impact of raindrop kinetic energy on soil song et al 2020 thus promoting vegetation survival rates and indirectly help maintain soil fertility guo et al 2019 han et al 2018 found that land with fsps had significantly less runoff and sediment than bare land the application of fsps in forest and steppe zones of the loess plateau increased soil organic matter capillary porosity and soil nitrogen content thereby enhancing land productivity and increasing species diversity of plant communities fu et al 2010 however fsps can be damaged by high intensity runoff which dramatically decreases their erosion reduction benefits vegetation restoration is the most effective measure for controlling water erosion and decreasing soil nutrient losses worldwide especially in arid and semiarid regions liang et al 2020 han et al 2021 taking the loess plateau as an example vegetation restoration after implementing the grain for green project increased plant species diversity canopy coverage and biomass consequently decreasing runoff and soil erosion wang et al 2019 many studies have discussed the effectiveness of different vegetation species on water erosion control zhu et al 2021 found that the shrub community controlled runoff and soil erosion whereas the grass community reduced soil erosion while increasing rainwater infiltration the dense canopies of forestlands and shrublands can intercept rainfall significantly reducing soil and water losses song et al 2014 however forestlands generally consume high soil moisture leading to soil desiccation and degradation in semiarid areas yu et al 2018 wang et al 2012 showed that anthropogenic forest plantations are not beneficial for mitigating water stress whereas grasslands were better than plantation forestlands and shrublands for flow deceleration and erosion control while using minimal water liu et al 2020 grass coverage regulates the formation of concentrated flow and sediment transport by limiting the water available for slope runoff dorioz et al 2006 aboveground vegetation increases surface roughness enhancing infiltration and reducing surface scouring by runoff kurothe et al 2014 macropores formed by the root system create conditions for preferential water flow in addition de baets et al 2009 indicated that grasslands have a shallow but dense lateral spreading rooting pattern increasing the resistance of topsoil against concentrated flow erosion and reducing potential erosion therefore grasslands appear to be better for conserving soil and water in semiarid regions mulching is an effective conversation practice for reducing runoff and soil losses over long periods giller et al 2009 mulching comprises a layer of material other than soil or growing vegetation applied to the bare soil or around existing plants therefore mulching protects soil resources from erosion by promoting infiltration during rainfall decreasing runoff amount velocity and connectivity and preventing the soil surface from raindrop impact and runoff crusting prosdocimi et al 2017 rahma et al 2019 tested two typical soils in the loess plateau of china a silt loam and a clay loam to show that covering the soil with mulch reduced runoff amounts compared with no mulch cover dai et al 2018 tested the effectiveness of straw mulching on regulating runoff and sediment under heavy rainfall and found that runoff depths and sediment yields declined by 81 and 97 respectively mulching influences soil and water losses in complex ways thus it is imperative to deepen our knowledge of the processes and mechanisms of mulching to prevent soil and water loss according to the literature reviewed above soil and water conservation swc practices can modify sediment transport processes to change the flow characteristics and dynamic mechanisms of soil erosion analyzing slope runoff hydraulics during the erosion process is necessary to characterize soil erosion quantitatively swc measures can increase slope surface roughness consequently leading to an increase in the darcy weisbach friction coefficient and decrease in flow velocity reynolds number and froude number zhang et al 2010a flow hydraulics are directly related to sediment detachment transport deposition and rill development aksoy and kavvas 2005 although these results are reported elsewhere the differences in overland flow hydraulics under different runoff scouring conditions is unclear therefore exploring the hydraulic characteristics and dynamic erosion mechanisms of overland flow under different swc practices on steep hillslopes is necessary the conservation measures mentioned above can contribute to minimizing soil erosion however suitable conditions for their application vary with the individual conservation practice few studies have systematically compared the efficiency of various swc practices on soil water erosion control and there is a lack of knowledge on the applicability of these conservation measures in sediment reduction and runoff maintenance under varied rainfall causing runoff processes to increase the effectiveness of swc practices and their adoption rate promising conservation measures must be identified by evaluating the impact of swc practices on runoff and soil erosion the hydraulic characteristics of these complicated underlying surfaces under various rainfall causing runoff processes also need further analysis this study aimed to determine the optimal soil erosion control practices for the commonly used swc measures on the loess plateau three typical swc practices on the loess plateau fish scale pits grass restoration by alfalfa and straw mulching were selected to 1 evaluate their effectiveness on reducing runoff and sediment losses and 2 clarify their hydraulic characteristics to reveal the mechanisms controlling soil erosion the findings of these runoff scouring experiments will provide theoretical guidance to achieve the combined goal of reducing runoff and sediment in semiarid areas 2 material and methods 2 1 test location the experiments were conducted at a field site in yan an shaanxi province china 36 11 37 09 n 109 21 110 03 e fig 1a b yan an is in the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau with high terrain elevation in the northwest and low elevation in the southeast average elevation 1200 m the area has an arid to semiarid climate the mean annual precipitation is approximately 500 mm with 60 70 occurring from july to september in the form of high intensity short duration rain storms the soil is loessal soil the fractions of clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 063 mm and sand 0 063 2 mm are 10 2 59 4 and 30 4 respectively soil texture is classified as silty loam soil according to the international soil texture classification criteria iuss working group wrb 2015 fish scale pits can be used for afforestation and land preparation in broken terrain areas and have been used extensively to control soil erosion at the hillslope scale on the northern loess plateau they are semicircular pits joined in a triangular shape similar to a fish scale arrangement constructed on steep slopes sun et al 2019 fig 1d straw mulching can be used to conserve soil and water in this region corn straw is easily accessible because corn is widely planted in local areas as part of the grain for green project yan an returned about 71 800 ha of farmland to forestland and grassland by the end of 2016 accounting for 19 4 of the total farmland area zhang et al 2020 revegetation species included purple alfalfa medicago sativa sea buckthorn hipporhae rhamnoides economic forest malus pumila and black locust robinia pseudoacacia in addition revegetation of degraded arable land with legume pasture alfalfa improves vegetation conditions and controls soil and water losses on the loess plateau dong et al 2020 in yan an more than 13 300 ha on average has been revegetated annually with alfalfa since 2000 song 2013 2 2 experimental devices and design runoff scouring experiments were conducted in the field under different inflow intensities to evaluate the effect of swc measures on water erosion at the hillslope scale the erosion scouring experimental treatments are shown in fig 1c and d each runoff plot was 20 0 m long and 3 0 m wide the hillslopes were relatively gentle 25 zhang et al 2019 tang et al 1998 suggested that slope gradients exceeding 20 should be banned from farming as it is considered the critical slope for developing gully erosion hence we set the slope of each runoff plot at 20 steel plates were used to isolate experimental slopes by inserting the plates approximately 0 2 m deep the experimental devices included an overflow buffering tank water supply system and a runoff collecting device fig 1c the overflow tank for supplying inflow was placed on the upper end of the runoff plots clear water was pumped into the buffering tank using the water supply system to eliminate runoff turbulence before discharging water onto the runoff plots the flow rate was controlled by valves installed on a flow diversion box and measured directly using a flow meter when the runoff generated on the slope the runoff collection device was used to collect runoff and sediment samples hillslope soil erosion is usually induced by water flow in response to short duration high intensity rainfall given the propensity for short duration high intensity summer rainfall events on the loess plateau to cause severe soil erosion maximum 10 min rainfall intensity r10 0 7 2 8 mm min 1 guo et al 2021 the experimental rainfall intensity treatments were set to 30 50 60 80 100 and 120 mm h 1 the experimental inflow rate of concentrated flow q m3 h 1 was calculated by multiplying the rainfall intensity r mm h 1 by the plot area a 60 m2 therefore the experimental inflow rates were 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 m3 h 1 prior to the experiment inflow intensities were calibrated to ensure that the tested inflow rate reached the requirement the relative errors of the inflow rates were less than 5 the four experimental treatments included bare slope ck slope with grass revegetation by alfalfa gr slope with straw mulching sm and slope with fish scale pits fsps all treatments were replicated three times with 72 runoff scouring experiments conducted in total the gr plots were planted with alfalfa medicago sativa liu et al 2020 examined the benefits of controlling soil erosion in grasslands using published data and found that the effectiveness of vegetation restoration increased with increasing vegetation cover and tended to be stable when the coverage exceeded 60 nearly 65 vegetation coverage was selected in this research study and the canopy height was approximately 15 cm the fsps had multiple semicircular pits arranged in a triangular pattern pits were dug in the soil trough in the slope direction using a hoe fig 1d each pit was 100 cm in diameter 50 cm long and 50 cm deep rahma et al 2019 analyzed the efficacy of applying mulch to save soil and water from cultivated soils and concluded that silt loam could be treated with a mulch rate as low as 0 4 kg m 2 to prevent 60 90 of soil losses on short slopes the runoff and sediment reduction benefit would increase slightly when the straw mulching rate reached 0 8 kg m 2 hence the sm plots were covered with 0 75 kg m 2 dry straw equating to approximately 85 mulch coverage the soil bulk densities of the 0 20 cm soil layer for ck fsps sm and gr were 1 31 1 26 1 30 and 1 23 g cm 3 and the antecedent soil moisture contents at the start of the experiment were 11 0 11 3 12 1 and 10 4 respectively 2 3 measurements each scouring experiment lasted 30 min when runoff was generated from the slope a timer was started and the time of runoff initiation was recorded runoff samples were collected continuously in barrels at the plot outlet fig 1c for each experiment duration at one minute intervals to ensure accurate runoff and sediment measurements flow velocity was measured using the dye method kmno4 in four 1 m long observation sections positioned from upslope 0 5 m to downslope 19 5 m the average of the measured flow velocities on the four sections was corrected by multiplying by the error correction factor of 0 75 zhang et al 2010b after the erosion scouring events ended the runoff sample volumes were measured and weighed and the sediments were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to calculate sediment yield and sediment discharge runoff rates and sediment discharges are determined by dividing the runoff volume and sediment weight collected from the outlet respectively by the collection time the sediment concentration was calculated as the ratio of sediment weight to runoff volume cumulative runoff and soil loss data were obtained based on the measured runoff time interval and sediment concentration prosdocimi et al 2017 the volumetric soil water contents 0 20 cm in the upslope 0 6 5 m middle slope 6 5 13 5 m and downslope 13 5 20 0 m for each treatment were measured before and after the scouring experiment using a portable soil moisture measurement instrument diviner2000 sentek australia which were used to calculate the percentage change in soil moisture before and after the experiment to explain the water storage effect of the swc measures 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 runoff and sediment reduction rate the runoff reduction benefit rrb and sediment reduction benefit srb were used to measure the performance of swc practices on controlling soil and water losses relative to ck zhao et al 2014 higher rrb and srb values indicate more effective runoff maintenance and sediment reductions 1 rrb r ck r tm r ck 100 where rck and rtm are the runoff rates of the ck and treated slopes respectively 2 srb s ck s tm s ck 100 where sck and stm are the sediment yields of the ck and treated slopes respectively 2 4 2 hydraulic parameters average water depth was calculated by assuming the slope flow is uniform 3 h q bv where h is average water depth m q is runoff rate m3 s 1 b is average width of the flow path m and v is flow velocity m s 1 the hydraulic parameters presented in this study were the reynolds number re froude number fr darcy weisbach roughness coefficient f shear stress τ pa and stream power ω n m 1 s 1 the greater the reynolds number the higher the likelihood of the occurrence of turbulent flow re is calculated as 4 re vr υ where υ is the kinematic viscosity coefficient of

respectively fr is calculated as 6 fr v gh where g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 8 m s 2 the darcy weisbach roughness coefficient f is calculated as 7 f 8 grj v 2 where j is the hydraulic gradient approximately equal to the sine of the slope gradient the shear stress τ is calculated as 8 τ ρ m grj where ρ m is water sediment mixture density kg m 3 the stream power ω is calculated as 9 ω τ v 2 4 3 gray relational analysis gra the gra method is used to evaluate the closeness of the relationship by determining the correlation degree of a gray system with incomplete information and uncertain relationships lu et al 2021 the method is used widely in the information theory field due to its less strict requirement for sample size and typical statistical distribution and ease of calculation the slope erosion system can be regarded as a gray system therefore we used the gra method to calculate the gray relational degrees matrix representing the degree of correlation between hydraulic parameters and erosion rate the procedures were as follows 1 identify the factor series and initialize experimental data the reference sequence x 0 was erosion rate and the comparison sequences x i were the five hydraulic parameters the initial values of different series were normalized due to the different units such that 10 x 0 k x 0 k 1 n k 1 n x 0 k 11 x i k x i k 1 n k 1 n x i k 2 calculate the absolute values δ0i k between x 0 and x i expressed as 12 0 i k x 0 k x i k 13 min min 0 min i 0 i k 14 max max 0 max i 0 i k 3 calculate the gray relational coefficient which shows the relative closeness of indicators x i and x 0 calculated as 15 ξ 0 i k min λ max 0 i k λ max where λ is a distinguishing coefficient varying from 0 to 1 used to enlarge or compress the range of the gray relational coefficient a value of 0 5 is usually adopted 4 calculate the gray relational degree the arithmetic mean of gray relational coefficients is used to represent the gray relational degree for the x i series given by 16 γ 0 i 1 n t 1 n ξ 0 i k 2 5 statistical analysis scatter plots and bar charts were used to provide a visual comparison for runoff sediment runoff and sediment reduction benefit at different flow scouring rates for different treatments a duncan s least significant difference lsd test was conducted to examine significant differences in runoff soil loss and hydrodynamic parameters between ck and swc practices all statistical tests were considered significant at the p 0 05 level the above analyses were undertaken with spss v25 0 spss inc chicago usa and all graphs were drawn in sigma plot v12 5 systat software inc san jose usa 3 results 3 1 runoff responses to different swc practices the runoff start times and runoff coefficients for the different management practices under scouring are in table 1 no runoff occurred with fsps under the 2 0 m3 h 1 inflow rate or sm under the 2 0 4 0 m3 h 1 inflow rate therefore they are not shown in the tables or figures the runoff start times and runoff coefficients varied significantly p 0 05 between treatments for the bare slope ck the runoff scouring experiments always had earlier runoff start times and higher runoff coefficients than fsps gr and sm under scouring rates from 2 0 to 7 0 m3 h 1 for example at 5 0 m3 h 1 the gr fsps and sm treatments increased the runoff start time by 2 8 3 9 and 6 3 times and decreased the runoff coefficients by 29 42 and 83 respectively compared to ck conservation practices increased the time to runoff by increasing the surface roughness and decreased the runoff coefficient by reducing steady runoff rates and increasing the time required to achieve steady runoff rates as inflow rate increased differences in runoff start times and runoff coefficients decreased for all four surfaces especially for the scouring experiments at 7 0 m3 h 1 there were no significant differences p 0 05 in the runoff start times for swc practices at this inflow rate 5 9 min for gr 5 9 min for fsps and 6 8 min for sm but they prolonged the time to runoff by 1 8 times than ck however runoff coefficients for the swc treatments differed the fsps had a higher runoff coefficient 0 80 than gr 0 59 and sm 0 52 at 7 0 m3 h 1 and was close to the values observed in the bare plots 0 86 according to the experimental recorded data rills erosion occurred on bare slopes at 4 7 m3 h 1 and fsp slopes at 6 7 m3 h 1 with the formation of rills surface flow gradually converted into concentrated flow leading to high runoff coefficients runoff amounts differed significantly for the swc plots relative to the bare slope 0 54 3 02 m3 fig 2 the swc practices raised the surface roughness of the hillslope increasing infiltration runoff amount was coupled with the spatial variability of surface conditions which hindered the formation of surface runoff and attenuated the scouring of runoff along the slope runoff rates followed similar trends in all treatments under different scouring rates fig 3 generally three distinct stages in the runoff process were observed stage i was prior to the start of runoff when water infiltrated the soil but no runoff occurred stage ii was a rapid decline in infiltration and runoff started and increased rapidly stage iii was the beginning of a relatively constant runoff rate indicating a constant infiltration rate clear differences occurred in temporal variations in runoff rate between water discharge rates and conservation measures the bare slope ck always had the highest runoff rate in stage iii which initially experienced a sharp increase before gradually rising with scouring duration until reaching a steady state runoff rate ranging from 30 to 100 l min 1 under different scouring rates for the swc treatments runoff rates increased more gradually during the observation period and sm always had the lowest runoff rate 3 2 sediment responses to different swc practices the swc practices produced less sediment than bare land with significant differences in total sediment between treatments p 0 05 in response to different water discharge rates fig 4 the temporal change of sediment rates varied between treatments fig 5 due to abundant loose material in the slope surface ck had extremely high erosion rates during the initial scouring stage fig 5 which subsequently declined with scouring duration rills emerged on ck slopes when the inflow rate reached 4 0 m3 h 1 and evolved into the main erosion type at higher inflow rates 5 0 m3 h 1 for the gr and sm treatments only sheet erosion occurred at the different inflow rates such that the variation in erosion rates with scouring remained stable over time for most treatments the greater the inflow rate the higher the erosion rate especially for fsp slopes fig 5 inflow rates higher than 6 0 m3 h 1 gradually damaged the structure of fsps with runoff scouring as the rills evolved relatively rapidly increasing the erosion rate differences in sediment yield rates between the swc practices decreased with increasing water discharge rates the maximum erosion rates were 6696 g min 1 for fsps 2338 g min 1 for gr and 1921 g min 1 for sm at an inflow rate of 7 0 m3 h 1 the fsps gr and sm treatments had significantly less sediment than ck nonetheless when the inflow rate increased e g 6 0 and 7 0 m3 h 1 the sediment rates of gr fsps and sm gradually approached those of ck the effectiveness of fsps was less pronounced than the other swc treatments with increasing inflow rate as rills appeared and developed into the main erosion type runoff and sediment yield rates increased with increasing inflow rates for all four slope surfaces figs 3 and 5 show that fsps gr and sm had lower runoff and sediment yield rates than ck at the same scouring rate the sm treatment had the lowest total runoff and sediment yield due to its ability to regulate runoff and erosion the fsps dramatically decreased the erosion rate at low inflow rates but performed ineffectively at high inflow rates exceeding ck 3 3 runoff and sediment reduction benefits for different swc practices the rrb ranged from 62 0 to 22 6 for gr 100 7 3 for fsps and 100 39 6 for sm at inflow rates ranging from 2 0 to 7 0 m3 h 1 fig 6 the srb ranged from 89 2 to 76 7 for gr 100 56 3 for fsps and 100 81 2 for sm at inflow discharges ranging from 2 0 to 7 0 m3 h 1 fig 6 all three swc treatments had very high rrbs and srbs at 2 m3 h 1 under fsps and sm no runoff occurred and consequently no soil was lost however the rrbs for the different swc measures decreased noticeably with increasing inflow discharge especially for fsps which decreased to 7 3 at 7 0 m3 h 1 the srbs for the different swc practices also slightly decreased with increasing inflow discharge fig 6 shows that srb was higher than rrb for all treatments overall sm slopes had the highest rrbs and srbs 40 and 80 respectively during the runoff scouring experiment overall mulch had a significant beneficial effect on runoff and sediment reduction and an increase in inflow discharge counteracted the reduction effect of swcs on sediment rate 3 4 runoff hydraulic characteristics and relationships with soil erosion rate surface runoff is the main driver of water erosion but vegetation topography and mulching can alter the erosion dynamics of surface water flow and ultimately influence sediment detachment and transport the mean values of hydraulic parameters were compared among treatments table 2 the sm slope had significantly lower v re and fr and significantly higher f than the bare slope and other swc treatments overall v re and fr increased and f decreased with increasing inflow rate the mean flow velocity for the bare slope increased from 0 12 to 0 24 m s 1 with increasing flow rate a pronounced decrease in flow velocity occurred in the swc plots the bare soil plots had the highest v 0 24 m s 1 at an inflow rate of 7 0 m3 h 1 approximately twice that in the sm treatment the gr fsps and sm plots had flow velocities of 0 16 0 19 and 0 12 m s 1 respectively the swc practices and discharge intensity influenced the range of re and fr table 2 the re ranged from 78 to 407 for the gr slope 168 569 for the fsps slope and 131 322 for the sm slope fr followed a similar variation trend as re except for fsps at an inflow rate of 7 0 m3 h 1 re was less than 500 and fr was less than 1 indicating that all treatments produced a laminar flow pattern and a subcritical flow type bare land had the highest re and fr which significantly differed from the values in the swc plots the decrease in re and fr for the swc practices indicated the predominance of viscous force and gravity of flow weakened disturbance of water flow and stable water flow resulting in weak scouring of surface soil particles and slight soil erosion the darcy weisbach resistance coefficient was lowest for the bare soil ranging from 1 08 to 2 09 the fsps sm and gr plots had stronger flow resistance than the bare slope more so at the lower inflow rate as flow resistance for all treatments decreased with increasing inflow rate under different inflow rates the average resistance coefficient decreased from 16 85 to 2 83 for gr 8 26 2 62 for fsps and 7 04 5 95 for sm the impact of swc practices on the erosion dynamics of flow shear stress τ and stream power ω is shown in table 2 except for gr τ and ω increased with discharge rate ck had lower τ than the swc treatments under different scouring intensities with values ranging from 4 11 to 8 49 higher shear stress τ occurred in gr and fsps than ck increasing by 40 130 and 20 60 respectively sm had lower τ than gr and fsps with values ranging from 6 00 to 10 60 the swc practices increased surface roughness delayed runoff generation decreased flow velocity and increased flow depth and water shear stress especially for gr and fsps plant stems mulch and fish scale pits hindered water flow causing surface ponding inreasing the water level and impacting the flow shear stress results for ω differed from those for τ ck had significantly higher ω than the other treatments except fsps at inflow rates of 6 0 and 7 0 m3 h 1 stream power ranged from 0 49 to 2 04 n m 1 s 1 for ck 0 29 1 65 n m 1 s 1 for gr 0 68 2 44 n m 1 s 1 for fsps and 0 49 1 24 n m 1 s 1 for sm the three swc practices led to different intensities of reduction in stream power under different discharge rates however ω was larger for fsps than ck at an inflow rate of 7 0 m3 h 1 because fsps effectiveness gradually declined with increasing discharge rate the gra was used to estimate the influence of hydraulic parameters on erosion rate over time the gray correlation coefficients between hydraulic properties re fr f τ and ω and soil erosion rate in the ck plots and swc plots at six scouring rates 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 m3 h 1 are in table 3 the relational degrees of the erosion rate and hydrodynamic parameters for ck were ranked flow shear stress 0 858 stream power 0 847 reynolds number 0 836 froude number 0 743 darcy weisbach coefficient 0 566 for the swc measures stream power had greater gray relational degrees with erosion rate than reynolds number and flow shear stress indicating that these hydrodynamic parameters may be the preferred descriptors for the erosional process 4 discussion 4 1 soil and water conservation performance sediment detachment and transport are associated with slope runoff runoff generation is influenced by various factors including rainfall soil moisture and slope microtopography the desired impacts of swc measures are to delay surface runoff generation control soil erosion increase infiltration rate and improve soil fertility fig 7 shows that the swc practices significantly affected the amount of water infiltrating the soil as did the inflow scouring intensity the initial soil moisture from 0 to 20 cm depth did not vary among treatments 11 2 on average after the experiment soil moisture increased from 0 3 to 1 5 for all treatments fig 7 all swc practices increased soil infiltration relative to ck sm plots had significantly higher soil moisture variation at 0 20 cm depth than the other treatments a previous study suggested that straw mulching reduces the formation of soil physical crust by filtering soil particles during rainstorms lin and chen 2015 straw itself forms a runoff collection and absorption layer and additional barriers on the soil surface liao et al 2021 increasing soil water content prosdocimi et al 2017 reported that straw mulch prevented the formation of surface ponds and runoff however infiltration at the end of the experiment differed between fsps and gr when light inflow causing runoff occurred fsps always had more infiltration than gr because fsps can strengthen the roughness of slopes enhancing vertical infiltration of overland flow by intercepting runoff fu et al 2010 when heavy inflow causing runoff occurred the efficiency of the fsps stored soil moisture declined compared to gr because they were gradually destroyed and lost their ability to control runoff grassland restoration can effectively change infiltration pathways by developing root systems and lengthening the runoff path huang et al 2017 concluded that grass roots near the surface soil increase soil infiltration capacity by improving the topsoil s physical and chemical properties such as soil bulk density soil porosity and organic matter fig 8 illustrates the basic statistics for runoff and soil loss by comparing the surface slopes the three swc practices decreased soil and water losses indicating that they are suitable for the fragmented terrain on the loess plateau the sm had the greatest effect on controlling water erosion producing the highest rrb 40 100 and srb 80 100 fig 6 the fsps had higher rrb 40 100 than gr 30 60 but lower srb 50 80 than gr 80 90 under low inflow discharges however each swc practice had its own characteristics and ability to reduce rainfall power and intercept runoff therefore their efficiency for controlling soil water erosion needs further analysis understanding the impact of these conservation practices on soil erosion is important for planning natural resource management and the associated decision making sediment yield significantly declined under gr compared with bare land preventing soil and water losses the effectiveness was relatively stable only slightly changing as inflow increased these results are consistent with jin et al 2021 who demonstrated that vegetation significantly decreased soil erosion and improved soil physical chemical and biological properties alfalfa stems can slow the flow velocity and weaken the erosive force of runoff and its roots can increase the resistance to soil erosion gyssels et al 2005 zimmermann et al 2006 these factors reduced soil erosion on the gr slopes however grasslands had relatively lower rrb than srb fig 6 the runoff reduction rate associated with the planted grass slopes decreased as inflow intensity increased in some cases grasslands had higher surface runoff than bare land likely due to the presence of root systems leung et al 2015 found that roots occupied soil pores during initial growth affecting both saturated hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rate and leading to increased runoff in general grasslands had positive effects on sediment reduction and runoff maintenance ultimately improving the local environment when cultivating plants water resources should be able to maintain the long term natural growth of plants otherwise plants on slopes may die thus failing to achieve a sustainable effect as a typical vegetation type for vegetation restoration grasslands could be considered for soil loss control and water resource conservation in semiarid areas where water is limited bare slopes had more runoff and sediment than fsp slopes indicating that fsps positively affected water and soil conservation during rainwater scouring as zheng et al 2019 reported the fsp technology is often combined with afforestation technology to increase soil moisture and afforestation survival rate thus promoting the grain for green program on the arid and semiarid loess plateau since 1999 the positive effects of fsp practices are closely related to the resistance force on a slope generated from the unique topography that it creates the thin sheet flow on a slope is prone to resistance action due to the extreme shallowness of the surface runoff moreover fsps ensure that runoff does not flow in one direction reducing the runoff concentration runoff erosion capacity and soil erosion guo et al 2019 in our research the fsps performed well in regulating runoff and controlling sediment at low inflow rates with rrb ranging from 45 to 100 and srb ranging from 80 to 100 at inflow rates of 2 0 4 0 m3 h 1 however the fsps gradually lost their effectiveness when subjected to higher discharge scouring under intensive scouring conditions runoff and sediment on slopes exceeded the pits interception capacity such that excess runoff and sediment overflowed due to the limited capacity of fsps they are often destroyed by high inflow events because they become filled with sediment and runoff the rrb and srb decreased to 7 and 50 respectively at an inflow rate of 7 0 m3 h 1 fig 6 we can speculate that there is a threshold for the effect of fsps when filled with sediment and destroyed by runoff the fsp benefits of reduced erosion declined rapidly and the sediment yield exceeded that of ck by twofold sun et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to consider the influencing factors in an area such as local topography and typical rainfall characteristics to reasonably plan and arrange fsps straw mulching is a natural product that enhances long term soil function and has an immediate effect on soil erosion so it is an important option for achieving erosion control goals in a recent study on land management cerda et al 2017 straw mulching immediately reduced erosion and water loss as seen in the present study sm had superior performance in reducing runoff and sediment under almost all inflow rates this finding is in line with sadeghi et al 2015 who showed that applying sm in the alborz mountains of northern iran reduced runoff and sediment yield by 96 71 and 100 respectively under simulated rainfall intensities of 90 mm h 1 the sm treatment also increased the time to ponding and how long the ponded surfaces took to generate overflow table 1 the sm treatment had less soil particle detachment than the other treatments because mulching protected the soil surface from runoff scouring the presence of sm also formed barriers to runoff flow and created more potential ponding surfaces that intercepted runoff and delayed soil surface wetting water interception by straw could help explain the delay in runoff initiation and the decline in total runoff thus curbing water erosion directly or indirectly straw also increases soil organic matter and improves soil physical properties soil moisture and soil temperature mulumba and lal 2008 wang et al 2015 yin et al 2016 straw also positively affected nitrogen management liu et al 2017 and soil microbial biomass wang et al 2020 in addition straw mulch is a local natural agricultural product that could be an efficient solution for achieving sustainable management 4 2 hydraulic characteristics of water erosion on swc slopes this study showed that v re and fr tended to increase and f tended to decrease with increasing discharge flow rate on bare and swc slopes the variation in v with increasing discharges flow rate is similar to ali et al 2012 who showed the strong dependency of mean flow velocity on flow discharge overland flow velocity is the basis for calculating other hydrodynamic parameters according to eq 7 the darcy weisbach coefficient positively correlated with flow depth and negatively correlated with flow velocity in addition flow depth and velocity increased with increasing inflow rate table 2 explaining the decreasing darcy weisbach friction factor with increasing inflow rate table 2 gr fsps and sm significantly increased overland flow resistance reduced water flow velocity and diminished stream power table 2 compared to bare land implying that more energy from runoff was consumed to overcome flow resistance with less energy left for soil detachment and sediment transportation soil surface roughness is generally considered a key factor affecting flow resistance with a potentially positive correlation between these two factors shang et al 2020 surface cover gr and sm and fsps increase surface roughness omidvar et al 2019 guo et al 2021 shang et al 2020 prolonging the flow path improving soil resistance to the shearing force of overland flow and reducing flow erosivity the re and fr numbers decreased on all swc slopes relative to ck except fsps suffering from high inflow scouring as reported by pan and shangguan 2006 liang et al 2014 and omidvar et al 2019 the reduced re and fr can be attributed to the increase in flow depth and simultaneous decrease in flow velocity due to the increase in soil surface roughness however the effect of fsps was gradually lost as the structure became damaged and rills occurred under high inflow scouring causing relatively large re quantifying the hydrodynamic flow properties and sediment detachment rate is critical for understanding water erosion processes and sediment prediction in this study the gra showed that among many hydrodynamic factors runoff power best reflects the soil erosion rate on swc slopes and shear stress simulates the erosion process on bare slopes shear stress expresses the driving force whereas stream power represents the energy available for soil detachment they are most often adopted in hydrodynamic models for predicting soil detachment knapen et al 2007 previous studies pan and shangguan 2006 omidvar et al 2019 reported significant relationships between sediment and hydraulic characteristics in the presence of different covers such as vegetation and rock fragments or bare soil the current study identified these relationships under swc practices overall the results showed that straw mulching improved hydraulic properties more than grass restoration and fish scale pits 4 3 limitations and implications identifying the benefits of soil and water conservation measures can aid in designing more cost effective programs and evaluating programs policies and practices in this research we evaluated the effectiveness of different soil and water conservation measures some questions remain on the ecological and economic benefits and cost assessment of swc practices unlike environmental benefits it is difficult to quantify the effectiveness of swc practices when considering economic costs and ecological benefits grass restoration has gained increasing attention due to its low cost and long term high eco sustainability dong et al 2020 wu et al 2021 vegetation restoration can improve ecological factors such as vegetation productivity soil aggregation microbial community properties and soil physicochemical properties which favor environmental improvements and soil c sequestration in degraded ecosystems he et al 2016 a study on china s loess plateau indicated that restored grassland sequestrates more soil c than restored forest jin et al 2014 fsps had superior rainwater harvesting capacity which improved plant survival feng et al 2018 in addition fsps improve the soil environment including soil organic matter capillary porosity and nitrogen content increasing land productivity zhang et al 2007 however fsp construction must meet the standard distribution rules otherwise the edge is at risk of being destroyed which is accelerated by sedimentation over time periodic maintenance is indispensable for fsps to maintain their function fu et al 2010 consuming more labor and costs than the other two measures straw mulching can improve soil structure and organic matter content karami et al 2012 regulate topsoil temperature awe et al 2015 decrease evaporation li et al 2018 and enhance enzyme activity and crop performance akhtar et al 2018 increasing crop productivity the tradeoff between mulching costs and soil water conservation benefits is an important consideration we used corn straw as the mulching material in this study as it is widely planted in local areas and inexpensive moreover the application of straw mulching does not have a high labor demand sm has preferable potential to improve soil and moisture conditions and prevent soil and water losses on semiarid hillslopes providing economic and ecological benefits to farmlands however identifying the most appropriate mulch type and application rate requires further research the economic feasibility of mulching application is another fundamental aspect that should be addressed 5 conclusions we investigated the efficiency of typical soil and water conservation swc practices on the loess plateau under runoff scouring based on our data swc practices reduce soil and water losses straw mulching had the most prominent effects on controlling water erosion producing the highest runoff and sediment reduction benefits grass revegetation reduced sediment more efficient than runoff gra was used to assess the influence of hydrodynamic parameters on erosion rate revealing that stream power may be the preferred erosion process descriptor for different conservation measures overall this study provides useful information for policymakers and land managers involved in promoting the large scale implementation of suitable swc practices on the loess plateau and other regions with

9814,plant height is the main agronomic character used to measure the vertical growth and developmental abilities of plant cucumber is a popular greenhouse vegetable in northwest china and its production is principally limited by water and temperature however few studies have simulated water and temperature driven cucumber heights in solar greenhouses in this paper we explored these optimum growth functions to simulate cucumber height dynamics under different irrigation upper limits by conducting experiments between 2017 and 2019 in wuzhong ningxia china first we calculated the accumulated temperature during the growth period by measuring growth stage base temperatures we then calculated water impact factor parameters based on the per day plant height growth rate we constructed functions dwstr i of the factors affecting cucumber plant heights at different growth stages then used these functions as multipliers the accumulated temperature was taken as an independent variable in four functions i e the bertalanffy gompertz logistic and mischerlich functions to describe the water and temperature driven cucumber plant height growth dynamics consequently an optimal function was selected among the four simulated functions defined as mo b mo g mo l and mo m impact factor functions were established with 2018 experimental data as y 0 1753e0 0177x y 0 6332e0 0046x and y 0 7241e0 0031x in the stretch tendril period initial flowering period and early harvest period respectively the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0 9604 0 9937 and 0 9191 these data were then used to assess the function associated parameters the models were calibrated with the 2017 and 2019 experimental data and the mo l model obtained the best ia 0 993 and 0 998 in 2017 and 2019 and nrmse 10 27 and 4 97 in 2017 and 2019 values among the four models further the mean ia 0 995 and nrmse 9 20 values of the mo l model were significantly higher than those of the mo b and mo m models between 2017 and 2019 the mo l model could be optimal for simulating the physiological cucumber height growth insolar greenhouses and the model calibration showed good agreement between the simulated and measured results keywords cucumber water accumulated temperature logistic model 1 introduction plant height as an principal agronomic character is the length of the caudex of cucumbers cucumis sativus l and is closely related to the yield and morphological structure of cucumbers and other crops jiang et al 2020a miao et al 2012 plant height is one of the most important factors for affecting the extinction coefficient of the plant model because of affecting directly the ability of the plant light interception cheng et al 2020 in addition simulation of plant height is important for modelling systems for visual plant organs li et al 2011 plant height is an important parameter for the model an artificial neural network of tomato aerial dry matter and yield in the greenhouse lópez aguilar et al 2020 simulation models of plant growth are tools for integrating various aspects of knowledge about plant growth which can be tested hypotheses about how different parts of the system interact and can be developed understanding about the system as a whole and plant response to weather conditions acock and reynolds 1989 deihimfard et al 2019 however plant height simulation models have rarely been developed and applied over the past few decades some of the most popular models such as penman monteith pm model montero et al 2001 rouphael and colla 2004 ignored plant height dynamic simulations since they uniformly regard plant height as 2 m when simulating the leaf area index and light interception yan et al 2019 recently researchers have gradually recognised the importance of plant height in models of growth and development simulation and they have put forward some simple methods for simulating the crop height steven et al 1996 believed that the plant height was correlated with the daily total solar radiation and temperature accumulation in a quadratic parabola of violets based on the principle of accumulated temperature li et al 2006a presented the linear correlation between plant height and effective accumulated temperature of muskmelon seedlings they established the plant height growth model driven by effective accumulated temperature and water as the main factors of muskmelon seedlings xie et al 2007 research found that there was an exponential relationship between plant height and effective accumulated temperature during the whole growth period of cucumber another method is to use the growth function to simulate the dynamic change of plant height lei et al 2020 in these simulation models of plant height liu et al 2016 study used engraftment of days and the growth rate to drive plant height elongation jiang et al 2020a also considered temperature and soil water stress as driving variable of winter wheat however temperature and soil moisture were insufficiently considered in the simulation of plant height of horticultural crops in a general way growth function is used for expressing an analytical formula that connects morphological development or dry weight of a plant to time at present domestic and international common growth functions mainly include bertalanffy von bertalanffy 1957 mischerlich mitscherlich 1928 logistic verhulst 1838 and gompertz gompertz 1815 most of these growth functions were utilised in medicine biology epidemiology economic development of research in recent years some studies have applied them to simulate the development of landscape plants forests fruit trees and other economic forests ge et al 2020 shoda et al 2020 yu et al 2017 and some to simulate the ontogeny of field crops ge et al 2020 moreover growth functions to simulation can vary in different environments and varieties water and temperature are the major limiting factors to crop production studies have found that the treatment with irrigation lower limit of 80 of field capacity is significantly higher than other treatments 50 60 70 of cucumber height lv et al 2020 adequate water supplementation at critical stages of plant growth may not only promote the cellular metabolism of plants but also improve the availability of the mineral nutrients çakir and çebi 2009 yaghi et al 2013 so any degree of water stress can cause harmful impacts on the plant development and yield çebi et al 2018 in recent years the studies have shown that it is more representative and accurate to use effective accumulated temperature instead of time factor for simulating plant growth and development shabani et al 2014 yu et al 2002 in particular simulation crop yield dry matter and leaf area lecoeur and guilioni 1998 mahbod et al 2014 wart et al 2013 it is of great significance to research the impact of effective accumulated temperature on plant growth process to improve agricultural production efficiency cucumber is widely cultivated and is one of the most popular greenhouse vegetables in northwest china which is particularly sensitive to water and temperature therefore establishing the model of cucumber plant height driven by soil water and accumulated temperature are of great importance in this paper based on accumulated temperature simulation of cucumber plant height under different irrigation upper limit treatments was investigated in solar greenhouse thus the main objectives of the study were to 1 establish functions dwstr i at different growth stages which were for water impact factor parameters and upper limit of irrigation of cucumber plant height in the solar greenhouse 2 construct and evaluate new different functions of cucumber plant height

fruit with thin dark green skins zhang et al 2013 the planting dates were march 15th 28th and 21st in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the cucumber plants were transplanted into the greenhouse when the seedlings had a physiological age of three leaves the traditional south north soil planting model was applied with double row planting along a flat ridge and a plant spacing of 20 cm ridge width of 80 cm and row spacing of 60 cm the harvest dates were july 27th august 26th and august 15th in 2017 2018 and 2019 the same amount of fertilizer was applied to each treatment with a base fertilizer application of 70 000 kg ha farm manure and the fields were plowed to 20 cm 30 cm by a gyrotiller drip irrigation was conducted with a 20 cm emitter spacing 2 l h emitter flow rate 0 2 mpa working

displayed on zigwsn precision agriculture management platform of beijing zigvine tech co ltd china it was called soil moisture monitor system for short in the following the traditional oven dry method zhu et al 2021 was used for calibrating the soil moisture content monitored two months after the installation of the soil moisture monitor system the soil moisture was measured by oven dry method using a drill diameter of 2 5 cm soil moisture monitor system was calibrated by thirty seven times of measured results via oven dry method the calibrated linear relationships between soil volumetric

measured the soil moisture content at field capacity and saturation weather data in the solar greenhouse meteorological data were automatically observed by the wisteria precision agriculture management platform which was developed by the beijing wisteria company in china meteorological data mainly include daily maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity carbon dioxide content and solar radiation effective accumulated temperature tu is calculated by the following formula 1 li et al 2006a 1 tu i 1 n t i t b where t i is the average of hourly temperature sum on the day i day tb is the base temperature of growth day the value of tb are 13 14 16 and 16 on the corresponding st if eh and u growth stages respectively cheng et al 2019 2 2 establishment simulation models of cucumber plant height in solar greenhouse 2 2 1 growth functions the studies show that the whole growth period of crops can be simulated by using the nonlinear growth curve function such as bertalanffy function eq 2 logistic eq 3 gompertz eq 4 and mischerlich eq 5 2 h b a b 1 b b exp c b tu 3 3 h l a l 1 b l exp c l tu 4 h g a g e b g exp c g tu 5 h m a m 1 b m exp c m tu where hb hl hg

the four growth functions cm bb bl bg and bm are the initial growth parameters dimensionless cb cl cg and cm are the growth rate parameters dimensionless 2 2 2 modified growth functions for plant height of cucumber in solar greenhouse effective accumulated temperature and water are the main factors to affect crop growth based on the assumption that temperature and soil moisture content directly affect the final value of plant height the four growth functions i e bertalanffy logistic gompertz and mischerlich which were multiplied by the influencing parameter function dwstr i eq 10 of water on plant height were used to optimise the influences of moisture eqs 6 9 these growth functions of cucumber plant height under the influence of moisture were defined as mo b mo l mo g and mo m respectively additionally it was assumed that the cucumber plant height was maximizing at the uprooting plant stage in the research 6 h b a b 1 b b exp c b tu 3 dwstr 7 h l a l 1 b l exp c l tu dwstr

rate per unit growth day under unstressed water and nutrition conditions cm d 2 2 3 estimation of cucumber plant height model parameters the model parameters were estimating using the experimental data collected in 2018 the parameters of the four optimized functions were estimated by comparing the observed plant heights with the simulated plant heights which were estimated based on the least square method table 3 in this study an observed plant height of 7 90 cm was regarded as the estimated initial parameter value at the transplanting time the maximum cucumber plant height was taken as the estimated value of parameter a the other parameters were calculated by the least square method then a set of parameter values was received for all models these sets could exactly meet the simulation accuracy requirements table 3 finally the differences between the observed and simulated cucumber plant height values were compared 2 3 model evaluation cucumber plant height model evaluation was conducted using 2017 and 2019 experimental data the accuracy of the models for plant height simulation of cucumber was evaluated by the statistic of root mean square error rmse eq 11 normalised rmse nrmse eq 12 and index of agreement ia eq 13 willmott 1982 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n x obs x sim 2 12 nrmse 100 rmse x obs 13 ia 1 i 1 n x obs x sim 2 i 1 n x obs x obs x sim x obs 2 where xsim is the simulated value xobs is the observed value n is the number of values and x obs is the average of observed value the rmse shows the difference in the mean of observation and simulation while nrmse represents the difference in the relative size of the mean as an unbounded percentage willmott 1982 and nrmse 15 15 nrmse 30 and 30 represent good agreement moderate agreement and poor agreement respectively liang et al 2018 the index of agreement 0 ia 1 aimed to be a descriptive measure and a relative and bounded measure willmott 1982 the closer the ia value is to 1 the better the model performance will be liang et al 2018 3 results 3 1 establishment of functions for the water parameter and upper limit irrigation impact factors according to a regression analysis of the experimental data plant height and effective accumulated temperature functions were established for different growth stages fig 2 table 2 the results showed that the per day growth rate values lri measured under treatments w1 w2 w3 and w4 were 0 1078 0 137 0 1653 and 0 1831 in the stretch tendril period respectively in the initial flowering period the lri values measured under treatments w1 w2 w3 and w4 were 0 21 0 2214 0 2292 and 0 2416 respectively in the early harvest period and uprooting period the lri values measured under treatments w1 w2 w3 and w4 were 0 4544 0 4599 0 4712 and 0 5019 respectively throughout the whole cucumber growth period the optimal water management index was the upper limit of irrigation at 100 of the field water capacity therefore the lri value obtained under the w1 treatment was called lro and was 0 1831 0 2416 and 0 5019 in each growth period according to eq 10 function formulas fig 3 of the water parameter and upper limit irrigation influencing factors were established in each growth period therefore the functional formulas in the stretch tendril period initial flowering period and early harvest period were y 0 1753e0 0177x y 0 6332e0 0046x and y 0 7241e0 0031x respectively the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0 9604 0 9937 and 0 9191 respectively the f test results showed that the test levels of the three function formulas were 0 0017 0 00002 and 0 0001 all of which passed the f test with reliability above 0 01 3 2 simulation and parameter analysis of the cucumber height growth dynamics in the solar greenhouse in 2018 the parameters a b and c were calculated for each equation as shown in table 3 in the mo b mo l mo g and mo m models parameters a b and c all increased with an increasing irrigation water upper limit the cucumber plant height values simulated by the mo m and mo b models were negative during the stretch tendril period with effective accumulative temperature 200 and 50 respectively which was inconsistent with the actual cucumber plant height growth conditions fig 4 these negative values gradually decreased as the upper limit of irrigation decreased in fact when the effective accumulated temperature reached 40 37 the actual plant height values measured under the w1 w2 w3 and w4 treatments were already 11 67 cm 13 52 cm 13 27 cm and 11 4 cm respectively when the effective accumulated temperature reached 164 49 the actual plant height values measured under the w1 w2 w3 and w4 treatments were 37 26 cm 35 18 cm 32 12 cm and 26 26 cm respectively in addition the cucumber plant heights output by the mo m model showed only one inflexion point indicating rapid linear growth before the accumulated temperature of 400 was reached the simulations of the mo b model revealed two inflexion points indicating rapid linear growth before the accumulated temperature of 100 before the first inflexion point however slow seedling root uptake occurred in the transplant seedings stage rapid plant height grew was impossible in the models when the effective accumulated temperature were greater than approximately 800 in the uprooting period the values simulated by the mo m and mo b models agreed with the actual values during the whole growth period s type growth trends were simulated by the mo l and mo g models these trends were exactly in line with the slow fast slow trend of the actual dynamic observations based on the normalized root mean square error nrmse values obtained for the calibration dataset in 2018 fig 5a the results indicated that the general average nrmse of the four new growth functions i e the mo b mo g mo m mo l models were 19 8597 14 1184 73 5647 and 12 516 cm respectively fig 5a and the general average information assurance values ias were 0 9888 0 9944 0 8906 and 0 9945 fig 5b respectively in particular the nrmse of model mo m reached 73 5647 indicating that the mo m model cannot be used to simulate cucumber plant heights both statistical indexes showed that the simulation accuracy of the mo l model was the highest among the four functions both showed nrmse values 15 3 3 calibration and validation of cucumber plant height model according to the experimental data obtained in 2017 and 2019 the newly established growth functions for simulating cucumber plant heights in the studied solar greenhouse were evaluated generally both the mo b and mo m models had larger simulation errors in the stretch tendril period compared to the other models fig 6 which agreed with the results of the model calibration and validation using data collected in 2018 in particular the cucumber plant heights simulated by the mo m model were very large negative numbers in the stretch tendril period which seriously misaligned with reality fig 6 however the plant heights output by the mo g and mo l models were more comsistent with the actual observations moreover the nrmse and ia values of the mo l model were the smallest compared to those of the other models indicating that the simulations of the mo l model were the most consisitent with the cucumber plant height growth dynamics the averaged nrmse values of four growth functions i e mo b mo g mo m and mo l were 26 18 12 61 104 79 and 10 27 cm in 2017 table 4 respectively and the average ia values of the four growth functions were 0 96 0 99 0 73 and 0 99 in 2017 table 4 respectively the mo g and mo l models had higher accuracies in the 2019 verification results than in the 2017 model verification results with averaged nrmse values of 8 37 and 4 97 cm and averaged ia values of 0 995 and 0 998 table 4 respectively however the mo b and mo m models had lower accuracies in the 2019 verification results with average nrmse values of 51 77 and 120 14 cm and average ia values of 0 88 and 0 66 table 4 respectively generally according to both the calibration and validation results obtained with the experimental data the mo g and mo l models could be used to accurately describe the response of cucumber plant height growth to changes in the accumulated temperature and moisture conditions at different growth stages in studied the solar greenhouse among the models designed to simulate cucumber plant heights between 2017 and 2019 the mo l model obtained the lowest error average nrmse of 9 20 and average ia of 0 995 in the cucumber plant height simulations this nrmse value was extremely significantly different from those of the mo b and mo m model outputs and this ia value was extremely significantly different from that of the mo m model outputs fig 7 4 discussions plant height as an agronomic character of the crop which is the importance in measuring plant vertical growth and development ability different water management in the greenhouse had significant effects on the height growth development of plants and the changes of plant morphogenesis çakir 2004 the plant height of cucumber is longer for the fully irrigated than plants suffering water stress treatments zhang et al 2002a 2002b zou et al 2005 therefore it is significant to explore the effects of soil water on the cucumber plant height growth in the research the function formula of water influence factor parameters and upper irrigation limit for each growth period were obtained which were taken as a coefficient and multiplied by the four common growth functions so as to obtain the plant height growth dynamics under the influence of water cucumber is very sensitive to changes in moisture during its growth stages çakir et al 2017 gong et al 2015 this research found that maintaining a soil water content below 70 of the field water capacity significantly reduces the plant heights and the restricts the nutritional growth of the plants zhang et al 2002a 2002b zou et al 2005 suggested that a linear relationship exists between the upper limit of irrigation and the plant heights of spring cucumber in this study as the upper limit of irrigation increased the plant height also increased gradually w1 w2 w3 w4 and the maximum plant heights were measured at the 100 upper limit of irrigation this result was consistent with the views of li qingming li et al 2005 and liao kai liao and fan 2011 additionally in this study based on calculating the growth rate per unit day the relationships between the water parameter influencing factors and the upper limit of irrigation in different growth periods were established as exponential functions fig 3 li et al 2006a and li et al 2006b also suggested that as the upper limit of irrigation increased the water parameter influencing factor increased exponentially moreover considering the influence of the daily accumulated temperature we learned from the dwstr i formula driven by warter and muskmelon irrigation in li jianming s research li et al 2006a and described the relationship between the water factor and upper limit of irrigation as they affect the cucumber plant height using dwstr i functions these functions differed from f w functions jiang et al 2020b in which only water stress was considered to affect the plant height of winter wheat reaumur proposed the accumulated temperature theory by exploring the effects of air temperatures on plant growth in 1730 mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 in recent years the accumulated temperature has served as a guiding factor and has been important in crop phenology modelling agrometeorological forecasting studies on crop developmental rates growth calculations and yield forecasting li et al 2020 this theory has been used in the decision support system for agronotechnology transfer dssat model jones et al 2003 agricultural production systems simulator apsim model keating et al 2003 world food studies wofost model wit and diepen 2007 and crop environmental resource synthesis ceres maize model liu et al 2012 taking the effective accumulated temperature as an independent variable to simulate plant development previous studies have shown that the logistic model is more suitable for simulating the vegetative growth of plants than the gompertz and richards models cai et al 2020 su et al 2020 wang et al 2020 in this study four new models were used to simulate the dynamic changes in plant height driven by the effective accumulated temperature and water conditions according to the nrmse and ia values obtained for the four new growth functions using the calibration dataset fig 5 and table 4 the average nrmse value of the mo m model was as high as 99 50 while the average ia was only 0 76 these two indicators suggest that the mo m model cannot be used to simulate the growth dynamics of cucumber plant heights specifically because the simulated plant height values were negative at the stretch tendril period which is not in line with the actual growth dynamics of cucumber plant heights thus the nrmse values of the mo m model were very high although the ia of the mo b model was as high as 0 943 the average nrmse was 32 6 30 represent poor agreement and the simulated plant height values were negative during the stretch tendril period indicating that the mo b model failed to simulate the heights of cucumber plants these two indexes showed that the mo g and mo l models had good simulation accuracies and could be used to simulate the dynamics of cucumber plant heights during the whole growth period for these models the nrmses were 11 7 and 9 2 15 represent good agreement and the ia were 0 993 and 0 995 respectively the mo l model was found to obtain the lowest error when simulating cucumber plant heights its nrmse was extremely significantly different from those of the mo b and mo m models and its ia was extremely significantly different from that of the mo m models fig 7 thus compared with the other three growth functions the mo l model yielded optimal nrmse and ia values when simulating cucumber plant heights the variation trend of cucumber plant heights was s shaped and increased with the growth process the plant heights increased rapidly in the early stage but slowly in the late stage zhou et al 2012 jiang et al 2020b also suggested that the mo l model received the optima of rmse and ia values when simulating the heights of winter wheat plants 5 conclusions in the study we took the accumulated temperature as the independent variable and the influencing factor parameters associated with and the upper irrigation limit function dwstr i at each growth stage as the coefficients to obtain four growth functions gompertz mischerlich bertalanffy and logistic functions consequently four new growth functions were constructed to describe the impacts of moisture and accumulated temperature on cucumber plant heights in a solar greenhouse then based on experimental data collected between 2017 and 2019 the simulations of these four new different models were calibrated and evaluated the following major conclusions can be drawn from the results 1 with an increase in the upper limit of irrigation the water impact factor parameters changed exponentially and the exponential function differed among different growth stages the functional formula obtained for the stretch tendril period initial flowering period and early harvest period were y 0 1753e0 0177x y 0 6332e0 0046x and y 0 7241e0 0031x respectively and the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0 9604 0 9937 and 0 9191 respectively 2 among the four newly established growth functions i e the mo g mo m mo b and mo l models the mo l model was the most accurate in simulating the growth changes in cucumber plant heights driven by the soil water and accumulated temperature conditions showing the lowest variations in accuracy between 2017 and 2019 furthermore the simulations output by the mo l model were the most consistent with the actual development of cucumber plant heights in the studied solar greenhouse both the nrmse and ia indicators showed good agreement declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

9814,plant height is the main agronomic character used to measure the vertical growth and developmental abilities of plant cucumber is a popular greenhouse vegetable in northwest china and its production is principally limited by water and temperature however few studies have simulated water and temperature driven cucumber heights in solar greenhouses in this paper we explored these optimum growth functions to simulate cucumber height dynamics under different irrigation upper limits by conducting experiments between 2017 and 2019 in wuzhong ningxia china first we calculated the accumulated temperature during the growth period by measuring growth stage base temperatures we then calculated water impact factor parameters based on the per day plant height growth rate we constructed functions dwstr i of the factors affecting cucumber plant heights at different growth stages then used these functions as multipliers the accumulated temperature was taken as an independent variable in four functions i e the bertalanffy gompertz logistic and mischerlich functions to describe the water and temperature driven cucumber plant height growth dynamics consequently an optimal function was selected among the four simulated functions defined as mo b mo g mo l and mo m impact factor functions were established with 2018 experimental data as y 0 1753e0 0177x y 0 6332e0 0046x and y 0 7241e0 0031x in the stretch tendril period initial flowering period and early harvest period respectively the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0 9604 0 9937 and 0 9191 these data were then used to assess the function associated parameters the models were calibrated with the 2017 and 2019 experimental data and the mo l model obtained the best ia 0 993 and 0 998 in 2017 and 2019 and nrmse 10 27 and 4 97 in 2017 and 2019 values among the four models further the mean ia 0 995 and nrmse 9 20 values of the mo l model were significantly higher than those of the mo b and mo m models between 2017 and 2019 the mo l model could be optimal for simulating the physiological cucumber height growth insolar greenhouses and the model calibration showed good agreement between the simulated and measured results keywords cucumber water accumulated temperature logistic model 1 introduction plant height as an principal agronomic character is the length of the caudex of cucumbers cucumis sativus l and is closely related to the yield and morphological structure of cucumbers and other crops jiang et al 2020a miao et al 2012 plant height is one of the most important factors for affecting the extinction coefficient of the plant model because of affecting directly the ability of the plant light interception cheng et al 2020 in addition simulation of plant height is important for modelling systems for visual plant organs li et al 2011 plant height is an important parameter for the model an artificial neural network of tomato aerial dry matter and yield in the greenhouse lópez aguilar et al 2020 simulation models of plant growth are tools for integrating various aspects of knowledge about plant growth which can be tested hypotheses about how different parts of the system interact and can be developed understanding about the system as a whole and plant response to weather conditions acock and reynolds 1989 deihimfard et al 2019 however plant height simulation models have rarely been developed and applied over the past few decades some of the most popular models such as penman monteith pm model montero et al 2001 rouphael and colla 2004 ignored plant height dynamic simulations since they uniformly regard plant height as 2 m when simulating the leaf area index and light interception yan et al 2019 recently researchers have gradually recognised the importance of plant height in models of growth and development simulation and they have put forward some simple methods for simulating the crop height steven et al 1996 believed that the plant height was correlated with the daily total solar radiation and temperature accumulation in a quadratic parabola of violets based on the principle of accumulated temperature li et al 2006a presented the linear correlation between plant height and effective accumulated temperature of muskmelon seedlings they established the plant height growth model driven by effective accumulated temperature and water as the main factors of muskmelon seedlings xie et al 2007 research found that there was an exponential relationship between plant height and effective accumulated temperature during the whole growth period of cucumber another method is to use the growth function to simulate the dynamic change of plant height lei et al 2020 in these simulation models of plant height liu et al 2016 study used engraftment of days and the growth rate to drive plant height elongation jiang et al 2020a also considered temperature and soil water stress as driving variable of winter wheat however temperature and soil moisture were insufficiently considered in the simulation of plant height of horticultural crops in a general way growth function is used for expressing an analytical formula that connects morphological development or dry weight of a plant to time at present domestic and international common growth functions mainly include bertalanffy von bertalanffy 1957 mischerlich mitscherlich 1928 logistic verhulst 1838 and gompertz gompertz 1815 most of these growth functions were utilised in medicine biology epidemiology economic development of research in recent years some studies have applied them to simulate the development of landscape plants forests fruit trees and other economic forests ge et al 2020 shoda et al 2020 yu et al 2017 and some to simulate the ontogeny of field crops ge et al 2020 moreover growth functions to simulation can vary in different environments and varieties water and temperature are the major limiting factors to crop production studies have found that the treatment with irrigation lower limit of 80 of field capacity is significantly higher than other treatments 50 60 70 of cucumber height lv et al 2020 adequate water supplementation at critical stages of plant growth may not only promote the cellular metabolism of plants but also improve the availability of the mineral nutrients çakir and çebi 2009 yaghi et al 2013 so any degree of water stress can cause harmful impacts on the plant development and yield çebi et al 2018 in recent years the studies have shown that it is more representative and accurate to use effective accumulated temperature instead of time factor for simulating plant growth and development shabani et al 2014 yu et al 2002 in particular simulation crop yield dry matter and leaf area lecoeur and guilioni 1998 mahbod et al 2014 wart et al 2013 it is of great significance to research the impact of effective accumulated temperature on plant growth process to improve agricultural production efficiency cucumber is widely cultivated and is one of the most popular greenhouse vegetables in northwest china which is particularly sensitive to water and temperature therefore establishing the model of cucumber plant height driven by soil water and accumulated temperature are of great importance in this paper based on accumulated temperature simulation of cucumber plant height under different irrigation upper limit treatments was investigated in solar greenhouse thus the main objectives of the study were to 1 establish functions dwstr i at different growth stages

measured the soil moisture content at field capacity and saturation weather data in the solar greenhouse meteorological data were automatically observed by the wisteria precision agriculture management platform which was developed by the beijing wisteria company in china meteorological data mainly include daily maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity carbon dioxide content and solar radiation effective accumulated temperature tu is calculated by the following formula 1 li et al 2006a 1 tu i 1 n t i t b where t i is the average of hourly temperature sum on the day i day tb is the base temperature of growth day the value of tb are 13 14 16 and 16 on the corresponding st if eh and u growth stages respectively cheng et al 2019 2 2 establishment simulation models of cucumber plant height in solar greenhouse 2 2 1 growth functions the studies show that the whole growth period of crops can be simulated by using the nonlinear growth curve function such as bertalanffy function eq 2 logistic eq 3 gompertz eq 4 and mischerlich eq 5 2 h b a b 1 b b exp c b tu 3 3 h l a l 1 b l exp c l tu 4 h g a g e b g exp c g tu 5 h m a m 1 b m exp c m tu where hb hl hg

the four growth functions cm bb bl bg and bm are the initial growth parameters dimensionless cb cl cg and cm are the growth rate parameters dimensionless 2 2 2 modified growth functions for plant height of cucumber in solar greenhouse effective accumulated temperature and water are the main factors to affect crop growth based on the assumption that temperature and soil moisture content directly affect the final value of plant height the four growth functions i e bertalanffy logistic gompertz and mischerlich which were multiplied by the influencing parameter function dwstr i eq 10 of water on plant height were used to optimise the influences of moisture eqs 6 9 these growth functions of cucumber plant height under the influence of moisture were defined as mo b mo l mo g and mo m respectively additionally it was assumed that the cucumber plant height was maximizing at the uprooting plant stage in the research 6 h b a b 1 b b exp c b tu 3 dwstr 7 h l a l 1 b l exp c l tu dwstr

rate per unit growth day under unstressed water and nutrition conditions cm d 2 2 3 estimation of cucumber plant height model parameters the model parameters were estimating using the experimental data collected in 2018 the parameters of the four optimized functions were estimated by comparing the observed plant heights with the simulated plant heights which were estimated based on the least square method table 3 in this study an observed plant height of 7 90 cm was regarded as the estimated initial parameter value at the transplanting time the maximum cucumber plant height was taken as the estimated value of parameter a the other parameters were calculated by the least square method then a set of parameter values was received for all models these sets could exactly meet the simulation accuracy requirements table 3 finally the differences between the observed and simulated cucumber plant height values were compared 2 3 model evaluation cucumber plant height model evaluation was conducted using 2017 and 2019 experimental data the accuracy of the models for plant height simulation of cucumber was evaluated by the statistic of root mean square error rmse eq 11 normalised rmse nrmse eq 12 and index of agreement ia eq 13 willmott 1982 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n x obs x sim 2 12 nrmse 100 rmse x obs 13 ia 1 i 1 n x obs x sim 2 i 1 n x obs x obs x sim x obs 2 where xsim is the simulated value xobs is the observed value n is the number of values and x obs is the average of observed value the rmse shows the difference in the mean of observation and simulation while nrmse represents the difference in the relative size of the mean as an unbounded percentage willmott 1982 and nrmse 15 15 nrmse 30 and 30 represent good agreement moderate agreement and poor agreement respectively liang et al 2018 the index of agreement 0 ia 1 aimed to be a descriptive measure and a relative and bounded measure willmott 1982 the closer the ia value is to 1 the better the model performance will be liang et al 2018 3 results 3 1 establishment of functions for the water parameter and upper limit irrigation impact factors according to a regression analysis of the experimental data plant height and effective accumulated temperature functions were established for different growth stages fig 2 table 2 the results showed that the per day growth rate values lri measured under treatments w1 w2 w3 and w4 were 0 1078 0 137 0 1653 and 0 1831 in the stretch tendril period respectively in the initial flowering period the lri values measured under treatments w1 w2 w3 and w4 were 0 21 0 2214 0 2292 and 0 2416 respectively in the early harvest period and uprooting period the lri values measured under treatments w1 w2 w3 and w4 were 0 4544 0 4599 0 4712 and 0 5019 respectively throughout the whole cucumber growth period the optimal water management index was the upper limit of irrigation at 100 of the field water capacity therefore the lri value obtained under the w1 treatment was called lro and was 0 1831 0 2416 and 0 5019 in each growth period according to eq 10 function formulas fig 3 of the water parameter and upper limit irrigation influencing factors were established in each growth period therefore the functional formulas in the stretch tendril period initial flowering period and early harvest period were y 0 1753e0 0177x y 0 6332e0 0046x and y 0 7241e0 0031x respectively the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0 9604 0 9937 and 0 9191 respectively the f test results showed that the test levels of the three function formulas were 0 0017 0 00002 and 0 0001 all of which passed the f test with reliability above 0 01 3 2 simulation and parameter analysis of the cucumber height growth dynamics in the solar greenhouse in 2018 the parameters a b and c were calculated for each equation as shown in table 3 in the mo b mo l mo g and mo m models parameters a b and c all increased with an increasing irrigation water upper limit the cucumber plant height values simulated by the mo m and mo b models were negative during the stretch tendril period with effective accumulative temperature 200 and 50 respectively which was inconsistent with the actual cucumber plant height growth conditions fig 4 these negative values gradually decreased as the upper limit of irrigation decreased in fact when the effective accumulated temperature reached 40 37 the actual plant height values measured under the w1 w2 w3 and w4 treatments were already 11 67 cm 13 52 cm 13 27 cm and 11 4 cm respectively when the effective accumulated temperature reached 164 49 the actual plant height values measured under the w1 w2 w3 and w4 treatments were 37 26 cm 35 18 cm 32 12 cm and 26 26 cm respectively in addition the cucumber plant heights output by the mo m model showed only one inflexion point indicating rapid linear growth before the accumulated temperature of 400 was reached the simulations of the mo b model revealed two inflexion points indicating rapid linear growth before the accumulated temperature of 100 before the first inflexion point however slow seedling root uptake occurred in the transplant seedings stage rapid plant height grew was impossible in the models when the effective accumulated temperature were greater than approximately 800 in the uprooting period the values simulated by the mo m and mo b models agreed with the actual values during the whole growth period s type growth trends were simulated by the mo l and mo g models these trends were exactly in line with the slow fast slow trend of the actual dynamic observations based on the normalized root mean square error nrmse values obtained for the calibration dataset in 2018 fig 5a the results indicated that the general average nrmse of the four new growth functions i e the mo b mo g mo m mo l models were 19 8597 14 1184 73 5647 and 12 516 cm respectively fig 5a and the general average information assurance values ias were 0 9888 0 9944 0 8906 and 0 9945 fig 5b respectively in particular the nrmse of model mo m reached 73 5647 indicating that the mo m model cannot be used to simulate cucumber plant heights both statistical indexes showed that the simulation accuracy of the mo l model was the highest among the four functions both showed nrmse values 15 3 3 calibration and validation of cucumber plant height model according to the experimental data obtained in 2017 and 2019 the newly established growth functions for simulating cucumber plant heights in the studied solar greenhouse were evaluated generally both the mo b and mo m models had larger simulation errors in the stretch tendril period compared to the other models fig 6 which agreed with the results of the model calibration and validation using data collected in 2018 in particular the cucumber plant heights simulated by the mo m model were very large negative numbers in the stretch tendril period which seriously misaligned with reality fig 6 however the plant heights output by the mo g and mo l models were more comsistent with the actual observations moreover the nrmse and ia values of the mo l model were the smallest compared to those of the other models indicating that the simulations of the mo l model were the most consisitent with the cucumber plant height growth dynamics the averaged nrmse values of four growth functions i e mo b mo g mo m and mo l were 26 18 12 61 104 79 and 10 27 cm in 2017 table 4 respectively and the average ia values of the four growth functions were 0 96 0 99 0 73 and 0 99 in 2017 table 4 respectively the mo g and mo l models had higher accuracies in the 2019 verification results than in the 2017 model verification results with averaged nrmse values of 8 37 and 4 97 cm and averaged ia values of 0 995 and 0 998 table 4 respectively however the mo b and mo m models had lower accuracies in the 2019 verification results with average nrmse values of 51 77 and 120 14 cm and average ia values of 0 88 and 0 66 table 4 respectively generally according to both the calibration and validation results obtained with the experimental data the mo g and mo l models could be used to accurately describe the response of cucumber plant height growth to changes in the accumulated temperature and moisture conditions at different growth stages in studied the solar greenhouse among the models designed to simulate cucumber plant heights between 2017 and 2019 the mo l model obtained the lowest error average nrmse of 9 20 and average ia of 0 995 in the cucumber plant height simulations this nrmse value was extremely significantly different from those of the mo b and mo m model outputs and this ia value was extremely significantly different from that of the mo m model outputs fig 7 4 discussions plant height as an agronomic character of the crop which is the importance in measuring plant vertical growth and development ability different water management in the greenhouse had significant effects on the height growth development of plants and the changes of plant morphogenesis çakir 2004 the plant height of cucumber is longer for the fully irrigated than plants suffering water stress treatments zhang et al 2002a 2002b zou et al 2005 therefore it is significant to explore the effects of soil water on the cucumber plant height growth in the research the function formula of water influence factor parameters and upper irrigation limit for each growth period were obtained which were taken as a coefficient and multiplied by the four common growth functions so as to obtain the plant height growth dynamics under the influence of water cucumber is very sensitive to changes in moisture during its growth stages çakir et al 2017 gong et al 2015 this research found that maintaining a soil water content below 70 of the field water capacity significantly reduces the plant heights and the restricts the nutritional growth of the plants zhang et al 2002a 2002b zou et al 2005 suggested that a linear relationship exists between the upper limit of irrigation and the plant heights of spring cucumber in this study as the upper limit of irrigation increased the plant height also increased gradually w1 w2 w3 w4 and the maximum plant heights were measured at the 100 upper limit of irrigation this result was consistent with the views of li qingming li et al 2005 and liao kai liao and fan 2011 additionally in this study based on calculating the growth rate per unit day the relationships between the water parameter influencing factors and the upper limit of irrigation in different growth periods were established as exponential functions fig 3 li et al 2006a and li et al 2006b also suggested that as the upper limit of irrigation increased the water parameter influencing factor increased exponentially moreover considering the influence of the daily accumulated temperature we learned from the dwstr i formula driven by warter and muskmelon irrigation in li jianming s research li et al 2006a and described the relationship between the water factor and upper limit of irrigation as they affect the cucumber plant height using dwstr i functions these functions differed from f w functions jiang et al 2020b in which only water stress was considered to affect the plant height of winter wheat reaumur proposed the accumulated temperature theory by exploring the effects of air temperatures on plant growth in 1730 mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 in recent years the accumulated temperature has served as a guiding factor and has been important in crop phenology modelling agrometeorological forecasting studies on crop developmental rates growth calculations and yield forecasting li et al 2020 this theory has been used in the decision support system for agronotechnology transfer dssat model jones et al 2003 agricultural production systems simulator apsim model keating et al 2003 world food studies wofost model wit and diepen 2007 and crop environmental resource synthesis ceres maize model liu et al 2012 taking the effective accumulated temperature as an independent variable to simulate plant development previous studies have shown that the logistic model is more suitable for simulating the vegetative growth of plants than the gompertz and richards models cai et al 2020 su et al 2020 wang et al 2020 in this study four new models were used to simulate the dynamic changes in plant height driven by the effective accumulated temperature and water conditions according to the nrmse and ia values obtained for the four new growth functions using the calibration dataset fig 5 and table 4 the average nrmse value of the mo m model was as high as 99 50 while the average ia was only 0 76 these two indicators suggest that the mo m model cannot be used to simulate the growth dynamics of cucumber plant heights specifically because the simulated plant height values were negative at the stretch tendril period which is not in line with the actual growth dynamics of cucumber plant heights thus the nrmse values of the mo m model were very high although the ia of the mo b model was as high as 0 943 the average nrmse was 32 6 30 represent poor agreement and the simulated plant height values were negative during the stretch tendril period indicating that the mo b model failed to simulate the heights of cucumber plants these two indexes showed that the mo g and mo l models had good simulation accuracies and could be used to simulate the dynamics of cucumber plant heights during the whole growth period for these models the nrmses were 11 7 and 9 2 15 represent good agreement and the ia were 0 993 and 0 995 respectively the mo l model was found to obtain the lowest error when simulating cucumber plant heights its nrmse was extremely significantly different from those of the mo b and mo m models and its ia was extremely significantly different from that of the mo m models fig 7 thus compared with the other three growth functions the mo l model yielded optimal nrmse and ia values when simulating cucumber plant heights the variation trend of cucumber plant heights was s shaped and increased with the growth process the plant heights increased rapidly in the early stage but slowly in the late stage zhou et al 2012 jiang et al 2020b also suggested that the mo l model received the optima of rmse and ia values when simulating the heights of winter wheat plants 5 conclusions in the study we took the accumulated temperature as the independent variable and the influencing factor parameters associated with and the upper irrigation limit function dwstr i at each growth stage as the coefficients to obtain four growth functions gompertz mischerlich bertalanffy and logistic functions consequently four new growth functions were constructed to describe the impacts of moisture and accumulated temperature on cucumber plant heights in a solar greenhouse then based on experimental data collected between 2017 and 2019 the simulations of these four new different models were calibrated and evaluated the following major conclusions can be drawn from the results 1 with an increase in the upper limit of irrigation the water impact factor parameters changed exponentially and the exponential function differed among different growth stages the functional formula obtained for the stretch tendril period initial flowering period and early harvest period were y 0 1753e0 0177x y 0 6332e0 0046x and y 0 7241e0 0031x respectively and the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0 9604 0 9937 and 0 9191 respectively 2 among the four newly established growth functions i e the mo g mo m mo b and mo l models the mo l model was the most accurate in simulating the growth changes in cucumber plant heights driven by the soil water and accumulated temperature conditions showing the lowest variations in accuracy between 2017 and 2019 furthermore the simulations output by the mo l model were the most consistent with the actual development of cucumber plant heights in the studied solar greenhouse both the nrmse and ia indicators showed good agreement declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have
