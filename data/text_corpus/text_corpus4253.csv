21265,wave spectral components change with time and through space by receiving energy from wind through non linear energy transfer among the spectral components and dissipation due to white capping and friction changes in wave spectra are high during local events like sea land breeze and extreme events like tropical cyclones tc the wave spectral evolution during a sea land breeze cycle and tc are studied using both measured and modelled data during a sea land breeze cycle the winds are simulated using weather research and forecasting model and waves using the simulating waves nearshore model simulated source terms vary according to the intensification and weakening of sea breeze with energy from wind input having a maximum influence on wave spectra and white capping having the least the evolution of wave spectra during the tc using the european centre for medium range weather forecasts era 5 reanalysis data shows large spatial and temporal variations during the tc large waves are found in the right quadrant to the tc heading direction tc generated waves are mostly young wind seas with the youngest of waves found in the left quadrants and the wave field does not exactly follow the wind field but depends on the velocity of forward motion of tc keywords wave spectral evolution source terms sea breeze tropical cyclone extreme waves 1 introduction knowledge of the ocean wave conditions is essential for the design of marine structures as well as climatic studies most of the studies conducted on the ocean wave conditions rely on the integrated wave parameters such as significant wave height hm0 mean wave period tm02 and mean wave direction which will be inadequate in a sea state combining various wave systems hence the wave spectral description of the sea state is indispensable a wave spectrum evolves in space and time by undergoing various processes like absorbing energy from wind exchanging energy through non linear interactions and losing energy through dissipation processes like white capping bottom friction etc cavaleri et al 2007 the characteristics of wave spectra vary both spatially and temporally the physical processes that influence the wave spectrum include local events like sea breeze land breeze systems and extreme events like tropical cyclones in both cases the wind speed and wind direction change at a very different time scale providing a growth and decay phase which in turn has a significant effect on the growth and decay of the wave spectrum studies on wave growth due to the increasing wind have been carried out since the joint north sea wave project jonswap experiment hasselmann et al 1973 more descriptions of the current state of understanding of the processes governing spectral wave evolution can be seen in tolman et al 2013 and cavaleri et al 2007 it is known that the shape of a wave spectrum is maintained by mainly two processes non linear transfer of energy by non linear four wave interactions and white capping several studies have discussed the process of white capping ardhuin et al 2007 cavaleri et al 2007 donelan and yuan 1994 but it continues to exist as one of the least understood processes non linear wave interaction is a process that redistributes wave energy over the spectrum through the exchange of energy resulting from resonant sets of wave components the basic properties of non linear wave interactions were found out by phillips 1960 and hasselmann 1962 1963a b it is included in the wave models mainly through two important processes called triad interactions and quadruplets interaction in triad interaction two wave components interact to form a resultant wave component and this resultant wave component will interact with a third wave component if this third wave component had the same wavelength speed and direction as the resultant one triad wave wave interactions cannot occur in deep water because in deep water it is not possible for the wave components to meet these resonant conditions holthuijsen 2010 hence in deep water quadruplet wave wave interactions occur where a pair of wave components interact with another pair of wave components quadruplets interactions transfer wave energy from the peak frequency to lower frequencies whereas triads transfer wave energy from lower to higher frequencies the computation of quadruplets wave wave interactions is complex and time consuming out of many methods and approximations proposed for computing the quadruplets interactions the discrete interaction approximation dia proposed by hasselmann et al 1985 is used in wave models like simulating waves nearshore swan during the non monsoon period winds in the coastal regions of india are dominated by the sea breeze the diurnal sea and the land breeze is caused due to the contrasting thermal responses of land and water surfaces and has its maximum vertical extend in the tropical coastal regions abbs and physick 1992 a sea land breeze cycle has mainly two phases onshore and offshore during the onshore phase of the sea land breeze cycle starting from late morning to early afternoon the wind speed increases to reach its maximum at night the wind speed drops and the wind direction veers offshore in the early hours of the morning this offshore phase is known as the land breeze many studies have shown that the sea breeze can significantly impact coastal processes like alongshore sediment transport e g masselink 1998 masselink and pattiaratchi 1998 pattiaratchi et al 1997 ponce de leon and orfila 2013 conducted a numerical study on the impact of marine breeze on wave field around mallorca island in the mediterranean sea using the swan wave model gunsen and symonds 2014 conducted a study on the spectral evolution of waves during a sea land breeze cycle off southwest australia by focusing on the relative roles of wind input white capping non linear interactions on wave spectrum even though the importance of seasonally reversing monsoon winds on ocean waves in the indian coastal region has been well studied much attention is not paid to the evolution of wave spectra during the sea land breeze cycle in the earlier studies on the spectral characteristics of waves along the east and west coasts of india dattatri et al 1977 narasimhan and deo 1979 kumar and kumar 2008 aboobacker et al 2014 kumar et al 2014a 2014b kumar and anjali 2015 anjali and kumar 2016 2017 anjali et al 2018 the evolution of the wave spectrum in response to the changes in the wind has not been discussed some studies have discussed the influence of sea breeze on the waves in the coastal waters of india neetu et al 2006 remya and kumar 2013 glejin et al 2013 aboobacker et al 2014 amrutha et al 2016 vethamony et al 2011 have studied the super imposition of wind seas on pre existing swells of the eastern arabian sea and found that the wave spectra distinctly bring out salient features of deep water swell and wind seas generated by the local sea breeze but the evolution of wave spectra in response to the changes in wind speed and direction during a diurnal sea land breeze cycle along the indian coast has not been studied a tropical cyclone tc with intense and fast varying winds produces a severe and complex ocean wave field that can propagate for thousands of kilometres away from the storm center resulting in dramatic variation of the wave field in time and space in the northern indian ocean there are 5 6 times more tropical disturbances in the bay of bengal than in the arabian sea dube et al 1997 studies were carried out in the past to understand wave characteristics during a hurricane young 2006 kumar and stone 2007 xu et al 2007 chu and cheng 2008 soomere et al 2008 fan et al 2009 babanin et al 2011 sanil kumar et al 2013 amrutha et al 2014 mandal et al 2020 the evolution of the wave energy spectrum during the onset of a tc is set by the input of energy from the wind the transfer of energy between different frequency bands via non linear wave wave interactions and the energy loss due to wave breaking phillips 1980 the wave field in a given region is a result of the combined response to both remote and local forcing a comprehensive study of the wind wave field generated by tc bonnie is reported by moon et al 2003 in which the role of non linear wave wave interactions to continually shape and stabilize the wave spectrum to a standard jonswap is confirmed recently collins et al 2018 presented directional wave spectra during two intense tcs in the pacific ocean in the design of marine structures it is essential to consider the wave loading during extreme events like tcs the induced loads and the structure s response can be calculated reasonably only if the wave spectra during such extreme events are clearly understood whalen and ochi 1978 have shown that the maximum response of a structure does not always occur at the maximum spectral energy density hence the wave spectra during different stages of extreme events like tc and the changes in wave spectral shape during tc should be known considering the above the objective of this work is to study the evolution of wave spectra during two different weather phenomena one during the sea land breeze cycle here the wind speed and wind direction change relatively slowly and the other during the tc where wind speed and direction changes rapidly the evolution of wave spectra during a sea land breeze cycle is studied for a location in the eastern arabian sea fig 1 a using the swan wave model and the relative roles of wind input white capping and non linear interaction in the evolution of wave spectrum are examined the growth and decay of wave spectra during tc phailin described in section 2 2 is studied for a location off gopalpur in the northwestern bay of bengal fig 1b this paper is structured as follows section 2 deals with the data and methodology in which section 2 1 describes the numerical model used to study the evolution of wave spectra during sea breeze whereas section 2 2 describes the data and methods used to study the evolution of wave spectra during a tropical cyclone section 3 deals with the results and discussions where section 3 1 focuses on the wave spectral evolution during sea breeze and section 3 2 on the wave spectral evolution during tropical cyclones section 4 gives a summary and conclusion from the study 2 data and methodology 2 1 modelling waves during sea land breeze cycle swan wave model the swan wave model is used to simulate the wave conditions during the sea land breeze cycle swan is a third generation wave model used for simulating realistic wave parameters in coastal areas lakes and estuaries from given water depth wind bottom and current conditions it is a discrete spectral model based on a wave action density equation where the wave current interaction through radiation stresses is taken into consideration the model equation is given below 1 δ n δ t c g x n x c g y n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s t o t σ n σ ѳ x y t is the wave action density which is deﬁned as wave energy density divided by intrinsic frequency e σ in frequency direction space and time cg x

source terms stot 2 s tot s in s nl 3 s nl 4 s d s w s d s b s d s b r the first three terms of eq 2 represent wave growth by the wind non linear transfer of wave energy through three wave and four wave interactions the last three terms of eq 2 are wave decay due to white capping bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking respectively the quality of wave hindcast or forecast is decided by many factors such as forcing by wind currents water level variations quality of the source terms and the numerical effects roland and ardhuin 2014 the factors affecting the quality of wave prediction varies from deep water to shallow water in deep water source terms for wind wave growth white capping dissipation and non linear interactions are prominent whereas in shallow water bottom friction depth induced breaking dissipation by vegetation and opposing currents non linear triad interactions and bottom scattering start to play a role in the source term balance many source terms still contain many empirically based functional relationships and coefficients and hence the accuracy of the wave prediction is still challenging hence it is important to know which of the available schemes and coefficients for various physical processes provides the best wave prediction for the study region the weather research and forecasting wrf model is used to simulate the spatial and temporal variability of wind speed associated with sea breeze and larger synoptic conditions the swan wave model forced by the 3 hourly wind from wrf output is used to simulate the wave conditions during the sea breeze the model specifications for swan are given in table 1 the domain for swan is 74 25oe to 74 5oe and 14 2on to 14 4on in 250 200 grids with a resolution of 0 001 fig 1b the 3 hourly wind data with a resolution of 0 027 0 027 from the wrf model s output and the wave parameters like hm0 tm02 and wave direction from the directional waverider buoy deployed at 30 m water depth off honnavar buoy x in the eastern arabian sea fig 1b were used as the input parameters for the swan the model run was carried out for a period of 4 months starting from 27 january 2015 to 31 may 2015 and the model results are compared with the directional waverider buoy deployed at 9 m water depth buoy y the offshore boundary of the swan model was taken at 30 m water depth since the measured wave data were at this depth the same wave parameters were given for all the three boundaries at north west and south whereas the eastern boundary is a closed boundary land the digitized bathymetry from the hydrographic chart is used as the bathymetry for swan swan was run in the third generation mode with a time step of 15 min results of the model simulation with different white capping schemes and friction coefficients were compared to find out the best scheme for the study location the model was first run run i with the default settings for white capping dissipation the komen type dissipation using δ 1 following rogers et al 2003 and jonswap bottom friction coefficient c 0 067 m2s 3 which is the value originally recommended by bouws and komen 1983 the second model run run ii was done using the same white capping and friction coefficient but with δ 1 for the third model run run iii the white capping scheme used is the komen type dissipation with δ 1 and a constant jonswap bottom friction coefficient c 0 038 m2s 3 as recommended by zijlema et al 2012 the saturation based white capping scheme based on the work of alves and banner 2003 implemented in swan following van der westhuysen et al 2007 with a bottom friction coefficient of c 0 038 m2s 3 is used in the fourth model run run iv hm0 and tm02 obtained from all the four model runs were compared with the measured wave parameters using root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r scatter index si and bias 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n a i b i 2 4 r n i 1 n a i b i i 1 n a i i 1 n b i n i 1 n a i 2 i 1 n a i 2 n i 1 n b i 2 i 1 n b

represents the mean value the temporal variation in the magnitude of source terms during a sea breeze cycle on 27 march 2015 is examined by comparing the source term output during the growth and decay phase of the sea breeze the spatial variation of source terms is also examined by comparing the source terms at two different water depths 25 m and 9 m the one dimensional wave spectrum obtained from the third model run is compared with the measured spectrum during the growth and decay phase of the sea land breeze cycle 2 2 evolution of wave spectra during tropical cyclone a depression developed on 9 october 2013 morning over the southeast bay of bengal intensified and developed into a cyclonic storm cs phailin on the same day evening imd 2013 moving north westwards it further intensified into a severe cyclonic storm scs in the morning and into a very scs in the forenoon of 10 october over the east central bay of bengal the phailin crossed odisha coast near gopalpur around 17 00 utc of 12 october 2013 the track of the tc is shown in fig 1c the waverider buoy drifted from its deployed location on 12 october 2013 00 00 utc due to the impact of the tc and the buoy remained within 100 km from the tc track on 12 october the influence of tc on waves is examined using waverider buoy data located at 19 16 87 n 84 57 76 e buoy z the data collected during the period from 1 to 14 october 2013 is used for the study on the evolution of the wave spectrum at a location the evolution of the wave spectrum near the cyclone eye at different locations is studied using european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era 5 reanalysis data hersbach and dee 2016 for differentiating seas of different origins a parameter equivalent wind sea frequency fu calculated from the wind speed is used 7 f u g 2 π β u where u wind speed g 9 81 β 1 2 donelan et al 1985 the equivalent wind sea frequency fu is the lowest wave frequency which may receive energy input from the winds with constant wind speed 3 results and discussions 3 1 evolution of wave spectra during a sea land breeze cycle hm0 and tm02 obtained from all the four model runs i to iv are compared with the measured data from buoy y fig 2 a b and the rmse between measured and modelled data for each of the four runs are also calculated table 2 from fig 2a b it can be seen that there is no much variation in the hm0 obtained from different model runs the values of rmse calculated for different model runs are almost the same in the case of hm0 but differs significantly in the case of tm02 since the rmse between measured and modelled values of hm0 and tm02 is the least for run iii it is used in further analysis the effect of the sea breeze in the coastal regions of india is significant from november to may aparna et al 2005 waves generated under the influence of sea breeze will be characterised by high hm0 and low tm02 fig 2c shows the variation in hm0 tm02 and wind speed during a period of 10 days in march 2015 wind vector for the same period 22 march 2015 00 00 h to 1 april 2015 00 00 h is shown in fig 3 one significant sea land breeze cycle with high hm0 and wind speed accompanied by low tm02 is observed on 27 march 2015 fig 2c hence this sea land breeze cycle is selected for further study the diurnal variations in hm0 tm02 and wind speed on 27 march 2015 are shown in fig 2d here the wind speed is found to increase to reach a maximum 6 47 m s at around 12 00 h and then decreases indicating a sea land breeze cycle the impact of the sea breeze on the wave spectrum can be seen as the growth and decay of the wave spectrum over time in a day fig 2e shows the wave spectrum at every 3 h interval on 27 march 2015 here the wave spectra observed have one major peak at a frequency less than 0 1 hz swell peak and two minor peaks at higher frequencies wind sea peak the wind sea peaks tend to vary significantly over time it can be seen that at 12 h an energy peak develops at around 0 4 hz and it continues to develop to its maximum energy till 15 h and then decays as the wind speed reduced to 2 8 m s such a pattern of growth and decay of the wave spectrum be seen in ponce de leon and orfila 2013 where the wave spectrum is single peaked the increase in energy from 9 to 15 h followed by a decrease from 15 to 21 h in the wind sea frequency region of the wave spectrum fig 2e is related to the wind speed intensification due to sea breeze and hence marks the impact of sea breeze on wave spectrum the evolution of wave spectra under the influence of wind involves various energy transfer mechanisms like energy input from wind transfer of energy between different wave components through non linear interaction and dissipation due to processes like white capping breaking and friction these processes contribute to the total energy of the wave spectrum and are regarded as the source terms the various source terms obtained from swan at the time of maximum wind speed during the onshore phase of the above mentioned sea land breeze cycle are shown in fig 4 the figure shows the source terms like variance density wind input sin dissipation through white capping sds and quadruplet interactions snl4 distributed over the frequency and direction domain at 12 h when the wind speed is maximum at 12 hrs the wind direction is from the west indicating that the winds are blowing towards the coast the wind vector is indicated with white arrow in fig 4 the spectrum for variance density shows two peaks one at a lower frequency f 0 1 hz representing swells from the southwest direction and the other at higher frequency f 0 4 hz representing wind seas from the west fig 4a the wind input term is also from the west with its maximum energy concentration between west and southwest at high frequencies fig 4b due to the influence of the sea breeze it can be seen that the region of high wind input occurs at 0 4 hz in the direction bin 240 to 300 with its peak at 240 to 270 fig 4b fig 4c shows that it is also in the same frequency and direction bin of 240 300 the magnitude of energy loss due to white capping and spread through non linear interactions is high fig 4d white capping is a type of wave dissipation that depends on the steepness of the waves and thereby wind input the generated wind sea also has signiﬁcant energy in spectral components travelling in directions away from the peak wind sea direction fig 4a gunson and symonds 2014 observed that quadruplet interactions play a major role in spreading high frequency wave energy in frequency and direction space the evolution of source terms during the growth and decay phase of a sea land breeze cycle is shown in fig 5 the figure shows the variations in variance density wind input and non linear interactions over a frequency direction domain from 9 h to 21 h also the change in wind pattern is shown using the wind vector from 9 h to 18 h the wind direction is from the northwest and it is towards the coast the wind speed increases from 9 h and reaches a maximum speed 6 47 m s at 12 h and then decreases indicating that the sea breeze which starts in the early morning hours intensifies at 12 h and then weakens at 18 h the strength of the sea breeze is very low and thereafter the wind direction changes the wind input term is very sensitive to the changes in the wind pattern energy from wind input is present only when the wind speed is considerably high 12 15 h the wind input energy at 12 h is concentrated in the southwest northwest directional bin which shifts to the west northwest directional bin at 15 h energy from wind input is zero when the wind speed reduces to 2 85 m s after that at 21 h wind speed slightly increases to 3 23 m s and the direction shifts to the southeast indicating the effect of a land breeze since the wind speed is low the energy from wind input is zero during land breeze hours this shows that the effect of land breeze on the wave spectrum is negligibly small the energy of the wind sea peak in the variance density spectrum is also high when the influence of the sea breeze is strong the one dimensional wave spectra of source terms indicate the relative roles of source terms at different frequencies fig 6 it can be seen that the energy transfer from wind input is always positive whereas the energy transfer from non linear interactions has both positive and negative phases it shows that due to non linear interactions energy is lost at certain frequency bins whereas energy is gained at other bins thus non linear interactions enable the distribution of energy between various frequency bins the energy from wind input is maximum at 12 h fig 6b and lies in the frequency bin 0 4 hz 0 5 hz but the wind sea peak in the variance density spectrum reaches its peak at 15 h and with its maximum energy between 0 2 hz and 0 4 hz fig 5a this is due to the influence of non linear interactions which become stronger at 15 h fig 6c at 12 h and 15 h fig 6b c the maximum energy loss due to non linear interactions occurs between 0 4 and 0 5 hz region of high wind input and maximum energy gain between 0 2 and 0 4 hz during other times maximum energy loss due to non linear interactions occurs at frequencies greater than 0 6 hz the energy gain at a higher frequency from wind input is transferred to lower frequencies through non linear interactions the magnitude of energy loss dissipation due to white capping observed here is negligibly small maximum wind input is observed during 12 h when wind speed is maximum the modelled one dimensional wave spectrum at 9 m is compared with the measured wave spectrum at different stages of a sea land breeze cycle fig 6 both the modelled and measured wave spectrum are double peaked the peak frequency of swells from the model run matches well with the measured swell frequency whereas wind sea peak frequency differs but even in the case of swells the magnitude of energy density between modelled and measured wave spectra varies the modelled energy density over predicts except for 9 h when the wind speed is maximum at 12 h the modelled wind seas match well with the measured one the over prediction of swell peak by model can be due to error in estimation of swell wave dissipation by bottom friction the spatial and temporal variations in source terms are studied by comparing the source terms at 9 m and 25 m water depth fig 7 the wind input term reaches its maximum at around 10 15 h non linear interactions and dissipation due to white capping come into action when the energy from wind input increases the influence of dissipation due to white capping is comparatively less at both the depths the magnitude of source terms is high at 9 m depth compared to 25 m depth since sea breeze is a coastal phenomenon whose strength decreases offshore aparna et al 2005 the decrease in the magnitude of source terms at 25 m depth could be due to the decrease in the strength of sea breeze dissipation due to bottom friction and total energy dissipation is high at 9 m depth since the depth is less 3 2 evolution of wave spectra during tropical cyclone the variation in the averaged wave parameters from waverider buoy data buoy z during the tc is shown in fig 8 a to d the hm0 before the arrival of the cyclone is between 1 and 2 m in contrast on 10 october 2013 when the cyclone is 850 km away from the buoy location hm0 starts to increase to reach its peak on 12 october indicating the influence of the tc the maximum value of hm0 is 7 34 m which occurs on 12 october 10 42 h an increase in the tm02 is observed during the tc period showing the influence of swells generated by the cyclone which reached the location before the arrival of the cyclone the daily average spectral energy density of buoy wave data from 4 to 14 october is shown in fig 8e it can be seen that the wave spectrum before the arrival of the cyclone is double peaked with low frequency swells and high frequency wind seas whereas during the cyclone period the wave spectrum is single peaked with very high spectral energy the wave spectrum on 10 october is narrow and the spectral peak lies predominantly in the swell region indicating the presence of high energy swells reaching from the cyclone location on 12 october the spectral energy density is maximum and the low frequency wind seas and swells merge to form a high energy single peaked spectrum the wave directional spectra era 5 at the cyclone eye 15 75on 88 5oe and locations north west south and east of the cyclone as marked in fig 1c are shown in fig 9 the spatial distribution of hm0 and wind vector on 11 october 00 00 h when the cyclone reaches its maximum intensity is shown in fig 1c the equivalent wind sea frequency fu which is the lowest wave frequency which may receive energy input from the winds is also shown two spectral peaks one at a lower frequency 0 056 hz and one at a higher frequency 0 1 0 15 hz can be identified in the figure the lower frequency peak whose direction is always from the southwest is a swell peak since the peak frequency is less than fu whereas the high frequency peaks of which the direction varies according to the wind direction are the wind seas generated by the cyclonic wind the wind direction at the location of cyclone and north of cyclone is from the east and hence the wind sea peaks are also from the east right of the storm centre the wind direction approximately aligns with the direction of propagation of the storm and hence it is expected that the wave propagates forward with the storm these waves will remain within the intense wind regions of the storm for an extended period and are generally called fetch trapped waves king and shemdin 1978 whereas in the left of the storm centre fig 9b the wind direction and the direction of propagation of storm are opposed and hence waves will remain in the strong wind field for a very short time this causes asymmetry in the wave direction it can be observed that in the west of the storm centre the wind sea direction is from the northeast south of the storm centre wind speed is less hence the wind sea energy is also less and it spread in all the directions according to the wind direction the evolution of wave spectra over time is shown in fig 10 as directional wave spectra from 6 to 18 october from the figure it can be seen that there is a spectral peak with maximum energy which always lies at frequency less than 0 1 hz with its direction from southwest representing the swells another peak with comparatively lower energy is also observed in the same direction at around 0 1 hz but on 12 october when the cyclone is very near the energy of the second peak is very high during all other time except 12 october the u10 cp u10 wind speed cp phase speed ratio of the second spectral peak is less than 1 indicating that these waves are propagating faster than wind and hence cannot receive energy from wind the spectral peak observed on 12 october holds u10 cp 1 showing that it is still under the influence of cyclone winds many studies show that the wave pattern around a moving tropical cyclone follows an asymmetric pattern zhang and oey 2019 ponce de león and bettencourt 2019 to understand more about this pattern the hm0 distribution up to a radius of 220 km from the cyclone eye are analysed the region is divided into four quadrants rf right front lb left back lf left front and rb right back with respect to cyclone heading direction following the definition of hwang and walsh 2016 in terms of azimuth angle referenced to the tropical cyclone heading ϕ 0 and positive counter clockwise the range of each quadrant is defined as 45 to 45 rf 45 to 135 lb 135 to 225 lf and 225 to 315 rb as shown in fig 11 a fig 11b shows that hm0 is asymmetric with high values in the right quadrant rf and rb and low values in the left lf and lb to quantitatively analyse the asymmetry in the distribution of hm0 the probability of occurrence of hm0 in each quadrant is calculated and shown in fig 11d hm0 observed in this region ranges from 3 to 6 m hence the probability of occurrence of hm0 within the range 3 4 m 4 5 m and 5 6 m in each quadrant is shown in the figure in all the quadrants the probability of occurrence of waves with hm0 range 4 5 m is the highest waves with a high hm0 range 5 6 m are occurring only in the rf and rb quadrant whereas small waves 3 4 m are mostly occurring in the lf quadrant the occurrence of high waves in the right quadrant is due to the high wind speed in that region fig 11b from the studies conducted by ponce de leon and guedes soares 2014 and ponce de leon and bettencourt 2019 it is found that extreme wave parameters and maximum wind speed under cyclones are higher in the southeast quadrant between 90 and 180 measured clockwise from the cyclone s direction in this study if the cyclone heading direction is considered as north 0 and measured clockwise as in the above mentioned studies the maximum wind speed and hm0 during cyclone are observed in the northeast quadrant between 0 and 90 to know more about the waves generated by the moving tropical cyclone inverse wave age ωn u10 cp is estimated for the region fig 11c except in the region near the cyclone eye the waves in the tc are active wind seas with ωn greater than 1 though inverse wave age ωn is directly proportional to wind speed and wind speed is high in the right quadrants the youngest wind seas high ωn values are found in the lf and lb quadrants whereas in the rf quadrant the wind seas are comparatively older this is because cp is directly proportional to hm0 as explained by zhang and oey 2019 and hm0 is low at lf and lb quadrants resulting in high ωn in the rf quadrant due to large hm0 slightly older waves are found fig 12 shows the variation of hm0 for different velocities of forward motion of cyclone figs 12a and b shows the distribution of wind speed and hm0 on 10 october at 12 h and 18 h respectively even though the maximum value of wind speed vmax observed here is almost the same the velocity of forward motion vfm of the cyclone differs similarly fig 12c and d show the wind speed and hm0 on 11 october at 00 h and 18 h where the values of vfm are 7 20 m s and 2 27 m s respectively here it can be seen that the wave field does not follow exactly the same distribution as the wind field for higher values of vfm fig 12a and c the contours of hm0 tend to sweep back behind the storm centre this is because when the propagation velocity of cyclone increases it exceeds the group velocity of the waves generated by the storm and these waves cannot keep pace with the storm whereas for lower values of vfm larger waves are seen on the right quadrant of the cyclone eye 4 summary and conclusion the evolution of the wave spectrum according to the changes in the wind system during a sea land breeze cycle is examined by focusing on the source terms involved the influence of sea breeze on waves can be observed as growth and decay of wave energy in the high frequency region of the spectrum with respect to the changes in the wind speed due to the sea land breeze cycle the various source terms examined during the sea land breeze cycle are found to be sensitive to the sea breeze intensity the wind input term is observed from the same direction of the wind west with its maximum magnitude during the time of sea breeze intensification the energy of the variance density spectrum also varies according to the sea breeze intensity and wind direction the energy from wind input is maximum at 12 h in the high frequency region but the variance density of wind sea peak reaches its maximum intensity at 15 h in the low frequency region this due to the effect of non linear interactions that distribute the energy gained from wind input between various frequency bins by enabling energy loss at higher frequency bins and gain at lower frequency bins in the region of high wind input the energy loss due to non linear interactions is also found to be high the influence of white capping observed is negligibly small in the evolution process the decrease in the magnitude of source terms at 25 m depth could be due to the decrease in the strength of sea breeze since sea breeze is a coastal phenomenon whose strength decreases offshore the evolution of wave spectrum during a tropical cyclone is studied using the wave data at gopalpur on the east coast of india during a tropical cyclone phailin the effect of the cyclone is identified as an increase in hm0 during the period the wave spectra observed during the tropical cyclone are single peaked with very high energy the directional wave spectra observed near the eye and north west east and south of the cyclone has two separate peaks representing swells and wind sea the wind sea direction aligns with the direction of cyclone wind and the energy is highest when the cyclone is near hm0 during the tropical cyclone is high in the right quadrant with respect to the cyclone heading direction where the wind speed is maximum waves generated due to tropical cyclones are young wind seas and the youngest of waves are found in the left front and left back quadrants the wave field generated by cyclone winds does not exactly follow the wind field but it also depends on the velocity of forward motion of the cyclone when the velocity of the forward motion of the cyclone is high the large waves tend to sweep back behind the storm centre as it cannot keep pace with the storm since the propagation velocity of the cyclone exceeds the group velocity of waves generated credit authorship contribution statement m anjali nair conceptualization formal analysis

21265,wave spectral components change with time and through space by receiving energy from wind through non linear energy transfer among the spectral components and dissipation due to white capping and friction changes in wave spectra are high during local events like sea land breeze and extreme events like tropical cyclones tc the wave spectral evolution during a sea land breeze cycle and tc are studied using both measured and modelled data during a sea land breeze cycle the winds are simulated using weather research and forecasting model and waves using the simulating waves nearshore model simulated source terms vary according to the intensification and weakening of sea breeze with energy from wind input having a maximum influence on wave spectra and white capping having the least the evolution of wave spectra during the tc using the european centre for medium range weather forecasts era 5 reanalysis data shows large spatial and temporal variations during the tc large waves are found in the right quadrant to the tc heading direction tc generated waves are mostly young wind seas with the youngest of waves found in the left quadrants and the wave field does not exactly follow the wind field but depends on the velocity of forward motion of tc keywords wave spectral evolution source terms sea breeze tropical cyclone extreme waves 1 introduction knowledge of the ocean wave conditions is essential for the design of marine structures as well as climatic studies most of the studies conducted on the ocean wave conditions rely on the integrated wave parameters such as significant wave height hm0 mean wave period tm02 and mean wave direction which will be inadequate in a sea state combining various wave systems hence the wave spectral description of the sea state is indispensable a wave spectrum evolves in space and time by undergoing various processes like absorbing energy from wind exchanging energy through non linear interactions and losing energy through dissipation processes like white capping bottom friction etc cavaleri et al 2007 the characteristics of wave spectra vary both spatially and temporally the physical processes that influence the wave spectrum include local events like sea breeze land breeze systems and extreme events like tropical cyclones in both cases the wind speed and wind direction change at a very different time scale providing a growth and decay phase which in turn has a significant effect on the growth and decay of the wave spectrum studies on wave growth due to the increasing wind have been carried out since the joint north sea wave project jonswap experiment hasselmann et al 1973 more descriptions of the current state of understanding of the processes governing spectral wave evolution can be seen in tolman et al 2013 and cavaleri et al 2007 it is known that the shape of a wave spectrum is maintained by mainly two processes non linear transfer of energy by non linear four wave interactions and white capping several studies have discussed the process of white capping ardhuin et al 2007 cavaleri et al 2007 donelan and yuan 1994 but it continues to exist as one of the least understood processes non linear wave interaction is a process that redistributes wave energy over the spectrum through the exchange of energy resulting from resonant sets of wave components the basic properties of non linear wave interactions were found out by phillips 1960 and hasselmann 1962 1963a b it is included in the wave models mainly through two important processes called triad interactions and quadruplets interaction in triad interaction two wave components interact to form a resultant wave component and this resultant wave component will interact with a third wave component if this third wave component had the same wavelength speed and direction as the resultant one triad wave wave interactions cannot occur in deep water because in deep water it is not possible for the wave components to meet these resonant conditions holthuijsen 2010 hence in deep water quadruplet wave wave interactions occur where a pair of wave components interact with another pair of wave components quadruplets interactions transfer wave energy from the peak frequency to lower frequencies whereas triads transfer wave energy from lower to higher frequencies the computation of quadruplets wave wave interactions is complex and time consuming out of many methods and approximations proposed for computing the quadruplets interactions the discrete interaction approximation dia proposed by hasselmann et al 1985 is used in wave models like simulating waves nearshore swan during the non monsoon period winds in the coastal regions of india are dominated by the sea breeze the diurnal sea and the land breeze is caused due to the contrasting thermal responses of land and water surfaces and has its maximum vertical extend in the tropical coastal regions abbs and physick 1992 a sea land breeze cycle has mainly two phases onshore and offshore during the onshore phase of the sea land breeze cycle starting from late morning to early afternoon the wind speed increases to reach its maximum at night the wind speed drops and the wind direction veers offshore in the early hours of the morning this offshore phase is known as the land breeze many studies have shown that the sea breeze can significantly impact coastal processes like alongshore sediment transport e g masselink 1998 masselink and pattiaratchi 1998 pattiaratchi et al 1997 ponce de leon and orfila 2013 conducted a numerical study on the impact of marine breeze on wave field around mallorca island in the mediterranean sea using the swan wave model gunsen and symonds 2014 conducted a study on the spectral evolution of waves during a sea land breeze cycle off southwest australia by focusing on the relative roles of wind input white capping non linear interactions on wave spectrum even though the importance of seasonally reversing monsoon winds on ocean waves in the indian coastal region has been well studied much attention is not paid to the evolution of wave spectra during the sea land breeze cycle in the earlier studies on the spectral characteristics of waves along the east and west coasts of india dattatri et al 1977 narasimhan and deo 1979 kumar and kumar 2008 aboobacker et al 2014 kumar et al 2014a 2014b kumar and anjali 2015 anjali and kumar 2016 2017 anjali et al 2018 the evolution of the wave spectrum in response to the changes in the wind has not been discussed some studies have discussed the influence of sea breeze on the waves in the coastal waters of india neetu et al 2006 remya and kumar 2013 glejin et al 2013 aboobacker et al 2014 amrutha et al 2016 vethamony et al 2011 have studied the super imposition of wind seas on pre existing swells of the eastern arabian sea and found that the wave spectra distinctly bring out salient features of deep water swell and wind seas generated by the local sea breeze but the evolution of wave spectra in response to the changes in wind speed and direction during a diurnal sea land breeze cycle along the indian coast has not been studied a tropical cyclone tc with intense and fast varying winds produces a severe and complex ocean wave field that can propagate for thousands of kilometres away from the storm center resulting in dramatic variation of the wave field in time and space in the northern indian ocean there are 5 6 times more tropical disturbances in the bay of bengal than in the arabian sea dube et al 1997 studies were carried out in the past to understand wave characteristics during a hurricane young 2006 kumar and stone 2007 xu et al 2007 chu and cheng 2008 soomere et al 2008 fan et al 2009 babanin et al 2011 sanil kumar et al 2013 amrutha et al 2014 mandal et al 2020 the evolution of the wave energy spectrum during the onset of a tc is set by the input of energy from the wind the transfer of energy between different frequency bands via non linear wave wave interactions and the energy loss due to wave breaking phillips 1980 the wave field in a given region is a result of the combined response to both remote and local forcing a comprehensive study of the wind wave field generated by tc bonnie is reported by moon et al 2003 in which the role of non linear wave wave interactions to continually shape and stabilize the wave spectrum to a standard jonswap is confirmed recently collins et al 2018 presented directional wave spectra during two intense tcs in the pacific ocean in the design of marine structures it is essential to consider the wave loading during extreme events like tcs the induced loads and the structure s response can be calculated reasonably only if the wave spectra during such extreme events are clearly understood whalen and ochi 1978 have shown that the maximum response of a structure does not always occur at the maximum spectral energy density hence the wave spectra during different stages of extreme events like tc and the changes in wave spectral shape during tc should be known considering the above the objective of this work is to study the evolution of wave spectra during two different weather phenomena one during the sea land breeze cycle here the wind speed and wind direction change relatively slowly and the other during the tc where wind speed and direction changes rapidly the evolution of wave spectra during a sea land breeze cycle is studied for a location in the eastern arabian sea fig 1 a using the swan wave model and the relative roles of wind input white capping and non linear interaction in the evolution of wave spectrum are examined the growth and decay of wave spectra during tc phailin described in section 2 2 is studied for a location off gopalpur in the northwestern bay of bengal fig 1b this paper is structured as follows section 2 deals with the data and methodology in which section 2 1 describes the numerical model used to study the evolution of wave spectra during sea breeze whereas section 2 2 describes the data and methods used to study the evolution of wave spectra during a tropical cyclone section 3 deals with the results and discussions where section 3 1 focuses on the wave spectral evolution during sea breeze and section 3 2 on the wave spectral evolution during tropical cyclones section 4 gives a summary and conclusion from the study 2 data and methodology 2 1 modelling waves during sea land breeze cycle swan wave model the swan wave model is used to simulate the wave conditions during the sea land breeze cycle swan is a third generation wave model used for simulating realistic wave parameters in coastal areas lakes and estuaries from given water depth wind bottom and current conditions it is a discrete spectral model based on a wave action density equation where the wave current interaction through radiation stresses is taken into consideration the model equation is given below 1 δ n δ t c g x n x c g y n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s t o t σ n σ ѳ x y t is the wave action density which is deﬁned as wave energy density divided by intrinsic frequency e σ in frequency direction space and time cg x

source terms stot 2 s tot s in s nl 3 s nl 4 s d s w s d s b s d s b r the first three terms of eq 2 represent wave growth by the wind non linear transfer of wave energy through three wave and four wave interactions the last three terms of eq 2 are wave decay due to white capping bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking respectively the quality of wave hindcast or forecast is decided by many factors such as forcing by wind currents water level variations quality of the source terms and the numerical effects roland and ardhuin 2014 the factors affecting the quality of wave prediction varies from deep water to shallow water in deep water source terms for wind wave growth white capping dissipation and non linear interactions are prominent whereas in shallow water bottom friction depth induced breaking dissipation by vegetation and opposing currents non linear triad interactions and bottom scattering start to play a role in the source term balance many source terms still contain many empirically based functional relationships and coefficients and hence the accuracy of the wave prediction is still challenging hence it is important to know which of the available schemes and coefficients for various physical processes provides the best wave prediction for the study region the weather research and forecasting wrf model is used to simulate the spatial and temporal variability of wind speed associated with sea breeze and larger synoptic conditions the swan wave model forced by the 3 hourly wind from wrf output is used to simulate the wave conditions during the sea breeze the model specifications for swan are given in table 1 the domain for swan is 74 25oe to 74 5oe and 14 2on to 14 4on in 250 200 grids with a resolution of 0 001 fig 1b the 3 hourly wind data with a resolution of 0 027 0 027 from the wrf model s output and the wave parameters like hm0 tm02 and wave direction from the directional waverider buoy deployed at 30 m water depth off honnavar buoy x in the eastern arabian sea fig 1b were used as the input parameters for the swan the model run was carried out for a period of 4 months starting from 27 january 2015 to 31 may 2015 and the model results are compared with the directional waverider buoy deployed at 9 m water depth buoy y the offshore boundary of the swan model was taken at 30 m water depth since the measured wave data were at this depth the same wave parameters were given for all the three boundaries at north west and south whereas the eastern boundary is a closed boundary land the digitized bathymetry from the hydrographic chart is used as the bathymetry for swan swan was run in the third generation mode with a time step of 15 min results of the model simulation with different white capping schemes and friction coefficients were compared to find out the best scheme for the study location the model was first run run i with the default settings for white capping dissipation the komen type dissipation using δ 1 following rogers et al 2003 and jonswap bottom friction coefficient c 0 067 m2s 3 which is the value originally recommended by bouws and komen 1983 the second model run run ii was done using the same white capping and friction coefficient but with δ 1 for the third model run run iii the white capping scheme used is the komen type dissipation with δ 1 and a constant jonswap bottom friction coefficient c 0 038 m2s 3 as recommended by zijlema et al 2012 the saturation based white capping scheme based on the work of alves and banner 2003 implemented in swan following van der westhuysen et al 2007 with a bottom friction coefficient of c 0 038 m2s 3 is used in the fourth model run run iv hm0 and tm02 obtained from all the four model runs were compared with the measured wave parameters using root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r scatter index si and bias 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n a i b i 2 4 r n i 1 n a i b i i 1 n a i i 1 n b i n i 1 n a i 2 i 1 n a i 2 n i 1 n b i 2 i 1 n b

represents the mean value the temporal variation in the magnitude of source terms during a sea breeze cycle on 27 march 2015 is examined by comparing the source term output during the growth and decay phase of the sea breeze the spatial variation of source terms is also examined by comparing the source terms at two different water depths 25 m and 9 m the one dimensional wave spectrum obtained from the third model run is compared with the measured spectrum during the growth and decay phase of the sea land breeze cycle 2 2 evolution of wave spectra during tropical cyclone a depression developed on 9 october 2013 morning over the southeast bay of bengal intensified and developed into a cyclonic storm cs phailin on the same day evening imd 2013 moving north westwards it further intensified into a severe cyclonic storm scs in the morning and into a very scs in the forenoon of 10 october over the east central bay of bengal the phailin crossed odisha coast near gopalpur around 17 00 utc of 12 october 2013 the track of the tc is shown in fig 1c the waverider buoy drifted from its deployed location on 12 october 2013 00 00 utc due to the impact of the tc and the buoy remained within 100 km from the tc track on 12 october the influence of tc on waves is examined using waverider buoy data located at 19 16 87 n 84 57 76 e buoy z the data collected during the period from 1 to 14 october 2013 is used for the study on the evolution of the wave spectrum at a location the evolution of the wave spectrum near the cyclone eye at different locations is studied using european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era 5 reanalysis data hersbach and dee 2016 for differentiating seas of different origins a parameter equivalent wind sea frequency fu calculated from the wind speed is used 7 f u g 2 π β u where u wind speed g 9 81 β 1 2 donelan et al 1985 the equivalent wind sea frequency fu is the lowest wave frequency which may receive energy input from the winds with constant wind speed 3 results and discussions 3 1 evolution of wave spectra during a sea land breeze cycle hm0 and tm02 obtained from all the four model runs i to iv are compared with the measured data from buoy y fig 2 a b and the rmse between measured and modelled data for each of the four runs are also calculated table 2 from fig 2a b it can be seen that there is no much variation in the hm0 obtained from different model runs the values of rmse calculated for different model runs are almost the same in the case of hm0 but differs significantly in the case of tm02 since the rmse between measured and modelled values of hm0 and tm02 is the least for run iii it is used in further analysis the effect of the sea breeze in the coastal regions of india is significant from november to may aparna et al 2005 waves generated under the influence of sea breeze will be characterised by high hm0 and low tm02 fig 2c shows the variation in hm0 tm02 and wind speed during a period of 10 days in march 2015 wind vector for the same period 22 march 2015 00 00 h to 1 april 2015 00 00 h is shown in fig 3 one significant sea land breeze cycle with high hm0 and wind speed accompanied by low tm02 is observed on 27 march 2015 fig 2c hence this sea land breeze cycle is selected for further study the diurnal variations in hm0 tm02 and wind speed on 27 march 2015 are shown in fig 2d here the wind speed is found to increase to reach a maximum 6 47 m s at around 12 00 h and then decreases indicating a sea land breeze cycle the impact of the sea breeze on the wave spectrum can be seen as the growth and decay of the wave spectrum over time in a day fig 2e shows the wave spectrum at every 3 h interval on 27 march 2015 here the wave spectra observed have one major peak at a frequency less than 0 1 hz swell peak and two minor peaks at higher frequencies wind sea peak the wind sea peaks tend to vary significantly over time it can be seen that at 12 h an energy peak develops at around 0 4 hz and it continues to develop to its maximum energy till 15 h and then decays as the wind speed reduced to 2 8 m s such a pattern of growth and decay of the wave spectrum be seen in ponce de leon and orfila 2013 where the wave spectrum is single peaked the increase in energy from 9 to 15 h followed by a decrease from 15 to 21 h in the wind sea frequency region of the wave spectrum fig 2e is related to the wind speed intensification due to sea breeze and hence marks the impact of sea breeze on wave spectrum the evolution of wave spectra under the influence of wind involves various energy transfer mechanisms like energy input from wind transfer of energy between different wave components through non linear interaction and dissipation due to processes like white capping breaking and friction these processes contribute to the total energy of the wave spectrum and are regarded as the source terms the various source terms obtained from swan at the time of maximum wind speed during the onshore phase of the above mentioned sea land breeze cycle are shown in fig 4 the figure shows the source terms like variance density wind input sin dissipation through white capping sds and quadruplet interactions snl4 distributed over the frequency and direction domain at 12 h when the wind speed is maximum at 12 hrs the wind direction is from the west indicating that the winds are blowing towards the coast the wind vector is indicated with white arrow in fig 4 the spectrum for variance density shows two peaks one at a lower frequency f 0 1 hz representing swells from the southwest direction and the other at higher frequency f 0 4 hz representing wind seas from the west fig 4a the wind input term is also from the west with its maximum energy concentration between west and southwest at high frequencies fig 4b due to the influence of the sea breeze it can be seen that the region of high wind input occurs at 0 4 hz in the direction bin 240 to 300 with its peak at 240 to 270 fig 4b fig 4c shows that it is also in the same frequency and direction bin of 240 300 the magnitude of energy loss due to white capping and spread through non linear interactions is high fig 4d white capping is a type of wave dissipation that depends on the steepness of the waves and thereby wind input the generated wind sea also has signiﬁcant energy in spectral components travelling in directions away from the peak wind sea direction fig 4a gunson and symonds 2014 observed that quadruplet interactions play a major role in spreading high frequency wave energy in frequency and direction space the evolution of source terms during the growth and decay phase of a sea land breeze cycle is shown in fig 5 the figure shows the variations in variance density wind input and non linear interactions over a frequency direction domain from 9 h to 21 h also the change in wind pattern is shown using the wind vector from 9 h to 18 h the wind direction is from the northwest and it is towards the coast the wind speed increases from 9 h and reaches a maximum speed 6 47 m s at 12 h and then decreases indicating that the sea breeze which starts in the early morning hours intensifies at 12 h and then weakens at 18 h the strength of the sea breeze is very low and thereafter the wind direction changes the wind input term is very sensitive to the changes in the wind pattern energy from wind input is present only when the wind speed is considerably high 12 15 h the wind input energy at 12 h is concentrated in the southwest northwest directional bin which shifts to the west northwest directional bin at 15 h energy from wind input is zero when the wind speed reduces to 2 85 m s after that at 21 h wind speed slightly increases to 3 23 m s and the direction shifts to the southeast indicating the effect of a land breeze since the wind speed is low the energy from wind input is zero during land breeze hours this shows that the effect of land breeze on the wave spectrum is negligibly small the energy of the wind sea peak in the variance density spectrum is also high when the influence of the sea breeze is strong the one dimensional wave spectra of source terms indicate the relative roles of source terms at different frequencies fig 6 it can be seen that the energy transfer from wind input is always positive whereas the energy transfer from non linear interactions has both positive and negative phases it shows that due to non linear interactions energy is lost at certain frequency bins whereas energy is gained at other bins thus non linear interactions enable the distribution of energy between various frequency bins the energy from wind input is maximum at 12 h fig 6b and lies in the frequency bin 0 4 hz 0 5 hz but the wind sea peak in the variance density spectrum reaches its peak at 15 h and with its maximum energy between 0 2 hz and 0 4 hz fig 5a this is due to the influence of non linear interactions which become stronger at 15 h fig 6c at 12 h and 15 h fig 6b c the maximum energy loss due to non linear interactions occurs between 0 4 and 0 5 hz region of high wind input and maximum energy gain between 0 2 and 0 4 hz during other times maximum energy loss due to non linear interactions occurs at frequencies greater than 0 6 hz the energy gain at a higher frequency from wind input is transferred to lower frequencies through non linear interactions the magnitude of energy loss dissipation due to white capping observed here is negligibly small maximum wind input is observed during 12 h when wind speed is maximum the modelled one dimensional wave spectrum at 9 m is compared with the measured wave spectrum at different stages of a sea land breeze cycle fig 6 both the modelled and measured wave spectrum are double peaked the peak frequency of swells from the model run matches well with the measured swell frequency whereas wind sea peak frequency differs but even in the case of swells the magnitude of energy density between modelled and measured wave spectra varies the modelled energy density over predicts except for 9 h when the wind speed is maximum at 12 h the modelled wind seas match well with the measured one the over prediction of swell peak by model can be due to error in estimation of swell wave dissipation by bottom friction the spatial and temporal variations in source terms are studied by comparing the source terms at 9 m and 25 m water depth fig 7 the wind input term reaches its maximum at around 10 15 h non linear interactions and dissipation due to white capping come into action when the energy from wind input increases the influence of dissipation due to white capping is comparatively less at both the depths the magnitude of source terms is high at 9 m depth compared to 25 m depth since sea breeze is a coastal phenomenon whose strength decreases offshore aparna et al 2005 the decrease in the magnitude of source terms at 25 m depth could be due to the decrease in the strength of sea breeze dissipation due to bottom friction and total energy dissipation is high at 9 m depth since the depth is less 3 2 evolution of wave spectra during tropical cyclone the variation in the averaged wave parameters from waverider buoy data buoy z during the tc is shown in fig 8 a to d the hm0 before the arrival of the cyclone is between 1 and 2 m in contrast on 10 october 2013 when the cyclone is 850 km away from the buoy location hm0 starts to increase to reach its peak on 12 october indicating the influence of the tc the maximum value of hm0 is 7 34 m which occurs on 12 october 10 42 h an increase in the tm02 is observed during the tc period showing the influence of swells generated by the cyclone which reached the location before the arrival of the cyclone the daily average spectral energy density of buoy wave data from 4 to 14 october is shown in fig 8e it can be seen that the wave spectrum before the arrival of the cyclone is double peaked with low frequency swells and high frequency wind seas whereas during the cyclone period the wave spectrum is single peaked with very high spectral energy the wave spectrum on 10 october is narrow and the spectral peak lies predominantly in the swell region indicating the presence of high energy swells reaching from the cyclone location on 12 october the spectral energy density is maximum and the low frequency wind seas and swells merge to form a high energy single peaked spectrum the wave directional spectra era 5 at the cyclone eye 15 75on 88 5oe and locations north west south and east of the cyclone as marked in fig 1c are shown in fig 9 the spatial distribution of hm0 and wind vector on 11 october 00 00 h when the cyclone reaches its maximum intensity is shown in fig 1c the equivalent wind sea frequency fu which is the lowest wave frequency which may receive energy input from the winds is also shown two spectral peaks one at a lower frequency 0 056 hz and one at a higher frequency 0 1 0 15 hz can be identified in the figure the lower frequency peak whose direction is always from the southwest is a swell peak since the peak frequency is less than fu whereas the high frequency peaks of which the direction varies according to the wind direction are the wind seas generated by the cyclonic wind the wind direction at the location of cyclone and north of cyclone is from the east and hence the wind sea peaks are also from the east right of the storm centre the wind direction approximately aligns with the direction of propagation of the storm and hence it is expected that the wave propagates forward with the storm these waves will remain within the intense wind regions of the storm for an extended period and are generally called fetch trapped waves king and shemdin 1978 whereas in the left of the storm centre fig 9b the wind direction and the direction of propagation of storm are opposed and hence waves will remain in the strong wind field for a very short time this causes asymmetry in the wave direction it can be observed that in the west of the storm centre the wind sea direction is from the northeast south of the storm centre wind speed is less hence the wind sea energy is also less and it spread in all the directions according to the wind direction the evolution of wave spectra over time is shown in fig 10 as directional wave spectra from 6 to 18 october from the figure it can be seen that there is a spectral peak with maximum energy which always lies at frequency less than 0 1 hz with its direction from southwest representing the swells another peak with comparatively lower energy is also observed in the same direction at around 0 1 hz but on 12 october when the cyclone is very near the energy of the second peak is very high during all other time except 12 october the u10 cp u10 wind speed cp phase speed ratio of the second spectral peak is less than 1 indicating that these waves are propagating faster than wind and hence cannot receive energy from wind the spectral peak observed on 12 october holds u10 cp 1 showing that it is still under the influence of cyclone winds many studies show that the wave pattern around a moving tropical cyclone follows an asymmetric pattern zhang and oey 2019 ponce de león and bettencourt 2019 to understand more about this pattern the hm0 distribution up to a radius of 220 km from the cyclone eye are analysed the region is divided into four quadrants rf right front lb left back lf left front and rb right back with respect to cyclone heading direction following the definition of hwang and walsh 2016 in terms of azimuth angle referenced to the tropical cyclone heading ϕ 0 and positive counter clockwise the range of each quadrant is defined as 45 to 45 rf 45 to 135 lb 135 to 225 lf and 225 to 315 rb as shown in fig 11 a fig 11b shows that hm0 is asymmetric with high values in the right quadrant rf and rb and low values in the left lf and lb to quantitatively analyse the asymmetry in the distribution of hm0 the probability of occurrence of hm0 in each quadrant is calculated and shown in fig 11d hm0 observed in this region ranges from 3 to 6 m hence the probability of occurrence of hm0 within the range 3 4 m 4 5 m and 5 6 m in each quadrant is shown in the figure in all the quadrants the probability of occurrence of waves with hm0 range 4 5 m is the highest waves with a high hm0 range 5 6 m are occurring only in the rf and rb quadrant whereas small waves 3 4 m are mostly occurring in the lf quadrant the occurrence of high waves in the right quadrant is due to the high wind speed in that region fig 11b from the studies conducted by ponce de leon and guedes soares 2014 and ponce de leon and bettencourt 2019 it is found that extreme wave parameters and maximum wind speed under cyclones are higher in the southeast quadrant between 90 and 180 measured clockwise from the cyclone s direction in this study if the cyclone heading direction is considered as north 0 and measured clockwise as in the above mentioned studies the maximum wind speed and hm0 during cyclone are observed in the northeast quadrant between 0 and 90 to know more about the waves generated by the moving tropical cyclone inverse wave age ωn u10 cp is estimated for the region fig 11c except in the region near the cyclone eye the waves in the tc are active wind seas with ωn greater than 1 though inverse wave age ωn is directly proportional to wind speed and wind speed is high in the right quadrants the youngest wind seas high ωn values are found in the lf and lb quadrants whereas in the rf quadrant the wind seas are comparatively older this is because cp is directly proportional to hm0 as explained by zhang and oey 2019 and hm0 is low at lf and lb quadrants resulting in high ωn in the rf quadrant due to large hm0 slightly older waves are found fig 12 shows the variation of hm0 for different velocities of forward motion of cyclone figs 12a and b shows the distribution of wind speed and hm0 on 10 october at 12 h and 18 h respectively even though the maximum value of wind speed vmax observed here is almost the same the velocity of forward motion vfm of the cyclone differs similarly fig 12c and d show the wind speed and hm0 on 11 october at 00 h and 18 h where the values of vfm are 7 20 m s and 2 27 m s respectively here it can be seen that the wave field does not follow exactly the same distribution as the wind field for higher values of vfm fig 12a and c the contours of hm0 tend to sweep back behind the storm centre this is because when the propagation velocity of cyclone increases it exceeds the group velocity of the waves generated by the storm and these waves cannot keep pace with the storm whereas for lower values of vfm larger waves are seen on the right quadrant of the cyclone eye 4 summary and conclusion the evolution of the wave spectrum according to the changes in the wind system during a sea land breeze cycle is examined by focusing on the source terms involved the influence of sea breeze on waves can be observed as growth and decay of wave energy in the high frequency region of the spectrum with respect to the changes in the wind speed due to the sea land breeze cycle the various source terms examined during the sea land breeze cycle are found to be sensitive to the sea breeze intensity the wind input term is observed from the same direction of the wind west with its maximum magnitude during the time of sea breeze intensification the energy of the variance density spectrum also varies according to the sea breeze intensity and wind direction the energy from wind input is maximum at 12 h in the high frequency region but the variance density of wind sea peak reaches its maximum intensity at 15 h in the low frequency region this due to the effect of non linear interactions that distribute the energy gained from wind input between various frequency bins by enabling energy loss at higher frequency bins and gain at lower frequency bins in the region of high wind input the energy loss due to non linear interactions is also found to be high the influence of white capping observed is negligibly small in the evolution process the decrease in the magnitude of source terms at 25 m depth could be due to the decrease in the strength of sea breeze since sea breeze is a coastal phenomenon whose strength decreases offshore the evolution of wave spectrum during a tropical cyclone is studied using the wave data at gopalpur on the east coast of india during a tropical cyclone phailin the effect of the cyclone is identified as an increase in hm0 during the period the wave spectra observed during the tropical cyclone are single peaked with very high energy the directional wave spectra observed near the eye and north west east and south of the cyclone has two separate peaks representing swells and wind sea the wind sea direction aligns with the direction of cyclone wind and the energy is highest when the cyclone is near hm0 during the tropical cyclone is high in the right quadrant with respect to the cyclone heading direction where the wind speed is maximum waves generated due to tropical cyclones are young wind seas and the youngest of waves are found in the left front and left back quadrants the wave field generated by cyclone winds does not exactly follow the wind field but it also depends on the velocity of forward motion of the cyclone when the velocity of the forward motion of the cyclone is high the large waves tend to sweep back behind the storm centre as it cannot keep pace with the storm since the propagation velocity of the cyclone exceeds the group velocity of waves generated credit authorship contribution statement m anjali nair conceptualization formal analysis

21266,the current field induced by internal solitary wave could cause destruction to marine structures morison equation is widely used in estimating forces by internal solitary waves on cylinder structure zan and lin 2020 utilize numerical simulation to check the applicability of morison equation on force estimation by internal solitary wave on cylindrical structure and conclude that nonlinearity is important for the force estimation induced by internal solitary wave however wang et al 2019 analyze experimental data on pile sections and find that the original morison equation could fit measured forces reasonably well if local coefficients are used in this study numerical simulations are used to illustrate the significance of nonlinear acceleration terms and explain contradictions between these two studies the results show that nonlinear terms could not be neglected even if local coefficients are adopted and the significance of nonlinear contribution at different layers is exemplified the pros and cons of using local versus global coefficients are also discussed keywords internal solitary wave force morison equation cylinder 1 introduction internal solitary waves occur between two layers of fluids with different densities the wave induced velocity can induce destruction to marine engineering structures such as oil drilling rigs and pipelines it is imperative to estimate forces induced by internal solitary waves on marine structures during designing stage to minimize future economic loss and casualties morison equation which was originally posed to estimate force induced by unbroken surface waves on a cylindrical pile morison et al 1950 has been widely used to calculate forces by internal solitary waves in recent years the morison equation decomposes total force on a differential section of cylindrical pile into two components a virtual mass force proportional to the horizontal local acceleration and a drag force proportional to the square of the local velocity 1 d f ρ c m π d 2 4 u t ρ c d d 2 u u d z where ρ is the density of fluid d the diameter of cylinder u the horizontal velocity component c m and c d are the coefficients of inertial and drag components the total force exerted on structure can be calculated by integrating 1 along z axis this equation is expected to be valid if the diameter of pile d is much less than the wave length l d l 0 15 so incident wave field is not disturbed and the existence of pile can be neglected most previous studies utilized the coefficients determined by surface wave experiments and substituted the velocity field induced by internal solitary wave in morison equation to determine the forces various methods were used to derive velocity and acceleration field induced by internal solitary wave e g observation data and modal separation methods cai et al 2003 2006 2008 classical wave formulation such as korteweg de vries kdv equation or mcc theory xie et al 2010 si et al 2012 nonlinear numerical models xie et al 2011 lü et al 2016 the radon transform technique applied to radar images zha et al 2012 the forces on a vertical cylinder by internal solitary wave are analyzed in these papers however in recent years the scenarios for horizontal cylinder or complex cylindrical structures e g semi submersible platforms are also studied extensively chen et al 2017 2018 ding et al 2020a b in these studies the inertial and drag coefficients were generally set to constant values though there was no consensus on values these coefficients should be set to e g c m 2 0 c d 1 2 see cai et al 2003 2006 xie et al 2010 zha et al 2012 c m 1 8 c d 0 6 see cai et al 2008 xie et al 2011 c m 1 8 c d 0 8 see si et al 2012 lü et al 2016 chen et al 2017 2018 measured forces induced by internal solitary waves on different multi column floating platforms with laboratory experiments and obtained the empirical coefficients c m and c d as a function of keulegan carpenter number reynolds number and layer depth for internal solitary waves these studies indicate the empirical coefficients for internal solitary waves are quite different from those for surface waves however these coefficients are not universal and depend on model settings wang et al 2018 in all studies mentioned above original morison equation is used the differences among these studies lie in how velocity and local acceleration field are calculated and the choice of empirical coefficients the nonlinear acceleration terms are neglected in original morison equation this is plausible for small amplitude surface waves but this does not hold for internal solitary waves zan and lin 2020 studied the influence of nonlinear acceleration terms on force estimation by internal solitary wave the result indicated that only after nonlinear acceleration terms were reserved could morison equation predict the temporal evolution of forces by internal solitary waves reasonably well the modified morison equation which includes the total acceleration is suggested 2 d f ρ c m π d 2 4 d u d t ρ c d d 2 u u d z recently wang et al 2019 measured forces on different pile sections by internal solitary waves and suggested that different empirical coefficients should be used for the upper and lower layers as flow field exhibited distinct characteristics in different layers the morison equation with local coefficients or layer dependent coefficients determined by least squares method could fit measured forces well the original morison equation was used and nonlinear acceleration terms were neglected in this study this conclusion contradicts that arrived at by zan and lin 2020 which emphasized the significance of nonlinear acceleration terms in this study numerical simulation results are used to address this discrepancy e g whether the use of local empirical coefficients alleviates significance of nonlinear acceleration terms the pros and cons of local versus global coefficients are also briefly discussed the paper is organized as follows numerical configurations are given in section 2 in section 3 the influence of nonlinear acceleration terms on force estimation induced by internal solitary wave on selected pile sections is examined and their spatial characteristics are discussed in section 4 in section 5 the choice between local and global coefficients are discussed the major conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 numerical configurations the incompressible navier stokes equations with boussinesq approximation and the continuity equation are used to solve the problem in this

viscosity and diffusivity coefficients respectively which are primarily influenced by turbulent viscosity the k ω sst two equation closure model is adopted for turbulence computation in this study the coupled system of equations are solved with piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm which splits the discretization equations into an implicit predictor and multiple explicit corrector steps two sets of numerical simulations are used to analyze the influence of nonlinear terms the first set of simulations are three dimensional cylinder resolved high resolution computations which compute forces exerted on cylindrical pile directly by integrating pressure and viscous force the cylindrical pile is neglected in the second set of simulations and a two dimensional numerical study can be utilized the velocity data at cylinder location are then used to evaluate the forces with morison equation openfoam open source field operation and manipulation is used for computations in this study openfoam is an open source software for computational fluid dynamics which is a collection of applications built upon over 100 software libraries modules the solver buoyantboussinesqpimplefoam is used in this study which is based on boussinesq approximation for incompressible fluid the computation domain and initial configuration are shown in fig 1 the computational domain is a closed region of 10 m width 30 m length and of 5 m height a circular cylinder with 1 m diameter and 5 m height is placed in the center of domain for the first set of simulations the grid structure is shown in fig 2 the size of background mesh is homogeneous across the domain with side length equal to 0 1 m the grid is refined towards the cylinder and boundary layers are added close to the surface of cylinder the densities of upper and lower layer are initialized as 1000 kg m 3 and 1030 kg m 3 respectively the initial velocity field is set to zero and a density step h 1 m close to left boundary is used to trigger internal solitary wave this internal solitary wave generation method is easy to configure and widely used in laboratory and numerical experiments lin and song 2012 the simulations are integrated 50 s when the generated internal solitary wave has passed the location of cylinder the preconditioned bi conjugate gradient solver is adopted for velocity field iteration and preconditioned conjugate gradient solver is used for pressure field an adjustable time step strategy is used and the maximum courant number is restricted to below 0 25 to maintain the accuracy of numerical results the calculated forces on cylinder and the velocity field at cylinder location are saved at 0 1s interval no slip boundary conditions for velocity field are set for the closed wall and cylinder surface in the second set of numerical configurations the cylinder is neglected a homogeneous grid with side length of 0 1 m is used across the domain which is fine enough to resolve the internal solitary wave the velocity and acceleration field at cylinder location is used in the empirical equation to evaluate forces induced by the internal solitary wave on cylinder the forces on two pile sections are extensively analyzed in this study which are shown in fig 3 the first one locates in the upper layer and the second one locates at depth close to density interface the heights of both cylinder sections are 0 1 m the heights of center of gravity for these two cylinder sections are 4 45 m and 3 75 m respectively the amplitude of internal solitary wave generated is about 0 5 m which is approximately twice the distance between the second cylinder and initial still density interface 3 the influence of nonlinear acceleration terms in this section the temporal evolution of velocity and acceleration field at the two cylinder sections and the forces exerted on them are analyzed the inertial and drag coefficients are derived with least squares method the detail of which can be found in wang et al 2019 the significance of nonlinear acceleration terms and their influence on the coefficients are discussed the velocity fields at these two cylinder locations are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the maximum velocities at these two locations are comparative and the velocity field are not symmetric which are caused by gravity collapse mechanism lin and song 2012 the internal solitary wave generated is followed by small scale trailing waves the temporal evolution of local and total accelerations for these two cylinder sections cylinder 1 and 2 as shown in fig 3 are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively the contribution of each acceleration term is shown to better understand its contribution the component v u y is not included as internal solitary wave is assumed to propagate along x direction the velocity component v is constantly zero the total acceleration along x direction can be expressed as follows 6 d u d t u t u u x w u z the temporal evolution of acceleration components for cylinder 1 locating in the upper layer are shown in fig 5 the contribution of w u z is negligibly small the discrepancy between local and total acceleration is primarily caused by u u x term the contribution of which is relatively small compared to local acceleration term the temporal evolution of acceleration components for cylinder 2 locating close to density interface are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the acceleration components for cylinder 2 exhibit distinct characteristics from those for cylinder 1 the contribution of component u u x is relatively small similar to that for cylinder 1 however the contribution of component w u z is comparable to that of local acceleration and the overall temporal evolution of local and total accelerations deviate significantly from each other the velocity and acceleration field are then used in combination of the forces on respective pile section to derive the empirical coefficients for these two cylinder sections the original morison equation eq 1 and modified morison equation eq 2 which includes total acceleration term are used to study the influence of nonlinear acceleration terms on the empirical coefficients and estimated forces the empirical coefficients c m and c d are determined by least squares method the details of which can be found in wang et al 2019 the derived coefficients are then used in combination with velocity acceleration field and the corresponding morison equation to estimate the temporal evolution of forces on these two cylinder sections and the results are compared with true forces as shown in figs 7 and 8 the coefficients derived for the original and modified morison equations and the correlation coefficients between true forces and those estimated with respective morison equations are shown in table 1 from table 1 it can be seen that the choice of local versus total acceleration in morison equation has little impact on the values of drag coefficient c d whether the cylinder locates in the upper layer or close to density interface the choice of local versus total acceleration however could influence the values of c m significantly especially for cylinder 2 which locates close to density interface for cylinder 1 the inertial coefficient c m 1 461 derived for original morison equation is slightly smaller than that c m 1 718 for modified morison equation it can be seen from fig 7 that both original and modified morison equations could predict the evolution of forces reasonably well which consolidates the conclusion drawn by wang et al 2019 that with the local coefficients original morison equation could fit the temporal evolution of forces even if nonlinear acceleration terms are neglected this is plausible as the characteristics of local and total accelerations in the upper layer are similar as shown in fig 5 the smaller values of total accelerations are compensated by larger inertial coefficient c d constrained by least squares method furthermore it is apparent from fig 7 that the results derived by modified morison equation are slightly better than those estimated with original morison equation which are closer to true forces this can also be confirmed by the correlation coefficients between true force series and those derived with original and modified morison equations as shown in table 1 the correlation coefficient between true forces and those estimated with modified morison equation scenario is 0 994 while that for original morison equation is 0 975 it is also apparent that the maximum value for modified morison equation is closer to the realistic value than that for original morison equation the choice on the form of morison equation is more influential for cylinder 2 as is shown in table 1 and fig 8 the inertial coefficient for original morison equation c m 0 249 is quite smaller than that for modified morison equation c m 2 073 which can be anticipated by the large differences between local and total accelerations at this location as indicated in fig 6 the smaller amplitude of total acceleration is accompanied with larger inertial coefficient in modified morison equation it is interesting to note that the inertial coefficient c m 2 073 for modified morison equation is very close to the theoretical value 2 for irrotational accelerating flow past a stationary cylinder however this cannot be used as the criteria to judge modified morison equation is better as the flow field around cylinder is more complex for this scenario the temporal evolution of forces are calculated with the coefficients and their respective form of morison equation which are shown in fig 8 it is clear that the estimations by modified morison equation which takes nonlinear acceleration terms into account are significantly better than those by original morison equation the original morison equation fails to predict the secondary peak around 41 s which demonstrates the superiority of modified morison equation the maximum force around 30 s is also better predicted by modified morison equation the correlation coefficient between the force series derived by modified morison equation and true force series is 0 968 which is significantly better than that 0 821 for original morison equation it is interesting to note that there exists a local peak around 26 s the temporal evolution of the inertial and drag force components are calculated to further identify the reason for this phenomenon it is evident from fig 9 that the local peak around 26 s is induced by the combination of local peak in inertial force and the relatively mild increase of drag force this local peak is an artifact and introduced by the assumption of morison equation that the total force can be decomposed into two components from the above analysis it is evident that the modified morison equation with total acceleration term outperforms the original counterpart for cylinder 1 which locates far from density interface the neglect of nonlinear acceleration terms could be compensated by adjustment of empirical coefficients for cylinder 2 locating close to density interface certain feature e g the secondary force peak could not be predicted even qualitatively with original morison equation 4 the global characteristics of velocity and acceleration in the above section two cylinder sections at different locations are selected and performances of two forms of morison equation are analyzed for illustration the results indicate that the relative magnitude of nonlinear acceleration terms could influence the derived coefficients and the resulting accuracy of estimated forces the temporal and spatial distribution of velocity field and acceleration components are further analyzed in this section to understand their respective contribution at different depths the temporal and spatial distributions of horizontal and vertical velocity field are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the dashed line marks the moment when simulation time is 26 s further analysis on the data for this specific time will be shown later in this section to have an in depth understanding of the spatial distributions of corresponding physical quantities although the primary focus of this study is on the influence of nonlinear acceleration terms the analysis of velocity field is helpful as they are the key components of acceleration terms it can be seen from fig 10 that for depression internal solitary wave generated by gravity collapse the horizontal velocity in upper layer is positive and that in the lower is negative the magnitudes of velocity in the upper layer are larger than those in the lower layer as constrained by zero depth integrated flux and the relative smaller thickness of upper layer the vertical gradient of horizontal velocity u z is negligibly small except at depths close to density interface the local acceleration u t is expected to be prominent close to density interface and relatively small in the upper and lower layers the characteristics of horizontal gradient of horizontal velocity u x should resemble those for local acceleration as the internal solitary wave keeps its form as it propagates in the computational domain the vertical velocities w are also large near density interface and decrease as the distance increases from density interface as shown in fig 11 the three horizontal acceleration components and total acceleration in eq 6 at cylinder location are calculated and shown in fig 12 the extremums of acceleration components u t u u x and w u z locate along the density interface however the signs of nonlinear acceleration terms u u x and w u z at these locations are opposite of that for local acceleration the magnitude of acceleration component u u x is about one order of magnitude smaller than that for local acceleration therefore the contribution of this term to the discrepancy between local and total accelerations is relatively small the acceleration component w u z exhibits a distinct characteristic this acceleration component is only significant close to density interface when the internal solitary wave passes cylinder location which can be anticipated as the vertical gradient of horizontal velocity u z is almost zero in the domain except for regions close density interface the magnitude this acceleration component is comparable to that induced by local acceleration the total acceleration can be calculated by summing these three acceleration components with eq 6 the key differences between total and local accelerations are in the region close to density interface the magnitudes for total accelerations in this part are close to zero while those for local acceleration are close to their maximum four more cases are configured to investigate the influences of internal solitary wave amplitude and the thickness ratio between the upper and lower layers on the local and total acceleration patterns the amplitude of internal solitary wave generated by gravity collapse mechanism is determined by the initial step height h it can be seen from fig 13 that the magnitudes of local and total accelerations increase with wave amplitude and the general patterns of the acceleration distribution for these cases are similar the influence of thickness ratio between the upper and lower layers is shown in fig 14 from which it can be seen that for the same internal solitary wave amplitude the magnitudes of local and total accelerations increase with decreasing thickness ratios between the upper and lower layers for all these case studies it is evident that large discrepancies between the local and total accelerations exist along the density interface which further consolidates the conclusion in present study the horizontal velocity and acceleration component profiles at time 26 s are further analyzed to exemplify their spatial characteristics as shown in figs 15 and 16 the locations of two cylinder sections studied previously are marked with dash dotted lines the velocity is almost constant in the upper and lower layers respectively and a sharp gradient exists close to density interface the magnitude of average horizontal velocity in the upper layer is about three times that of lower layer as the thickness of lower layer is approximately three times that of upper layer from fig 16 it can be seen that the discrepancies between local and total accelerations are strongly dependent on the spatial locations in lower layer the difference between these two accelerations is quite small in upper layer the discrepancy is apparently discernible and huge disparity can be found close to layer interface this characteristics could be explained with the spatial distributions of nonlinear acceleration components u u x and w u z the magnitude of w u z is comparable to that of local acceleration close density interface and is close to zero in upper and lower layers except for the uppermost boundary layer where large vertical gradient of horizontal velocity exists as no slip boundary condition is applied at the top boundary the spatial distribution of nonlinear acceleration component u u x could be better understood if it is expressed as 1 2 u 2 x the magnitudes of horizontal velocity squared u 2 in lower layer are about one order of magnitude smaller than those in upper layers the magnitudes of horizontal velocity outside regions of internal solitary wave are close to zero therefore the magnitudes of acceleration component u u x in lower layer are approximately one order smaller than those in upper layer as shown in fig 16 from the acceleration component profiles shown in fig 16 it seems that the local acceleration u t is dominating among whole depth the component w u z counteracts a majority of local acceleration close density interface and the contribution of component u u x is relatively small which could even be neglected for lower layer without introducing much error this is true for the local analysis but a totally different conclusion can be drawn when their accumulation effects are taken into account the temporal evolution of depth integration of these acceleration components are calculated and shown in fig 17 it can be seen that the integration of local acceleration is constantly zero which indicates that the inertial term has no net contribution to integrated force on cylinder if original morison equation is employed and a global empirical inertial coefficient is assumed cai et al 2003 zan and lin 2020 it is also interesting to note that although the acceleration component u u x exhibits a distinct characteristic from component w u z the depth integration of these two acceleration components are exactly the same which can be observed in fig 17 and be mathematically confirmed zan and lin 2020 the depth integration of total acceleration eq 6 can therefore be expressed as two times the depth integration of acceleration component u u x or w u z 7 0 h d u d t d z 0 h u u x w u z d z 2 0 h u u x d z 2 0 h w u z d z from the above analysis it can be seen that although different configurations are used in this study from those by wang et al 2019 the key points in previous study are successfully reproduced and confirmed for cylinder 1 case i e the forces predicted with original morison equation could fit the temporal evolution of forces if local empirical coefficients are used and determined by least squares method wang et al 2019 further analyzed two more cylinder sections locating in lower layers and found that the coefficients were almost the same at different depths in the same layer which could also be confirmed in this study as the vertical gradient of horizontal velocity is very small in upper or lower layer respectively although the original morison equation could fit the temporal evolution of forces reasonably well with coefficients derived with least squares method abnormal values of empirical coefficients were spotted by wang et al 2019 in this study the same scenarios are observed e g unreasonably small value for inertial coefficient c m 0 249 is derived for cylinder 2 if original morison equation is used if the modified morison equation is employed for coefficients derivation and force estimation the empirical coefficients are within normal range and the forces predicted with modified morison equation are more closer to true forces than those with original morison equation which can be discerned from figs 7 and 8 and also from correlation coefficients as shown in table 1 as a brief summary the good performances of original morison equation in wang et al 2019 are primarily because the cylinder sections selected are relatively far from density interface one section in upper layer and two in lower layer where the effects of nonlinear acceleration terms can be neglected for the sections in upper and lower layers the good correlations between measured forces and those estimated from original morison equation are attributed to different reasons for the sections in lower layer the magnitudes of nonlinear acceleration terms are negligibly small which is similar to the case of small amplitude surface waves while for the sections in upper layer the omissions of nonlinear acceleration terms are compensated by adjustment of empirical coefficients which is constrained by least squares methods the advantage of modified morison equation is not only for its better estimation of the temporal evolution of forces as quantified by correlation coefficients but also for the range of coefficients derived and the physically soundness 5 local versus global coefficients in previous studies global coefficients or depth independent coefficients for c m and c d are assumed in morison equation to calculate forces by flow field induced by surface wave or internal solitary wave wang et al 2019 analyzed the measured forces by internal solitary wave on three cylinder sections from laboratory experiments and suggested different coefficients for the sections in different layers as distinct velocity field exist among these layers this recommendation seems intuitive and necessary as large discrepancy exists for the coefficients derived for cylinder sections at different layers wang et al 2019 which can also be confirmed for the present study if original morison equation is used in the above section it is shown that modified morison equation which takes nonlinear acceleration terms into account is physically sound and outperforms original morison equation it is interesting to note that the discrepancies of empirical coefficients become smaller if modified morison equation is employed e g the inertial coefficient for cylinder 1 c m 1 461 is about one order of magnitude larger than that for cylinder 2 c m 0 249 if original morison equation is used while these coefficients are comparable c m 1 718 for cylinder 1 c m 2 073 for cylinder 2 for modified morison equation the inertial coefficients for modified morison equation are also closer to theoretical value for irrotational accelerating flow past a stationary cylinder and the global inertial coefficient c m 1 947 derived by zan and lin 2020 it is therefore appealing to reevaluate the necessity of local coefficients for different layers if modified morison equation is used the global coefficients derived by zan and lin 2020 are used here for comparison it should be noted that a different method for coefficients derivation was used in that study the empirical coefficients were inferred from forces at two specific times e g the moments of maximum and minimum forces one more set of global coefficients is further derived here with least squares methods to check the sensitivity of methods on the estimation of forces zan and lin 2020 showed that the temporal evolution of forces on the whole cylinder could be estimated reasonably well with depth independent empirical coefficients if modified morison equation was used in this section the forces predicted by global coefficients with modified morison equation on selected cylinder sections are compared with those estimated by local coefficients the empirical coefficients for modified morison equation and the correlation coefficients between true forces with those predicted for these configurations are shown in tables 2 and 3 the temporal evolution of estimated forces are shown in figs 18 and 19 for the two cylinder sections analyzed above from tables 2 and 3 it can be seen that the influence of coefficients determination method is very small if global coefficients are assumed this can be also confirmed from the temporal evolution of forces in figs 18 and 19 for cylinder 2 locating close to density interface the local coefficients are very close to global counterparts table 3 the forces predicted by modified morison equation with different sets of coefficients are very similar as shown in fig 19 for cylinder 1 it is evident that the forces predicted with local coefficients are closer to true forces than those predicted with global coefficients which is induced by the smaller local coefficients than global counterparts as can be seen in table 2 this partially supports that different empirical coefficients should be chosen for cylinder sections in different layers as the characteristics of flow field are distinct wang et al 2019 however this does not mean local coefficients are necessary for this scenario the use of local coefficients or layer dependent coefficients introduces more empirical parameters which could undoubtedly results in better fitting between the estimated and true forces moreover perfect agreements between the estimated and true forces can be achieved if the empirical coefficients are further assumed to be time dependent this is also plausible as the flow field characteristics of each layer are different at different moments however this approach should not be adopted as complex empirical coefficients are detrimental to their generality in unseen scenarios some discrepancies between predicted forces by morison equation and true forces are expected for the assumptions made in the derivation of morison equation e g the decomposition of inertial and drag terms the neglect of disturbances of velocity field by the existence of cylinder some terminologies from machine learning one hot research field nowadays are used to further exemplify this topic some experimental studies have been carried out recently to determine the empirical coefficients in morison equation for internal solitary wave chen et al 2017 2018 wang et al 2019 the measured forces and corresponding velocity fields in these studies can be termed training examples which can be used to determine the coefficients in morison equation the performance of morison equation with the derived coefficients can be partially evaluated by comparison with measured forces having a good performance measure on the training data is good but insufficient as the true goal is to predict well on new instances or the system needs to be able to make good predictions for examples it has never seen before introducing more parameters or more complex models could improve the agreements between model predictions and training examples but at the risk of overfitting which means that the model captures the patterns in training data well but fail to generalize well to unseen data the predictions with local coefficients seem better here as the exactly same training examples are used to derive the coefficients and evaluate the performance while global coefficients are inferred from the depth integrated forces and evaluated for one specific section in other words the training examples and test examples are different which is more reliable although its performance is not as good as that for local coefficients more measured data and numerical results are required to further evaluate the appropriate number of empirical parameters 6 conclusions the current field induced by internal solitary wave can cause significant destruction to marine structures it is therefore imperative to estimate forces induced by internal solitary wave on offshore structures during designing stage however there is no scientific consensus regarding the form of empirical formula that should be used to estimate these forces wang et al 2019 analyzed experimental data on pile sections and found that the original morison equation could fit measured forces reasonably well if local coefficients are used as supported by the fact that flow characteristics are distinct among different layers zan and lin 2020 utilized numerical simulation to check the applicability of morison equation on force estimation by internal solitary wave on cylindrical structures and concluded that nonlinear acceleration terms must be reserved to estimate the forces correctly in this study numerical simulations are used to settle the contradictions between these studies the numerical results at two specific locations are analyzed to study the influences of adopting local versus global empirical parameters and reserving nonlinear acceleration terms or not on the predictability of morison equation the results indicate that for the case of estimating forces by depression internal solitary wave on circular cylinder nonlinear acceleration terms should be not be neglected the significances of which depend on the location of cylinder sections more specifically for cylinder sections in the lower layer the differences of empirical coefficients derived and estimated forces by these two forms of morison equation are marginal this is due to the fact that nonlinear acceleration terms are quite small in the lower layer for this scenario for the cylinder sections in upper layer the estimated forces by morison equation with local coefficients could fit true forces well even if nonlinear acceleration terms are neglected which can be explained by the fact that empirical coefficients are adjusted as constrained by least squares method after modified morison equation is employed which takes nonlinear acceleration into accounts the empirical coefficients are within normal ranges and forces predicted are closer to true forces lastly for cylinder sections close to density interface where nonlinear acceleration terms are significant the results show that only if nonlinear acceleration terms are reserved can the forces estimated by morison equation agree with true forces the fairly good performance of original morison equation with local coefficients in wang et al 2019 could be reproduced and explained in this study as these three sections selected are not close to density interface the performances of modified morison equation with local versus global empirical coefficients on two selected cylinder sections are compared it is shown that the forces estimated by modified morison equation with local coefficients are better than those with global coefficients although they both predict the general trend of forces reasonably well however this does not mean local coefficients or layer dependent coefficients are preferred on the one hand some discrepancies between the estimated and true forces are expected as some assumptions used in morison equation on the other hand introducing more parameters are believed to improve the performance of empirical formula on available data set but at the risk of overfitting meaning that the empirical equation captures the patterns in available data well but fail to generalize well to unseen data more data via laboratory experiments and numerical simulations are required to further evaluate the appropriate number of empirical parameters or the complexity of morison equation finally it is suggested that nonlinear acceleration terms should be reserved in morison equation in future studies when it is applied for the case of internal solitary wave because it is physically sound and demonstrates superior

21266,the current field induced by internal solitary wave could cause destruction to marine structures morison equation is widely used in estimating forces by internal solitary waves on cylinder structure zan and lin 2020 utilize numerical simulation to check the applicability of morison equation on force estimation by internal solitary wave on cylindrical structure and conclude that nonlinearity is important for the force estimation induced by internal solitary wave however wang et al 2019 analyze experimental data on pile sections and find that the original morison equation could fit measured forces reasonably well if local coefficients are used in this study numerical simulations are used to illustrate the significance of nonlinear acceleration terms and explain contradictions between these two studies the results show that nonlinear terms could not be neglected even if local coefficients are adopted and the significance of nonlinear contribution at different layers is exemplified the pros and cons of using local versus global coefficients are also discussed keywords internal solitary wave force morison equation cylinder 1 introduction internal solitary waves occur between two layers of fluids with different densities the wave induced velocity can induce destruction to marine engineering structures such as oil drilling rigs and pipelines it is imperative to estimate forces induced by internal solitary waves on marine structures during designing stage to minimize future economic loss and casualties morison equation which was originally posed to estimate force induced by unbroken surface waves on a cylindrical pile morison et al 1950 has been widely used to calculate forces by internal solitary waves in recent years the morison equation decomposes total force on a differential section of cylindrical pile into two components a virtual mass force proportional to the horizontal local acceleration and a drag force proportional to the square of the local velocity 1 d f ρ c m π d 2 4 u t ρ c d d 2 u u d z where ρ is the density of fluid d the diameter of cylinder u the horizontal velocity component c m and c d are the coefficients of inertial and drag components the total force exerted on structure can be calculated by integrating 1 along z axis this equation is expected to be valid if the diameter of pile d is much less than the wave length l d l 0 15 so incident wave field is not disturbed and the existence of pile can be neglected most previous studies utilized the coefficients determined by surface wave experiments and substituted the velocity field induced by internal solitary wave in morison equation to determine the forces various methods were used to derive velocity and acceleration field induced by internal solitary wave e g observation data and modal separation methods cai et al 2003 2006 2008 classical wave formulation such as korteweg de vries kdv equation or mcc theory xie et al 2010 si et al 2012 nonlinear numerical models xie et al 2011 lü et al 2016 the radon transform technique applied to radar images zha et al 2012 the forces on a vertical cylinder by internal solitary wave are analyzed in these papers however in recent years the scenarios for horizontal cylinder or complex cylindrical structures e g semi submersible platforms are also studied extensively chen et al 2017 2018 ding et al 2020a b in these studies the inertial and drag coefficients were generally set to constant values though there was no consensus on values these coefficients should be set to e g c m 2 0 c d 1 2 see

internal solitary waves on different multi column floating platforms with laboratory experiments and obtained the empirical coefficients c m and c d as a function of keulegan carpenter number reynolds number and layer depth for internal solitary waves these studies indicate the empirical coefficients for internal solitary waves are quite different from those for surface waves however these coefficients are not universal and depend on model settings wang et al 2018 in all studies mentioned above original morison equation is used the differences among these studies lie in how velocity and local acceleration field are calculated and the choice of empirical coefficients the nonlinear acceleration terms are neglected in original morison equation this is plausible for small amplitude surface waves but this does not hold for internal solitary waves zan and lin 2020 studied the influence of nonlinear acceleration terms on force estimation by internal solitary wave the result indicated that only after nonlinear acceleration terms were reserved could morison equation predict the temporal evolution of forces by internal solitary waves reasonably well the modified morison equation which includes the total acceleration is suggested 2 d f ρ c m π d 2 4 d u d t ρ c d d 2 u u d z recently wang et al 2019 measured forces on different pile sections by internal solitary waves and suggested that different empirical coefficients should be used for the upper and lower layers as flow field exhibited distinct characteristics in different layers the morison equation with local coefficients or layer dependent coefficients determined by least squares method could fit measured forces well the original morison equation was used and nonlinear acceleration terms were neglected in this study this conclusion contradicts that arrived at by zan and lin 2020 which emphasized the significance of nonlinear acceleration terms in this study numerical simulation results are used to address this discrepancy e g whether the use of local empirical coefficients alleviates significance of nonlinear acceleration terms the pros and cons of local versus global coefficients are also briefly discussed the paper is organized as follows numerical configurations are given in section 2 in section 3 the influence of nonlinear acceleration terms on force estimation induced by internal solitary wave on selected pile sections is examined and their spatial characteristics are discussed in section 4 in section 5 the choice between local and global coefficients are discussed the major conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 numerical configurations the incompressible navier stokes equations with boussinesq approximation and the continuity equation are used to solve the problem in this

viscosity and diffusivity coefficients respectively which are primarily influenced by turbulent viscosity the k ω sst two equation closure model is adopted for turbulence computation in this study the coupled system of equations are solved with piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm which splits the discretization equations into an implicit predictor and multiple explicit corrector steps two sets of numerical simulations are used to analyze the influence of nonlinear terms the first set of simulations are three dimensional cylinder resolved high resolution computations which compute forces exerted on cylindrical pile directly by integrating pressure and viscous force the cylindrical pile is neglected in the second set of simulations and a two dimensional numerical study can be utilized the velocity data at cylinder location are then used to evaluate the forces with morison equation openfoam open source field operation and manipulation is used for computations in this study openfoam is an open source software for computational fluid dynamics which is a collection of applications built upon over 100 software libraries modules the solver buoyantboussinesqpimplefoam is used in this study which is based on boussinesq approximation for incompressible fluid the computation domain and initial configuration are shown in fig 1 the computational domain is a closed region of 10 m width 30 m length and of 5 m height a circular cylinder with 1 m diameter and 5 m height is placed in the center of domain for the first set of simulations the grid structure is shown in fig 2 the size of background mesh is homogeneous across the domain with side length equal to 0 1 m the grid is refined towards the cylinder and boundary layers are added close to the surface of cylinder the densities of upper and lower layer are initialized as 1000 kg m 3 and 1030 kg m 3 respectively the initial velocity field is set to zero and a density step h 1 m close to left boundary is used to trigger internal solitary wave this internal solitary wave generation method is easy to configure and widely used in laboratory and numerical experiments lin and song 2012 the simulations are integrated 50 s when the generated internal solitary wave has passed the location of cylinder the preconditioned bi conjugate gradient solver is adopted for velocity field iteration and preconditioned conjugate gradient solver is used for pressure field an adjustable time step strategy is used and the maximum courant number is restricted to below 0 25 to maintain the accuracy of numerical results the calculated forces on cylinder and the velocity field at cylinder location are saved at 0 1s interval no slip boundary conditions for velocity field are set for the closed wall and cylinder surface in the second set of numerical configurations the cylinder is neglected a homogeneous grid with side length of 0 1 m is used across the domain which is fine enough to resolve the internal solitary wave the velocity and acceleration field at cylinder location is used in the empirical equation to evaluate forces induced by the internal solitary wave on cylinder the forces on two pile sections are extensively analyzed in this study which are shown in fig 3 the first one locates in the upper layer and the second one locates at depth close to density interface the heights of both cylinder sections are 0 1 m the heights of center of gravity for these two cylinder sections are 4 45 m and 3 75 m respectively the amplitude of internal solitary wave generated is about 0 5 m which is approximately twice the distance between the second cylinder and initial still density interface 3 the influence of nonlinear acceleration terms in this section the temporal evolution of velocity and acceleration field at the two cylinder sections and the forces exerted on them are analyzed the inertial and drag coefficients are derived with least squares method the detail of which can be found in wang et al 2019 the significance of nonlinear acceleration terms and their influence on the coefficients are discussed the velocity fields at these two cylinder locations are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the maximum velocities at these two locations are comparative and the velocity field are not symmetric which are caused by gravity collapse mechanism lin and song 2012 the internal solitary wave generated is followed by small scale trailing waves the temporal evolution of local and total accelerations for these two cylinder sections cylinder 1 and 2 as shown in fig 3 are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively the contribution of each acceleration term is shown to better understand its contribution the component v u y is not included as internal solitary wave is assumed to propagate along x direction the velocity component v is constantly zero the total acceleration along x direction can be expressed as follows 6 d u d t u t u u x w u z the temporal evolution of acceleration components for cylinder 1 locating in the upper layer are shown in fig 5 the contribution of w u z is negligibly small the discrepancy between local and total acceleration is primarily caused by u u x term the contribution of which is relatively small compared to local acceleration term the temporal evolution of acceleration components for cylinder 2 locating close to density interface are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the acceleration components for cylinder 2 exhibit distinct characteristics from those for cylinder 1 the contribution of component u u x is relatively small similar to that for cylinder 1 however the contribution of component w u z is comparable to that of local acceleration and the overall temporal evolution of local and total accelerations deviate significantly from each other the velocity and acceleration field are then used in combination of the forces on respective pile section to derive the empirical coefficients for these two cylinder sections the original morison equation eq 1 and modified morison equation eq 2 which includes total acceleration term are used to study the influence of nonlinear acceleration terms on the empirical coefficients and estimated forces the empirical coefficients c m and c d are determined by least squares method the details of which can be found in wang et al 2019 the derived coefficients are then used in combination with velocity acceleration field and the corresponding morison equation to estimate the temporal evolution of forces on these two cylinder sections and the results are compared with true forces as shown in figs 7 and 8 the coefficients derived for the original and modified morison equations and the correlation coefficients between true forces and those estimated with respective morison equations are shown in table 1 from table 1 it can be seen that the choice of local versus total acceleration in morison equation has little impact on the values of drag coefficient c d whether the cylinder locates in the upper layer or close to density interface the choice of local versus total acceleration however could influence the values of c m significantly especially for cylinder 2 which locates close to density interface for cylinder 1 the inertial coefficient c m 1 461 derived for original morison equation is slightly smaller than that c m 1 718 for modified morison equation it can be seen from fig 7 that both original and modified morison equations could predict the evolution of forces reasonably well which consolidates the conclusion drawn by wang et al 2019 that with the local coefficients original morison equation could fit the temporal evolution of forces even if nonlinear acceleration terms are neglected this is plausible as the characteristics of local and total accelerations in the upper layer are similar as shown in fig 5 the smaller values of total accelerations are compensated by larger inertial coefficient c d constrained by least squares method furthermore it is apparent from fig 7 that the results derived by modified morison equation are slightly better than those estimated with original morison equation which are closer to true forces this can also be confirmed by the correlation coefficients between true force series and those derived with original and modified morison equations as shown in table 1 the correlation coefficient between true forces and those estimated with modified morison equation scenario is 0 994 while that for original morison equation is 0 975 it is also apparent that the maximum value for modified morison equation is closer to the realistic value than that for original morison equation the choice on the form of morison equation is more influential for cylinder 2 as is shown in table 1 and fig 8 the inertial coefficient for original morison equation c m 0 249 is quite smaller than that for modified morison equation c m 2 073 which can be anticipated by the large differences between local and total accelerations at this location as indicated in fig 6 the smaller amplitude of total acceleration is accompanied with larger inertial coefficient in modified morison equation it is interesting to note that the inertial coefficient c m 2 073 for modified morison equation is very close to the theoretical value 2 for irrotational accelerating flow past a stationary cylinder however this cannot be used as the criteria to judge modified morison equation is better as the flow field around cylinder is more complex for this scenario the temporal evolution of forces are calculated with the coefficients and their respective form of morison equation which are shown in fig 8 it is clear that the estimations by modified morison equation which takes nonlinear acceleration terms into account are significantly better than those by original morison equation the original morison equation fails to predict the secondary peak around 41 s which demonstrates the superiority of modified morison equation the maximum force around 30 s is also better predicted by modified morison equation the correlation coefficient between the force series derived by modified morison equation and true force series is 0 968 which is significantly better than that 0 821 for original morison equation it is interesting to note that there exists a local peak around 26 s the temporal evolution of the inertial and drag force components are calculated to further identify the reason for this phenomenon it is evident from fig 9 that the local peak around 26 s is induced by the combination of local peak in inertial force and the relatively mild increase of drag force this local peak is an artifact and introduced by the assumption of morison equation that the total force can be decomposed into two components from the above analysis it is evident that the modified morison equation with total acceleration term outperforms the original counterpart for cylinder 1 which locates far from density interface the neglect of nonlinear acceleration terms could be compensated by adjustment of empirical coefficients for cylinder 2 locating close to density interface certain feature e g the secondary force peak could not be predicted even qualitatively with original morison equation 4 the global characteristics of velocity and acceleration in the above section two cylinder sections at different locations are selected and performances of two forms of morison equation are analyzed for illustration the results indicate that the relative magnitude of nonlinear acceleration terms could influence the derived coefficients and the resulting accuracy of estimated forces the temporal and spatial distribution of velocity field and acceleration components are further analyzed in this section to understand their respective contribution at different depths the temporal and spatial distributions of horizontal and vertical velocity field are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the dashed line marks the moment when simulation time is 26 s further analysis on the data for this specific time will be shown later in this section to have an in depth understanding of the spatial distributions of corresponding physical quantities although the primary focus of this study is on the influence of nonlinear acceleration terms the analysis of velocity field is helpful as they are the key components of acceleration terms it can be seen from fig 10 that for depression internal solitary wave generated by gravity collapse the horizontal velocity in upper layer is positive and that in the lower is negative the magnitudes of velocity in the upper layer are larger than those in the lower layer as constrained by zero depth integrated flux and the relative smaller thickness of upper layer the vertical gradient of horizontal velocity u z is negligibly small except at depths close to density interface the local acceleration u t is expected to be prominent close to density interface and relatively small in the upper and lower layers the characteristics of horizontal gradient of horizontal velocity u x should resemble those for local acceleration as the internal solitary wave keeps its form as it propagates in the computational domain the vertical velocities w are also large near density interface and decrease as the distance increases from density interface as shown in fig 11 the three horizontal acceleration components and total acceleration in eq 6 at cylinder location are calculated and shown in fig 12 the extremums of acceleration components u t u u x and w u z locate along the density interface however the signs of nonlinear acceleration terms u u x and w u z at these locations are opposite of that for local acceleration the magnitude of acceleration component u u x is about one order of magnitude smaller than that for local acceleration therefore the contribution of this term to the discrepancy between local and total accelerations is relatively small the acceleration component w u z exhibits a distinct characteristic this acceleration component is only significant close to density interface when the internal solitary wave passes cylinder location which can be anticipated as the vertical gradient of horizontal velocity u z is almost zero in the domain except for regions close density interface the magnitude this acceleration component is comparable to that induced by local acceleration the total acceleration can be calculated by summing these three acceleration components with eq 6 the key differences between total and local accelerations are in the region close to density interface the magnitudes for total accelerations in this part are close to zero while those for local acceleration are close to their maximum four more cases are configured to investigate the influences of internal solitary wave amplitude and the thickness ratio between the upper and lower layers on the local and total acceleration patterns the amplitude of internal solitary wave generated by gravity collapse mechanism is determined by the initial step height h it can be seen from fig 13 that the magnitudes of local and total accelerations increase with wave amplitude and the general patterns of the acceleration distribution for these cases are similar the influence of thickness ratio between the upper and lower layers is shown in fig 14 from which it can be seen that for the same internal solitary wave amplitude the magnitudes of local and total accelerations increase with decreasing thickness ratios between the upper and lower layers for all these case studies it is evident that large discrepancies between the local and total accelerations exist along the density interface which further consolidates the conclusion in present study the horizontal velocity and acceleration component profiles at time 26 s are further analyzed to exemplify their spatial characteristics as shown in figs 15 and 16 the locations of two cylinder sections studied previously are marked with dash dotted lines the velocity is almost constant in the upper and lower layers respectively and a sharp gradient exists close to density interface the magnitude of average horizontal velocity in the upper layer is about three times that of lower layer as the thickness of lower layer is approximately three times that of upper layer from fig 16 it can be seen that the discrepancies between local and total accelerations are strongly dependent on the spatial locations in lower layer the difference between these two accelerations is quite small in upper layer the discrepancy is apparently discernible and huge disparity can be found close to layer interface this characteristics could be explained with the spatial distributions of nonlinear acceleration components u u x and w u z the magnitude of w u z is comparable to that of local acceleration close density interface and is close to zero in upper and lower layers except for the uppermost boundary layer where large vertical gradient of horizontal velocity exists as no slip boundary condition is applied at the top boundary the spatial distribution of nonlinear acceleration component u u x could be better understood if it is expressed as 1 2 u 2 x the magnitudes of horizontal velocity squared u 2 in lower layer are about one order of magnitude smaller than those in upper layers the magnitudes of horizontal velocity outside regions of internal solitary wave are close to zero therefore the magnitudes of acceleration component u u x in lower layer are approximately one order smaller than those in upper layer as shown in fig 16 from the acceleration component profiles shown in fig 16 it seems that the local acceleration u t is dominating among whole depth the component w u z counteracts a majority of local acceleration close density interface and the contribution of component u u x is relatively small which could even be neglected for lower layer without introducing much error this is true for the local analysis but a totally different conclusion can be drawn when their accumulation effects are taken into account the temporal evolution of depth integration of these acceleration components are calculated and shown in fig 17 it can be seen that the integration of local acceleration is constantly zero which indicates that the inertial term has no net contribution to integrated force on cylinder if original morison equation is employed and a global empirical inertial coefficient is assumed cai et al 2003 zan and lin 2020 it is also interesting to note that although the acceleration component u u x exhibits a distinct characteristic from component w u z the depth integration of these two acceleration components are exactly the same which can be observed in fig 17 and be mathematically confirmed zan and lin 2020 the depth integration of total acceleration eq 6 can therefore be expressed as two times the depth integration of acceleration component u u x or w u z 7 0 h d u d t d z 0 h u u x w u z d z 2 0 h u u x d z 2 0 h w u z d z from the above analysis it can be seen that although different configurations are used in this study from those by wang et al 2019 the key points in previous study are successfully reproduced and confirmed for cylinder 1 case i e the forces predicted with original morison equation could fit the temporal evolution of forces if local empirical coefficients are used and determined by least squares method wang et al 2019 further analyzed two more cylinder sections locating in lower layers and found that the coefficients were almost the same at different depths in the same layer which could also be confirmed in this study as the vertical gradient of horizontal velocity is very small in upper or lower layer respectively although the original morison equation could fit the temporal evolution of forces reasonably well with coefficients derived with least squares method abnormal values of empirical coefficients were spotted by wang et al 2019 in this study the same scenarios are observed e g unreasonably small value for inertial coefficient c m 0 249 is derived for cylinder 2 if original morison equation is used if the modified morison equation is employed for coefficients derivation and force estimation the empirical coefficients are within normal range and the forces predicted with modified morison equation are more closer to true forces than those with original morison equation which can be discerned from figs 7 and 8 and also from correlation coefficients as shown in table 1 as a brief summary the good performances of original morison equation in wang et al 2019 are primarily because the cylinder sections selected are relatively far from density interface one section in upper layer and two in lower layer where the effects of nonlinear acceleration terms can be neglected for the sections in upper and lower layers the good correlations between measured forces and those estimated from original morison equation are attributed to different reasons for the sections in lower layer the magnitudes of nonlinear acceleration terms are negligibly small which is similar to the case of small amplitude surface waves while for the sections in upper layer the omissions of nonlinear acceleration terms are compensated by adjustment of empirical coefficients which is constrained by least squares methods the advantage of modified morison equation is not only for its better estimation of the temporal evolution of forces as quantified by correlation coefficients but also for the range of coefficients derived and the physically soundness 5 local versus global coefficients in previous studies global coefficients or depth independent coefficients for c m and c d are assumed in morison equation to calculate forces by flow field induced by surface wave or internal solitary wave wang et al 2019 analyzed the measured forces by internal solitary wave on three cylinder sections from laboratory experiments and suggested different coefficients for the sections in different layers as distinct velocity field exist among these layers this recommendation seems intuitive and necessary as large discrepancy exists for the coefficients derived for cylinder sections at different layers wang et al 2019 which can also be confirmed for the present study if original morison equation is used in the above section it is shown that modified morison equation which takes nonlinear acceleration terms into account is physically sound and outperforms original morison equation it is interesting to note that the discrepancies of empirical coefficients become smaller if modified morison equation is employed e g the inertial coefficient for cylinder 1 c m 1 461 is about one order of magnitude larger than that for cylinder 2 c m 0 249 if original morison equation is used while these coefficients are comparable c m 1 718 for cylinder 1 c m 2 073 for cylinder 2 for modified morison equation the inertial coefficients for modified morison equation are also closer to theoretical value for irrotational accelerating flow past a stationary cylinder and the global inertial coefficient c m 1 947 derived by zan and lin 2020 it is therefore appealing to reevaluate the necessity of local coefficients for different layers if modified morison equation is used the global coefficients derived by zan and lin 2020 are used here for comparison it should be noted that a different method for coefficients derivation was used in that study the empirical coefficients were inferred from forces at two specific times e g the moments of maximum and minimum forces one more set of global coefficients is further derived here with least squares methods to check the sensitivity of methods on the estimation of forces zan and lin 2020 showed that the temporal evolution of forces on the whole cylinder could be estimated reasonably well with depth independent empirical coefficients if modified morison equation was used in this section the forces predicted by global coefficients with modified morison equation on selected cylinder sections are compared with those estimated by local coefficients the empirical coefficients for modified morison equation and the correlation coefficients between true forces with those predicted for these configurations are shown in tables 2 and 3 the temporal evolution of estimated forces are shown in figs 18 and 19 for the two cylinder sections analyzed above from tables 2 and 3 it can be seen that the influence of coefficients determination method is very small if global coefficients are assumed this can be also confirmed from the temporal evolution of forces in figs 18 and 19 for cylinder 2 locating close to density interface the local coefficients are very close to global counterparts table 3 the forces predicted by modified morison equation with different sets of coefficients are very similar as shown in fig 19 for cylinder 1 it is evident that the forces predicted with local coefficients are closer to true forces than those predicted with global coefficients which is induced by the smaller local coefficients than global counterparts as can be seen in table 2 this partially supports that different empirical coefficients should be chosen for cylinder sections in different layers as the characteristics of flow field are distinct wang et al 2019 however this does not mean local coefficients are necessary for this scenario the use of local coefficients or layer dependent coefficients introduces more empirical parameters which could undoubtedly results in better fitting between the estimated and true forces moreover perfect agreements between the estimated and true forces can be achieved if the empirical coefficients are further assumed to be time dependent this is also plausible as the flow field characteristics of each layer are different at different moments however this approach should not be adopted as complex empirical coefficients are detrimental to their generality in unseen scenarios some discrepancies between predicted forces by morison equation and true forces are expected for the assumptions made in the derivation of morison equation e g the decomposition of inertial and drag terms the neglect of disturbances of velocity field by the existence of cylinder some terminologies from machine learning one hot research field nowadays are used to further exemplify this topic some experimental studies have been carried out recently to determine the empirical coefficients in morison equation for internal solitary wave chen et al 2017 2018 wang et al 2019 the measured forces and corresponding velocity fields in these studies can be termed training examples which can be used to determine the coefficients in morison equation the performance of morison equation with the derived coefficients can be partially evaluated by comparison with measured forces having a good performance measure on the training data is good but insufficient as the true goal is to predict well on new instances or the system needs to be able to make good predictions for examples it has never seen before introducing more parameters or more complex models could improve the agreements between model predictions and training examples but at the risk of overfitting which means that the model captures the patterns in training data well but fail to generalize well to unseen data the predictions with local coefficients seem better here as the exactly same training examples are used to derive the coefficients and evaluate the performance while global coefficients are inferred from the depth integrated forces and evaluated for one specific section in other words the training examples and test examples are different which is more reliable although its performance is not as good as that for local coefficients more measured data and numerical results are required to further evaluate the appropriate number of empirical parameters 6 conclusions the current field induced by internal solitary wave can cause significant destruction to marine structures it is therefore imperative to estimate forces induced by internal solitary wave on offshore structures during designing stage however there is no scientific consensus regarding the form of empirical formula that should be used to estimate these forces wang et al 2019 analyzed experimental data on pile sections and found that the original morison equation could fit measured forces reasonably well if local coefficients are used as supported by the fact that flow characteristics are distinct among different layers zan and lin 2020 utilized numerical simulation to check the applicability of morison equation on force estimation by internal solitary wave on cylindrical structures and concluded that nonlinear acceleration terms must be reserved to estimate the forces correctly in this study numerical simulations are used to settle the contradictions between these studies the numerical results at two specific locations are analyzed to study the influences of adopting local versus global empirical parameters and reserving nonlinear acceleration terms or not on the predictability of morison equation the results indicate that for the case of estimating forces by depression internal solitary wave on circular cylinder nonlinear acceleration terms should be not be neglected the significances of which depend on the location of cylinder sections more specifically for cylinder sections in the lower layer the differences of empirical coefficients derived and estimated forces by these two forms of morison equation are marginal this is due to the fact that nonlinear acceleration terms are quite small in the lower layer for this scenario for the cylinder sections in upper layer the estimated forces by morison equation with local coefficients could fit true forces well even if nonlinear acceleration terms are neglected which can be explained by the fact that empirical coefficients are adjusted as constrained by least squares method after modified morison equation is employed which takes nonlinear acceleration into accounts the empirical coefficients are within normal ranges and forces predicted are closer to true forces lastly for cylinder sections close to density interface where nonlinear acceleration terms are significant the results show that only if nonlinear acceleration terms are reserved can the forces estimated by morison equation agree with true forces the fairly good performance of original morison equation with local coefficients in wang et al 2019 could be reproduced and explained in this study as these three sections selected are not close to density interface the performances of modified morison equation with local versus global empirical coefficients on two selected cylinder sections are compared it is shown that the forces estimated by modified morison equation with local coefficients are better than those with global coefficients although they both predict the general trend of forces reasonably well however this does not mean local coefficients or layer dependent coefficients are preferred on the one hand some discrepancies between the estimated and true forces are expected as some assumptions used in morison equation on the other hand introducing more parameters are believed to improve the performance of empirical formula on available data set but at the risk of overfitting meaning that the empirical equation captures the patterns in available data well but fail to generalize well to unseen data more data via laboratory experiments and numerical simulations are required to further evaluate the appropriate number of empirical parameters or the complexity of morison equation finally it is suggested that nonlinear acceleration terms should be reserved in morison equation in future studies when it is applied for the case of internal solitary wave because it is physically sound and demonstrates superior performances as shown in this study and zan and lin 2020 credit authorship contribution statement zhenhua lin conceptualization methodology software writing original draft funding acquisition xiaoxiao

theoretically analyzed the pseudo shakedown phenomenon of plate structures under repeated mass impact loadings on the basis of rigid perfectly plastic model cho et al 2014 experimentally and numerically studied the temperature effect on the dynamic responses of steel beams under repeated impacts duan et al 2019 experimentally investigated the dynamic behaviour of aluminium alloy plates under repeated impacts and the initial cracks effect was taken in account recently zhu et al 2018 established the rigid perfectly plastic model of stiffened ship plates subjected to repeated impacts numerical calculation and experimental tests were carried out to validate the theoretical model although many studies on the structural repeated impact behaviours have been conducted current studies mainly focus on the repeated impact dynamic response and failure mechanism of traditional structures such as beams plates and stiffened plates in recent years with the requirement of structure safety and light weight sandwich structures are increasingly introduced into the design and manufacture of ship and offshore structures birman and kardomateas 2018 sutherland 2018 he et al 2018 chen et al 2019 shen et al 2017 van do and lee 2018 honeycomb sandwich structures are widely applied in the field of structure light weighted design and impact protection due to their remarkable mechanical properties gibson and ashby 1999 wang 2019 hazizan and cantwell 2003 wang et al 2017 sun et al 2019 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 carried out the impact resistance tests of aluminum honeycombs and studied the effects of cell number and central angle on the impact resistance zhang et al 2016 2017 derived theoretical models of the indentation response of sandwich panels by using the energy balance equation numerical calculation and experimental validation were further conducted to investigate the low velocity impact mechanical behaviour of honeycomb sandwich structures palomba et al 2018 introduced double layer honeycomb sandwich structures to realize lightweight and efficient crashworthy structures their dynamic responses and energy absorption capabilities were analyzed by low velocity impact tests crupi et al 2013 performed the static and low velocity impact tests of sandwich plates with cellular material cores results showed that cellular materials such as honeycomb and aluminium foam have excellent impact energy absorption performance and can be potentially applied as filling material for lightweight ship structure obviously current studies on aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels ahsps are mainly concentrated on the single impact dynamic mechanical behaviour whereas the repeated impact mechanical behaviour and energy absorption mechanism investigations of ahsps are relatively scarce recently balcı et al 2017 carried out the single and repeated drop weight impact tests and investigated the dynamic behaviours of repaired honeycomb sandwich panels for cargo structures at a319 a320 321 however the repeated impact energy absorption mechanism and deformation mode evolution of ahsps can be hardly revealed in their experimental studies guo et al 2018 2019 experimentally and numerically investigated the repeated impact dynamic behaviours of sandwich plates with aluminium foam cores significantly the equivalent crushable foam model was adopted in the numerical calculation of repeated impact dynamic responses and the compression deformation mode of aluminium foam core could hardly be observed and analyzed in order to study the repeated impact mechanical behaviours and energy absorption mechanism a three dimensional elastoplastic finite element model of ahsp under repeated impacts is established in which the real thin walled geometric microstructure of honeycomb core is taken in account the dynamic deformation and damage modes of honeycomb cores the plastic deformation accumulation process as well as the energy absorption characteristics are analyzed in addition the repeated impact experiments of ahsps were carried out by using instron ceast 9350 impact testing machine to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of numerical calculation method finally the effects of structural parameters on the repeated impact dynamic mechanical behaviours are performed 2 numerical investigation 2 1 physical model and numerical calculation method to investigate the dynamic mechanical behaviour of sandwich panels with honeycomb core a three dimensional nonlinear elastoplastic finite element model of ahsp subjected to low velocity mass impact loading is established by using the commercial software abaqus explicit the sandwich panel considered here is constituted by top and bottom face sheets as well as regular hexagon aluminium honeycomb core as shown in fig 1 the face sheets and aluminium honeycomb core are bonded by using the epoxy resin during our numerical calculations the geometrical parameters of ahsp are defined as follow the thicknesses of the face sheets and aluminium honeycomb core are defined as 1 0 mm and 20 mm respectively the wall length and thickness of honeycomb cells are 4 0 mm and 0 07 mm respectively the dimension of the square sandwich panel is 180 mm 180 mm the side length value of regular hexagon honeycomb core is chosen as 4 mm the hard mass hammer is chosen as hemisphere impactor and the diameter is 40 mm besides the face sheets and the honeycomb core are respectively made up of mild steel materials and a3003 h19 alloy aluminium material during our research the impact velocities of ahsps are adjusted within low velocity range the strain rate and wave propagation effects are negligible with commonly used material systems therefore an isotropic elastoplastic and rate independent material model is defined for both the mild steel face sheets and aluminium honeycomb core zhang et al 2017 crupi et al 2012 the mechanical properties of mild steel face sheets were obtained through the standard uniaxial tension tests the mechanical properties of a3003 h19 alloy aluminium foil are supplied by the manufacturer the corresponding material mechanical properties of ahsp are summarized in table 1 the hemisphere impactor is modeled as discrete rigid body the face sheets and aluminium honeycomb core are meshed by using the four node linear reduced integration shell element s4r the hemisphere impactor is meshed by using the four node element r3d4 meanwhile the local mesh refinement of ahsp around the impact contact is implemented to improve the calculation efficiency and accuracy in addition fixed constraint boundary condition is defined at top and bottom edges of mild steel face sheets the interaction contact relationship between the impactor and sandwich panel is set as the general contact in our experiment mild steel face sheets and aluminium honeycomb core were bonded by epoxy resin the debonding phenomenon between face sheets and honeycomb core did not appear during our repeated impact experimental tests consequently the interaction between the face sheets and honeycomb cores in our numerical model is defined as the tie constraint which means that the mild steel face sheets are rigidly connected with the honeycomb core layer and the binding area does not have relative movement and deformation the single impact energy of the whole system is 50 j the mass and initial impact velocity of the hemisphere impactor is defined as 7 989 kg and 3 53 m s respectively on the basis of the numerical calculation of ahsp under single impact loadings the dynamic response information of ahsp such as stress and strain as well as structure deformation characteristics can be obtained in addition the dynamic response information can be mapped as the initial state to the repeated impact numerical model of ahsp by giving the same initial impact velocity and impact energy to the hemisphere impactor the repeated impact dynamic responses of ahsp can be calculated on the basis of the multiple step analysis procedure 2 2 numerical calculation results based on the above repeated impact finite element model the dynamic deformation accumulation processes of ahsp under repeated impact loadings are achieved figs 2 and 3 respectively illustrate the cross sectional and top views of the evolution of the dynamic deformation and damage modes of honeycomb cores with the increase of the impact numbers it can be found from figs 2 and 3 that the dynamic impact mechanical behaviour and energy absorption capability of sandwich structures is mainly dominated by the honeycomb core compression deformation after the first impact of ahsp the transverse stresses of ahsp increasingly enlarge and the top face sheet buckling occurs and gives rise to the crushing deformation of honeycomb core the clamped sandwich panel experiences both local and global bending displacement the bending deformation and local hemispherical indentation zone occur in the top face sheet whereas the global bending deformation appears in the bottom face sheet in addition the honeycomb core under the hemispherical indentation zone significantly generates progressive buckling the crumpling and buckling area of the cell walls apparently appears which gives rise to the collapse of ahsps the formation of folds can be divided into two types namely eversion and inward fold the folds are superimposed layer by layer the next fold will be formed after each eversion and inward folds are fully compacted and the folds produced by cell wall decrease from the central area to the surrounding areas as the increase of impact numbers the permanent deflections of both top and bottom face sheets of ahsp enlarge gradually the honeycomb core compresses gradually and finally reaches the densification stage the integral folds of the honeycomb core increase and the buckling area gradually enlarges the deformation mode of top face sheet is intuitively embodied as the coupling mode of the global bending deformations and the local indentations whereas the deformation mode of bottom face sheet experiences the mode transition from the global bending deformation model to the coupling deformation mode to further investigate the dynamic mechanical behaviours and energy absorption properties of ahsp under repeated impact loads the time histories of impact force and displacement the loading and unloading impact force displacement curves as well as the energy absorption and allocation characteristics are calculated as shown in fig 4 it can be observed that the impact force time curve of ahsp under single impact load is approximately half wave sine pulse the midpoint displacement of top face sheet of ahsp gradually increases as the increase of the impact contact time the maximum bending plastic deformation and the permanent bending deflection successively appear owing to the elastic rebound effect the single impact energy is mainly converted to the rebound kinetic energy of impact hammer and the plastic deformation energy of top face sheet and honeycomb core as the increase of impact numbers the peak force enlarges obviously the permanent deflection of ahsp accumulates apparently whereas the duration of impact force and the increment of the permanent deflection as well as the slope of the loading curve gradually decline the growth rate of bending deformation of top face sheet is considerably higher than that of bottom face sheet actually the low velocity impact dynamic mechanical model of ahsps can be generally simplified as a spring mass model the relationship between the impact force and the corresponding global bending deformation of ahsps can be represented by a linear spring with constant stiffness while the local indentation zone is account by a nonlinear spring with the increase of repeated impact numbers the honeycomb core compresses gradually and finally reaches the densification stage the sandwich panel is gradually strengthened the linear spring stiffness represented the global bending deformation significantly enhances resulting in the increase of the impact force and the decline of the permanent deflection increment in addition as the increase of impact numbers the energy absorption rate of the top face sheet essentially keeps unchanged the energy absorption rate of the aluminium honeycomb core declines from 40 to 20 the energy absorption rate of the bottom face sheet increases from 2 to 15 top and bottom face sheets play an increasingly important part in the repeated impact energy absorption and allocation due to the densification of honeycomb core 3 experimental validations in order to validate the accuracy and reliability of numerical calculation method and demonstrate the repeated impact dynamic mechanical behaviours of ahsps the repeated impact experimental tests of ahsps were conducted by using instron drop tower 9350 as shown in fig 5 the total impact mass of impact system is composed of the impact hammer mass the force transducer and the attached additional mass the total impact mass can be adjusted from 2 5 kg to 70 kg the maximum impact velocity can be up to 24 m s with the contribution of the spring acceleration system on the top of the impact tower the hammer is chosen as 40 mm diameter hemispherical impactor in addition a force transducer with a maximum loading capacity of 90 kn was connected with the hemispherical impactor to immediately measure the impact force time curves the experimental test samples of ahsps were composed of top and bottom face sheets as well as honeycomb core the dimension of the square test samples was 250 mm 250 mm the top and bottom face sheets were made of mild steel and the honeycomb core was made of aluminum alloy the face sheets and honeycomb core were bonded with epoxy resins during our experimental measurements the experimental test samples were fixed by using the rigid clamp apparatus to achieve fixed constrain boundary condition the inner effective dimension of the clamp apparatus was 180 mm 180 mm the single impact energy was set as 50 j the material and geometrical parameters of the experimental test samples as well as the impact parameters such as the impact mass and the impact velocity were consistent with those of the finite element model during the repeated drop weight impact experimental tests all the data were measured originally from the force transducer and then analyzed by using the data acquisition system das 64 k the midpoint permanent deflections of top and bottom face sheets were measured by using the micrometer gauge and 3d scanner system firstly the cumulative processes of permanent plastic deformation of ahsps from the first impact to the tenth impact were obtained as illustrated in fig 6 it can be found that bending deformation and hemispherical local indentation of the top face sheet as well as the global bending deformation of the bottom face sheet appeared and accumulated gradually after the repeated drop weight impact tests which shows a good agreement with the numerical results the midpoint bending deflection of the top face sheet is much larger than that of the bottom face sheet due to the large plastic deformation of honeycomb core in addition it was obvious that the white line at the boundary of ahsp under repeated impact kept in a straight line which intuitively indicated that the fixed constrain boundary condition in the repeated impact tests can be effectively achieved by using the clamp apparatus in addition the time histories of impact force of ahsp under specific impact numbers were respectively acquired and compared with the numerical calculation results as shown in fig 7 one can observe that the numerical calculation results are in reasonable consistent with the repeated impact experimental results significantly there exist multiple oscillations in the experimental results which was probably due to the impact vibration responses of the support systems and the clamp apparatus in an attempt to clarify the dynamic mechanical behaviours of ahsp under repeated impact loads and further verify the accuracy of the proposed numerical calculation model the peak force the face sheets permanent deflections and honeycomb core compression as well as the energy absorption ratio were obtained and compared as shown in fig 8 it can be found that the peak force and the permanent deflections as well as the compression were approximately exponential with the impact numbers with the increase of repeated impact numbers the bending deformations of the top and bottom face sheets increased gradually whereas the energy absorption ratio and the increment of the bending deformation declined significantly obviously the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental results which proves the validity of the numerical method as well as the correction of the repeated impact dynamic mechanical behaviours of ahsp 4 parametric study 4 1 effect of the thickness of face sheets on the dynamic mechanical behaviours in order to study the effect of the thickness of face sheets on the dynamic behaviours the plastic deformation and energy absorption characteristics of ahsps with three different face sheet thicknesses ranging from 0 5 mm to 1 5 mm subjected to repeated impact loads are studied as shown in fig 9 one can observe from fig 9 that with the increase of face sheet thickness the sandwich panel is gradually strengthened and the global bending stiffness significantly enhances resulting in the significant increase of the peak force whereas the increment of the permanent deflections of face sheets as well as the increment of the compression deformation of honeycomb core decline gradually the whole energy absorption ratio reduces drastically in addition especially noteworthy is that when the face sheet thickness is 0 5 mm there exist two different stages in the repeated impact accumulation and evolution process of the permanent deflection of bottom face sheet and honeycomb core compression as well as the energy absorption ratio when the impact number is lower than 5 the impact energy is mainly absorbed by the top face sheet and honeycomb core whereas the bottom face sheet has little contribution on the energy absorption when the impact number is higher than 5 the compression deformation gradually accumulates and the honeycomb core finally reaches the densification stage as shown in fig 10 the midpoint of the top face sheet is superposition with that of the bottom face sheet the bending deflection and the energy absorption ratio of bottom face sheet increase rapidly the energy absorption ratio of the top face sheet drastically descends consequently with the appearance of the densification stage of honeycomb core the top and bottom face sheets make a dominant contribution in the impact energy absorption 4 2 effect of the wall thickness of honeycomb cell on the dynamic mechanical behaviours in order to study the effect of wall thickness of honeycomb cell on the dynamic behaviours the repeated impact plastic deformation accumulation and energy absorption properties of ahsps with five different wall thicknesses ranging from 0 04 mm to 0 16 mm are performed as shown in fig 11 during our numerical calculations the material properties and geometrical parameters except for the wall thickness of honeycomb cell remain unchanged and the repeated impact energy is maintained at 50 j it can be found from fig 11 that as the increase of the wall thickness of honeycomb cell the peak force and the permanent deflections of the top face sheet increase in the condition of the same impact energy and impact number on the other hand with the increase of impact numbers the peak forces of ahsps with five different wall thicknesses become larger the bending deflection of top and bottom face sheets and the compression deformation of honeycomb cores gradually increase whereas the overall energy absorption rates gradually decline in addition one can observe that when the wall thickness of honeycomb core is large the compression deformation of honeycomb core increases linearly with the increase of the number of impacts however when the wall thickness decreases to 0 04 mm it is noteworthy that the bending deflection of bottom face sheet and the compression deformation of honeycomb cores as well as energy absorption ratio of top and bottom face sheets significantly appear two different stages when the impact number is less than 7 the deformation growth rate of the top face sheet is significantly higher than that of the bottom face sheet the top face sheet and the honeycomb core play a dominant role in the energy absorption when the impact number is higher than 7 the honeycomb core reaches the densification stage and the compression deformation remains unchanged the bending deflection and energy absorption rate of bottom face sheet increase drastically the top and bottom face sheets play a major role in the impact energy absorption 4 3 effect of the wall length of honeycomb cell on the dynamic mechanical behaviours to investigate the influence of the wall length of honeycomb cell on the dynamic mechanical behaviours and energy absorption performances the repeated impact dynamic responses of ahsps with five different face sheet thicknesses ranging from 2 mm to 10 mm are investigated as illustrated in fig 12 we can see that with the wall length of the honeycomb cell increasing the peak force of ahsp and the permanent deflections of the top face sheet decrease the honeycomb core compression increases significantly the repeated impact numbers before the occurrence of the densification stage of honeycomb core descends gradually this could be explained that as the increase of the wall length the cell numbers reduce which gives rise to the weakening of the reinforcement effect of honeycomb core as well as the global strength and stiffness of ahsps after the occurrence of the densification stage the honeycomb cores make a decreasingly contribution to the impact energy absorption whereas the face sheets play an increasingly dominate role on the repeated impact energy absorption 5 conclusions in this paper the repeated impact plastic deformation accumulation and energy absorption characteristics of ahsps are numerically and experimentally investigated a three dimensional nonlinear finite element model of ahsp under repeated impact loads is established by using the commercial software abaqus explicit the repeated impact experimental tests of ahsps were conducted by using the instron 9350 drop tower in addition the influences of geometric parameters on the repeated impact dynamic mechanical behaviours and energy absorption properties are further discussed within the limitation of the presented experimental and numerical results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the numerical calculated results of the repeated impact dynamic mechanical behaviours of ahsps show a good agreement with the repeated impact experimental results which demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the repeated impact elastoplastic numerical model of ahsps 2 with the increase of the repeated impact numbers the permanent bending deflections of both top and bottom face sheets increase the integral folds of the honeycomb core increase and the buckling area enlarges the honeycomb core compresses and finally reaches the densification stage top and bottom face sheets play an increasingly important part in the repeated impact energy absorption 3 the deformation mode of top face sheet is embodied as the coupling mode of the global bending deformations and the local indentations whereas the deformation mode of bottom face sheet experience the mode transition from the global bending deformation model to the coupling deformation mode between the global bending deformations and the local indentations 4 the plastic deformation accumulation and energy absorption performances of ahsps under repeated impact loads can be effectively modulated by the wall thickness and length of honeycomb cells as well as the face sheet thickness credit authorship contribution statement yu zhang formal analysis writing original draft yinggang li

helicopters wheel landing loads zhu et al 2020 ice floe impact loads cai et al 2020 as well as extremely slamming loads truong et al 2018 resulting in the structural plastic deformation and damage

aluminium foam have excellent impact energy absorption performance and can be potentially applied as filling material for lightweight ship structure obviously current studies on aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels ahsps are mainly concentrated on the single impact dynamic mechanical behaviour whereas the repeated impact mechanical behaviour and energy absorption mechanism investigations of ahsps are relatively scarce recently balcı et al 2017 carried out the single and repeated drop weight impact tests and investigated the dynamic behaviours of repaired honeycomb sandwich panels for cargo structures at a319 a320 321 however the repeated impact energy absorption mechanism and deformation mode evolution of ahsps can be hardly revealed in their experimental studies guo et al 2018 2019 experimentally and numerically investigated the repeated impact dynamic behaviours of sandwich plates with aluminium foam cores significantly the equivalent crushable foam model was adopted in the numerical calculation of repeated impact dynamic responses and the compression deformation mode of aluminium foam core could hardly be observed and analyzed in order to study the repeated impact

microstructure of honeycomb core is taken in account the dynamic deformation and damage modes of honeycomb cores the plastic deformation accumulation process as well as the energy absorption

calculation method to investigate the dynamic mechanical behaviour of sandwich panels with honeycomb core a three dimensional nonlinear elastoplastic finite element model of ahsp subjected to low velocity mass impact loading is established by using the commercial software abaqus explicit the sandwich panel considered here is constituted by top and bottom face sheets as well as regular hexagon aluminium honeycomb core as shown in fig 1 the face sheets and aluminium honeycomb core are bonded by using the epoxy resin during our numerical calculations the geometrical parameters of ahsp are defined as follow the thicknesses of the face sheets and aluminium honeycomb core are defined as 1 0 mm and 20 mm respectively the wall length and thickness of honeycomb cells are 4 0 mm and 0 07 mm respectively the dimension of the square sandwich panel is 180 mm 180 mm the side length value of regular hexagon honeycomb core is chosen as 4 mm the hard mass hammer is chosen as hemisphere impactor and the diameter is 40 mm besides the face sheets and the honeycomb core are respectively made up of mild steel materials and a3003 h19 alloy aluminium material during our research the impact velocities of ahsps are adjusted within low velocity range the strain rate and wave propagation effects are negligible with commonly used material systems therefore an isotropic elastoplastic and rate independent material model is defined for both the mild steel face sheets and aluminium honeycomb core zhang et al 2017 crupi et al 2012 the mechanical properties of mild steel face sheets were obtained through the standard uniaxial tension tests the mechanical properties of a3003 h19 alloy aluminium foil are supplied by the manufacturer the corresponding material mechanical properties of ahsp are summarized in table 1 the hemisphere impactor is modeled as discrete rigid body the face sheets and aluminium honeycomb core are meshed by using the four node linear reduced integration shell element s4r the hemisphere impactor is meshed by using the four node element r3d4 meanwhile the local mesh refinement of ahsp around the impact contact is implemented to improve the calculation efficiency and accuracy in addition fixed constraint boundary condition is defined at top and bottom edges of mild steel face sheets the interaction contact relationship between the impactor and sandwich panel is set as the general contact in our experiment mild steel face sheets and aluminium honeycomb core were bonded by epoxy resin the debonding phenomenon between face sheets and honeycomb core did not appear during our repeated impact experimental tests consequently the interaction between the face sheets and honeycomb cores in our numerical model is defined as the tie constraint which means that the mild steel face sheets are rigidly connected with the honeycomb core layer and the binding area does not have relative movement and deformation the single impact energy of the whole system is 50 j the mass and initial impact velocity of the hemisphere impactor is defined as 7 989 kg and 3 53 m s respectively on the basis of the numerical calculation of ahsp under single impact loadings the dynamic response information of ahsp such as stress and strain as well as structure deformation characteristics can be obtained in addition the dynamic response information can be mapped as the initial state to the repeated impact numerical model of ahsp by giving the same initial impact velocity and impact energy to the hemisphere impactor the repeated impact dynamic responses of ahsp can be calculated on the basis of the multiple step analysis procedure 2 2 numerical calculation results based on the above repeated impact finite element model the dynamic deformation accumulation processes of ahsp under repeated impact loadings are achieved figs 2 and 3 respectively illustrate the cross sectional and top views of the evolution of the dynamic deformation and damage modes of honeycomb cores with the increase of the impact numbers it can be found from figs 2 and 3 that the dynamic impact mechanical behaviour and energy absorption capability of sandwich structures is mainly dominated by the honeycomb core compression deformation after the first impact of ahsp the transverse stresses of ahsp increasingly enlarge and the top face sheet buckling occurs and gives rise to the crushing deformation of honeycomb core the clamped sandwich panel experiences both local and global bending displacement the bending deformation and local hemispherical indentation zone occur in the top face sheet whereas the global bending deformation appears in the bottom face sheet in addition the honeycomb core under the hemispherical indentation zone significantly generates progressive buckling the crumpling and buckling area of the cell walls apparently appears which gives rise to the collapse of ahsps the formation of folds can be divided into two types namely eversion and inward fold the folds are superimposed layer by layer the next fold will be formed after each eversion and inward folds are fully compacted and the folds produced by cell wall decrease from the central area to the surrounding areas as the increase of impact numbers the permanent deflections of both top and bottom face sheets of ahsp enlarge gradually the honeycomb core compresses gradually and finally reaches the densification stage the integral folds of the honeycomb core increase and the buckling area gradually enlarges the deformation mode of top face sheet is intuitively embodied as the coupling mode of the global bending deformations and the local indentations whereas the deformation mode of bottom face sheet experiences the mode transition from the global bending deformation model to the coupling deformation mode to further investigate the dynamic mechanical behaviours and energy absorption properties of ahsp under repeated impact loads the time histories of impact force and displacement the loading and unloading impact force displacement curves as well as the energy absorption and allocation characteristics are calculated as shown in fig 4 it can be observed that the impact force time curve of ahsp under single impact load is approximately half wave sine pulse the midpoint displacement of top face sheet of ahsp gradually increases as the increase of the impact contact time the maximum bending plastic deformation and the permanent bending deflection successively appear owing to the elastic rebound effect the single impact energy is mainly converted to the rebound kinetic energy of impact hammer and the plastic deformation energy of top face sheet and honeycomb core as the increase of impact numbers the peak force enlarges obviously the permanent deflection of ahsp accumulates apparently whereas the duration of impact force and the increment of the permanent deflection as well as the slope of the loading curve gradually decline the growth rate of bending deformation of top face sheet is considerably higher than that of bottom face sheet actually the low velocity impact dynamic mechanical model of ahsps can be generally simplified as a spring mass model the relationship between the impact force and the corresponding global bending deformation of ahsps can be represented by a linear spring with constant stiffness while the local indentation zone is account by a nonlinear spring with the increase of repeated impact numbers the honeycomb core compresses gradually and finally reaches the densification stage the sandwich panel is gradually strengthened the linear spring stiffness represented the global bending deformation significantly enhances resulting in the increase of the impact force and the decline of the permanent deflection increment in addition as the increase of impact numbers the energy absorption rate of the top face sheet essentially keeps unchanged the energy absorption rate of the aluminium honeycomb core declines from 40 to 20 the energy absorption rate of the bottom face sheet increases from 2 to 15 top and bottom face sheets play an increasingly important part in the repeated impact energy absorption and allocation due to the densification of honeycomb core 3 experimental validations in order to validate the accuracy and reliability of numerical calculation method and demonstrate the repeated impact dynamic mechanical behaviours of ahsps the repeated impact experimental tests of ahsps were conducted by using instron drop tower 9350 as shown in fig 5 the total impact mass of impact system is composed of the impact hammer mass the force transducer and the attached additional mass the total impact mass can be adjusted from 2 5 kg to 70 kg the maximum impact velocity can be up to 24 m s with the contribution of the spring acceleration system on the top of the impact tower the hammer is chosen as 40 mm diameter hemispherical impactor in addition a force transducer with a maximum loading capacity of 90 kn was connected with the hemispherical impactor to immediately measure the impact force time curves the experimental test samples of ahsps were composed of top and bottom face sheets as well as honeycomb core the dimension of the square test samples was 250 mm 250 mm the top and bottom face sheets were made of mild steel and the honeycomb core was made of aluminum alloy the face sheets and honeycomb core were bonded with epoxy resins during our experimental measurements the experimental test samples were fixed by using the rigid clamp apparatus to achieve fixed constrain boundary condition the inner effective dimension of the clamp apparatus was 180 mm 180 mm the single impact energy was set as 50 j the material and geometrical parameters of the experimental test samples as well as the impact parameters such as the impact mass and the impact velocity were consistent with those of the finite element model during the repeated drop weight impact experimental tests all the data were measured originally from the force transducer and then analyzed by using the data acquisition system das 64 k the midpoint permanent deflections of top and bottom face sheets were measured by using the micrometer gauge and 3d scanner system firstly the cumulative processes of permanent plastic deformation of ahsps from the first impact to the tenth impact were obtained as illustrated in fig 6 it can be found that bending deformation and hemispherical local indentation of the top face sheet as well as the global bending deformation of the bottom face sheet appeared and accumulated gradually after the repeated drop weight impact tests which shows a good agreement with the numerical results the midpoint bending deflection of the top face sheet is much larger than that of the bottom face sheet due to the large plastic deformation of honeycomb core in addition it was obvious that the white line at the boundary of ahsp under repeated impact kept in a straight line which intuitively indicated that the fixed constrain boundary condition in the repeated impact tests can be effectively achieved by using the clamp apparatus in addition the time histories of impact force of ahsp under specific impact numbers were respectively acquired and compared with the numerical calculation results as shown in fig 7 one can observe that the numerical calculation results are in reasonable consistent with the repeated impact experimental results significantly there exist multiple oscillations in the experimental results which was probably due to the impact vibration responses of the support systems and the clamp apparatus in an attempt to clarify the dynamic mechanical behaviours of ahsp under repeated impact loads and further verify the accuracy of the proposed numerical calculation model the peak force the face sheets permanent deflections and honeycomb core compression as well as the energy absorption ratio were obtained and compared as shown in fig 8 it can be found that the peak force and the permanent deflections as well as the compression were approximately exponential with the impact numbers with the increase of repeated impact numbers the bending deformations of the top and bottom face sheets increased gradually whereas the energy absorption ratio and the increment of the bending deformation declined significantly obviously the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental results which proves the validity of the numerical method as well as the correction of the repeated impact dynamic mechanical behaviours of ahsp 4 parametric study 4 1 effect of the thickness of face sheets on the dynamic mechanical behaviours in order to study the effect of the thickness of face sheets on the dynamic behaviours the plastic deformation and energy absorption characteristics of ahsps with three different face sheet thicknesses ranging from 0 5 mm to 1 5 mm subjected to repeated impact loads are studied as shown in fig 9 one can observe from fig 9 that with the increase of face sheet thickness the sandwich panel is gradually strengthened and the global bending stiffness significantly enhances resulting in the significant increase of the peak force whereas the increment of the permanent deflections of face sheets as well as the increment of the compression deformation of honeycomb core decline gradually the whole energy absorption ratio reduces drastically in addition especially noteworthy is that when the face sheet thickness is 0 5 mm there exist two different stages in the repeated impact accumulation and evolution process of the permanent deflection of bottom face sheet and honeycomb core compression as well as the energy absorption ratio when the impact number is lower than 5 the impact energy is mainly absorbed by the top face sheet and honeycomb core whereas the bottom face sheet has little contribution on the energy absorption when the impact number is higher than 5 the compression deformation gradually accumulates and the honeycomb core finally reaches the densification stage as shown in fig 10 the midpoint of the top face sheet is superposition with that of the bottom face sheet the bending deflection and the energy absorption ratio of bottom face sheet increase rapidly the energy absorption ratio of the top face sheet drastically descends consequently with the appearance of the densification stage of honeycomb core the top and bottom face sheets make a dominant contribution in the impact energy absorption 4 2 effect of the wall thickness of honeycomb cell on the dynamic mechanical behaviours in order to study the effect of wall thickness of honeycomb cell on the dynamic behaviours the repeated impact plastic deformation accumulation and energy absorption properties of ahsps with five different wall thicknesses ranging from 0 04 mm to 0 16 mm are performed as shown in fig 11 during our numerical calculations the material properties and geometrical parameters except for the wall thickness of honeycomb cell remain unchanged and the repeated impact energy is maintained at 50 j it can be found from fig 11 that as the increase of the wall thickness of honeycomb cell the peak force and the permanent deflections of the top face sheet increase in the condition of the same impact energy and impact number on the other hand with the increase of impact numbers the peak forces of ahsps with five different wall thicknesses become larger the bending deflection of top and bottom face sheets and the compression deformation of honeycomb cores gradually increase whereas the overall energy absorption rates gradually decline in addition one can observe that when the wall thickness of honeycomb core is large the compression deformation of honeycomb core increases linearly with the increase of the number of impacts however when the wall thickness decreases to 0 04 mm it is noteworthy that the bending deflection of bottom face sheet and the compression deformation of honeycomb cores as well as energy absorption ratio of top and bottom face sheets significantly appear two different stages when the impact number is less than 7 the deformation growth rate of the top face sheet is significantly higher than that of the bottom face sheet the top face sheet and the honeycomb core play a dominant role in the energy absorption when the impact number is higher than 7 the honeycomb core reaches the densification stage and the compression deformation remains unchanged the bending deflection and energy absorption rate of bottom face sheet increase drastically the top and bottom face sheets play a major role in the impact energy absorption 4 3 effect of the wall length of honeycomb cell on the dynamic mechanical behaviours to investigate the influence of the wall length of honeycomb cell on the dynamic mechanical behaviours and energy absorption performances the repeated impact dynamic responses of ahsps with five different face sheet thicknesses ranging from 2 mm to 10 mm are investigated as illustrated in fig 12 we can see that with the wall length of the honeycomb cell increasing the peak force of ahsp and the permanent deflections of the top face sheet decrease the honeycomb core compression increases significantly the repeated impact numbers before the occurrence of the densification stage of honeycomb core descends gradually this could be explained that as the increase of the wall length the cell numbers reduce which gives rise to the weakening of the reinforcement effect of honeycomb core as well as the global strength and stiffness of ahsps after the occurrence of the densification stage the honeycomb cores make a decreasingly contribution to the impact energy absorption whereas the face sheets play an increasingly dominate role on the repeated impact energy absorption 5 conclusions in this paper the repeated impact plastic deformation accumulation and energy absorption characteristics of ahsps are numerically and experimentally investigated a three dimensional nonlinear finite element model of ahsp under repeated impact loads is established by using the commercial software abaqus explicit the repeated impact experimental tests of ahsps were conducted by using the instron 9350 drop tower in addition the influences of geometric parameters on the repeated impact dynamic mechanical behaviours and energy absorption properties are further discussed within the limitation of the presented experimental and numerical results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the numerical calculated results of the repeated impact dynamic mechanical behaviours of ahsps show a good agreement with the repeated impact experimental results which demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the repeated impact elastoplastic numerical model of ahsps 2 with the increase of the repeated impact numbers the permanent bending deflections of both top and bottom face sheets increase the integral folds of the honeycomb core increase and the buckling area enlarges the honeycomb core compresses and finally reaches the densification stage top and bottom face sheets play an increasingly important part in the repeated impact energy absorption 3 the deformation mode of top face sheet is embodied as the coupling mode of the global bending deformations and the local indentations whereas the deformation mode of bottom face sheet experience the mode transition from the global bending deformation model to the coupling deformation mode between the global bending deformations and the local indentations 4 the plastic deformation accumulation and energy absorption performances of ahsps under repeated impact loads can be effectively modulated by the wall thickness and length of honeycomb cells as well as the face sheet thickness credit authorship contribution statement yu zhang formal analysis writing original draft yinggang li

nonlinear effect 1 introduction the ocean disaster tsunami has received more and more attention as people s living standards improve lin et al 2015 besides the crustal displacement the volcanic eruption and meteoritic impact the frequent landslide is the most likely cause of the tsunami like wave heidarzadeh et al 2019 some human factors also bring about the generation of the soliton wave such as the underwater explosion and even the sailing of ship grue 2017 the occurrence probability of the soliton wave seems fewer than that of the regular wave in the ocean however the destructiveness of these long waves is much larger especially in terms of the tremendous streamwise loading and the runup when the long wave approaches the coast the shoaling effect causes the amplification of the wave amplitude the action of the long wave on the structures is concerned widely in coastal and offshore engineering xie and stoesser 2020 zhu and dong 2020 the cylinder style structures are often employed in the ocean engineering as some typical forms such as the fully submerged bottom fixed marine risers the bottom fixed but surface piercing standing legs for coastal constructions and the free floating elevated floating offshore wind turbines the interaction between the wave and cylinder appears strong nonlinearity the investigation of wave induced run up and load on the cylindrical structures has always been a hot issue due to the significance and complexity from the middle of the last century the diffraction theory has already been deduced for the calculation of wave impact on piles maccamy and fuchs 1954 along with the progression of scientific cognition the researchers have paid much attention to the higher order component for both the run up and wave load the excessive run up on standing legs leads to the green water numerous numerical and experimental researches have been conducted to recognize the run up on coastal column designed structures kriebel 1992 described the theoretical results for second order wave run up around a large diameter vertical circular cylinder the results explained a significant portion of the nonlinear wave run up distribution measured at all angles around the cylinder nielsen 2003 compared several methods on computing the run up along platform columns to experimental results more effort is recommended to put into understanding details of the run up phenomenon due to the fully nonlinear in the experimental study by morris thomas and thiagarajan 2004 the different harmonics of the wave run up on fixed surface piercing cylinders are examined to determine the importance of the local wave diffraction and incident wave nonlinearities they showed that the complete wave run up is not well accounted for by second order diffraction theory the work of chen et al 2014 indicated that openfoam is capable of accurate modelling of nonlinear wave interaction with offshore structures with up to 4th order harmonic correctly captured despite the above refined numerical results the experimental precision of run up is limited by measurement methods the wave gauges are commonly used to measure the surface elevation in the experiment of run up on the cylinder niedzwecki and duggal 1992 li et al 2012 the intrusive instrument can help to observe the diffraction and scattering handily however the water surface of the run up is the oblique crescent moon like style the wave gauge cannot catch the actual run up height and the bias increases with the run up height because of the stretch of the water surface not only that most studies focus on the maximum height but neglect the process of run up although the former seems more critical to coastal engineering the latter may provide inspired points of view on the nonlinear problem in terms of the wave load on cylinders some elaborate formulas have been established and modified rationally based on theoretical derivations or different empirical models niedzweck and huston 1992 huseby and grue 2000 paulsen et al 2014 fan et al 2018 the fundamental response of columns relates to the wave period while the higher harmonics in the forcing excite the unexpected frequency of the cylinders intermittently the second order diffraction programs are responsible for the sum frequency excitation that gives rose to springing and the ringing events occur as the higher order burst type forced by waves natvig and teigen 1993 the third order theories proposed by faltinsen et al 1995 attempted to explain the ringing phenomenon which is often associated with the third harmonic force moreover grue et al 1993 described a higher harmonic wave exciting force secondary load cycle leading to the oscillation at about one quarter of the wave period after the main peak chaplin et al 1997 stated that the amplitude of this oscillation was found to be a function predominantly of the wave steepness and simple numerical experiments showed that it might have an essential effect on ringing response grue and huseby 2002 concluded that the secondary load cycle gives a vital contribution to the build up of the resonant body at about four times the local wave frequency here the discussion on the nonlinearity rainey 2007 should be mentioned the high order solution on the wave frequency belongs to the weakly nonlinear theory however the secondary load cycle is a strongly nonlinear phenomenon accompanied with the local breaking and even formation of a cavitation bubble consequently the secondary load cycle is supposed to be studied as prominent nonlinear characteristics furthermore paulsen et al 2014 also marked the secondary load cycle for some particular examples belongs to a frequency range above the sixth harmonic wave frequency it should be regarded as an indicator of strongly nonlinear local flow rather than a direct contributor to the low order resonant forcing the troubling nonlinear effect creates the not well understood problem of wave induced run up and load on the cylinder the solitary wave is a well qualified subject to give an intuitive comprehension of the highly nonlinear process the nonlinear effects of a solitary wave on the runup and wave loads on a cylinder need further investigation besides the advantage of straightforward shape the solitary wave is also employed as the simplification to simulate the tsunami wave hsiao and lin 2010 some previous theoretical and numerical paper wang et al 1992 zhao et al 2007 cao and wan 2015 of solitary wave induced hydrodynamic characters on cylinders can be reviewed but the relevant experiment is a handful to the best of the authors knowledge the rarely available data owes to the small scale laboratory experiment given by yates and wang 1994 the undisturbed water depth was 4 cm and the radius of the bottom fixed cylinder was 6 35 cm the study focused on the wave field around the cylinder and the wave force the run up is the approximate value from the closest gauge of 0 2 cm away from the cylinder mo et al 2013 conducted the experiments on the interaction between the plunging solitary wave and a slender cylinder on a sloping beach the severe lack of trials makes the deficient reference for the deep going study on the nonlinear problem in this paper experiments are conducted to obtain the solitary wave induced run up and loads on the vertical truncated cylinder the primary objective is to provide referenced data for the study of the wave cylinder nonlinear problems especially the time varying process of the hydrodynamic characters an image capture technique and a six component balance system are employed respectively to report the run up and loading process on the cylinder the description of facilities and methods are presented in the next section the run up process is given in section 3 section 4 shows the hydrodynamic loads finally the conclusions are summarized 2 experimental facilities and set up the experiments are conducted in the tsunami basin for offshore region wang et al 2018 the basin is 42 4 m in length 4 m in width and 1 6 m in height an acrylic made cylinder with a pedestal is fixed on the steel structure in the center region of the basin nielsen 2003 used the calibrated vertical strings as the ruler to estimate the run up analogous to that a waterproof mask printed by the 2 cm side length mesh is glued around the surface of the cylinder as shown in fig 1 serving for the run up detection two cameras with the resolution of 1024 1024 at 100 fps record the run up process synchronously from the front and back of the cylinder the cameras are placed at the inclined top to avoid the shield of view as shown in fig 2 some led lights are employed to enhance the image quality it should be emphasized that the run up height η represents the elevation beyond the still water surface instead of the bottom of the cylinder the hydrodynamic loads are measured by a set of the force balance system at the 1 khz sample frequency which consists of four kistler 9317c piezoelectric 3 component sensors some conventional sensors only obtain no more than three orthogonal components of wave forces the system of four load cells can measure the three more moments wang et al 2019 the sensors are screwed between the cylinder and the supporting steel structure to ensure that hydrodynamic loads are responded integrally by the force balance system the size of the installation and the right handed system of load directions are shown in fig 2 the load center locates at the midpoint of the sensors array with the 1 5 cm height above the cylinder the water depth h is 50 cm in the present study the truncated depth g is the distance between the still water surface and the bottom of the cylinder given as 10 cm 5 cm 0 cm 5 cm and 10cm respectively the value of g 0 represents the submerged situation and the negative means elevated the relative wave height h h is from 0 1 to 0 5 with the 0 05 interval the generation of the solitary wave follows the modified goring s methodology proposed by malek mohammadi and testik 2010 the wave shape adopts grimshaw s third order solution grimshaw 1971 the free surface elevation for some wave conditions is shown in fig 3 measured by the wave gauge 10 m away from the cylinder the generation method is qualified by the consistency between the experimental data and the theoretical results 3 run up on the cylinder 3 1 the image capture technique the method of image processing is given as following pre take the static image fig 4 a before the wave incoming the mesh printed on the waterproof mask serves for the calibration the mesh lines are extracted by the binarization method with the appropriate threshold value the lowest line of the mesh locates at the still water surface and the interval between each line is 2 cm the present study focuses on the run up along the centerline of the cylinder therefore the two cameras are arranged to make the principal optic axis coplanar with the cylinder centerline marked in advance as thus the crosswise perspective deviation along the centerline can be neglected the corresponding height of each pixel along the centerline is interpolated linearly from the adjacent two extracted points fig 4b the solitary is generated after the preparation and the run up occurs fig 4c the interface of the run up water and the cylinder appears dim which presents the low grey value in the image matrix the distinct interface fig 4d is produced after binarizing the image with a threshold value and running the opening operation for the pixels i e the erosion and the subsequent dilation for the grey value finally the value η of the run up in the current image is obtained all images in each case are handled by the matlab code to obtain the run up process the accuracy of the interface capture depends on some threshold values chosen artificially by prior observation besides the errors in locating the interface come from the limited resolution obscure interface occasional light impulsion and numerical precision the automatic capture of the run up process is checked in some cases by manual operation frame by frame the results from the inspection and the repeated experiments show that the error in most cases is less than 0 1 cm with the largest error of about 0 4 cm at some extreme condition such as the violent breaking one example of the run up process is exhibited in fig 5 the curve is the raw data handled without any filtering the smooth of the curves qualifies the efficient auto capture of the interface to detect the run up process in the present paper the run up at the front and back centerline of the cylinder surface is discussed to focus on the secondary peak the run up along the whole surface of the cylinder can be captured by more cameras to obtain comprehensive data in the future 3 2 maximum and secondary peak of the front run up the maximum value ηf of front run up is normalized by the water depth fig 6 a the curve is fitted as the reference based on the data from g 0 by the superposition of the first and second order of h h byatt smith 1971 the apparent conclusion comes that the front run up increases with the wave amplitude the line of the slope k 1 proves that the front run up height is always larger than the wave amplitude another conclusion goes that the truncated depth has no significant effect on the maximum front run up even at the elevated situation g 0 the reason is that the cylinder diameter of 0 3 m is relatively small compared with the solitary wavelength of more than 5 m in this study for the better observation of the nonlinear effect the maximum front run up is normalized by the wave amplitude fig 6b the referenced curve is fitted with an additional constant term the result shows that the increase of wave amplitude leads to the larger relative growth of front run up height the trend is evident below h h 0 35 however the rise of ηf h weakens from h h 0 4 which could also be proved by the negative coefficient of the second order term herein two different patterns fig 7 exists during the maximum front run up occurring the first one fig 7a appears as the concave pattern not the real dent because of the perspective distortion when the value of h h is no more than 0 35 from h h 0 4 the curvature of the interface evolves to the convex fig 7b the change indicates that the run up height close to the cylinder centerline increases faster than that away from the centerline as the relative wave height increases a threshold of the pronounced nonlinear behavior is deemed around the value of h h 0 35 0 4 in some previous studies chaplin et al 1997 rainey 2007 paulsen et al 2014 the existence of a distinct return flow can be observed from the diffracted wave propagating around the cylinder after the passage of the wave crest the qualitative observation of the nonlinear surface deformation serves to explain the secondary peak here with the image capture technique we find that the return flow causes the secondary front run up fig 8 for the small wave amplitude h h 0 35 the trend of the front run up process is consistent with the varying surface of the solitary wave the large wave amplitude h h 0 35 results in two differences in the front run up process one is the occurrence of the secondary peak the other is the fast falling of water in the primary run up take the example of h h 0 4 the dimensionless time for the lasting of the primary mount is about 6 which consists of the raising process of 5 and the decline process of 1 from the image results and the field observation the front run up process for the large wave amplitude can be interpreted as follows the larger wave leads to higher front run up due to the more substantial nonlinear effect the extra high run up caused by the wavefront cannot be maintained in the wave deceleration phase therefore the running up water drops quickly the falling water volume contributes to the violent break around the truncated cylinder even making the water surface elevation below the cylinder bottom when the wave tail and the return flow from the cylinder back come the surface elevation rises again leading to the secondary run up the value of h h 0 35 0 4 is the threshold for the emergence of the secondary front run up 3 3 maximum and pattern of the back run up the mechanism of the front run up is the common sense of water climbing on the obstacle but the back run up comes from the stack of the water flowing around the circumference and bottom of the truncated cylinder the maximum back run up height ηb is normalized and fitted in fig 9 the value of ηb at the submerged situation g 0 is always similar to the corresponding wave amplitude for the elevated situation ηb rises substantially at g 5 cm at the large wave amplitude and descends slightly at the case of g 10cm the value of h h 0 35 0 4 is indicated again to be the turning point for the nonlinear process the images of the moment that the maximum height occurs are focused on understanding the back run up further for the small wave amplitude the pattern of back run up seems similar to that of the front run up as shown in fig 7a the smooth back run up process with no break displays a concave interface along the cylinder backside however the back run up pattern changes at the large wave amplitude fig 10 the wave propagating around the cylinder encounters at the cylinder backside in the submerged situation g 0 fig 10 a c the collision makes the water surface upwell and roll outwards although the maximum run up height ηb is similar the water volume increases with the g value leading to the larger width of the upwelling water as marked by the cyan color for the elevated cylinder g 0 fig 10 d e the impact of water on the cylinder bottom results in the plentiful spray which makes the image post process failing to obtain the back run up the splashing spray causes excessive detected height for the back run up in the case of g 5cm however the violent break around the cylinder reduces the back run up in the case of g 10cm as a result the streaming collision at the cylinder backside is the causation of the secondary peak the upwelling water generates the return flow against the wave propagating leading to the secondary front run up and the load discussed later 4 hydrodynamic loads on the cylinder the three component forces and moments are measured the specific configuration of the cylinder makes that the lateral force f y yawing moment m z and rolling moment m x are much smaller fig 11 than the inline force f x vertical force f z and pitching moment m y therefore only the latter three loads are discussed in the following section 4 1 maximum and secondary peak of the inline force the morison equation morison et al 1950 seems to be suitable in the present characteristic scale to estimate the inline force however the high harmonic force induced by the complex diffraction and scattering and even the wave break makes the morison equation fail to estimate the force in the nonlinear situation herein the inline force calculated by the morison equation is given as the reference fig 12 a the drag coefficient of 0 8 and the inertia coefficient of 2 result in the over estimated value than the experimental results the inline force appears as a positive zone and a negative zone no matter of the g values the variation of the inline force is gentle in the wave acceleration phase the positive zone in fig 12a but in the wave decelerating phase the negative zone in fig 12a the wave break and the diffraction result in the fluctuation of the force this sense can be an analogy with the run up the pattern of the run up during the wavefront is ordered while the subsequent flow due to the wave collision and break leads to the chaotic process in the study on the steep regular wave the magnitude of the secondary load cycle was seen to be more pronounced in the long wave regime paulsen et al 2014 here for the solitary wave classified as the long wave the secondary peak for the inline force occurs at the case of h h 0 35 fig 12b the degree of the nonlinear phenomena increases with the wave amplitude an evident peak can be even observed for h h 0 5 moreover the timing is about one quarter of the significant wave period later than the main peak consistent with the results for the regular wave grue and huseby 2002 the secondary cycle in the regular wave may cause a hazard to the offshore structure due to the repeated action from the four times of the local wave frequency although the solitary wave does not have this global effect the deformation of the free surface brings the local effects on the wave loads in a solitary wave of large amplitude the secondary peak of the solitary wave might have less influence on the structure than that of the regular wave however it is interesting to understand the characteristics of hydrodynamic loads on a cylinder under the action of a solitary wave of different amplitudes particularly at large amplitude besides for the non stationary process the frequency should be ever changing the frequency value has to be a function of time the concept of instantaneous frequency is necessary for understanding the detailed mechanisms for the nonlinear process huang et al 2009 the instantaneous frequency just depends on the local data instead of the sequential signal this problem deserves further study to analyze the influence of the issue of frequency the maximum value of the inline force increases with the relative wave height h h and the truncated depth g fig 13 a although the morison equation may not apply to the present truncated cylinder the calculated positive peaks divided by the coefficient of 1 5 can yet accord with the experimental data it represents that the positive inline force can still be evaluated as the sum of the drag force and the inertial force provided the appropriate force coefficient however the variation of the negative peak has no explicit law because of the wave break furthermore the peaks are normalized by ρghhr in fig 13b to reveal the influence of the wave amplitude the nonlinear effect emerges with the increasing wave amplitude as a result the curve of the positive peak gradually flattens which is the same as the trend of the front run up in fig 6b 4 2 maximum and secondary peak of the vertical force the maximum vertical force normalized by ρgh 2 r increases with the wave amplitude fig 14 a the net buoyancy is eliminated before the measurement the pressure from the rising wave surface i e the additional buoyancy plays an important role therefore the submerged situations g 0 has little influence on the peak of vertical force and the values decline with the elevated height g 0 the maximum vertical force normalized by ρghhr decreases with the wave amplitude fig 14b the growing nonlinearity leads to the decline of the relative vertical force because the enhanced wave break around the cylinder leads to the declining pressure on the cylinder bottom the loading process for different g values fig 15 a indicates that the vertical forces on the submerged cylinder g 0 are consistent and smooth in contrast the wave impact and break at the bottom of the truncated cylinder g 0 leads to the fluctuated force herein the secondary peak of the vertical force is also observed in the case of h h 0 35 for the submerged cylinder fig 15b this nonlinear effect appears at the large wave amplitude which is similar to that in the run up and the inline force the return flow from the streaming collision causes rising surface elevation leading to the secondary peak of the vertical force the vertical force is not usually concerned since the damage of cylinder structure often results from the deficiency of the inline force even so the results of the vertical force may help to add some acknowledge to the nonlinear process 4 3 maximum of pitching moment and the acting position of inline force the pitching moment is generated by both the inline force and the vertical force but the inline force dominates the pitching moment in the present system because of the much longer arm given in fig 2 consequently fig 16 is almost the upside down presentation of fig 13 since the positive inline force causes the negative pitching moment and vice versa the value of l 1 09 m is the force arm from the cylinder bottom to the center of the balance system for the study on the acting position of the resultant inline force the pitching moment center is translated to the water surface as shown as the inset in fig 17 with the assumption of ignoring the effect of vertical force on the pitching moment the value of m y and f x can reflect the action point of the resultant inline force at the initial stage of the solitary wave before the timing a the inline force loads mainly on the submerged part of the cylinder s zone as a result the positive f x causes the negative clockwise m y between the timing a and b the coming of wavefront leads to the increasing inline force and the decreasing negative pitching moments it means that the action point of inline force moves upwards following the rising water surface but it remains in the s zone until the inline force reaches the maximum value when the wave crest approaches between the timing b and c the decreasing inertia force results in the decline of inline force the positive f x and the positive m y indicate that the action point locates in the u zone after the timing c the leaving away of the wave causes the negative f x and the positive m y the action point moves back to the s zone which is the reversed process before timing a the fluctuation comes from the influence of the violent wave break 5 conclusions the experiments are carried out to investigate the solitary wave induced run up and loads on the vertical truncated cylinder different truncated depths and wave amplitudes are tested to understand the nonlinear problem further the nonlinearity of the problem emerges with the increase of wave amplitude the strong nonlinearity acts on not only the maximum value but also the interacting process for the hydrodynamic characters the streaming collision at the cylinder backside causes the upwelling water and wave break leading to the return flow against the wave propagating the return flow induces the secondary peaks for both the front run up and the wave force the relative wave height of 0 35 0 4 is deemed as the threshold of the pronounced nonlinear phenomenon the time varying process and surface pattern are recognized by the image capture system for the front and back run up the truncated depth has little influence on the maximum front run up which is larger than the wave amplitude the maximum back run up is similar for all the submerged situations while the volume of the upwelling water increases with the submerged depth the wave break at the large wave amplitude causes the decrease of back run up for the elevated cylinder the imaging technique even fails to capture the back run up because of the splashing spray from the violent wave break the inline force dominated by the inertial wave force increases with the truncated depths and the wave amplitude the positive peak is lower than the predicted value and the negative peak is unpredictable due to the wave break the vertical force depends mainly on the rising wave surface the submerged cylinder with different depths has a similar vertical force in the same wave amplitude with the assumption of ignoring the effect of vertical force the translated pitching moment presents the acting position of the resultant inline force it is found that there is a threshold of the emergence of the pronounced nonlinear characteristics of wave force acting on a cylinder by a solitary wave of large amplitude to compare it with the secondary load cycle in the regular waves further work on the transient frequency of the hydrodynamic loads will be carried out in due course credit authorship contribution statement qian wang methodology investigation writing

constructions and the free floating elevated floating offshore wind turbines the interaction between the wave and cylinder appears strong nonlinearity the investigation of wave induced run up and load on the cylindrical structures has always been a hot issue due to the significance and complexity from the middle of the last century the diffraction theory has already been deduced for the calculation of wave impact on piles maccamy and fuchs 1954 along with the progression of scientific cognition the researchers have paid much attention to the higher order component for both the run up and wave load the excessive run up on standing legs leads to the green water numerous numerical and experimental researches have been conducted to recognize the run up on coastal column designed structures kriebel 1992 described the theoretical results for second order wave run up around a large diameter vertical circular cylinder the results explained a significant portion of the nonlinear wave run up distribution measured at all angles around the cylinder nielsen 2003 compared several methods on computing the run up along platform columns to experimental results more effort is recommended to put into understanding details of the run up phenomenon due to the fully nonlinear in the experimental study by morris thomas and thiagarajan 2004 the different harmonics of the wave run up on fixed surface piercing cylinders are examined to determine the importance of the local wave diffraction and incident wave nonlinearities they showed that the complete wave run up is not well accounted for by second order diffraction theory the work of chen et al 2014 indicated that openfoam is capable of accurate modelling of nonlinear wave interaction with offshore structures with up to 4th order harmonic correctly captured despite the above refined numerical results the experimental precision of run up is limited by measurement methods the wave gauges are commonly used to measure the surface elevation in the experiment of run up on the cylinder niedzwecki and duggal 1992 li et al 2012 the intrusive instrument can help to observe the diffraction and scattering handily however the water surface of the run up is the oblique crescent moon like style the wave gauge cannot catch the actual run up height and the bias increases with the run up height because of the stretch of the water surface not only that most studies focus on the maximum height but neglect the process of run up although the former seems more critical to coastal engineering the latter may provide inspired points of view on the nonlinear problem in terms of the wave load on cylinders some elaborate formulas have been established and modified rationally based on theoretical derivations or different empirical models niedzweck and huston 1992 huseby and grue 2000 paulsen et al 2014 fan et al 2018 the fundamental response of columns relates to the wave period while the higher harmonics in the forcing excite the unexpected frequency of the cylinders intermittently the second order diffraction programs are responsible for the sum frequency excitation that gives rose to springing and the ringing events occur as the higher order burst type forced by waves natvig and teigen 1993 the third order theories proposed by faltinsen et al 1995 attempted to explain the ringing phenomenon which is often associated with the third harmonic force moreover grue et al 1993 described a higher harmonic wave exciting force secondary load cycle leading to the oscillation at about one quarter of the wave period after the main peak chaplin et al 1997 stated that the amplitude of this oscillation was found to be a function predominantly of the wave steepness and simple numerical experiments showed that it might have an essential effect on ringing response grue and huseby 2002 concluded that the secondary load cycle gives a vital contribution to the build up of the resonant body at about four times the local wave frequency here the discussion on the nonlinearity rainey 2007 should be mentioned the high order solution on the wave frequency belongs to the weakly nonlinear theory however the secondary load cycle is a strongly nonlinear phenomenon accompanied with the local breaking and even formation of a cavitation bubble consequently the secondary load cycle is supposed to be studied as prominent nonlinear characteristics furthermore paulsen et al 2014 also marked the secondary load cycle for some particular examples belongs to a frequency range above the sixth harmonic wave frequency it should be regarded as an indicator of strongly nonlinear local flow rather than a direct contributor to the low order resonant forcing the troubling nonlinear effect creates the not well understood problem of wave induced run up and load on the cylinder the solitary wave is a well qualified subject to give an intuitive comprehension of the highly nonlinear process the nonlinear effects of a solitary wave on the runup and wave loads on a cylinder need further investigation besides the advantage of straightforward shape the solitary wave is also employed as the simplification to simulate the tsunami wave hsiao and lin 2010 some previous theoretical and numerical paper wang et al 1992 zhao et al 2007 cao and wan 2015 of solitary wave induced hydrodynamic characters on cylinders can be reviewed but the relevant experiment is a handful to the best of the authors knowledge the rarely available data owes to the small scale laboratory experiment given by yates and wang 1994 the undisturbed water depth was 4 cm and the radius of the bottom fixed cylinder was 6 35 cm the study focused on the wave field around the cylinder and the wave force the run up is the approximate value from the closest gauge of 0 2 cm away from the cylinder mo et al 2013 conducted the experiments on the interaction between the plunging solitary wave and a slender cylinder on a sloping beach the severe lack of trials makes the deficient reference for the deep going study on the nonlinear problem in this paper experiments are conducted to obtain the solitary wave induced run up and loads on the vertical truncated cylinder the primary objective is to provide referenced data for the study of the wave cylinder nonlinear problems especially the time varying process of the hydrodynamic characters an image capture technique and a six component balance system are employed respectively to report the run up and loading process on the cylinder the description of facilities and methods are presented in the next section the run up process is given in section 3 section 4 shows the hydrodynamic loads finally the conclusions are summarized 2 experimental facilities and set up the experiments are conducted in the tsunami basin for offshore region wang et al 2018 the basin is 42 4 m in length 4 m in width and 1 6 m in height an acrylic made cylinder with a pedestal is fixed on the steel structure in the center region of the basin nielsen 2003 used the calibrated vertical strings as the ruler to estimate the run up analogous to that a waterproof mask printed by the 2 cm side length mesh is glued around the surface of the cylinder as shown in fig 1 serving for the run up detection two cameras with the resolution of 1024 1024 at 100 fps record the run up process synchronously from the front and back of the cylinder the cameras are placed at the inclined top to avoid the shield of view as shown in fig 2 some led lights are employed to enhance the image quality it should be emphasized that the run up height η represents the elevation beyond the still water surface instead of the bottom of the cylinder the hydrodynamic loads are measured by a set of the force balance system at the 1 khz sample frequency which consists of four kistler 9317c piezoelectric 3 component sensors some conventional sensors only obtain no more than three orthogonal components of wave forces the system of four load cells can measure the three more moments wang et al 2019 the sensors are screwed between the cylinder and the supporting steel structure to ensure that hydrodynamic loads are responded integrally by the force balance system the size of the installation and the right handed system of load directions are shown in fig 2 the load center locates at the midpoint of the sensors array with the 1 5 cm height above the cylinder the water depth h is 50 cm in the present study the truncated depth g is the distance between the still water surface and the bottom of the cylinder given as 10 cm 5 cm 0 cm 5 cm and 10cm respectively the value of g 0 represents the submerged situation and the negative means elevated the relative wave height h h is from 0 1 to 0 5 with the 0 05 interval the generation of the solitary wave follows the modified goring s methodology proposed by malek mohammadi and testik 2010 the wave shape adopts grimshaw s third order solution grimshaw 1971 the free surface elevation for some wave conditions is shown in fig 3 measured by the wave gauge 10 m away from the cylinder the generation method is qualified by the consistency between the experimental data and the theoretical results 3 run up on the cylinder 3 1 the image capture technique the method of image processing is given as following pre take the static image fig 4 a before the wave incoming the mesh printed on the waterproof mask serves for the calibration the mesh lines are extracted by the binarization method with the appropriate threshold value the lowest line of the mesh locates at the still water surface and the interval between each line is 2 cm the present study focuses on the run up along the centerline of the cylinder therefore the two cameras are arranged to make the principal optic axis coplanar with the cylinder centerline marked in advance as thus the crosswise perspective deviation along the centerline can be neglected the corresponding height of each pixel along the centerline is interpolated linearly from the adjacent two extracted points fig 4b the solitary is generated after the preparation and the run up occurs fig 4c the interface of the run up water and the cylinder appears dim which presents the low grey value in the image matrix the distinct interface fig 4d is produced after binarizing the image with a threshold value and running the opening operation for the pixels i e the erosion and the subsequent dilation for the grey value finally the value η of the run up in the current image is obtained all images in each case are handled by the matlab code to obtain the run up process the accuracy of the interface capture depends on some threshold values chosen artificially by prior observation besides the errors in locating the interface come from the limited resolution obscure interface occasional light impulsion and numerical precision the automatic capture of the run up process is checked in some cases by manual operation frame by frame the results from the inspection and the repeated experiments show that the error in most cases is less than 0 1 cm with the largest error of about 0 4 cm at some extreme condition such as the violent breaking one example of the run up process is exhibited in fig 5 the curve is the raw data handled without any filtering the smooth of the curves qualifies the efficient auto capture of the interface to detect the run up process in the present paper the run up at the front and back centerline of the cylinder surface is discussed to focus on the secondary peak the run up along the whole surface of the cylinder can be captured by more cameras to obtain comprehensive data in the future 3 2 maximum and secondary peak of the front run up the maximum value ηf of front run up is normalized by the water depth fig 6 a the curve is fitted as the reference based on the data from g 0 by the superposition of the first and second order of h h byatt smith 1971 the apparent conclusion comes that the front run up increases with the wave amplitude the line of the slope k 1 proves that the front run up height is always larger than the wave amplitude another conclusion goes that the truncated depth has no significant effect on the maximum front run up even at the elevated situation g 0 the reason is that the cylinder diameter of 0 3 m is relatively small compared with the solitary wavelength of more than 5 m in this study for the better observation of the nonlinear effect the maximum front run up is normalized by the wave amplitude fig 6b the referenced curve is fitted with an additional constant term the result shows that the increase of wave amplitude leads to the larger relative growth of front run up height the trend is evident below h h 0 35 however the rise of ηf h weakens from h h 0 4 which could also be proved by the negative coefficient of the second order term herein two different patterns fig 7 exists during the maximum front run up occurring the first one fig 7a appears as the concave pattern not the real dent because of the perspective distortion when the value of h h is no more than 0 35 from h h 0 4 the curvature of the interface evolves to the convex fig 7b the change indicates that the run up height close to the cylinder centerline increases faster than that away from the centerline as the relative wave height increases a threshold of the pronounced nonlinear behavior is deemed around the value of h h 0 35 0 4 in some previous studies chaplin et al 1997 rainey 2007 paulsen et al 2014 the existence of a distinct return flow can be observed from the diffracted wave propagating around the cylinder after the passage of the wave crest the qualitative observation of the nonlinear surface deformation serves to explain the secondary peak here with the image capture technique we find that the return flow causes the secondary front run up fig 8 for the small wave amplitude h h 0 35 the trend of the front run up process is consistent with the varying surface of the solitary wave the large wave amplitude h h 0 35 results in two differences in the front run up process one is the occurrence of the secondary peak the other is the fast falling of water in the primary run up take the example of h h 0 4 the dimensionless time for the lasting of the primary mount is about 6 which consists of the raising process of 5 and the decline process of 1 from the image results and the field observation the front run up process for the large wave amplitude can be interpreted as follows the larger wave leads to higher front run up due to the more substantial nonlinear effect the extra high run up caused by the wavefront cannot be maintained in the wave deceleration phase therefore the running up water drops quickly the falling water volume contributes to the violent break around the truncated cylinder even making the water surface elevation below the cylinder bottom when the wave tail and the return flow from the cylinder back come the surface elevation rises again leading to the secondary run up the value of h h 0 35 0 4 is the threshold for the emergence of the secondary front run up 3 3 maximum and pattern of the back run up the mechanism of the front run up is the common sense of water climbing on the obstacle but the back run up comes from the stack of the water flowing around the circumference and bottom of the truncated cylinder the maximum back run up height ηb is normalized and fitted in fig 9 the value of ηb at the submerged situation g 0 is always similar to the corresponding wave amplitude for the elevated situation ηb rises substantially at g 5 cm at the large wave amplitude and descends slightly at the case of g 10cm the value of h h 0 35 0 4 is indicated again to be the turning point for the nonlinear process the images of the moment that the maximum height occurs are focused on understanding the back run up further for the small wave amplitude the pattern of back run up seems similar to that of the front run up as shown in fig 7a the smooth back run up process with no break displays a concave interface along the cylinder backside however the back run up pattern changes at the large wave amplitude fig 10 the wave propagating around the cylinder encounters at the cylinder backside in the submerged situation g 0 fig 10 a c the collision makes the water surface upwell and roll outwards although the maximum run up height ηb is similar the water volume increases with the g value leading to the larger width of the upwelling water as marked by the cyan color for the elevated cylinder g 0 fig 10 d e the impact of water on the cylinder bottom results in the plentiful spray which makes the image post process failing to obtain the back run up the splashing spray causes excessive detected height for the back run up in the case of g 5cm however the violent break around the cylinder reduces the back run up in the case of g 10cm as a result the streaming collision at the cylinder backside is the causation of the secondary peak the upwelling water generates the return flow against the wave propagating leading to the secondary front run up and the load discussed later 4 hydrodynamic loads on the cylinder the three component forces and moments are measured the specific configuration of the cylinder makes that the lateral force f y yawing moment m z and rolling moment m x are much smaller fig 11 than the inline force f x vertical force f z and pitching moment m y therefore only the latter three loads are discussed in the following section 4 1 maximum and secondary peak of the inline force the morison equation morison et al 1950 seems to be suitable in the present characteristic scale to estimate the inline force however the high harmonic force induced by the complex diffraction and scattering and even the wave break makes the morison equation fail to estimate the force in the nonlinear situation herein the inline force calculated by the morison equation is given as the reference fig 12 a the drag coefficient of 0 8 and the inertia coefficient of 2 result in the over estimated value than the experimental results the inline force appears as a positive zone and a negative zone no matter of the g values the variation of the inline force is gentle in the wave acceleration phase the positive zone in fig 12a but in the wave decelerating phase the negative zone in fig 12a the wave break and the diffraction result in the fluctuation of the force this sense can be an analogy with the run up the pattern of the run up during the wavefront is ordered while the subsequent flow due to the wave collision and break leads to the chaotic process in the study on the steep regular wave the magnitude of the secondary load cycle was seen to be more pronounced in the long wave regime paulsen et al 2014 here for the solitary wave classified as the long wave the secondary peak for the inline force occurs at the case of h h 0 35 fig 12b the degree of the nonlinear phenomena increases with the wave amplitude an evident peak can be even observed for h h 0 5 moreover the timing is about one quarter of the significant wave period later than the main peak consistent with the results for the regular wave grue and huseby 2002 the secondary cycle in the regular wave may cause a hazard to the offshore structure due to the repeated action from the four times of the local wave frequency although the solitary wave does not have this global effect the deformation of the free surface brings the local effects on the wave loads in a solitary wave of large amplitude the secondary peak of the solitary wave might have less influence on the structure than that of the regular wave however it is interesting to understand the characteristics of hydrodynamic loads on a cylinder under the action of a solitary wave of different amplitudes particularly at large amplitude besides for the non stationary process the frequency should be ever changing the frequency value has to be a function of time the concept of instantaneous frequency is necessary for understanding the detailed mechanisms for the nonlinear process huang et al 2009 the instantaneous frequency just depends on the local data instead of the sequential signal this problem deserves further study to analyze the influence of the issue of frequency the maximum value of the inline force increases with the relative wave height h h and the truncated depth g fig 13 a although the morison equation may not apply to the present truncated cylinder the calculated positive peaks divided by the coefficient of 1 5 can yet accord with the experimental data it represents that the positive inline force can still be evaluated as the sum of the drag force and the inertial force provided the appropriate force coefficient however the variation of the negative peak has no explicit law because of the wave break furthermore the peaks are normalized by ρghhr in fig 13b to reveal the influence of the wave amplitude the nonlinear effect emerges with the increasing wave amplitude as a result the curve of the positive peak gradually flattens which is the same as the trend of the front run up in fig 6b 4 2 maximum and secondary peak of the vertical force the maximum vertical force normalized by ρgh 2 r increases with the wave amplitude fig 14 a the net buoyancy is eliminated before the measurement the pressure from the rising wave surface i e the additional buoyancy plays an important role therefore the submerged situations g 0 has little influence on the peak of vertical force and the values decline with the elevated height g 0 the maximum vertical force normalized by ρghhr decreases with the wave amplitude fig 14b the growing nonlinearity leads to the decline of the relative vertical force because the enhanced wave break around the cylinder leads to the declining pressure on the cylinder bottom the loading process for different g values fig 15 a indicates that the vertical forces on the submerged cylinder g 0 are consistent and smooth in contrast the wave impact and break at the bottom of the truncated cylinder g 0 leads to the fluctuated force herein the secondary peak of the vertical force is also observed in the case of h h 0 35 for the submerged cylinder fig 15b this nonlinear effect appears at the large wave amplitude which is similar to that in the run up and the inline force the return flow from the streaming collision causes rising surface elevation leading to the secondary peak of the vertical force the vertical force is not usually concerned since the damage of cylinder structure often results from the deficiency of the inline force even so the results of the vertical force may help to add some acknowledge to the nonlinear process 4 3 maximum of pitching moment and the acting position of inline force the pitching moment is generated by both the inline force and the vertical force but the inline force dominates the pitching moment in the present system because of the much longer arm given in fig 2 consequently fig 16 is almost the upside down presentation of fig 13 since the positive inline force causes the negative pitching moment and vice versa the value of l 1 09 m is the force arm from the cylinder bottom to the center of the balance system for the study on the acting position of the resultant inline force the pitching moment center is translated to the water surface as shown as the inset in fig 17 with the assumption of ignoring the effect of vertical force on the pitching moment the value of m y and f x can reflect the action point of the resultant inline force at the initial stage of the solitary wave before the timing a the inline force loads mainly on the submerged part of the cylinder s zone as a result the positive f x causes the negative clockwise m y between the timing a and b the coming of wavefront leads to the increasing inline force and the decreasing negative pitching moments it means that the action point of inline force moves upwards following the rising water surface but it remains in the s zone until the inline force reaches the maximum value when the wave crest approaches between the timing b and c the decreasing inertia force results in the decline of inline force the positive f x and the positive m y indicate that the action point locates in the u zone after the timing c the leaving away of the wave causes the negative f x and the positive m y the action point moves back to the s zone which is the reversed process before timing a the fluctuation comes from the influence of the violent wave break 5 conclusions the experiments are carried out to investigate the solitary wave induced run up and loads on the vertical truncated cylinder different truncated depths and wave amplitudes are tested to understand the nonlinear problem further the nonlinearity of the problem emerges with the increase of wave amplitude the strong nonlinearity acts on not only the maximum value but also the interacting process for the hydrodynamic characters the streaming collision at the cylinder backside causes the upwelling water and wave break leading to the return flow against the wave propagating the return flow induces the secondary peaks for both the front run up and the wave force the relative wave height of 0 35 0 4 is deemed as the threshold of the pronounced nonlinear phenomenon the time varying process and surface pattern are recognized by the image capture system for the front and back run up the truncated depth has little influence on the maximum front run up which is larger than the wave amplitude the maximum back run up is similar for all the submerged situations while the volume of the upwelling water increases with the submerged depth the wave break at the large wave amplitude causes the decrease of back run up for the elevated cylinder the imaging technique even fails to capture the back run up because of the splashing spray from the violent wave break the inline force dominated by the inertial wave force increases with the truncated depths and the wave amplitude the positive peak is lower than the predicted value and the negative peak is unpredictable due to the wave break the vertical force depends mainly on the rising wave surface the submerged cylinder with different depths has a similar vertical force in the same wave amplitude with the assumption of ignoring the effect of vertical force the translated pitching moment presents the acting position of the resultant inline force it is found that there is a threshold of the emergence of the pronounced nonlinear characteristics of wave force acting on a cylinder by a solitary wave of large amplitude to compare it with the secondary load cycle in the regular waves further work on the transient frequency of the hydrodynamic loads will be carried out in due course credit authorship contribution statement qian wang methodology investigation writing

21269,factors affecting the cyclic response of seabed around offshore foundations are associated with soil structure wave loading and drainage conditions constitutive theories proposed to account for these factors in the design of such soil structure systems must be able to capture the essentials of seabed dynamics in this paper a combined theoretical numerical study on dynamic response of sandy seabed focusing on nonlinear soil constitutive behavior is presented the manuscript is of threefold first part presents a rigorous theoretical study to evaluate the cyclic behavior of seabed using the framework of bounding surface plasticity focus here is on more effectively modeling the elemental response particularly liquefaction a new hardening law is proposed to incorporate into the modified bounding surface model which is found to be the effective formulation addressing the wave induced nonlinear seabed behavior second part presents a number of cyclic triaxial tests simulated to verify the new constitutive formulation in the third part a poro elasto plastic numerical model in terms of the extended nonlinear finite element form of the discretized coupled flow deformation equations is developed then free field wave induced dynamic response of sandy seabed is evaluated on various problems presenting the capability of the proposed constitutive formulation in capturing residual liquefaction keywords bounding surface finite elements hardening law liquefaction of sandy seabed nonlinear dynamic response poro elasto plasticity 1 introduction cyclic loading in the form of ocean waves constitute a significant part of the design of coastal geotechnical engineering systems geomechanical considerations are particularly important in identifying the conditions leading to instability of such systems under cyclic excitations among those engineering soil properties in terms of stress strain relationships dynamic shear strength characteristics and hydraulic conductivity are necessary properties to be determined to decide whether there will be permanent deformations in the seabed foundations or indirectly in the upper offshore structures during such events therefore it is of utmost significance that cyclic soil behavior is both measured in the laboratory through physical model tests and modeled through theoretical frameworks which are in turn verified by such test results while the former have been conducted since the early 20th century it was not until the late 1970 s that the latter theoretical and numerical works emerge since then theoretical modeling studies have focused on sands and sand like granular seabed to identify the conditions leading to failure such as liquefaction therefore constitutive theories used to evaluate the behavior of sands should ideally achieve a certain accuracy in tackling the geomechanics problem many theories have been proposed with that objective in related literature firstly mroz et al 1978 proposed the multi surface plasticity theory the actual constitutive model based upon such a theory is further developed by mroz et al 1981 another more elaborate yet simpler theory is proposed independently by krieg 1975 and dafalias and popov 1975 which was later enhanced to be the model we know today as the bounding surface plasticity by dafalias and hermann 1982 a yielding surface and a bounding surface are used in the model the former of which resides inside the latter poorooshasb and pietruszczak 1986 proposed a two surface model that makes use of bounding surface to predict the dynamic behavior of soils which also accounts for the plastic deformations during unloading in order to overcome some of the limitations associated with the general form of bounding surface plasticity a generalized plasticity theory gpt is developed by zienkiewicz and mroz 1984 although the theory does not disprove the basic notion of the classical plasticity the fact that it needs only a handful of measurable parameters to construct the theory without reference to a yield or a bounding surface makes it an appealing one to adopt in addressing the dynamic response of soils zienkiewicz et al 1985 incorporated a bounding surface into gpt which is later expanded by pastor et al 1985 in the work of pastor et al 1990 however there is no surface definition required to define the yielding condition or evaluate plastic deformations such theory was employed by ulker 2017 2018 and 2019 cyclic plasticity of granular soils and particularly liquefaction are published in many studies in the last two decades one of the early ones is the multi surface plasticity model developed by elgamal et al 2002 the cyclic mobility and liquefaction behavior of sand are modeled in their work using a different surface in each plastic flow step papadimitriou et al 2001 papadimitriou and bouckovalas 2002 and later papadimitriou et al 2005 models the plastic behavior of sands under various sample preparation methods as well as low and high cyclic shear strains osinov 2003 develops an incremental model for the earthquake induced deformations of sand fu et al 2007 presents a study on the development of a constitutive model and thoroughly calibrated the results with experiments in another study wang and zhang 2007 and later zhang and wang 2012 develop a model for the cyclic behavior of liquefied loose sands with large deformations andrade 2009 models the instability of loose sands due to liquefaction he showed that the liquefaction criterion in the model can be explained by the available failure criteria for soils and performed quantitative analysis of the loss of stability that would cause liquefaction due to the effect in the radial loading direction andrianopoulos et al 2010 proposes a bounding surface model bsm and computes the liquefaction of geo structures due to seismic waves ye et al 2012 studies the post liquefaction change in anisotropy via gpt and analyzes the response through numerical modeling boulanger and ziotopoulou 2013 formulates a plane strain model for geotechnical earthquake engineering problems post liquefaction shear deformations are predicted by the model developed by wang et al 2014 the liquefaction potential of seabed around coastal structures has been the topic of interest for the last few decades some of them on liquefaction of granular materials stand out zen and yamazaki 1990 sumer and fredsøe 2002 ulker 2012 ulker et al 2012 2018 ye et al 2015 ye and wang 2015 only limited number of research studies try to shed a light on the nonlinear response of seabed soil under waves poorooshasb and ishihara 1987 considers seabed as a porous material with a non linear stress strain law believed to represent the mode of deformation of the solid phase the numerical technique used is a hybrid finite difference finite element scheme gatmiri 1990 presents finite element analyses studying the wave induced response of seabed yang et al 1994 presents progressive wave induced liquefaction of sand deposits with a non linear analysis procedure and later yang 1997 studies the standing wave induced response of seabed using the non associative generalized plasticity based bounding surface model proposed by yang 1997 noorzad 1999 evaluates the elasto plastic behavior of sandy seabed under standing waves using the original canasand model sassa and sekiguchi 1999 and later sassa and sekiguchi 2001 both measured and predicted the wave induced loose sand response with pioneering experiments and rigorous numerical study respectively ulker 2009 makes use of two surface cyclic plasticity model and evaluates the poro elasto plastic dynamic response of seabed in free field in a more recent work zhu et al 2019 studies the effects of principal stress rotations on wave induced response of elasto plastic sandy seabed while numerous other works are published studying the wave induced seabed response around coastal and offshore structures not many focus on the accurate analysis of wave induced nonlinear cyclic behavior of seabed soil in this paper a combined theoretical and numerical study on the analysis of dynamic response of sandy seabed is presented specific attention is paid to the elemental level elasto plastic behavior of sandy seabed firstly a rigorous comparative study of stress strain behavior of saturated sandy seabed is performed utilizing the constitutive theories of bounding surface plasticity and generalized plasticity here a non associated two surface bounding surface model with mixed hardening and a no surface generalized plasticity model with deviatoric strain hardening are employed a novel hardening rule in terms of combined isotropic kinematic hardening is proposed and incorporated into the bounding surface formulation to more accurately and efficiently address the wave induced dynamic behavior of sandy seabed secondly a number of undrained cyclic triaxial tests are simulated to put the theories into a rigorous test for identifying the most accurate and effective formulation necessary to quantify the cyclic dynamic response complex stress paths are run at this point to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified bounding plasticity model with the new hardening rule compared to the generalized plasticity formulation finally the late bounding plasticity model achieving better validation is implemented into an in house finite element code in c a fully coupled poro elasto plastic numerical model is developed where the proposed bounding surface model is incorporated into the extended nonlinear finite element form of the discretized coupled flow deformation equations then the wave induced dynamic response of free field seabed is evaluated the results are validated with wave flume experiments at macro level capturing essentially the residual liquefaction of loose sand 2 constitutive modeling of wave induced cyclic elasto plastic behavior of sand in this section a modified constitutive framework is presented to model the dynamic behavior of saturated sandy seabed soil it is a two surface cyclic plastic model with mixed hardening originally proposed by poorooshasb and pietruszczak 1985 and later modified by poorooshasb and pietruszczak 1986 capable of modeling the cyclic and monotonic behavior of non cohesive granular soils the theory is implemented into a computer program and related computational tools are developed to analyze the dynamic response of sand under cyclic loadings this section of the paper presents a theoretical study of the proposed model with the idea of demonstrating its capability and yet some drawbacks associated with its formulation and ease to implement into a numerical scheme such as the classical finite element method is also discussed 2 1 bounding surface plasticity model with mixed hardening this model consists of two families of surfaces a yield and a bounding surface where the former serves the purpose of distinguishing the elastic strains from that of plastic ones and where the latter separates communicable stress paths from that of non communicable ones in the formulation a new hardening rule in terms of calculating the plastic hardening modulus during stress reversals is developed in addition a simple method of evaluating the location of center of the yield surface as well as the image stresses located on the bounding surface based upon the current stress vector is incorporated into the formulation using simple vector algebra this way kinematic hardening law of the model now better suits to implement into a finite element software the bounding surface is defined in the set of axis σ1 2 3 as in fig 1 with the equation 1 f σ η g θ i 0 where the three invariants defined here are 2 σ s i j s i j 2 i σ i i 3 j 3 s i j s j k s k i 3 s i j σ i j σ k k δ i j 3 the yield surface is defined in σ 1 2 3 space which moves within the bounding surface 3 f σ η g θ i 0 in 1 η η f ε p a ε p is the function that keeps the history of the plastic distortion where a is the isotropic hardening parameter and η f 2 sin φ f 3 sin φ f where φ f is the angle of friction at failure this way isotropic hardening is governed during virgin loading of the soil when the bounding and yield surfaces are tangential to each other along the stress vector function g θ is the lode s angle function

s i j s j k s k i 3 s i j σ i j i α i j and α ij is the unit tensor along the axis of the yield surface also defined as the back stress or the center location of the yield surface in this study the shape of the yield surface on the deviatoric plane is assumed to be circular giving g θ 1 which simplifies the subsequent analyses 2 1 1 evaluation of plastic strains it is necessary to distinguish the virgin loading vl process from that of stress reversals sr or unloading reloading cycles during loading thus while the flow rule inherently does not change the way it is evaluated does so during vl a non associated flow rule is described by using a global plastic potential function g σ η defined as 6 g σ η σ η c i g θ ln i i 0 0 where i 0 is a constant and η c is the critical history parameter defining the value of σ i for which plastic strain d ε i i p 0 with an analogy to the critical state theory flow rule is then written for vl and sr as 7a d ε p d λ g σ η σ i j d λ dev g σ i j dev g σ i j 7b d ε i j p n i j n i j d σ i j h l s r where dev g σ i j is the deviatoric component of the potential gradient dλ is the positive scalar h l sr is the plastic modulus during sr and n i j and n i j are the unit vectors normal to the local plastic potential g and to the yield surface respectively in vl stress point lies on the bounding surface along which yield surface coincides hence during vl and sr the consistency conditions must independently be satisfied as in classical plasticity local plastic potential is defined similar to the global one as 8 g σ i β 2 β 1 i 2 σ β 2 ln i 2 σ β 2 β 3 0 with 9 β 1 η c g θ β 2 1 5 dev α i j dev α i j α k k 2 1 2 plastic hardening modulus the material property that controls the development of plastic strains during loading processes is the plastic hardening modulus while the material exhibits strain hardening plastic hardening modulus essentially provides the necessary link between the applied load and that of irrecoverable deformation during vl h l vl modulus is calculated as 10 h l v l f η η ε p dev g σ i j dev g σ i j in this study a new way of calculating the plastic modulus during stress reversals h l sr depending upon the position of stress tensor on the yield surface relative to the bounding surface is proposed as 11 h l s r h l b s h l h 0 h l where 12 h l h l b s δ 0 δ γ h 0 1 e 0 λ κ where γ is the kinematic hardening constant h l b s is the value on f 0 surface during sr as 13 h l b s h l v l g σ f σ along with initial void ratio e 0 slope of virgin loading λ and elastic unloading line κ the angle between the stress vector and its counterpart on f 0 σ f1 is δ and the corresponding angle between the stress on the other side of the bounding surface σ f2 and its couple σ f1 is δ 0 as 14a δ cos 1 σ i j σ f 1 σ k l σ k l σ f 1 σ f 1 ½ 14b δ 0 cos 1 σ f 2 σ f 1 σ f 2 σ f 2 σ f 1 σ f 1 ½ we need to determine the locations of these stresses in terms of kinematic hardening law 2 1 3 kinematic hardening law in this study the space diagonal of i j identified by δ and that of the local space i j identified by α as well as the stress tensor itself σ are all taken as coplanar fig 2 satisfying necessary stress space geometrical considerations ulker 2009 since the bounding surface and its axis are fixed this rule needs to be formulated using α as 15 d α α i j m 1 d m 1 α i j m 2 d m 2 where m 1 and m 2 are the components of α it is now important that the initial location of the yield surface α 0 is determined this condition requires unit normal vectors to be equal at the current stress point 16 n f f σ i j f σ i j f σ i j ½ n i j f σ i j f σ i j f σ i j ½ in this study a simple technique based on vector algebra that is consistent with the rest of the model is incorporated into the theory to calculate the back stress and obtain σ f1 and σ f2 stresses initial unit vector α α 0 in the beginning of unloading is first evaluated as 17 α σ d from the equation of yield surface we know that q p 2 η with q p being triaxial stresses also 18 α σ 2 d 2 1 2 σ 2 2 σ η 1 2 η 2 2 1 2 using 18 and fig 3 we can write 19 α σ 2 σ η 1 2 η 2 n f having found the initial location of the yield surface in order to initiate the translation rule for the yield surface locations of σ f 1 and σ f 2 on the projected deviatoric stress plane π plane need to be determined σ f 1 and σ f 2 are both located on the bounding surface and guide the kinematics of the yield surface if the current stress point is located on the yield surface then its conjugate can be found as 20 f s i j c s i j c 2 η g θ 1 i c 0 since i i c is constant volumetric and deviatoric components are simply derived as σ i i c σ i i and s i j c λ 1 s i j respectively which when substituted in the bounding surface gives 21 λ 1 η g θ 1 i σ 0 with 22 s f 1 η g θ 1 i σ s i j or in triaxial stress state q f 1 2 η g θ 1 i f 1 the conjugate stress vector can be back calculated for the triaxial case using q f 1 and p f 1 since p f 1 p i and for the general 3 d case in terms of s f1 and σ f 1 i i for other stress states equivalent manipulation can be made and the s f1 stress vector can be calculated the datum stress vector can then be derived as described in fig 4 as 23 s f 2 s σ f 2 σ leading to 24 σ f 2 σ λ 2 σ f 1 σ where λ 2 can be evaluated if 24 is substituted into f 0 yielding 25 λ 2 η g θ 2 i σ σ f 1 σ σ f 1 σ 2 1 2 since i i f2 and σ s i j s i j 2 1 2 equation 24 gives in fact the stress point on the bounding surface of the line drawn in the π plane which cuts the bounding surface at these stresses now that the initial location of the yield surface is known we can calculate the kinematic components m 1 and m 2 through 15 by using the consistency condition in sr written in terms of α i j and 15 m 1 and m 2 are determined and the new yield surface is updated using 26 α k 1 α k m 1 d m 1 m 2 d m 2 since translation of the yield surface must be perpendicular to its axis α ij it can be readily shown that 27 d α i j d μ α f 1 α k l α f 1 α i j where α f 1 is the unit tensor specifying the location of the f 1 stress point the existence of the so called f 1 yield surface helps ensure that as the stress vector moves towards the bounding surface it approaches to a constant f 1 surface which is tangent to the bounding surface at the f 1 point the location of this surface can be found by writing 28 α f 1 σ f 1 λ f σ σ f 1 λ f σ σ f 1 λ f σ 1 2 where λ is calculated from 21 and d μ in 27 is calculated using the consistency condition of α i j as 29 d μ f σ i j d σ i j f α i j α f 1 α k l α f 1 α i j the incremental change in the axis of the yield surface can be evaluated using 27 2 1 4 stress strain relationship stress strain relation need to be derived for both vl and sr in terms of the elasto plastic constitutive matrix d ep leading to the final relationship after some vector algebra as 30 d σ i j d v l e p d ε i j d e d e g σ i j f σ i j d e h l v l f σ i j d e g σ i j d ε i j for the sr the above relation is in similar form except that instead of f g and h l vl the functions f q and h l sr should be employed giving 31 d s r e p d e d e n i j t n i j d e n i j d e n i j t h l s r equation 31 yields the explicit integration form of the fourth order material rigidity matrix and if one needs to employ an implicit scheme to integrate this stress strain relationship related tangential stiffness must also be derived which would then be called the consistent tangent stiffness for interested readers 3 cyclic triaxial test simulations in this section of the paper a number of cyclic triaxial tests are simulated using both of the frameworks of the modified bounding surface plasticity and generalized plasticity formulations presented above the first simulation presents the results of a cyclic triaxial strain controlled test conducted by ishihara and okada 1982 here a constant strain amplitude varying between 0 05 and 0 71 was applied it can be seen in fig 5 that the sample s effective stress is reduced progressively which from the beginning accompanies the generation of pore pressure leading to liquefaction after a number of cycles specimen liquefies with no mean effective stress left here q and p are the deviatoric and mean stresses respectively and ε s is shear strain fig 6 presents the strain controlled undrained cyclic triaxial test simulation results with the parameters g 20000 kpa k0 30000 kpa at p 225 kpa a 0 0025 γ 2 0 η f 0 52 η c 0 43 and η 0 02 the shear strain is kept constant at 0 3 in both compression and extension side yielding a reduction in shear stresses following number of cycles of loading the specimen reaches a complete state of liquefaction at the end of the test the simulation results of shear stress shear strain relationship and the stress path curves agree well with the results presented in pietruszczak and poorooshasb 1985 one of the aims of the present study is to model the behavior of sandy seabed under increasing cycles of loading in the case when initially large stress ratios are applied to the soil specimen such tests have been conducted by ishihara and okada 1982 and are simulated here again while it is of necessary characteristic property for any constitutive model to predict the observed cyclic behavior of sandy soils such a rather more complex behavior under an initially sheared soil sample with specific cyclic stress ratios provides more information about the capability of the modified theory itself thus the results predicted in figs 7 and 8 serve as valuable information fig 7 shows a group of comparisons made for a loose sand cyclic behavior under stress controlled undrained test the soil sample is sheared at a relatively large stress ratio and the bsm with the hardening law proposed in this study gives out better results than the initial simulation made by poorooshasb and pietruszczak 1986 using the actual formulation of the model simulation is compared with ishihara and okada 1982 test results the results of modified bsm with the new hardening rule well simulate the liquefaction response of loose sand and capture the main features of liquefaction for this large initial stress ratio test fig 8 presents another undrained cyclic triaxial test simulation with high compression side stress ratio the modified bsm improves the results of the model as well while the idea is to identify the features of the bsm leading to a better modeling of the test rather more sophisticated and versatile nature of the bsm with the current hardening law is used in the subsequent section of the study in terms of analysis of dynamic response of seabed 4 finite element analysis of cyclic poro elasto plastic seabed response 4 1 governing equations the equations governing the dynamic response of soils are the coupled flow and deformation equations developed by biot 1941 who later extended them to include inertial terms biot 1955 in this section the above theoretical formulation now tested at the elemental level against undrained triaxial tests has now been implemented into an in house finite element fe code developed to run for the biot s poroelasticity theory now called poro elasto plasticity d arcy s law takes place in the formulation to govern the pore water flow by ignoring the inertial forces associated with the motion of pore water the equations can be written in the partially dynamic pd form as follows 32 σ i j j ρ g i ρ u i 33 p w i ρ w g i ρ w u i w i k i ρ w g i 34 ε i i w i i n k f p w where ρ and ρ w are the total density of soil and water n is porosity k f is bulk modulus of pore water g is the gravitational acceleration and k i is the permeability coefficient as for variable unknowns σ i j is the total stress tensor u is solid phase displacement w is the relative displacement of pore water with respect to solid grains p w is the pore water pressure and ε i i is the rate of change of volumetric strain of the solid part in the system is the time derivative and denotes the spatial derivatives with respect to cartesian coordinates if we neglect the fluid accelerations and combine 33 and 34 the final equation set is now written in vectorial form as 35 t σ ρ g ρ u 0 36 t u t k ρ f g p w ρ f g ρ f u n k f p w 0 where the field variables of this mathematical formulation are now u and p w it should be noted here that u solid displacement is inherent in total stress which should now be replaced with the elasto plastic constitutive relation described in the previous section provided that the principle of effective stress is employed further neglecting the accelerations of solid phase u return the quasi static formulation qs ulker and rahman 2009 4 2 finite element formulation approximating the field variables

equations is carried out using the modified forward euler method mfe sloan 1987 this method is a fully explicit integration scheme requiring the previous converged stresses σ n strains ε n as well as the isotropic and kinematic hardening parameters ε n η n α n to update the current values of variables σ n 1 ε n 1 ε n 1 η n 1 α n 1 in order to achieve convergence at the material point level a sub stepping or sub incrementation technique is used here the sub stepping scheme employs reduction in the total strain allowing the calculations to be made for small increments in the mfe scheme the sub steps do not necessarily have to have constant size and the method also accounts for the error made at each sub step mfe essentially employs a two step euler procedure to estimate the error produced by the standard euler technique and calculates the required number of substeps at the end of time step t k we write 45 σ k 1 i σ k d σ 1 i 46 ε p k 1 i ε p k d ε p 1 i 47 α k 1 i α k d α 1 i where k is the sub step number ε p is the total plastic strain d ε p is the total plastic strain increment α is the back stress and d α is the increment in back stress subscript 1 indicates the first step incremental values and 2 the second step the increments with subscript 1 are evaluated at σ k ε p k and α k in a usual manner presented before as the total strain increment need to be divided into sub steps we have 48 δ ε k t k δ ε the above variables can now be updated by taking the averages of the first two estimates 49 σ k 1 i σ k d σ 1 i d σ 2 i 2 50 ε p k 1 i ε p k d ε p 1 i d ε p 2 i 2 51 α k 1 i α k d α 1 i d α 2 i 2 where d σ 2 i d ε p 2 i and d α 2 i are evaluated at σ k 1 i ε p k 1 and α k 1 i relative error is calculated as 52 r e k 1 e k 1 σ k 1 where e k 1 is the local error size of each sub step is constantly updated until r e k 1 t o l is satisfied 4 4 correcting for drift with a return algorithm the size of the steps and the manner in which equation 42 is evaluated differ between different algorithms in terms of integrating the d ep matrix all essentially assume a constant matrix for each load step this however is an approximation as the d ep matrix varies continuously with changes in stress despite the use of small steps in the post yield range it is found in practice that the predicted state of stress at the end of a loading increment may not lie on the current yield or bounding surface the deviation is more pronounced in the case of hardening as such discrepancies are cumulative it is important to ensure that the stresses are corrected back to the current yield surface at each step of the calculation several techniques for correcting the yield stresses have been proposed in the literature potts and gens 1985 ortiz and simo 1986 crisfield 1991 then the problem becomes to decide in what manner the stresses at the new point lying outside of the yield surface should be corrected so that in vl f σ k 1 ε p k 1 0 and in sr f σ k 1 α k 1 0 is satisfied in this study projection of stresses back to yield or bounding surface along the plastic flow direction is employed which is expressed as 53 σ c o r r σ t r i a l δ g σ where δ is a scalar σ c o r r is the corrected stress and σ t r i a l is the trial stress the corrected stress must satisfy the equation of bounding surface in vl as f σ c o r r ε c o r r f σ t r i a l δ g σ ε n 0 and the equation of yield surface in sr as f σ c o r r α c o r r f σ t r i a l δ g σ α n 0 it is assumed that the hardening parameters during vl and sr do not change if these are expanded in taylor s series and the δ 2 terms are neglected for vl and sr we get the following respectively 54a δ f σ ε p t r i a l f σ g σ i n i t i a l 54b δ f σ α t r i a l f σ g σ i n i t i a l gradients of the surfaces as well as the potential functions are calculated at the initial or converged step before the prediction is made whose stress vector lies on the corresponding surfaces then the new stress satisfying these surfaces are calculated from 53 the presented constitutive equations are implemented into an fe program at each gauss point flexibility of choosing the sub stepping procedure and allowing correction for yield and bounding surface drifts at the end of either each sub step or the current time step is introduced into the program the switch from vl to sr is decided upon a quantity calculated as 55 cos ϕ ε i j p e i j p ε i j p ε i j p e i j p e i j p where ϕ is the spatial angle between the direction of the deviatoric plastic strain rate ε i j p and that of accumulated plastic strain deviation e i j p here we define e i j p as 56 e i j p 0 t ε i j p t d t where t is time and t is a monotonically increasing quantity whenever 55 undergoes a change in sign then the element is said to be experiencing load reversal 4 5 free field seabed response under wave loading the presented fe formulation is validated through some basic problems where the dynamic response of a seabed soil under hydrostatic and harmonic wave loading is evaluated the stress strain relationship of seabed at elemental level is governed by the modified bounding surface plasticity formulation in doing so the most effective and computationally efficient fe formulation is sought to implement the model to satisfy convergence mfe scheme is used for that matter fig 9 shows the free field seabed problem with the soil being modeled as a saturated porous medium under infinitely long progressive wave loading also in the figure is the numerical model of 1 d seabed along with the specified boundary conditions under two forms of loading a constant hydrostatic load assuming no wave effect fig 9c and another harmonic wave form fig 9d the first problem considers the dynamic response of a seabed column under constant step load as in fig 9c horizontal flow along lateral boundaries and vertical flow through rigid and impermeable bottom are prevented the variation of young s modulus poorooshasb and yang 1990 is taken as 57 e e 0 a 0 1 2 ν i where a 0 is the method constant for calibration ν is the poisson s ratio and e 0 is the initial value of the modulus of elasticity i in this problem non linear fe analyses are carried out and the results are presented in terms of pore water pressure and vertical effective stresses of the qs and pd formulations in figs 10 and 11 respectively the model parameters are given for this first problem in table 1 in the analyses the effect of isotropic hardening parameter a on the results is studied and found to be insignificant since there is no stress reversal in the domain kinematic hardening parameter γ does not have any role here either effect of permeability values on the results is also studied we can see in figs 10 and 11 that the non linearity of soil constitutive behavior decreases the pore pressure magnitudes but increases the effective vertical stresses for each permeability value such a difference between linear and non linear solutions is more pronounced as the inertial term associated with the motion of soil skeleton is considered in the pd formulation except for pore pressures obtained for the lowest permeability k 10 5m s vertical effective stresses obtained from qs and pd formulations indicate that the poro elasto plastic behavior yields slightly larger stresses for various permeability values compared to the poro elastic response also in the pore pressure response observed an instant magnitude for k 10 5m s that is larger than the applied load this could be attributed to the observed mandel cryer effect that commonly occur in porous media consolidation under constant loading fig 12 shows the non linear distributions of pore pressure for both formulations where taking into account the accelerations of soil solids slightly raises the discrepancy between magnitudes it should be noted that in all the figures the poroelastic solutions match with their analytical counterparts derived by ulker and rahman 2009 in order to verify the formulation a free field seabed model is developed under harmonic surface wave excitation for a low frequency wave with t 1 6 s pore pressure response results are obtained and compared with the laboratory wave flume experiments of sumer et al 2012 the wave flume is 0 6 m wide and 26 5 m long where the water depth is kept constant at d 0 55 m in the experiment saturated sandy soil sediment is placed in a pit of 0 78 m wide and h 0 4 m thick and pore pressure measurements are taken at various depths inside the soil necessary parameters are given in table 1 fig 13 presents the time history of pore pressure heads computed by the fe analyses and measured by sumer et al 2012 at a depth of z 0 085 m and z 0 24 m for two wave heights of h 7 7 cm and 18 cm inertial terms are ignored in the numerical solution based upon previous studies of similar problem ulker and rahman 2009 ulker et al 2009 ulker 2012 sumer et al 2012 use of return mapping following substepping helps obtain convergence in the numerical integration of the formulation hence the model successfully predicts the overall pore pressure build up in the soil for this problem the third problem has the same fe model and similar material properties while the loading in the model is now changed into a high frequency harmonic variation with an assumed 1 d influence on the seabed sub stepping scheme is applied in 10 100 sub steps range within mfe scheme fig 14 shows the time history results of soil displacement and pore pressure at various nodes in the fe model pore pressure response tends to quickly increase in time in a few cycles faster in rate than the displacement response does particularly at the nodes closer to the soil surface thus liquefaction occurs in the soil in another problem the centrifuge wave flume experiment of sassa and sekiguchi 1999 is simulated in this experiment a sand box is placed in a wave tank and a number of standing waves is generated during a centrifuge test with a 50 g centrifugal acceleration sand is a loosely packed material named the leighton buzzard sand with a specific gravity of g s 2 65 mean grain size of d 50 0 15 mm and void ratios e max 1 07 e min 0 64 corresponding to a relative density range of dr 41 43 the test is conducted with a wavelength of l 510 mm fluid depth of 90 mm and frequency of f 11 hz corresponding to a 4 5 s wave period in an actual stage which continues until after the loose sand liquefies the problem model is given in fig 15 current study simulates the dynamic response of loose sand using the developed theoretical and numerical formulation finite element simulation results are given in fig 16 in terms of temporal variations of pore pressure the build up components of the excess pore pressure time histories match well with that of test results for corresponding depths in the last problem the same model is used and another wave train with a different wave amplitude is applied as wave pressure on the surface of sand soil which was studied previously by sassa and sekiguchi 2001 the horizontal variation of pore pressure response is compared with their solution where the occurrence of peaks is captured in the simulations particularly near the nodes of the wave form as well as the overall variation closer to the sand surface as can be seen in fig 17 5 conclusions in this paper a combined theoretical and numerical study on the analysis of dynamic response of sandy seabed is presented focus is mostly on being able to model the cyclic sand behavior at the elemental level for that a robust constitutive framework of the bounding surface plasticity is studied rigorously for addressing the wave induced dynamic response of sandy seabed here a new hardening rule based upon combined isotropic kinematic hardening is proposed and incorporated into the bounding surface formulation a number of cyclic undrained triaxial tests are simulated and the bounding surface plasticity model now in its modified form is found to be the effective one for predicting the elemental cyclic response of sandy seabed especially for complex stress paths with large stress ratios the proposed hardening law sufficiently captures the stress strain loops following its validation with cyclic triaxial test results the proposed constitutive formulation is incorporated into the governing coupled flow deformation equations leading to a fully coupled poro elasto plastic numerical model in summary the proposed hardening law works fairly well for predicting the dynamic response of seabed including progressive liquefaction

21269,factors affecting the cyclic response of seabed around offshore foundations are associated with soil structure wave loading and drainage conditions constitutive theories proposed to account for these factors in the design of such soil structure systems must be able to capture the essentials of seabed dynamics in this paper a combined theoretical numerical study on dynamic response of sandy seabed focusing on nonlinear soil constitutive behavior is presented the manuscript is of threefold first part presents a rigorous theoretical study to evaluate the cyclic behavior of seabed using the framework of bounding surface plasticity focus here is on more effectively modeling the elemental response particularly liquefaction a new hardening law is proposed to incorporate into the modified bounding surface model which is found to be the effective formulation addressing the wave induced nonlinear seabed behavior second part presents a number of cyclic triaxial tests simulated to verify the new constitutive formulation in the third part a poro elasto plastic numerical model in terms of the extended nonlinear finite element form of the discretized coupled flow deformation equations is

liquefaction keywords bounding surface finite elements hardening law liquefaction of sandy seabed nonlinear dynamic response poro elasto plasticity 1 introduction cyclic loading in the form of ocean waves constitute a significant part of the design of coastal geotechnical engineering systems geomechanical considerations are particularly important in identifying the conditions leading to instability of such systems under cyclic excitations among those engineering soil properties in terms of stress strain relationships dynamic shear strength characteristics and hydraulic conductivity are necessary properties to be determined to decide whether there will be permanent deformations in the seabed foundations or indirectly in the upper offshore structures during such events therefore it is of utmost significance that cyclic soil behavior is both measured in the laboratory through physical model tests and modeled through theoretical frameworks which are in turn verified by such test results while the former have been conducted since the early 20th century it was not until the late 1970 s that the latter theoretical and numerical works emerge since then theoretical modeling studies have focused on sands and sand like granular seabed to identify the conditions leading to failure such as liquefaction therefore constitutive theories used to evaluate the behavior of sands should ideally achieve a certain accuracy in tackling the geomechanics problem many theories have been proposed with that objective in related literature firstly mroz et al 1978 proposed the multi surface plasticity theory the actual constitutive model based upon such a theory is further developed by mroz et al 1981 another more elaborate yet simpler theory is proposed independently by krieg 1975 and dafalias and popov 1975 which was later enhanced to be the model we know today as the bounding surface plasticity by dafalias and hermann 1982 a yielding surface and a bounding surface are used in the model the former of which resides inside the latter poorooshasb and pietruszczak 1986 proposed a two surface model that makes use of bounding surface to predict the dynamic behavior of soils which also accounts for the plastic deformations during unloading in order to overcome some of the limitations associated with the general form of bounding surface plasticity a generalized plasticity theory gpt is developed by zienkiewicz and mroz 1984 although the theory does not disprove the basic notion of the classical plasticity the fact that it needs only a handful of measurable parameters to construct the theory without reference to a yield or a bounding surface makes it an appealing one to adopt in addressing the dynamic response of soils zienkiewicz et al 1985 incorporated a bounding surface into gpt which is later expanded by pastor et al 1985 in the work of pastor et al 1990 however there is no surface definition required to define the yielding condition or evaluate plastic deformations such theory was employed by ulker 2017 2018 and 2019 cyclic plasticity of granular soils and particularly liquefaction are published in many studies in the last two decades one of the early ones is the multi surface plasticity model developed by elgamal et al 2002 the cyclic mobility and liquefaction behavior of sand are modeled in their work using a different surface in each plastic flow step papadimitriou et al 2001 papadimitriou and bouckovalas 2002 and later papadimitriou et al 2005 models the plastic behavior of sands under various sample preparation methods as well as low and high cyclic shear strains osinov 2003 develops an incremental model for the earthquake induced deformations of sand fu et al 2007 presents a study on the development of a constitutive model and thoroughly calibrated the results with experiments in another study wang and zhang 2007 and later zhang and wang 2012 develop a model for the cyclic behavior of liquefied loose sands with large deformations andrade 2009 models the instability of loose sands due to liquefaction he showed that the liquefaction criterion in the model can be explained by the available failure criteria for soils

2014 the liquefaction potential of seabed around coastal structures has been the topic of interest for the last few decades some of them on liquefaction of granular materials stand out zen and yamazaki 1990 sumer and fredsøe 2002 ulker 2012 ulker et al 2012 2018 ye et al 2015 ye and wang 2015 only limited number of research studies try to shed a light on the nonlinear response of seabed soil under waves poorooshasb and ishihara 1987 considers seabed as a porous material with a non linear stress strain law believed to represent the mode of deformation of the solid phase the numerical technique used is a hybrid finite difference finite element scheme gatmiri 1990 presents finite element analyses studying the wave induced response of seabed yang et al 1994 presents progressive wave induced liquefaction of sand deposits with a non linear analysis procedure and later yang 1997 studies the standing wave induced response of seabed using the non associative generalized plasticity based bounding surface model proposed by yang 1997 noorzad 1999 evaluates the elasto plastic behavior of sandy seabed under standing waves using the original canasand model sassa and sekiguchi 1999 and later sassa and sekiguchi 2001 both measured and predicted the wave induced loose sand response with pioneering experiments and rigorous numerical study respectively ulker 2009 makes use of two surface cyclic plasticity model and evaluates the poro elasto plastic dynamic response of seabed in free field in a more recent work zhu et al 2019 studies the effects of principal stress rotations on wave induced response of elasto plastic sandy seabed while numerous other works are published studying the wave induced seabed response around coastal and offshore structures not many focus on the accurate analysis of wave induced nonlinear cyclic behavior of seabed soil in this paper a combined theoretical and numerical study on the analysis of dynamic response of sandy seabed is presented specific attention is paid to the elemental level elasto plastic behavior of sandy seabed firstly a rigorous comparative study of stress strain behavior of saturated sandy seabed is performed utilizing the constitutive theories of bounding surface plasticity and generalized plasticity here a non associated two surface bounding surface model with mixed hardening and a no surface generalized plasticity model with deviatoric strain hardening are employed a novel hardening rule in terms of combined isotropic kinematic hardening is proposed and incorporated into the bounding surface formulation to more accurately and efficiently address the wave induced dynamic behavior of sandy seabed secondly a number of undrained cyclic triaxial tests are simulated to put the theories into a rigorous test for identifying the most accurate and effective formulation necessary to quantify the cyclic dynamic response complex stress paths are run at this point to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified bounding plasticity model with the new hardening rule compared to the generalized plasticity formulation finally the late bounding plasticity model achieving better validation is implemented into an in house finite element code in c a fully coupled poro elasto plastic numerical model is developed where the proposed bounding surface model is incorporated into the extended nonlinear finite element form of the discretized coupled flow deformation equations then the wave induced dynamic response of free field seabed is evaluated the results are validated with wave flume experiments at macro level capturing essentially the residual liquefaction of loose sand 2 constitutive modeling of wave induced cyclic elasto plastic behavior of sand in this section a modified constitutive framework is presented to model the dynamic behavior of saturated sandy seabed soil it is a two surface cyclic plastic model with mixed hardening originally proposed by poorooshasb and pietruszczak 1985 and later modified by poorooshasb and pietruszczak 1986 capable of modeling the cyclic and monotonic behavior of non cohesive granular soils the theory is implemented into a computer program and related computational tools are developed to analyze the dynamic response of sand under cyclic loadings this section of the paper presents a theoretical study of the proposed model with the idea of demonstrating its capability and yet some drawbacks associated with its formulation and ease to implement into a numerical scheme such as the classical finite element method is also discussed 2 1 bounding surface plasticity model with mixed hardening this model consists of two families of surfaces a yield and a bounding surface where the former serves the purpose of distinguishing the elastic strains from that of plastic ones and where the latter separates communicable stress paths from that of non communicable ones in the formulation a new hardening rule in terms of calculating the plastic hardening modulus during stress reversals is developed in addition a simple method of evaluating the location of center of the yield surface as well as the image stresses located on the bounding surface based upon the current stress vector is incorporated into the formulation using simple vector algebra this way kinematic hardening law of the model now better suits to implement into a finite element software the bounding surface is defined in the set of axis σ1 2 3 as in fig 1 with the equation 1 f σ η g θ i 0 where the three invariants defined here are 2 σ s i j s i j 2 i σ i i 3 j 3 s i j s j k s k i 3 s i j σ i j σ k k δ i j 3 the yield surface is defined in σ 1 2 3 space which moves within the bounding surface 3 f σ η g θ i 0 in 1 η η f ε p a ε p is the function that keeps the history of the plastic distortion where a is the isotropic hardening parameter and η f 2 sin φ f 3 sin φ f where φ f is the angle of friction at failure this way isotropic hardening is governed during virgin loading of the soil when the bounding and yield surfaces are tangential to each other along the stress vector function g θ is the lode s angle function and is specified below william and warnke 1975 4 g θ 1 k 2 a 2 k 1 1 k 2 2 b k 5 k 4 1 k 2 2 b 1 2 k 2 where k 3 sin φ 3 sin φ a 3 cos θ sin θ b cos 2 θ 3 sin 2 θ other forms can also be used rahman and ulker 2018 in 3 η is the size of the yield surface which is assumed to be small compared to η f and kept constant for simplicity the modified invariants are now 5 σ s i j s i j 2 i α i j σ i i j 3 s i j s j k s k i 3 s i j σ i j i α i j and α ij is the unit tensor along the axis of the yield surface also defined as the back stress or the center location of the yield surface in this study the shape of the yield surface on the deviatoric plane is assumed to be circular giving g θ 1 which simplifies the subsequent analyses 2 1 1 evaluation of plastic strains it is necessary to distinguish the virgin loading vl process from that of stress reversals sr or unloading reloading cycles during loading thus while the flow rule inherently does not change the way it is evaluated does so during vl a non associated flow rule is described by using a global plastic potential function g σ η defined as 6 g σ η σ η c i g θ ln i i 0 0 where i 0 is a constant and η c is the critical history parameter defining the value of σ i for which plastic strain d ε i i p 0 with an analogy to the critical state theory flow rule is then written for vl and sr as 7a d ε p d λ g σ η σ i j d λ dev g σ i j dev g σ i j 7b d ε i j p n i j n i j d σ i j h l s r where dev g σ i j is the deviatoric component of the potential gradient dλ is the positive scalar h l sr is the plastic modulus during sr and n i j and n i j are the unit vectors normal to the local plastic potential g and to the yield surface respectively in vl stress point lies on the bounding surface along which yield surface coincides hence during vl and sr the consistency conditions must independently be satisfied as in classical plasticity local plastic potential is defined similar to the global one as 8 g σ i β 2 β 1 i 2 σ β 2 ln i 2 σ β 2 β 3 0 with 9 β 1 η c g θ β 2 1 5 dev α i j dev α i j α k k 2 1 2 plastic hardening modulus the material property that controls the development of plastic strains during loading processes is the plastic hardening modulus while the material exhibits strain hardening plastic hardening modulus essentially provides the necessary link between the applied load and that of irrecoverable deformation during vl h l vl modulus is calculated as 10 h l v l f η η ε p dev g σ i j dev g σ i j in this study a new way of calculating the plastic modulus during stress reversals h l sr depending upon the position of stress tensor on the yield surface relative to the bounding surface is proposed as 11 h l s r h l b s h l h 0 h l where 12 h l h l b s δ 0 δ γ h 0 1 e 0 λ κ where γ is the kinematic hardening constant h l b s is the value on f 0 surface during sr as 13 h l b s h l v l g σ f σ along with initial void ratio e 0 slope of virgin loading λ and elastic unloading line κ the angle between the stress vector and its counterpart on f 0 σ f1 is δ and the corresponding angle between the stress on the other side of the bounding surface σ f2 and its couple σ f1 is δ 0 as 14a δ cos 1 σ i j σ f 1 σ k l σ k l σ f 1 σ f 1 ½ 14b δ 0 cos 1 σ f 2 σ f 1 σ f 2 σ f 2 σ f 1 σ f 1 ½ we need to determine the locations of these stresses in terms of kinematic hardening law 2 1 3 kinematic hardening law in this study the space diagonal of i j identified by δ and that of the local space i j identified by α as well as the stress tensor itself σ are all taken as coplanar fig 2 satisfying necessary stress space geometrical considerations ulker 2009 since the bounding surface and its axis are fixed this rule needs to be formulated using α as 15 d α α i j m 1 d m 1 α i j m 2 d m 2 where m 1 and m 2 are the components of α it is now important that the initial location of the yield surface α 0 is determined this condition requires unit normal vectors to be equal at the current stress point 16 n f f σ i j f σ i j f σ i j ½ n i j f σ i j f σ i j f σ i j ½ in this study a simple technique based on vector algebra that is consistent with the rest of the model is incorporated into the theory to calculate the back stress and obtain σ f1 and σ f2 stresses initial unit vector α α 0 in the beginning of unloading is first evaluated as 17 α σ d from the equation of yield surface we know that q p 2 η with q p being triaxial stresses also 18 α σ 2 d 2 1 2 σ 2 2 σ η 1 2 η 2 2 1 2 using 18 and fig 3 we can write 19 α σ 2 σ η 1 2 η 2 n f having found the initial location of the yield surface in order to initiate the translation rule for the yield surface locations of σ f 1 and σ f 2 on the projected deviatoric stress plane π plane need to be determined σ f 1 and σ f 2 are both located on the bounding surface and guide the kinematics of the yield surface if the current stress point is located on the yield surface then its conjugate can be found as 20 f s i j c s i j c 2 η g θ 1 i c 0 since i i c is constant volumetric and deviatoric components are simply derived as σ i i c σ i i and s i j c λ 1 s i j respectively which when substituted in the bounding surface gives 21 λ 1 η g θ 1 i σ 0 with 22 s f 1 η g θ 1 i σ s i j or in triaxial stress state q f 1 2 η g θ 1 i f 1 the conjugate stress vector can be back calculated for the triaxial case using q f 1 and p f 1 since p f 1 p i and for the general 3 d case in terms of s f1 and σ f 1 i i for other stress states equivalent manipulation can be made and the s f1 stress vector can be calculated the datum stress vector can then be derived as described in fig 4 as 23 s f 2 s σ f 2 σ leading to 24 σ f 2 σ λ 2 σ f 1 σ where λ 2 can be evaluated if 24 is substituted into f 0 yielding 25 λ 2 η g θ 2 i σ σ f 1 σ σ f 1 σ 2 1 2 since i i f2 and σ s i j s i j 2 1 2 equation 24 gives in fact the stress point on the bounding surface of the line drawn in the π plane which cuts the bounding surface at these stresses now that the initial location of the yield surface is known we can calculate the kinematic components m 1 and m 2 through 15 by using the consistency condition in sr written in terms of α i j and 15 m 1 and m 2 are determined and the new yield surface is updated using 26 α k 1 α k m 1 d m 1 m 2 d m 2 since translation of the yield surface must be perpendicular to its axis α ij it can be readily shown that 27 d α i j d μ α f 1 α k l α f 1 α i j where α f 1 is the unit tensor specifying the location of the f 1 stress point the existence of the so called f 1 yield surface helps ensure that as the stress vector moves towards the bounding surface it approaches to a constant f 1 surface which is tangent to the bounding surface at the f 1 point the location of this surface can be found by writing 28 α f 1 σ f 1 λ f σ σ f 1 λ f σ σ f 1 λ f σ 1 2 where λ is calculated from 21 and d μ in 27 is calculated using the consistency condition of α i j as 29 d μ f σ i j d σ i j f α i j α f 1 α k l α f 1 α i j the incremental change in the axis of the yield surface can be evaluated using 27 2 1 4 stress strain relationship stress strain relation need to be derived for both vl and sr in terms of the elasto plastic constitutive matrix d ep leading to the final relationship after some vector algebra as 30 d σ i j d v l e p d ε i j d e d e g σ i j f σ i j d e h l v l f σ i j d e g σ i j d ε i j for the sr the above relation is in similar form except that instead of f g and h l vl the functions f q and h l sr should be employed giving 31 d s r e p d e d e n i j t n i j d e n i j d e n i j t h l s r equation 31 yields the explicit integration form of the fourth order material rigidity matrix and if one needs to employ an implicit scheme to integrate this stress strain relationship related tangential stiffness must also be derived which would then be called the consistent tangent stiffness for interested readers 3 cyclic triaxial test simulations in this section of the paper a number of cyclic triaxial tests are simulated using both of the frameworks of the modified bounding surface plasticity and generalized plasticity formulations presented above the first simulation presents the results of a cyclic triaxial strain controlled test conducted by ishihara and okada 1982 here a constant strain amplitude varying between 0 05 and 0 71 was applied it can be seen in fig 5 that the sample s effective stress is reduced progressively which from the beginning accompanies the generation of pore pressure leading to liquefaction after a number of cycles specimen liquefies with no mean effective stress left here q and p are the deviatoric and mean stresses respectively and ε s is shear strain fig 6 presents the strain controlled undrained cyclic triaxial test simulation results with the parameters g 20000 kpa k0 30000 kpa at p 225 kpa a 0 0025 γ 2 0 η f 0 52 η c 0 43 and η 0 02 the shear strain is kept constant at 0 3 in both compression and extension side yielding a reduction in shear stresses following number of cycles of loading the specimen reaches a complete state of liquefaction at the end of the test the simulation results of shear stress shear strain relationship and the stress path curves agree well with the results presented in pietruszczak and poorooshasb 1985 one of the aims of the present study is to model the behavior of sandy seabed under increasing cycles of loading in the case when initially large stress ratios are applied to the soil specimen such tests have been conducted by ishihara and okada 1982 and are simulated here again while it is of necessary characteristic property for any constitutive model to predict the observed cyclic behavior of sandy soils such a rather more complex behavior under an initially sheared soil sample with specific cyclic stress ratios provides more information about the capability of the modified theory itself thus the results predicted in figs 7 and 8 serve as valuable information fig 7 shows a group of comparisons made for a loose sand cyclic behavior under stress controlled undrained test the soil sample is sheared at a relatively large stress ratio and the bsm with the hardening law proposed in this study gives out better results than the initial simulation made by poorooshasb and pietruszczak 1986 using the actual formulation of the model simulation is compared with ishihara and okada 1982 test results the results of modified bsm with the new hardening rule well simulate the liquefaction response of loose sand and capture the main features of liquefaction for this large initial stress ratio test fig 8 presents another undrained cyclic triaxial test simulation with high compression side stress ratio the modified bsm improves the results of the model as well while the idea is to identify the features of the bsm leading to a better modeling of the test rather more sophisticated and versatile nature of the bsm with the current hardening law is used in the subsequent section of the study in terms of analysis of dynamic response of seabed 4 finite element analysis of cyclic poro elasto plastic seabed response 4 1 governing equations the equations governing the dynamic response of soils are the coupled flow and deformation equations developed by biot 1941 who later extended them to include inertial terms biot 1955 in this section the above theoretical formulation now tested at the elemental level against undrained triaxial tests has now been implemented into an in house finite element fe code developed to run for the biot s poroelasticity theory now called poro elasto plasticity d arcy s law takes place in the formulation to govern the pore water flow by ignoring the inertial forces associated with the motion of pore water the equations can be written in the partially dynamic pd form as follows 32 σ i j j ρ g i ρ u i 33 p w i ρ w g i ρ w u i w i k i ρ w g i 34 ε i i w i i n k f p w where ρ and ρ w are the total density of soil and water n is porosity k f is bulk modulus of pore water g is the gravitational acceleration and k i is the permeability coefficient as for variable unknowns σ i j is the total stress tensor u is solid phase displacement w is the relative displacement of pore water with respect to solid grains p w is the pore water pressure and ε i i is the rate of change of volumetric strain of the solid part in the system is the time derivative and denotes the spatial derivatives with respect to cartesian coordinates if we neglect the fluid accelerations and combine 33 and 34 the final equation set is now written in vectorial form as 35 t σ ρ g ρ u 0 36 t u t k ρ f g p w ρ f g ρ f u n k f p w 0 where the field variables of this mathematical formulation are now u and p w it should be noted here that u solid displacement is inherent in total stress which should now be replaced with the elasto plastic constitutive relation described in the previous section provided that the principle of effective stress is employed further neglecting the accelerations of solid phase u return the quasi static formulation qs ulker and rahman 2009 4 2 finite element formulation approximating the field variables

the discretized solid displacement u and the pore pressure p w this equation is temporally discretized also using the newmark β implicit method and is solved for incremental dof vector δ x n 1 i 1 at n number of iterations once these incremental dof s are calculated corresponding incremental strains are computed and the stress variables are calculated using the following constitutive relationships

equations is carried out using the modified forward euler method mfe sloan 1987 this method is a fully explicit integration scheme requiring the previous converged stresses σ n strains ε n as well as the isotropic and kinematic hardening parameters ε n η n α n to update the current values of variables σ n 1 ε n 1 ε n 1 η n 1 α n 1 in order to achieve convergence at the material point level a sub stepping or sub incrementation technique is used here the sub stepping scheme employs reduction in the total strain allowing the calculations to be made for small increments in the mfe scheme the sub steps do not necessarily have to have constant size and the method also accounts for the error made at each sub step mfe essentially employs a two step euler procedure to estimate the error produced by the standard euler technique and calculates the required number of substeps at the end of time step t k we write 45 σ k 1 i σ k d σ 1 i 46 ε p k 1 i ε p k d ε p 1 i 47 α k 1 i α k d α 1 i where k is the sub step number ε p is the total plastic strain d ε p is the total plastic strain increment α is the back stress and d α is the increment in back stress subscript 1 indicates the first step incremental values and 2 the second step the increments with subscript 1 are evaluated at σ k ε p k and α k in a usual manner presented before as the total strain increment need to be divided into sub steps we have 48 δ ε k t k δ ε the above variables can now be updated by taking the averages of the first two estimates 49 σ k 1 i σ k d σ 1 i d σ 2 i 2 50 ε p k 1 i ε p k d ε p 1 i d ε p 2 i 2 51 α k 1 i α k d α 1 i d α 2 i 2 where d σ 2 i d ε p 2 i and d α 2 i are evaluated at σ k 1 i ε p k 1 and α k 1 i relative error is calculated as 52 r e k 1 e k 1 σ k 1 where e k 1 is the local error size of each sub step is constantly updated until r e k 1 t o l is satisfied 4 4 correcting for drift with a return algorithm the size of the steps and the manner in which equation 42 is evaluated differ between different algorithms in terms of integrating the d ep matrix all essentially assume a constant matrix for each load step this however is an approximation as the d ep matrix varies continuously with changes in stress despite the use of small steps in the post yield range it is found in practice that the predicted state of stress at the end of a loading increment may not lie on the current yield or bounding surface the deviation is more pronounced in the case of hardening as such discrepancies are cumulative it is important to ensure that the stresses are corrected back to the current yield surface at each step of the calculation several techniques for correcting the yield stresses have been proposed in the literature potts and gens 1985 ortiz and simo 1986 crisfield 1991 then the problem becomes to decide in what manner the stresses at the new point lying outside of the yield surface should be corrected so that in vl f σ k 1 ε p k 1 0 and in sr f σ k 1 α k 1 0 is satisfied in this study projection of stresses back to yield or bounding surface along the plastic flow direction is employed which is expressed as 53 σ c o r r σ t r i a l δ g σ where δ is a scalar σ c o r r is the corrected stress and σ t r i a l is the trial stress the corrected stress must satisfy the equation of bounding surface in vl as f σ c o r r ε c o r r f σ t r i a l δ g σ ε n 0 and the equation of yield surface in sr as f σ c o r r α c o r r f σ t r i a l δ g σ α n 0 it is assumed that the hardening parameters during vl and sr do not change if these are expanded in taylor s series and the δ 2 terms are neglected for vl and sr we get the following respectively 54a δ f σ ε p t r i a l f σ g σ i n i t i a l 54b δ f σ α t r i a l f σ g σ i n i t i a l gradients of the surfaces as well as the potential functions are calculated at the initial or converged step before the prediction is made whose stress vector lies on the corresponding surfaces then the new stress satisfying these surfaces are calculated from 53 the presented constitutive equations are implemented into an fe program at each gauss point flexibility of choosing the sub stepping procedure and allowing correction for yield and bounding surface drifts at the end of either each sub step or the current time step is introduced into the program the switch from vl to sr is decided upon a quantity calculated as 55 cos ϕ ε i j p e i j p ε i j p ε i j p e i j p e i j p where ϕ is the spatial angle between the direction of the deviatoric plastic strain rate ε i j p and that of accumulated plastic strain deviation e i j p here we define e i j p as 56 e i j p 0 t ε i j p t d t where t is time and t is a monotonically increasing quantity whenever 55 undergoes a change in sign then the element is said to be experiencing load reversal 4 5 free field seabed response under wave loading the presented fe formulation is validated through some basic problems where the dynamic response of a seabed soil under hydrostatic and harmonic wave loading is evaluated the stress strain relationship of seabed at elemental level is governed by the modified bounding surface plasticity formulation in doing so the most effective and computationally efficient fe formulation is sought to implement the model to satisfy convergence mfe scheme is used for that matter fig 9 shows the free field seabed problem with the soil being modeled as a saturated porous medium under infinitely long progressive wave loading also in the figure is the numerical model of 1 d seabed along with the specified boundary conditions under two forms of loading a constant hydrostatic load assuming no wave effect fig 9c and another harmonic wave form fig 9d the first problem considers the dynamic response of a seabed column under constant step load as in fig 9c horizontal flow along lateral boundaries and vertical flow through rigid and impermeable bottom are prevented the variation of young s modulus poorooshasb and yang 1990 is taken as 57 e e 0 a 0 1 2 ν i where a 0 is the method constant for calibration ν is the poisson s ratio and e 0 is the initial value of the modulus of elasticity i in this problem non linear fe analyses are carried out and the results are presented in terms of pore water pressure and vertical effective stresses of the qs and pd formulations in figs 10 and 11 respectively the model parameters are given for this first problem in table 1 in the analyses the effect of isotropic hardening parameter a on the results is studied and found to be insignificant since there is no stress reversal in the domain kinematic hardening parameter γ does not have any role here either effect of permeability values on the results is also studied we can see in figs 10 and 11 that the non linearity of soil constitutive behavior decreases the pore pressure magnitudes but increases the effective vertical stresses for each permeability value such a difference between linear and non linear solutions is more pronounced as the inertial term associated with the motion of soil skeleton is considered in the pd formulation except for pore pressures obtained for the lowest permeability k 10 5m s vertical effective stresses obtained from qs and pd formulations indicate that the poro elasto plastic behavior yields slightly larger stresses for various permeability values compared to the poro elastic response also in the pore pressure response observed an instant magnitude for k 10 5m s that is larger than the applied load this could be attributed to the observed mandel cryer effect that commonly occur in porous media consolidation under constant loading fig 12 shows the non linear distributions of pore pressure for both formulations where taking into account the accelerations of soil solids slightly raises the discrepancy between magnitudes it should be noted that in all the figures the poroelastic solutions match with their analytical counterparts derived by ulker and rahman 2009 in order to verify the formulation a free field seabed model is developed under harmonic surface wave excitation for a low frequency wave with t 1 6 s pore pressure response results are obtained and compared with the laboratory wave flume experiments of sumer et al 2012 the wave flume is 0 6 m wide and 26 5 m long where the water depth is kept constant at d 0 55 m in the experiment saturated sandy soil sediment is placed in a pit of 0 78 m wide and h 0 4 m thick and pore pressure measurements are taken at various depths inside the soil necessary parameters are given in table 1 fig 13 presents the time history of pore pressure heads computed by the fe analyses and measured by sumer et al 2012 at a depth of z 0 085 m and z 0 24 m for two wave heights of h 7 7 cm and 18 cm inertial terms are ignored in the numerical solution based upon previous studies of similar problem ulker and rahman 2009 ulker et al 2009 ulker 2012 sumer et al 2012 use of return mapping following substepping helps obtain convergence in the numerical integration of the formulation hence the model successfully predicts the overall pore pressure build up in the soil for this problem the third problem has the same fe model and similar material properties while the loading in the model is now changed into a high frequency harmonic variation with an assumed 1 d influence on the seabed sub stepping scheme is applied in 10 100 sub steps range within mfe scheme fig 14 shows the time history results of soil displacement and pore pressure at various nodes in the fe model pore pressure response tends to quickly increase in time in a few cycles faster in rate than the displacement response does particularly at the nodes closer to the soil surface thus liquefaction occurs in the soil in another problem the centrifuge wave flume experiment of sassa and sekiguchi 1999 is simulated in this experiment a sand box is placed in a wave tank and a number of standing waves is generated during a centrifuge test with a 50 g centrifugal acceleration sand is a loosely packed material named the leighton buzzard sand with a specific gravity of g s 2 65 mean grain size of d 50 0 15 mm and void ratios e max 1 07 e min 0 64 corresponding to a relative density range of dr 41 43 the test is conducted with a wavelength of l 510 mm fluid depth of 90 mm and frequency of f 11 hz corresponding to a 4 5 s wave period in an actual stage which continues until after the loose sand liquefies the problem model is given in fig 15 current study simulates the dynamic response of loose sand using the developed theoretical and numerical formulation finite element simulation results are given in fig 16 in terms of temporal variations of pore pressure the build up components of the excess pore pressure time histories match well with that of test results for corresponding depths in the last problem the same model is used and another wave train with a different wave amplitude is applied as wave pressure on the surface of sand soil which was studied previously by sassa and sekiguchi 2001 the horizontal variation of pore pressure response is compared with their solution where the occurrence of peaks is captured in the simulations particularly near the nodes of the wave form as well as the overall variation closer to the sand surface as can be seen in fig 17 5 conclusions in this paper a combined theoretical and numerical study on the analysis of dynamic response of sandy seabed is presented focus is mostly on being able to model the cyclic sand behavior at the elemental level for that a robust constitutive framework of the bounding surface plasticity is studied rigorously for addressing the wave induced dynamic response of sandy seabed here a new hardening rule based upon combined isotropic kinematic hardening is proposed and incorporated into the bounding surface formulation a number of cyclic undrained triaxial tests are simulated and the bounding surface plasticity model now in its modified form is found to be the effective one for predicting the elemental cyclic response of sandy seabed especially for complex stress paths with large stress ratios the proposed hardening law sufficiently captures the stress strain loops following its validation with cyclic triaxial test results the proposed constitutive formulation is incorporated into the governing coupled flow deformation equations leading to a fully coupled poro elasto plastic numerical model in summary the proposed hardening law works fairly well for predicting the dynamic response of seabed including progressive liquefaction thus this modified bounding plasticity model can be utilized in solving more complex seabed foundation interaction type problems of coastal and offshore geotechnical engineering credit authorship
