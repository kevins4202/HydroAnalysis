11300,although empirical correlations between fertilizer application rate and nitrogen n loss have been demonstrated the differences in overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application among different crops have not been thoroughly elucidated to date we investigated the fate of 15n labeled fertilizer in the plant soil air water system across various crops i e garlic oilseed rape and broad bean by quantifying the n fluxes of various pathways combined with a pot experiment a rainfall simulating experiment and 15n tracer techniques hence we compared the differences between different crops in the overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application we found that n amount by plant uptake varied among these different crops but with little variation in fertilizer use efficiency fue the residual n amounts in soil were significantly different in these crops due to statistically non differential soil residual percentages consistent with the differences in the application rate of n fertilizer and fue further evidently different overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application occurred among these crops including gaseous loss of fertilizer n and potentially hydrologic loss of soil residual n from fertilizer the highest gaseous n loss including ammonia nh3 volatilization and nitrous oxide n2o emissions occurred in garlic system and the lowest occurred in broad bean moreover potentially hydrologic loss of soil residual n in the garlic system was higher than in the other two crop systems and the least was observed in the broad bean system therefore attempts to reduce fertilizer application could benefit from considering the difference in overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application between different crop systems the shift from crops with high environmental impacts to that with low impacts can largely reduce the regional n pollution keywords nonpoint source pollution fertilizer n 15n gaseous loss hydrologic loss overall environmental

warming air pollution water quality degradation and soil acidification due to excessive or unreasonable application conant et al 2013 gu et al 2015 ju et al 2009 sutton et al 2011 zeng et al 2017 zuo et al 2018 approximately 27 tg of the fertilizer n was used annually for food production during 2001 2010 in china yan et al 2014 however only 36 39 was taken up by plant from 2003 through 2010 gu et al 2017 which resulted in a substantial percentage of fertilizer n lost to the environment through ammonia volatilization denitrification leaching and runoff etc ju et al 2009 zhou et al 2017a a significant fraction of the fertilizer n applied to the cropland enters the freshwater systems and is transported by rivers to coastal areas resulting in eutrophication of coastal and marine ecosystems huang et al 2017 mabaya et al 2017 strokal et al 2014 china started to reduce the fertilizer use dating from 2015 by implementing an announced zero increase action plan for the national fertilizer use by 2020 which aimed to reduce the environmental costs associated with food production liu et al 2016b improving the n use efficiency nue is central to fertilizer reduction chen et al

are common measures to achieve the reduction of fertilizer application agricultural structure adjustment through the interconversion of different land uses e g paddy field and upland characterized by different crops rotation could be an alternative approach to reducing the fertilizer application rate li et al 2018b found that n export varied between upland and paddy fields in response to input hu et al 2018 found that converting paddy fields to upland reduced 42 1 of the total n tn export however conversion of domestically cultivated n fixing soybeans to high n demanding crops wheat corn rice and vegetables due to large importation of soybean increased n pollution in china sun et al 2018 the difference in the environmental impacts among different crops that are characterized by contrasting n surpluses i e the difference between n input and output by plant uptake is the core of agricultural structure adjustment for fertilizer reduction for example ju et al 2007 found that soil ph in the vegetable fields was significantly lower than in the wheat maize fields while soil electrical conductivity ec was significantly higher in the vegetable soils different n losses among rice wheat and maize in response to n inputs were also found in previous studies cui et al 2014 liu et al 2016a however the overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application among different crops have not been evaluated thoroughly and systematically knowledge of the tn budgets of agricultural systems including all n fluxes is essential for evaluating the overall environmental impacts of the fertilizer application zhou et al 2016b the 15n isotope tracer technique is a useful approach to investigating the fate of fertilizer n in agricultural systems chen et al 2016 quan et al 2017 sebilo et al 2013 zhou et al 2016b for example zhou et al 2016b investigated all n fluxes e g gaseous and hydrologic loss and the total n balances of agricultural systems with different fertilizers using this approach sebilo et al 2013 found the long term fate of fertilizer n in agricultural soil using the 15n isotope tracer technique however few studies compared the overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application among different crops in the present study we conducted a comprehensive study on the fate of n in three crops i e garlic oilseed rape and broad bean that were characterized by contrasting fertilizer n surplus i e the difference between n input from fertilizer and output by the plant uptake tang et al 2012 we investigated the fate of 15n labeled fertilizer in the plant soil air water system across different crops by integrating a pot experiment a rainfall simulating experiment and 15n tracer techniques the main goal of this study was to improve our understanding of the different overall environmental impacts i e the impacts of gaseous loss and hydrologic loss of fertilizer application across different crops specifically three objectives were defined i to explore the fate of fertilizer n that was taken by plant and retained in soil ii to quantify the fluxes of fertilizer n lost via gaseous and hydrological pathways and iii to compare the differences between different crops in overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application we hypothesized that fertilizer application could show evident variations in environmental impacts between different crops due to the difference in fertilizer n surplus 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental design the present study was conducted in xiaguan county 100 2119 e 25 6531 n in the southwest of erhai lake

experimental site and was passed through a 2 cm sieve for mixing the soil in pots had an organic matter of 36 4 g kg 1 a tn of 1 96 g kg 1 total of phosphorus of 0 88 g kg 1 total of potassium of 18 9 g kg 1 olsen p of 22 1 mg kg 1 ph of 6 33 eh of 17 1 c mol kg 1 and bulk density of 1 16 g cm 3 to understand the variations in the overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application among different crops three field experiments were conducted garlic allium sativum oilseed rape brassica napus and broad bean vicia faba all experiments were conducted in a randomized complete block design with three replicates the size of each plot was 100 cm length 30 cm width 20 cm height the planting density was accordance with local conventional management in all experiments in the garlic oilseed rape and broad bean experiments the plots received 423 212 and 95 2 kg n ha 1 respectively and all were applied as the basal fertilizer table 1 the n p2o5 and k2o fertilizers applied were urea 46 4 n superphosphate 18 p2o5 and potassium chloride 60 k2o respectively approximately 50 of urea was 15n labelled by 50 urea as the atomic percent 2 2 sample measurement and analysis 2 2 1 plant and soil measurement and analysis these crops including grain straw and root in each plot were all fully harvested plant samples were dried at 70 c to constant weight after being washed with distilled water and weighed to calculate the dry biomass of the aboveground and root soil samples were collected immediately after crop harvest and were air dried to analyze tn content and 15n abundance in soil parts

thermo scientific bremen germany 2 2 2 n2o emissions the n2o emissions were monitored with the static chambers gas chromatography technique as described by zhou et al 2017b in the present study gas samples were collected from the chamber in polyethylene coated aluminum gas bags between 9 00 am and 11 00 am in regular intervals of 10 min four gas samples per flux measurement 0 10 20 and 30 min after closure because the effluxes measured during this period were considered a representative of daily mean n2o flux rate xu and qi 2001 n2o fluxes were usually measured twice a week and the sampling frequency increased with the surrounding fertilization and precipitation events but slowed in winter to once a week during the experimental period the gas samples were immediately analyzed by gas chromatography gc 2010 japan detailed measurements and calculations about n2o flux rates and total n2o emission are described in xiong et al 2002 cumulative n2o fluxes were linearly interpolated the 15n ratios of n2o in the gas samples were analyzed by using a gasbench pre concentration trace gas concentration system interfaced to a thermoscientific delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer bremen germany 2 2 3 nh3 emissions and analysis the ventilation method was performed to measure the nh3 volatilization using a height rigid pvc cylinder 25 cm in height and 11 cm in diameter with a phosphoglycerol soaked sponge 2 cm thick and 12 cm in diameter as an absorbent jantalia et al 2012 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2004 the phosphoglycerol soaked sponges in the bottom were immersed in the 300 ml of 1 0 mol l 1 kcl solution in 500 ml containers and were shaken for 1 h to extract nh4 n in the sponges some of subsamples of ammonia absorbents were automatically pumped into an aa3 autoanalyzer bran luebbe norderstedt germany for nh4 n determination by flow injection analysis technology the other subsamples of ammonia absorbents were analyzed for 15n nh3 n isotope abundance ratios of nh4 in ammonia absorbents were determined with the ammonia diffusion method using devarda s reagent sebilo et al 2004 and analyzed by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer with an elemental analyzer ea irms the samples were collected daily in the first week after fertilization every two days in the next week and every 3 5 days thereafter in the following two weeks nh3 flux and total amount nh3 volatilization were calculated as described by liu et al 2015 2 2 4 potentially hydrologic n loss from soil residual measurement and analysis simulated rainfall was used to explore the hydrologic n loss from the residual 15n that was retained in soil after upland crop harvest we used a rainfall simulation system jlc ry1 jinzhou licheng automation equipment co ltd jinzhou china the system can simulate a wide range of rainfall intensities 10 to 390 mm h 1 using various water pressure and nozzle sizes controlled by a computer system the rainfall nozzles were held at a height of 3 m above ground and covered 25 m2 5 m 5 m four group nozzles produced a rainfall uniformity of greater than 80 the diameter of the simulated raindrops ranged ranges from 0 3 to 6 0 mm which is similar to natural raindrop distribution and size li et al 2016 this study used pots as hydrology bench after crop harvest the hydrology benches were under the coverage area of effective simulated rainfall the simulated rainfall lasted 260 min with an intensity of 30 mm h 1 the runoff samples were collected at 10 mm rainfall intervals for determining dissolved inorganic n din concentrations including no3 and nh4 and n isotope abundance ratios the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n were determined using the flow injection analysis technology and aa3 autoanalyzer bran luebbe norderstedt germany 15n isotope abundance ratios of no3 and nh4 in runoff from soil were determined with the ammonia diffusion method using devarda s reagent sebilo et al 2004 and analyzed by ea irms 2 3 calculation of the fate of 15n labeled fertilizer n the proportions of fertilizer n that was taken up by the plant fue retained in soil rsoil via gaseous loss gloss and potentially hydrologic loss

one way anova with duncan s test for multiple comparisons differences were considered to be statistically significant at p 0 05 and were indicated with different letters in the figures or tables 3 results 3 1 plant uptake and fue across different crops crops absorb n mainly from fixation fertilization and soil n the results showed that 15n fluxes by plant uptake showed significant differences among garlic oilseed rape and broad bean 67 8 kg ha 1 for garlic versus 44 4 kg ha 1 for oilseed rape and 20 6 kg ha 1 for broad bean p 0 05 fig 3 consistent with the differences in 15n labeled fertilizer n 15n fluxes by plant uptake for garlic were significantly greater than for oilseed rape and broad bean p 0 05 while the fue of garlic showed no significant variations versus oilseed rape and broad bean p 0 05 fig 3 both 15n flux by plant uptake and fue for oilseed rape were evidently higher than broad bean p 0 05 fig 3 3 2 difference in n gaseous loss between different crops the cumulative 15n n2o emissions were 5 5 kg km 2 for garlic 2 1 kg km 2 for oilseed rape and 0 094 kg km 2 for broad bean during experimental period fig 4 a n2o fluxes increased rapidly after fertilization and were positively related to temperature p 0 05 the cumulative 15n nh3 volatilization losses were 80 kg km 2 for garlic 1 7 kg km 2 for oilseed rape and 1 3 kg km 2 for broad bean during experimental period fig 4b nh3 emission mainly occurred ten days after fertilization there were significant differences in 15n n2o emissions and 15n nh3 volatilization between all crops respectively p 0 05 the largest 15n n2o and 15n nh3 emissions were observed for garlic and the 15n n2o and 15n nh3 emissions for oilseed rape were significantly larger than those of broad bean p 0 05 overall the gaseous losses of 15n via nh3 volatilization and n2o were 0 85 kg ha 1 for garlic which was significantly larger than the other two treatments fig 5 a the percentages of the n fertilizer lost via gaseous pathway including nh3 volatilization and denitrification varied among these crops i e 0 40 for garlic 0 033 for oilseed rape 0 021 for broad bean 3 3 soil residual of fertilizer n the soil residual 15n amount in garlic was significantly higher than oilseed rape and broad bean although the soil residual 15n amount in oilseed rape was higher than in broad bean table 2 the difference between the two was not statistically significant soil residual 15n abundances showed significant variations among these three crops soil residual 15n abundance in garlic was evidently greater than in oilseed rape which also had higher soil residual 15n abundance than broad bean table 2 however the percentages of fertilizer retained in soil showed little variations among these three crops 3 4 potentially hydrologic loss of soil residual n from fertilizer hydrologic n loss fluxes from soil residual 15n tended to increase with the increasing flow discharge for all these crops fig 6 under the same flow conditions hydrologic n loss fluxes from garlic soil were greater than the other two crops fig 6a and the least values occurred in broad bean fig 6b in addition the differences in hydrologic n loss flux among these three crops increased with the increasing flow discharge due to the differences in slopes the proportions of soil residual 15n that was in hydrologic loss increased sharply with increasing flow discharge for these three crops 0 8 25 6 for garlic 0 1 11 1 for oilseed rape and 0 1 5 8 for broad bean fig 7 a percentages and slopes were greater for garlic than for the other two crops and the least values occurred in broad bean fig 7a consistent with differences in hydrologic loss fluxes the proportions of 15n labeled fertilizer n in hydrologic loss increased sharply with increasing flow discharge for these three crops the proportions ranged from 0 4 under 0 5 mm flow discharge to 13 8 under 30 7 mm flow discharge for garlic while the proportions for oilseed rape 0 0 4 8 under 0 1 43 9 mm flow discharge and broad bean 0 0 3 4 under 0 2 40 7 mm flow discharge showed less variations than garlic fig 7b proportions and slopes were greater for garlic than for the other crops and the lowest values occurred in broad bean fig 7b consistent with differences in proportions of residual soil n15 that was in hydrologic loss 4 discussion 4 1 fate of 15n labeled fertilizer in the plant soil system across crops 15n fluxes by plant uptake for garlic were significantly greater than that for oilseed and broad bean with no significant variations in fue fig 3 likely due to higher fertilizer n application for garlic than the other crops these differences in fue and fertilizer n application likely be attributed to excessive n fertilizer application for garlic which resulted in more residual soil n compared to the other crops table 2 zhao et al 2009 also found that the amount of residual 15n in the soil increased significantly with an increase in the rate of fertilizer application both 15n fluxed by plant uptake and fue for oilseed were higher than broad bean fig 3 likely due to the biological n fixation of broad bean 4 2 variation in gaseous loss between different crops the gaseous losses derived from fertilizer including nh3 volatilization and n2o emissions varied among different crops cai et al 2002 nh3 volatilization exerted a negative impact on the quality of the atmospheric environment likely because of the impact of n fertilizers application behera et al 2013 gu et al 2012 n2o is an important greenhouse gas with a high global warming potential 298 times that of co2 in the 100 year horizon though n2o emission factor was approximately 1 ipcc 2006 many studies have described the nh3 volatilization and n2o emission during the rice growing season zhao et al 2016 however only a small number of studies have related the different upland crops in the rice upland crop rotation systems and measured the gaseous 15n losses the differences in gaseous n losses derived from fertilizer among these crops were significant fig 5a it is likely due to the vast difference in the rate of fertilization application among these crops wang et al 2014a found that nh3 volatilization increased linearly with n application rate and n2o emissions increased exponentially with the n application rate and the associated n surplus we found that nh3 volatilizations derived from fertilizer were dominant over the n2o emissions for garlic and broad bean 15n nh3 accounted for 93 of gaseous 15n loss for both crops but not for oilseed rape 45 an increase in the rate of fertilizer application increased the risk of n loss wang et al 2014a found that nh3 volatilization increased linearly with the n application rate and the n2o emissions increased exponentially with the n application rate and the associated n surplus in our study the highest n losses via nh3 and n2o emissions derived from fertilizer were observed in the garlic and the lowest gaseous n loss occurred in the broad bean fig 5b the study by zhang et al 2017b showed that the rice garlic crop rotation elevates the risk of n emission into the atmosphere because the n surplus in the rice garlic rotation system was significantly higher than in the rice broad bean system compared with garlic and oilseed rape the broad bean rice rotation with lower n surplus in soil could mitigate a range of potential environmental risks including eutrophication soil acidification and greenhouse gases emissions likely because a partial of fertilizer n can be replaced by biological n fixation cai et al 2018 a legume crop can increase the soil mineral n via n fixation and non legume crop could decreas the it by uptake kaspar et al 2011 which may reduce the difference between oilseed rape and broad bean 4 3 impact of soil residual n from fertilizer on subsequent hydrologic n loss a majority of the applied 15n fertilizer was retained in the soil n pool for garlic and broad bean 54 2 for garlic and 58 2 for broad bean while only 44 9 of applied 15n fertilizer in oilseed rape was retained in the soil table 2 higher soil residual percentage in garlic relative to oilseed rape was likely due to excessive fertilizer application rate and lower fue fig 3 lower soil residual percent in the oilseed rape than broad bean could be because of the lower fue for broad bean due to biological fixation such a residual effect can store n in the soil and thereby resulting in an accumulation of soil n which has been found in many previous studies van meter et al 2016 worrall et al 2015 yan et al 2014 zhou et al 2016a the accumulation of soil n could increase the n availability to subsequent loss via leaching runoff and gaseous pathway depending on the context of loss conditions zhou et al 2016a b in the present study we found that 0 8 25 6 of soil residual n can be lost via hydrologic ways for garlic depending on different flow conditions fig 7a however lower percentages of soil residual n in oilseed rape and broad bean were lost via hydrologic pathways 0 1 11 1 for oilseed rape versus 0 1 5 8 for broad bean fig 7a these differences were consistent with the differences in soil residual n amounts table 2 due to different n fertilizer application table 1 suggesting that the soil residual n resulted from n input surplus was the critical determinant for the subsequent hydrologic n loss previous studies also found that the watershed n export was correlated with the n surplus dupas et al 2015 wang et al 2014b greater proportions of 15n labeled fertilizer n were lost via the hydrologic pathway in garlic than the other crops could be attributed differences soil residual n table 2 as a result of fertilizer application table 1 and plant uptake fig 3 niu et al 2016 found that the losses of dissolved n increased exponentially at high input rates whereas the stimulation of plant n uptake and soil retention generally diminished as the n input increases in the present study despite the indistinct difference in fue between garlic oilseed rape and broad bean soil residual n rate showed significant differences between these crops primarily due to the difference in fertilizer application rate thereby causing significant variations in subsequent hydrologic loss between these crops 4 4 influence of hydrologic conditions on the loss of residual soil n in the present this study subsequent hydrologic loss of soil residual n and hydrologic loss percent increased sharply with the increasing flow discharges for all of these crops fig 6 and 7 revealing the strong influence of hydrologic conditions previous studies found that watershed n export was strongly influenced by hydrologic variables gao et al 2018 wollheim et al 2017 for example a higher percentage of net anthropogenic nitrogen input nani was exported in rivers from watersheds that have higher flow conditions howarth et al 2012 this phenomenon was observed because n transport from sources was determined by hydrologic actors and also because hydrologic variables influenced the transformation of n during transport in rivers bettez et al 2015 dupas et al 2015 seitzinger et al 2002 wollheim et al 2017 2005 wollheim et al 2008 zhou et al 2016a also found that extreme rainfall events cause the accumulated nitrate to move downwards and threaten groundwater nitrate contamination thus our study provided corroborate the significance of hydrological variables in watershed n export via leaching and runoff 4 5 suggestions for fertilizer reduction management to reduce fertilizer application for n pollution control would benefit from considering the difference in overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application across different crops first knowledge of different overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application among different crops could provide more information for agricultural adjustment to reduce the application of fertilizer in this study the overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application in garlic was significantly greater than in oilseed rape and broad bean reducing the fertilizer application to improve the quality of the entire watershed or the regional environment the agricultural structure i e the percent of different crops area should be adjusted by reducing the planting area of the crops with higher environmental impacts for example in erhai lake basin with many planting area of garlic some garlic fields can be planted broad bean or oilseed rape instead which can reduce the fertilizer application rate substantially second knowing the capability of hydrological loss of soil residual n derived from fertilizer could guide n management the soil residual n from a fertilizer may provide an essential source to subsequent plant however it could be a source of n loss if it cannot be used subsequently the contribution of soil residual n to plant uptake should be considered during fertilizer application to reduce fertilizer use for example an integrated soil crop system management can guide fertilizer application which is an environmental friendly approach to reduce environmental consequences while increasing crop productivity and improving nutrient use efficiency in china in previous studies chen et al 2014 wu and ma 2015 zhang et al 2011 third knowledge of the sensitive relationship between the hydrologic n loss and runoff could provide information for the runoff drainage management to reduce the hydrologic n loss improved water drainage management such as controlled drainage and a circular irrigation system poole et al 2018 takeda and fukushima 2006 williams et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 could be adopted 5 conclusions achieving agricultural sustainability and reducing environmental risks while increasing crop productivity requires a reduction in the fertilizer application rate agricultural structure adjustment through interconversion of different land uses e g paddy field and upland characterized by different crop rotations could be an alternative to reduce fertilizer application aside from the introduction of enhanced efficiency fertilizers and knowledge based n management the difference in the overall environmental consequences of fertilizer application across crop systems could provide important information for agricultural structure adjustment in the present study we investigated the fate of 15n labeled fertilizers in the plant soil air water system and compared the differences between three different crops in the overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application loss fluxes of fertilizer n via gaseous and hydrologic pathways showed significant variation between these different crops significantly higher gaseous loss fluxes occurred in crops with the higher rate of fertilizer application than those with a lower rate additionally the potential of hydrologic loss from the residual soil n derived from fertilizer varied among these crop systems these differences revealed the different overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application in different crops providing important information for adjustment of

11300,although empirical correlations between fertilizer application rate and nitrogen n loss have been demonstrated the differences in overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application among different crops have not been thoroughly elucidated to date we investigated the fate of 15n labeled fertilizer in the plant soil air water system across various crops i e garlic oilseed rape and broad bean by quantifying the n fluxes of various pathways combined with a pot experiment a rainfall simulating experiment and 15n tracer techniques hence we compared the differences between different crops in the overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application we found that n amount by plant uptake varied among these different crops but with little variation in fertilizer use efficiency fue the residual n amounts in soil were significantly different in these crops due to statistically non differential soil residual percentages consistent with the differences in the application rate of n fertilizer and fue further evidently different overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application occurred among these crops including gaseous loss of fertilizer n and potentially hydrologic loss of soil residual n from fertilizer the highest gaseous n loss including ammonia nh3 volatilization and nitrous oxide n2o emissions occurred in garlic system and the lowest occurred in broad bean moreover potentially hydrologic loss of soil residual n in the garlic system was higher than in the other two crop systems and the least was observed in the broad bean system therefore attempts to reduce fertilizer application could benefit from considering the difference in overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application between different crop systems the shift from crops with high environmental impacts to that with low impacts can largely reduce the regional n pollution keywords nonpoint source pollution fertilizer n 15n gaseous loss hydrologic loss overall environmental

vegetable fields was significantly lower than in the wheat maize fields while soil electrical conductivity ec was significantly higher in the vegetable soils different n losses among rice wheat and maize in response to n inputs were also found in previous studies cui et al 2014 liu et al 2016a however the overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application among different crops have not been

application zhou et al 2016b the 15n isotope tracer technique is a useful approach to investigating the fate of fertilizer n in agricultural systems chen et al 2016 quan et al 2017 sebilo et al 2013 zhou et al 2016b for example zhou et al 2016b investigated all n fluxes e g gaseous and hydrologic loss and the total n balances of agricultural systems with different fertilizers using this approach sebilo et al 2013 found the long term fate of fertilizer n in agricultural soil using the 15n isotope tracer technique however few studies compared the overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application among different crops in the present study we conducted a comprehensive study on the fate of n in three crops i e garlic oilseed rape and broad bean that were characterized by contrasting fertilizer n surplus i e the difference between n input from fertilizer and output by the plant uptake tang et al 2012 we investigated the fate of 15n labeled fertilizer in the plant soil air water system across different crops by integrating a pot experiment a rainfall simulating experiment and 15n tracer techniques the main goal of this study was to improve our understanding of the different overall environmental impacts i e the impacts of gaseous loss and hydrologic loss of fertilizer application across different crops specifically three objectives were defined i to explore the fate of fertilizer n that was taken by plant and retained in soil ii to quantify the fluxes of fertilizer n lost via gaseous and hydrological pathways and iii to compare the differences between different crops in overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application we hypothesized that fertilizer application could show evident variations in environmental impacts between different crops due to the difference in fertilizer n surplus 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental design the present study was conducted in xiaguan county 100 2119 e 25 6531 n in the southwest of erhai lake

different crops three field experiments were conducted garlic allium sativum oilseed rape brassica napus and broad bean vicia faba all experiments were conducted in a randomized complete block design with three replicates the size of each plot was 100 cm length 30 cm width 20 cm height the planting density was accordance with local conventional management in all experiments in the garlic oilseed rape and broad bean experiments the plots received 423 212 and 95 2 kg n ha 1 respectively and all were applied as the basal fertilizer table 1 the n p2o5 and k2o fertilizers applied were urea 46 4 n superphosphate 18 p2o5 and potassium chloride 60 k2o respectively approximately 50 of urea was 15n labelled by 50 urea as the atomic percent 2 2 sample measurement and analysis 2 2 1 plant and soil measurement and analysis these crops including grain straw and root in each plot were all fully harvested plant samples were dried at 70 c to constant weight after being washed with distilled water and weighed to calculate the dry biomass of the aboveground and root soil samples were collected immediately after crop harvest and were air dried to analyze tn content and 15n abundance in soil parts of dried plant samples and soil samples were air dried and ground to pass through a 150 Î¼ m screen for tn and 15n analysis plant and soil samples were analyzed for tn content using an elemental analyzer costech ecs4010 costech analytical technologies inc valencia ca usa 15n abundance ratio analyses were performed using gas isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms isoprime 100 system delta v plus thermo scientific bremen germany 2 2 2 n2o emissions the n2o emissions were monitored with the static chambers gas chromatography technique as described by zhou et al 2017b in the present study gas samples were collected from the chamber in polyethylene coated aluminum gas bags between 9 00 am and 11 00 am in regular intervals of 10 min four gas samples per flux measurement 0 10 20 and 30 min after closure because the effluxes measured during this period were considered a representative of daily mean n2o flux rate xu and qi 2001 n2o fluxes were usually measured twice a week and the sampling frequency increased with the surrounding fertilization and precipitation events but slowed in winter to once a week during the experimental period the gas samples were immediately analyzed by gas chromatography gc 2010 japan detailed measurements and calculations about n2o flux rates and total n2o emission are described in xiong et al 2002 cumulative n2o fluxes were linearly interpolated the 15n ratios of n2o in the gas samples were analyzed by using a gasbench pre concentration trace gas concentration system interfaced to a thermoscientific delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer bremen germany 2 2 3 nh3 emissions and analysis the ventilation method was performed to measure the nh3 volatilization using a height rigid pvc cylinder 25 cm in height and 11 cm in diameter with a phosphoglycerol soaked sponge 2 cm thick and 12 cm in diameter as an absorbent jantalia et al 2012 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2004 the phosphoglycerol soaked sponges in the bottom were immersed in the 300 ml of 1 0 mol l 1 kcl solution in 500 ml containers and were shaken for 1 h to extract nh4 n in the sponges some of subsamples of ammonia absorbents were automatically pumped into an aa3 autoanalyzer bran luebbe norderstedt germany for nh4 n determination by flow injection analysis technology the other subsamples of ammonia absorbents were analyzed for 15n nh3 n isotope abundance ratios of nh4 in ammonia absorbents were determined with the ammonia diffusion method using devarda s reagent sebilo et al 2004 and analyzed by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer with an elemental analyzer ea irms the samples were collected daily in the first week after fertilization every two days in the next week and every 3 5 days thereafter in the following two weeks nh3 flux and total amount nh3 volatilization were calculated as described by liu et al 2015 2 2 4 potentially hydrologic n loss from soil residual measurement and analysis simulated rainfall was used to explore the hydrologic n loss from the residual 15n that was retained in soil after upland crop harvest we used a rainfall simulation system jlc ry1 jinzhou licheng automation equipment co ltd jinzhou china the system can simulate a wide range of rainfall intensities 10 to 390 mm h 1 using various water pressure and nozzle sizes controlled by a computer system the rainfall nozzles were held at a height of 3 m above ground and covered 25 m2 5 m 5 m four group nozzles produced a rainfall uniformity of greater than 80 the diameter of the simulated raindrops ranged ranges from 0 3 to 6 0 mm which is similar to natural raindrop distribution and size li et al 2016 this study used pots as hydrology bench after crop harvest the hydrology benches were under the coverage area of effective simulated rainfall the simulated rainfall lasted 260 min with an intensity of 30 mm h 1 the runoff samples were collected at 10 mm rainfall intervals for determining dissolved inorganic n din concentrations including no3 and nh4 and n isotope abundance ratios the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n were determined using the flow injection analysis technology and aa3 autoanalyzer bran luebbe norderstedt germany 15n isotope abundance ratios of no3 and nh4 in runoff from soil were determined with the ammonia diffusion method using devarda s reagent sebilo et al 2004 and analyzed by ea irms 2 3 calculation of the fate of 15n labeled fertilizer n the proportions of fertilizer n that was taken up by the plant fue retained in soil rsoil via gaseous loss gloss and potentially hydrologic loss

one way anova with duncan s test for multiple comparisons differences were considered to be statistically significant at p 0 05 and were indicated with different letters in the figures or tables 3 results 3 1 plant uptake and fue across different crops crops absorb n mainly from fixation fertilization and soil n the results showed that 15n fluxes by plant uptake showed significant differences among garlic oilseed rape and broad bean 67 8 kg ha 1 for garlic versus 44 4 kg ha 1 for oilseed rape and 20 6 kg ha 1 for broad bean p 0 05 fig 3 consistent with the differences in 15n labeled fertilizer n 15n fluxes by plant uptake for garlic were significantly greater than for oilseed rape and broad bean p 0 05 while the fue of garlic showed no significant variations versus oilseed rape and broad bean p 0 05 fig 3 both 15n flux by plant uptake and fue for oilseed rape were evidently higher than broad bean p 0 05 fig 3 3 2 difference in n gaseous loss between different crops the cumulative 15n n2o emissions were 5 5 kg km 2 for garlic 2 1 kg km 2 for oilseed rape and 0 094 kg km 2 for broad bean during experimental period fig 4 a n2o fluxes increased rapidly after fertilization and were positively related to temperature p 0 05 the cumulative 15n nh3 volatilization losses were 80 kg km 2 for garlic 1 7 kg km 2 for oilseed rape and 1 3 kg km 2 for broad bean during experimental period fig 4b nh3 emission mainly occurred ten days after fertilization there were significant differences in 15n n2o emissions and 15n nh3 volatilization between all crops respectively p 0 05 the largest 15n n2o and 15n nh3 emissions were observed for garlic and the 15n n2o and 15n nh3 emissions for oilseed rape were significantly larger than those of broad bean p 0 05 overall the gaseous losses of 15n via nh3 volatilization and n2o were 0 85 kg ha 1 for garlic which was significantly larger than the other two treatments fig 5 a the percentages of the n fertilizer lost via gaseous pathway including nh3 volatilization and denitrification varied among these crops i e 0 40 for garlic 0 033 for oilseed rape 0 021 for broad bean 3 3 soil residual of fertilizer n the soil residual 15n amount in garlic was significantly higher than oilseed rape and broad bean although the soil residual 15n amount in oilseed rape was higher than in broad bean table 2 the difference between the two was not statistically significant soil residual 15n abundances showed significant variations among these three crops soil residual 15n abundance in garlic was evidently greater than in oilseed rape which also had higher soil residual 15n abundance than broad bean table 2 however the percentages of fertilizer retained in soil showed little variations among these three crops 3 4 potentially hydrologic loss of soil residual n from fertilizer hydrologic n loss fluxes from soil residual 15n tended to increase with the increasing flow discharge for all these crops fig 6 under the same flow conditions hydrologic n loss fluxes from garlic soil were greater than the other two crops fig 6a and the least values occurred in broad bean fig 6b in addition the differences in hydrologic n loss flux among these three crops increased with the increasing flow discharge due to the differences in slopes the proportions of soil residual 15n that was in hydrologic loss increased sharply with increasing flow discharge for these three crops 0 8 25 6 for garlic 0 1 11 1 for oilseed rape and 0 1 5 8 for broad bean fig 7 a percentages and slopes were greater for garlic than for the other two crops and the least values occurred in broad bean fig 7a consistent with differences in hydrologic loss fluxes the proportions of 15n labeled fertilizer n in hydrologic loss increased sharply with increasing flow discharge for these three crops the proportions ranged from 0 4 under 0 5 mm flow discharge to 13 8 under 30 7 mm flow discharge for garlic while the proportions for oilseed rape 0 0 4 8 under 0 1 43 9 mm flow discharge and broad bean 0 0 3 4 under 0 2 40 7 mm flow discharge showed less variations than garlic fig 7b proportions and slopes were greater for garlic than for the other crops and the lowest values occurred in broad bean fig 7b consistent with differences in proportions of residual soil n15 that was in hydrologic loss 4 discussion 4 1 fate of 15n labeled fertilizer in the plant soil system across crops 15n fluxes by plant uptake for garlic were significantly greater than that for oilseed and broad bean with no significant variations in fue fig 3 likely due to higher fertilizer n application for garlic than the other crops these differences in fue and fertilizer n application likely be attributed to excessive n fertilizer application for garlic which resulted in more residual soil n compared to the other crops table 2 zhao et al 2009 also found that the amount of residual 15n in the soil increased significantly with an increase in the rate of fertilizer application both 15n fluxed by plant uptake and fue for oilseed were higher than broad bean fig 3 likely due to the biological n fixation of broad bean 4 2 variation in gaseous loss between different crops the gaseous losses derived from fertilizer including nh3 volatilization and n2o emissions varied among different crops cai et al 2002 nh3 volatilization exerted a negative impact on the quality of the atmospheric environment likely because of the impact of n fertilizers application behera et al 2013 gu et al 2012 n2o is an important greenhouse gas with a high global warming potential 298 times that of co2 in the 100 year horizon though n2o emission factor was approximately 1 ipcc 2006 many studies have described the nh3 volatilization and n2o emission during the rice growing season zhao et al 2016 however only a small number of studies have related the different upland crops in the rice upland crop rotation systems and measured the gaseous 15n losses the differences in gaseous n losses derived from fertilizer among these crops were significant fig 5a it is likely due to the vast difference in the rate of fertilization application among these crops wang et al 2014a found that nh3 volatilization increased linearly with n application rate and n2o emissions increased exponentially with the n application rate and the associated n surplus we found that nh3 volatilizations derived from fertilizer were dominant over the n2o emissions for garlic and broad bean 15n nh3 accounted for 93 of gaseous 15n loss for both crops but not for oilseed rape 45 an increase in the rate of fertilizer application increased the risk of n loss wang et al 2014a found that nh3 volatilization increased linearly with the n application rate and the n2o emissions increased exponentially with the n application rate and the associated n surplus in our study the highest n losses via nh3 and n2o emissions derived from fertilizer were observed in the garlic and the lowest gaseous n loss occurred in the broad bean fig 5b the study by zhang et al 2017b showed that the rice garlic crop rotation elevates the risk of n emission into the atmosphere because the n surplus in the rice garlic rotation system was significantly higher than in the rice broad bean system compared with garlic and oilseed rape the broad bean rice rotation with lower n surplus in soil could mitigate a range of potential environmental risks including eutrophication soil acidification and greenhouse gases emissions likely because a partial of fertilizer n can be replaced by biological n fixation cai et al 2018 a legume crop can increase the soil mineral n via n fixation and non legume crop could decreas the it by uptake kaspar et al 2011 which may reduce the difference between oilseed rape and broad bean 4 3 impact of soil residual n from fertilizer on subsequent hydrologic n loss a majority of the applied 15n fertilizer was retained in the soil n pool for garlic and broad bean 54 2 for garlic and 58 2 for broad bean while only 44 9 of applied 15n fertilizer in oilseed rape was retained in the soil table 2 higher soil residual percentage in garlic relative to oilseed rape was likely due to excessive fertilizer application rate and lower fue fig 3 lower soil residual percent in the oilseed rape than broad bean could be because of the lower fue for broad bean due to biological fixation such a residual effect can store n in the soil and thereby resulting in an accumulation of soil n which has been found in many previous studies van meter et al 2016 worrall et al 2015 yan et al 2014 zhou et al 2016a the accumulation of soil n could increase the n availability to subsequent loss via leaching runoff and gaseous pathway depending on the context of loss conditions zhou et al 2016a b in the present study we found that 0 8 25 6 of soil residual n can be lost via hydrologic ways for garlic depending on different flow conditions fig 7a however lower percentages of soil residual n in oilseed rape and broad bean were lost via hydrologic pathways 0 1 11 1 for oilseed rape versus 0 1 5 8 for broad bean fig 7a these differences were consistent with the differences in soil residual n amounts table 2 due to different n fertilizer application table 1 suggesting that the soil residual n resulted from n input surplus was the critical determinant for the subsequent hydrologic n loss previous studies also found that the watershed n export was correlated with the n surplus dupas et al 2015 wang et al 2014b greater proportions of 15n labeled fertilizer n were lost via the hydrologic pathway in garlic than the other crops could be attributed differences soil residual n table 2 as a result of fertilizer application table 1 and plant uptake fig 3 niu et al 2016 found that the losses of dissolved n increased exponentially at high input rates whereas the stimulation of plant n uptake and soil retention generally diminished as the n input increases in the present study despite the indistinct difference in fue between garlic oilseed rape and broad bean soil residual n rate showed significant differences between these crops primarily due to the difference in fertilizer application rate thereby causing significant variations in subsequent hydrologic loss between these crops 4 4 influence of hydrologic conditions on the loss of residual soil n in the present this study subsequent hydrologic loss of soil residual n and hydrologic loss percent increased sharply with the increasing flow discharges for all of these crops fig 6 and 7 revealing the strong influence of hydrologic conditions previous studies found that watershed n export was strongly influenced by hydrologic variables gao et al 2018 wollheim et al 2017 for example a higher percentage of net anthropogenic nitrogen input nani was exported in rivers from watersheds that have higher flow conditions howarth et al 2012 this phenomenon was observed because n transport from sources was determined by hydrologic actors and also because hydrologic variables influenced the transformation of n during transport in rivers bettez et al 2015 dupas et al 2015 seitzinger et al 2002 wollheim et al 2017 2005 wollheim et al 2008 zhou et al 2016a also found that extreme rainfall events cause the accumulated nitrate to move downwards and threaten groundwater nitrate contamination thus our study provided corroborate the significance of hydrological variables in watershed n export via leaching and runoff 4 5 suggestions for fertilizer reduction management to reduce fertilizer application for n pollution control would benefit from considering the difference in overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application across different crops first knowledge of different overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application among different crops could provide more information for agricultural adjustment to reduce the application of fertilizer in this study the overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application in garlic was significantly greater than in oilseed rape and broad bean reducing the fertilizer application to improve the quality of the entire watershed or the regional environment the agricultural structure i e the percent of different crops area should be adjusted by reducing the planting area of the crops with higher environmental impacts for example in erhai lake basin with many planting area of garlic some garlic fields can be planted broad bean or oilseed rape instead which can reduce the fertilizer application rate substantially second knowing the capability of hydrological loss of soil residual n derived from fertilizer could guide n management the soil residual n from a fertilizer may provide an essential source to subsequent plant however it could be a source of n loss if it cannot be used subsequently the contribution of soil residual n to plant uptake should be considered during fertilizer application to reduce fertilizer use for example an integrated soil crop system management can guide fertilizer application which is an environmental friendly approach to reduce environmental consequences while increasing crop productivity and improving nutrient use efficiency in china in previous studies chen et al 2014 wu and ma 2015 zhang et al 2011 third knowledge of the sensitive relationship between the hydrologic n loss and runoff could provide information for the runoff drainage management to reduce the hydrologic n loss improved water drainage management such as controlled drainage and a circular irrigation system poole et al 2018 takeda and fukushima 2006 williams et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 could be adopted 5 conclusions achieving agricultural sustainability and reducing environmental risks while increasing crop productivity requires a reduction in the fertilizer application rate agricultural structure adjustment through interconversion of different land uses e g paddy field and upland characterized by different crop rotations could be an alternative to reduce fertilizer application aside from the introduction of enhanced efficiency fertilizers and knowledge based n management the difference in the overall environmental consequences of fertilizer application across crop systems could provide important information for agricultural structure adjustment in the present study we investigated the fate of 15n labeled fertilizers in the plant soil air water system and compared the differences between three different crops in the overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application loss fluxes of fertilizer n via gaseous and hydrologic pathways showed significant variation between these different crops significantly higher gaseous loss fluxes occurred in crops with the higher rate of fertilizer application than those with a lower rate additionally the potential of hydrologic loss from the residual soil n derived from fertilizer varied among these crop systems these differences revealed the different overall environmental impacts of fertilizer application in different crops providing important information for adjustment of

11301,declining water levels in the ogallala aquifer of the u s high plains necessitate more efficient irrigation technology to sustain agricultural production a study to evaluate the performance of mobile drip irrigation mdi for maize production in comparison to common center pivot nozzles low elevation spray application lesa and low energy precision application lepa was conducted a center pivot was retrofitted with mdi lepa and lesa irrigation capacities of 6 3 3 1 and 1 6 mm d were considered grain yield water use efficiency above ground biomass leaf area index lai and soil water content

there were no significant differences in monthly biomass yield between the application devices but there were significant differences in biomass yield between irrigation capacities there were no significant differences in lai between both the application devices and irrigation capacities there were no significant differences in water use efficiency between the application technologies p 0 2352 at 5 significance level however differences between irrigation capacities were significant p 0 050 generally crop biophysical measurements under mdi were not significantly different from those under lepa and lesa any marginal benefits of mdi were likely masked by rainfall thus further evaluation of mdi is recommended under conditions of less applied water than lepa or lesa accompanied by low rainfall the other benefits of mdi were found in reduction of wheel track rutting and ease of carrying out fertigation keywords mobile drip irrigation lepa lesa center pivot irrigation ogallala 1 introduction maize is one of the major crops cultivated in the u s midwest and it is among the five main crops grown in kansas kansas department of agriculture 2016a the state of kansas is among the top ten producers of maize for grain in the u s contributing 4 of the total national production usda national agricultural statistics service 2015 in addition to grain production and to a lesser degree kansas grows maize for silage between 2011 and 2015 the average value of maize exported annually from kansas was 339 92 million kansas department of agriculture 2016b making it the fifth largest agricultural export the land area under maize production in kansas has increased over the years indicating an upward trend into the future between 2006 and 2016 the average acreage under maize production was 1 738 125 ha kansas department of agriculture 2016b the crop is grown in all geographic regions of kansas but the southwest and northwest regions of the state are two largest production areas by land area these areas are also in the western region of kansas which receives the lowest amounts of rainfall averaging 440 mm annually goodin et al 2004 rahmani et al 2013 maize is the most irrigated crop in kansas according to kenny and juracek 2013 and requires from 500 to 800 mm of water to meet full crop evapotranspiration demands rogers et al 2015 to meet the water demand in western kansas additional 13 6 to 81 8 of crop water need to be supplied through irrigation according to kenny and juracek 2013 the mean irrigation application rate for maize in kansas is 381 mm year with an upward trend in the acreage from 1992 to 2011 in 1992 maize contributed to 43 of irrigated agriculture followed by increase to 56 in 2000 and 58 in 2011 kenny and juracek 2013 although maize production in kansas has steadily increased over the years the amount of water in the ogallala aquifer which is a main source of groundwater used for irrigation declined mcguire 2017 steward et al 2013 wada et al 2010 this reduction in groundwater levels has led to diminished well pumping capacities steward et al 2013 and affected farming decisions and management practices improved irrigation efficiency is the water management strategy that can extend the usable life of the ogallala aquifer as well as better cope with water scarcity more than 90 of irrigation in kansas rogers et al 2008 is done using center pivots that are typically fitted with low elevation spray application lesa nozzles lamm et al 2006 lesa is one of two spray nozzle categories the other is mid elevation spray application mesa which is suited for fields with high elevation changes although not common in kansas low energy precision application lepa nozzles are widely used in many regions of the southern high plains like texas o shaughnessy et al 2016 schneider and howell 1999 the earliest iteration of lepa devices were developed by lyle and bordovsky 1983 in texas and the primary design objective was to develop devices which could operate at low pressures in order to reduce energy costs in irrigation lamm et al 2006 a lepa application device could refer to either a sock that is dragged on the ground or a bubbler fitted a slight distance off the ground schneider and howell 1999 for this study a lepa bubbler was selected the application efficiencies of these technologies are in the ranges of 70 80 for lesa irmak et al 2011 rajan et al 2015 80 95 for lepa irmak et al 2011 waller and yitayew 2016 and 60 70 for mesa rajan et al 2015 though they are relatively efficient irrigation technologies there are some water loss pathways which they cannot prevent like canopy interception and evaporation soil water evaporation wind drift and runoff mobile drip irrigation mdi in theory has potential to eliminate the above mentioned water loses hence improve irrigation efficiency of center pivot systems in mdi water is applied directly to soil surface instead of aerial broadcasting in lepa and lesa mdi is the combination of drip irrigation presently the most efficient irrigation method goyal 2012 pathak et al 2009 and center pivot systems instead of typical spray nozzles the center pivot is fitted with drip lines that are dragged along the soil surface as the center pivot rotates during irrigation event the mdi concept has been tried in the past using various configurations that were dependent on the prevailing technologies of the time phene et al 1985 1981 but its development and adoption was beset by technological challenges with technological advancements in irrigation such as improvement in water filtration and pressure compensating emitters kisekka et al 2017 the interest in mdi was revived and furthermore bolstered by the need for more efficient irrigation technologies to better adapt to water scarcity and increase water conservation the objective of this study was to evaluate maize production under mdi as compared to lepa and lesa two common irrigation application devices used by farmers in the ogallala area of kansas this is an effort to benchmark modern mdi against other well known and widely used irrigation technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 field description a two year field experiment on biophysical properties of maize impacted by different irrigation technologies mdi lepa and lesa was conducted at the kansas state university s southwest research and extension center near garden city kansas 32 024 lat 100 826 long 885 m above sea level the experimental field was in ulysses silt loam soil stone et al 2011 and under four span center pivot with variable rate irrigation vri capability the center pivot had the following specifications span one 41 6 m spans two and three 41 2 m span four 41 1 m and 5 5 m overhang fig 1 the experiment was set up on the eastern half of the center pivot as a 3 4 split plot randomized complete block design with two factors irrigation capacity and irrigation application device and three replications fig 1 span 1 was maintained as a system failsafe and kept operational for each irrigation event but was not considered for data collection therefore there were 12 treatments in each block with a total of 36 treatments for the whole experiment a treatment was made up of an irrigation device and an irrigation capacity each span was divided into four equal parts that accommodated two mdis with dripper flow rates of 3 8 l h and 7 6 l h hereafter mdi1 and mdi2 respectively as shown in fig 2 lepa bubbler and lesa spray nozzle the applied three irrigation capacities were 6 2 3 1 and 1 6 mm d that related to full 1 2 and 1 4 maize evapotranspiration et demands respectively for the studied site a matrix of the irrigation treatment combinationsis shown in table 1 below 2 2 agronomic management for both years a no till planter was used to plant the maize in fields covered with stubble from previous seasons the maize varieties of deklab 64 89 in 2016 and deklab 62 98 in 2017 were planted at a seeding rate of 84 016 seeds ha in the 2016 the maize was planted on may 6th and emerged on may 23rd while in 2017 it was planted on may 8th and emerged on may 22nd fertilizer was applied in three

considered to complement water application by rainfall during the season the irrigation capacities of 6 2 3 1 and 1 6 mm d were derived from well capacities of 37 9 18 9 and 9 5 l s respectively the irrigation capacity of 6 2 mm d was designed to ensure meeting full seasonal et requirement for maize thus the irrigation capacities of 3 1 and 1 6 mm d met 50 and 25 of seasonal et respectively in the 2016 season the amounts of water applied were 215 9 114 3 and 88 9 mm for respective irrigation capacities of 6 2 3 1 and 1 6 mm d while in 2017 they were 266 7 139 7 and 88 9 mm d respectively

among the treatments littell et al 2006 the glimmix procedure in sas software was used for data analysis schabenberger 2005 a 5 significance level was used to conduct statistical tests 3 results and discussions 3 1 rainfall total rainfall received at the experiment site for a growing season april to october were 475 5 and 440 8 mm for 2016 and 2017 respectively these amounts are considered normal seasonal rainfall totals for the kansas state university southwest research extension center and within the range of the yearly rainfall for western kansas goodin et al 2004 rahmani et al 2013 although the seasonal rainfall totals in 2016 and 2017 were close their monthly distribution was different fig 3 the bulk of the rainfall in 2016 was constricted to the months of april may june july and august with september and october receiving little or no rainfall between april and july year 2016 received 179 3 mm more rainfall than the corresponding period in 2017 for this reason fewer irrigation events were carried out in 2016 between april and july in comparison to 2017 3 2 soil water content change in soil water storage between the start and end of the cropping season was used to compare the differences in water application between the irrigation application devices a similar approach was used by benjamin et al 2015 for comparison of the change in soil moisture storage under full and deficit irrigation scenarios the results of the statistical analysis presented in table 4 showed that the change in soil water storage among mdi lepa and lesa was not significantly different p 0 1990 while the change in storage between the rates of 6 2 3 1 and 1 6 mm d was significant as indicated by p 0 0001 the highest and lowest changes in storage were for 1 6 and 6 2 mm d treatments respectively soil profile water contents for 2016 and 2017 seasons are shown in figs 4 and 5 seasonal variation of available water in the top 2 4 m of the soil profile is show in fig 6 water content and available water at the start of the 2017 season was significantly higher than in 2016 this is attributed to 63 1 mm of rainfall received in march 2017 whereas there was no rainfall in the same period in 2016 in 2017 generally for all treatments top layers in the soil profile had higher water content and available water in comparison to 2016 this is attributed to a thick mulch of maize stover that was left over from the 2016 season higher soil water contents seen in september and october of 2017 were attributed to the 73 2 and 61 1 mm of rainfall received in those months respectively in contrast to 1 7 and 0 mm received in the same period in 2016 as shown in fig 4 in 2016 the largest zone of water depletion under the 6 2 mm d irrigation capacity at the latter stages of the season was as a depth range between 0 9 and 1 5 m for mdi lesa and lepa corresponding depletion depths for the 3 1 and 1 6 mm d were greater which indicated that the plants were drawing water from deeper depths similar depletion pattern was apparent for 2017 with the higher water content in the soil profile than in 2016 3 3 grain yield seed weight above ground biomass and lai the differences in grain yields for 2016 and 2017 shown in fig 7 for four irrigation application devices mdi1 mdi2 lepa lesa were not significant p 0 085 this finding is similar to observations reported by kisekka et al 2017 and o shaughnessy and colaizzi 2017 who found no differences in grain yield between mdi and lesa however significant differences were found between the three irrigation capacities p 0 0001 table 5 shows the mean weights of the 500 seed count for each treatment although no significant differences p 0 2134 in the weights of seeds were found between the irrigation application devices the differences between the three irrigation capacities were found significant p 0 0148 the interaction effects between application device and irrigation capacity did not have a significant effect on seed weight p 0 5073 as anticipated grain yield for all devices generally decreased when irrigation capacity decreased 6 2 and 1 6 mm d irrigation capacities caused the highest and lowest grain yields respectively the interaction effects between irrigation application devices and irrigation capacity were not significant p 0 228 which implies a general impact of irrigation capacity on grain yield regardless of the type of application device used based on five years 2005 09 of data by klocke et al 2011 the yields of maize grown in western kansas and irrigated at 100 50 and 25 capacities were 12 000 9000 and 6000 kg ha respectively these values represent yield differences of 25 and 50 in yield between the full half and quarter irrigations klocke et al 2007 also reported maize yields of 12 000 and 11 000 kg ha for 100 and 50 irrigation for west central nebraska region indicating a marginal difference in yields between full and half irrigation in this study the difference in mean grain yield between 6 2 mm d and 3 1 and 1 6 mm d irrigation capacities were small at 5 4 and 11 4 respectively though irrigation capacity is known to be a significant determinant of grain yield the slight differences observed between three irrigation capacities can be attributed to the effect of above normal growing season rainfall at critical growth stages which reduced the impact of water stress in under irrigated areas monthly increases in biomass yield plotted alongside in season irrigation events for different treatments are shown in fig 8 similar to grain yield there was no significant difference in monthly biomass yields between irrigation application devices for all months table 6 except for the first month there was significant difference in biomass yield between the 6 2 3 1 1 6 mm d irrigation capacities the interaction effects between irrigation application devices and irrigation capacity were found not significant table 6 biomass yields in 2016 were generally lower than those in 2017 confirming the results of other studies on yearly maize biomass variation benjamin et al 2015 djaman et al 2013 ning et al 2012 statistical analyses of monthly lai for 2016 and 2017 shown in fig 9 were conducted separately because the monthly readings for either year were not taken on or close to the same dates tables 7 and 8 show the least square means of lai for 2016 and 2017 the results for 2016 show that there were generally no significant differences in lai between both the application devices as well as irrigation capacities in contrast in 2017 while no significant differences in lai were found between application devices there were differences between irrigation capacities lai for month one was not significantly different between either application devices or irrigation capacities the interactive effects between the application devices and the irrigation capacities were also not significantly different the absence of significant differences found for plant growth parameters grain yield biomass yield and lai between mdi lepa and lesa indicates that all devices delivered similar amounts of water to the crops according to yin and mcclure 2013 biomass growth can be a good indicator of the health of a maize crop from early to mid stages of its growth since other crop management factors nutrients weed pests control were the same for all irrigation treatments the lack of significant difference in biomass yields between mdi lesa and lepa indicates that all devices applied the same amount of water to the maize a strong relationship exists between crop yields and et saseendran et al 2014 and reported for maize in several studies Ã§akir 2004 and djaman et al 2013 this study postulated that mdi would apply water more efficiently in comparison with lepa and lesa however the results did not indicate any significant yield advantage of mdi over both lepa and lesa kisekka et al 2017 reported that soil evaporation under mdi was lower than that under lesa by 35 indicating that mdi did apply water more efficiently and it was consistent with dripping irrigation in general the reason why greater differences in the measured biophysical benefits were absent in this study can be attributed to the effect of rainfall received over 2016 and 2017 seasons 3 4 water use efficiency water use efficiency for 2016 and 2017 seasons under mdi lepa and lesa with 6 2 3 1 and 1 6 mm d irrigation capacities is shown in fig 10 there were no significant differences in water use efficiency between the application devices p 0 2352 however the differences between irrigation capacities were found significant p 0 050 the interaction effects were not significant with p 0 7469 these observations were consistent with similar statistical analyses for grain yield the analysis of seasonal et for the two cropping seasons showed that there was no significant difference in et between mdi lepa and lesa with p 0 2352 for 2016 and p 0 6805 for 2017 while significant differences were found between the 6 2 3 1 1 6 mm d irrigation capacities with p 0 0014 and p 0 0001 for 2016 and 2017 respectively any differences in the biophysical properties in this study were expected to have resulted from the differences in et which in turn arose from the differences in soil water storage the fact that no differences in et were found between the irrigation application devices is thus consistent with the absence of significant differences between measured biophysical properties under different devices 3 5 other study observations wheel track rutting is a common problem in center pivot irrigation systems fitted with lesa lepa and mesa nozzles this is because such nozzles tend to spread water over wide areas on the soil surface including wheel paths and have high application rates during the study frequent visual inspection for wheel track rutting showed that the depths of wheel ruts in areas under mdi were much less than those in locations under lesa and lepa this reduced wheel track rutting highlights another advantage of mdi though fertigation was not done in the study it is important to note that mdi would also make the process relatively easier to implement because it is designed to apply water directly to the soil surface which prevents foliage burn 4 conclusions the results of this study showed that no significant differences were detected in grain yield above ground biomass water use efficiency and lai between mdi and lepa and lesa similar conclusions were made by kisekka et al 2017 and o shaughnessy and colaizzi 2017 the study also showed that there were no major differences in soil water transitions during the season from these facts we concluded that mdi did not perform better or worse than either lepa or lesa however since the main advantage of mdi was to reduce water losses as compared to sprinkler type devices like lesa and lepa it was anticipated to observe benefits of mdi by measuring of biophysical properties and soil water content above normal rainfall received during each of the two studied growing seasons highly likely led to relatively uniform soil moisture distribution throughout the fields and any marginal increases in soil water content due to mdi efficiency were negated and resulting in statistically insignificant measurements of the changes in biophysical properties considering that varying rainfall during two seasons did affect the results of this study and altered the anticipated conclusions it is recommended additional research to compare mdi to lepa and or lesa be continued under the following two conditions 1 mdi applying lesser water than lepa and lesa during each irrigation event and 2 mdi evaluated against lepa and lesa during years with very little rainfall evaluating mdi under conditions in which it applies less water in comparison to lepa and lesa is based on the idea that since mdi minimizes water loss biophysical measurements of crops under mdi applying fraction of water under lepa and lesa will still be comparable this way of evaluating mdi against lepa and lesa will isolate any effects of rainfall it could also help better understand the rainfall thresholds for which mdi makes a difference in comparison to other technologies acknowledgements this research was supported by grants and

mobile drip irrigation mdi for maize production in comparison to common center pivot nozzles low elevation spray application lesa and low energy precision application lepa was conducted a center pivot

was compared differences in grain yield between irrigation application devices were not significant p 0 085 but there were differences between irrigation capacities p 0 0001 at 5 significance level there were no significant differences in monthly biomass yield between the application devices but there were significant differences in biomass yield between irrigation capacities there were no significant differences in lai between both the application devices and irrigation capacities there were no significant differences in water use efficiency between the application technologies p 0 2352 at 5 significance level however differences between irrigation capacities were significant p 0 050 generally crop biophysical measurements under mdi were not significantly different from those under lepa and lesa any marginal benefits of mdi were likely masked by rainfall thus further evaluation of mdi is recommended under conditions of less applied water than lepa or lesa accompanied by low rainfall the other benefits of mdi were found in reduction of wheel track rutting and ease of carrying out fertigation keywords mobile drip irrigation lepa lesa center pivot irrigation ogallala 1 introduction maize is one of the major crops cultivated in the u s midwest and it is among the five main crops grown in kansas kansas department of agriculture 2016a the state of kansas is among the top ten producers of maize for grain in the u s contributing 4 of the total national production usda national agricultural statistics service 2015 in addition to grain production and to a lesser degree kansas grows maize for silage between 2011 and 2015 the average value of maize exported annually from kansas was 339 92 million kansas department of agriculture 2016b making it the fifth largest agricultural export the land area under maize production in kansas has increased over the years indicating an upward trend into the future between 2006 and 2016 the average acreage under maize production was 1 738 125 ha kansas department of agriculture 2016b the crop is grown in all geographic regions of kansas but the southwest and northwest regions of the state are two largest production areas by land area these areas are also in the western region of kansas which receives the lowest amounts of rainfall averaging 440 mm annually goodin et al 2004 rahmani et al 2013 maize is the most irrigated crop in kansas according to kenny and juracek 2013 and requires from 500 to 800 mm of water to meet full crop evapotranspiration demands rogers et al 2015 to meet the water demand in western kansas additional 13 6 to 81 8 of crop water need to be supplied through irrigation according to kenny and juracek 2013 the mean irrigation application rate for maize in kansas is 381 mm year with an upward trend in the acreage from 1992 to 2011 in 1992 maize contributed to 43 of irrigated agriculture followed by increase to 56 in 2000 and 58 in 2011 kenny and juracek 2013 although maize production in kansas has steadily increased over the years the amount of water in the ogallala aquifer which is a main source of groundwater used for irrigation declined mcguire 2017 steward et al 2013 wada et al 2010 this reduction in groundwater levels has led to diminished well pumping capacities steward et al 2013 and affected farming decisions and management practices improved irrigation efficiency is the water management strategy that can extend the usable life of the ogallala aquifer as well as better cope with water scarcity more than 90 of irrigation in kansas rogers et al 2008 is done using center pivots that are typically fitted with low elevation spray application lesa nozzles lamm et al 2006 lesa is one of two spray nozzle categories the other is mid elevation spray application mesa which is suited for fields with high elevation changes although not common in kansas low energy precision application lepa nozzles are widely used in many regions of the southern high plains like texas o shaughnessy et al 2016 schneider and howell 1999 the earliest iteration of lepa devices were developed by lyle and bordovsky 1983 in texas and the primary design objective was to develop devices which could operate at low pressures in order to reduce energy costs in irrigation lamm et al 2006 a lepa application device could refer to either a sock that is dragged on the ground or a bubbler fitted a slight distance off the ground schneider and howell 1999 for this study a lepa bubbler was selected the application efficiencies of these technologies are in the ranges of 70 80 for lesa irmak et al 2011 rajan et al 2015 80 95 for lepa irmak et al 2011 waller and yitayew 2016 and 60 70 for mesa rajan et al 2015 though they are relatively efficient irrigation technologies there are some water loss pathways which they cannot prevent like canopy interception and evaporation soil water evaporation wind drift and runoff mobile drip irrigation mdi in theory has potential to eliminate the above mentioned water loses hence improve irrigation efficiency of center pivot systems in mdi water is applied directly to soil surface instead of aerial broadcasting in lepa and lesa mdi is the combination of drip irrigation presently the most efficient irrigation method goyal 2012 pathak et al 2009 and center pivot systems instead of typical spray nozzles the center pivot is fitted with drip lines that are dragged along the soil surface as the center pivot rotates during irrigation event the mdi concept has been tried in the past using various configurations that were dependent on the prevailing technologies of the time phene et al 1985 1981 but its development and adoption was beset by technological challenges with technological advancements in irrigation such as improvement in water filtration and pressure compensating emitters kisekka et al 2017 the interest in mdi was revived and furthermore bolstered by the need for more efficient irrigation technologies to better adapt to water scarcity and increase water conservation the objective of this study was to evaluate maize production under mdi as compared to lepa and lesa two common irrigation application devices used by farmers in the ogallala area of kansas this is an effort to benchmark modern mdi against other well known and widely used irrigation technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 field description a two year field experiment on biophysical properties of maize impacted by different irrigation technologies mdi lepa and lesa was conducted at the kansas state university s southwest research and extension center near garden city kansas 32 024 lat 100 826 long 885 m above sea level the experimental field was in ulysses silt loam soil stone et al 2011 and under four span center pivot with variable rate irrigation vri capability the center pivot had the following specifications span one 41 6 m spans two and three 41 2 m span four 41 1 m and 5 5 m overhang fig 1 the experiment was set up on the eastern half of the center pivot as a 3 4 split plot randomized complete block design with two factors irrigation capacity and irrigation application device and three replications fig 1 span 1 was maintained as a system failsafe and kept operational for each irrigation event but was not considered for data collection therefore there were 12 treatments in each block with a total of 36 treatments for the whole experiment a treatment was made up of an irrigation device and an irrigation capacity each span was divided into four equal parts that accommodated two mdis with dripper flow rates of 3 8 l h and 7 6 l h hereafter mdi1 and mdi2 respectively as shown in fig 2 lepa bubbler and lesa spray nozzle the applied three irrigation capacities were 6 2 3 1 and 1 6 mm d that

from deeper depths similar depletion pattern was apparent for 2017 with the higher water content in the soil profile than in 2016 3 3 grain yield seed weight above ground biomass and lai the differences in grain yields for 2016 and 2017 shown in fig 7 for four irrigation application devices mdi1 mdi2 lepa lesa were not significant p 0 085 this finding is similar to observations reported by kisekka et al 2017 and o shaughnessy and colaizzi 2017 who found no differences in grain yield between mdi and lesa however significant differences were found between the three irrigation capacities p 0 0001 table 5 shows the mean weights of the 500 seed count for each treatment although no significant differences p 0 2134 in the weights of seeds were found between the irrigation application devices the differences between the three irrigation capacities were found significant p 0 0148 the interaction effects between application device and irrigation capacity did not have a significant effect on seed weight p 0 5073 as anticipated grain yield for all devices generally decreased when irrigation capacity decreased 6 2 and 1 6 mm d irrigation capacities caused the highest and lowest grain yields respectively the interaction effects between irrigation application devices and irrigation capacity were not significant p 0 228 which implies a general impact of irrigation capacity on grain yield regardless of the type of application device used based on five years 2005 09 of data by klocke et al 2011 the yields of maize grown in western kansas and irrigated at 100 50 and 25 capacities were 12 000 9000 and 6000 kg ha respectively these values represent yield differences of 25 and 50 in yield between the full half and quarter irrigations klocke et al 2007 also reported maize yields of 12 000 and 11 000 kg ha for 100 and 50 irrigation for west central nebraska region indicating a marginal difference in yields between full and half irrigation in this study the difference in mean grain yield between 6 2 mm d and 3 1 and 1 6 mm d irrigation capacities were small at 5 4 and 11 4 respectively though irrigation capacity is known to be a significant determinant of grain yield the slight differences observed between three irrigation capacities can be attributed to the effect of above normal growing season rainfall at critical growth stages which reduced the impact of water stress in under irrigated areas monthly increases in biomass yield plotted alongside in season irrigation events for different treatments are shown in fig 8 similar to grain yield there was no significant difference in monthly biomass yields between irrigation application devices for all months table 6 except for the first month there was significant difference in biomass yield between the 6 2 3 1 1 6 mm d irrigation capacities the interaction effects between irrigation application devices and irrigation capacity were found not significant table 6 biomass yields in 2016 were generally lower than those in 2017 confirming the results of other studies on yearly maize biomass variation benjamin et al 2015 djaman et al 2013 ning et al 2012 statistical analyses of monthly lai for 2016 and 2017 shown in fig 9 were conducted separately because the monthly readings for either year were not taken on or close to the same dates tables 7 and 8 show the least square means of lai for 2016 and 2017 the results for 2016 show that there were generally no significant differences in lai between both the application devices as well as irrigation capacities in contrast in 2017 while no significant differences in lai were found between application devices there were differences between irrigation capacities lai for month one was not significantly different between either application devices or irrigation capacities the interactive effects between the application devices and the irrigation capacities were also not significantly different the absence of significant differences found for plant growth parameters grain yield biomass yield and lai between mdi lepa and lesa indicates that all devices delivered similar amounts of water to the crops according to yin and mcclure 2013 biomass growth can be a good indicator of the health of a maize crop from early to mid stages of its growth since other crop management factors nutrients weed pests control were the same for all irrigation treatments the lack of significant difference in biomass yields between mdi lesa and lepa indicates that all devices applied the same amount of water to the maize a strong relationship exists between crop yields and et saseendran et al 2014 and reported for maize in several studies Ã§akir 2004 and djaman et al 2013 this study postulated that mdi would apply water more efficiently in comparison with lepa and lesa however the results did not indicate any significant yield advantage of mdi over both lepa and lesa kisekka et al 2017 reported that soil evaporation under mdi was lower than that under lesa by 35 indicating that mdi did apply water more efficiently and it was consistent with dripping irrigation in general the reason why greater differences in the measured biophysical benefits were absent in this study can be attributed to the effect of rainfall received over 2016 and 2017 seasons 3 4 water use efficiency water use efficiency for 2016 and 2017 seasons under mdi lepa and lesa with 6 2 3 1 and 1 6 mm d irrigation capacities is shown in fig 10 there were no significant differences in water use efficiency between the application devices p 0 2352 however the differences between irrigation capacities were found significant p 0 050 the interaction effects were not significant with p 0 7469 these observations were consistent with similar statistical analyses for grain yield the analysis of seasonal et for the two cropping seasons showed that there was no significant difference in et between mdi lepa and lesa with p 0 2352 for 2016 and p 0 6805 for 2017 while significant differences were found between the 6 2 3 1 1 6 mm d irrigation capacities with p 0 0014 and p 0 0001 for 2016 and 2017 respectively any differences in the biophysical properties in this study were expected to have resulted from the differences in et which in turn arose from the differences in soil water storage the fact that no differences in et were found between the irrigation application devices is thus consistent with the absence of significant differences between measured biophysical properties under different devices 3 5 other study observations wheel track rutting is a common problem in center pivot irrigation systems fitted with lesa lepa and mesa nozzles this is because such nozzles tend to spread water over wide areas on the soil surface including wheel paths and have high application rates during the study frequent visual inspection for wheel track rutting showed that the depths of wheel ruts in areas under mdi were much less than those in locations under lesa and lepa this reduced wheel track rutting highlights another advantage of mdi though fertigation was not done in the study it is important to note that mdi would also make the process relatively easier to implement because it is designed to apply water directly to the soil surface which prevents foliage burn 4 conclusions the results of this study showed that no significant differences were detected in grain yield above ground biomass water use efficiency and lai between mdi and lepa and lesa similar conclusions were made by kisekka et al 2017 and o shaughnessy and colaizzi 2017 the study also showed that there were no major differences in soil water transitions during the season from these facts we concluded that mdi did not perform better or worse than either lepa or lesa however since the main advantage of mdi was to reduce water losses as compared to sprinkler type devices like lesa and lepa it was anticipated to observe benefits of mdi by measuring of biophysical properties and soil water content above normal rainfall received during each of the two studied growing seasons highly likely led to relatively uniform soil moisture distribution throughout the fields and any marginal increases in soil water content due to mdi efficiency were negated and resulting in statistically insignificant measurements of the changes in biophysical properties considering that varying rainfall during two seasons did affect the results of this study and altered the anticipated conclusions it is recommended additional research to compare mdi to lepa and or lesa be continued under the following two conditions 1 mdi applying lesser water than lepa and lesa during each irrigation event and 2 mdi evaluated against lepa and lesa during years with very little rainfall evaluating mdi under conditions in which it applies less water in comparison to lepa and lesa is based on the idea that since mdi minimizes water loss biophysical measurements of crops under mdi applying fraction of water under lepa and lesa will still be comparable this way of evaluating mdi against lepa and lesa will isolate any effects of rainfall it could also help better understand the rainfall thresholds for which mdi makes a difference in comparison to other technologies acknowledgements this research was supported by grants and

11302,this study presents an interval based fuzzy chance constrained irrigation water allocation ifciwa model with double sided fuzziness for supporting irrigation water management it is derived from incorporating double sided chance constrained programming dfccp into an interval parameter programming ipp framework the model integrates interval linear crop water production functions into its general framework for irrigation water allocation moreover it can deal with uncertainties presented as discrete intervals and fuzziness it can also allow violation of system constraints with double sided fuzziness where each confidence level consists of two reliability scenarios i e minimum and maximum reliability scenarios to demonstrate its applicability the model is then applied to a case study in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin northwest china therefore optimal solutions have been generated for irrigation water allocation under uncertainty the results indicate that planning under a lower confidence level and a minimum reliability scenario can provide maximized system benefits system benefits under the high water level are 2 659 7 913 109 yuan when Î± 0 2 650 7 822 109 yuan when Î± 0 5 and 2 642 7 734 109 yuan when Î± 1 0 under the minimum reliability scenario furthermore the results can support in depth analysis of interrelationships among system benefits confidence levels reliability levels and risk levels these results can effectively provide decision support for managers identifying desired irrigation water allocation plans in study area keywords irrigation water management interval crop water production function fuzzy chance constrained programming decision making 1 introduction nowadays there is a growing awareness of the necessity to effectively alleviate the contradiction between the increasing demands for agricultural production and the shortages of agricultural water supply from a global perspective which has a profound effect on arid areas already dominated by irrigated agriculture elliott et al 2014 kang et al 2017 in fact irrigation water consumption accounts for nearly 90 of the total water availability in arid areas of northwestern china li et al 2016a moreover unscientific and unreasonable irrigation water management can also directly cause environmental and ecological degradations and natural resources shortages problems therefore it is indeed necessary to improve irrigation water management and optimize irrigation water allocation which will ensure the sustainable development of agricultural production lu et al 2016 optimizing irrigation water allocation in the technical sense implies how much water should be allocated to different subareas under certain goals zeng et al 2010 therefore various mathematical methods have been developed for irrigation planning and management to identify optimal solutions singh and panda 2012 including traditional methods including linear programming bartolini et al 2007 nonlinear programming cai et al 2001 dynamic programming shang and mao 2006 and artificial intelligence search methods like genetic algorithms arabi et al 2006 safavi and esmikhani 2013 and simulated annealing brown et al 2010 pÃ©rez sÃ¡nchez et al 2018 these techniques have made significant contributions to the development of irrigation water management however the above methods may have limitations in response to uncertainties e g stochastic fuzzy and interval variables parameters existing in irrigation water management problems practically an irrigation system typically covers a multitude of aspects associated with resources capacity economic development and environmental impact xu and qin 2010 leading to uncertain factors such as water availability irrigation water demand market price and crop yields such inherent uncertainties may cause intensified difficulties in the decision making of practical applications therefore a series of inexact mathematical programming methods including interval mathematical programming imp stochastic mathematical programming smp and fuzzy mathematical programming fmp have been developed for generating effective decision solutions under uncertainty generally smp can provide more explicit decision solutions while it may be impeded by its rigorous data requirements complicated probability analysis and time consuming computational burden xu and qin 2010 tan et al 2011 conversely imp based on interval analysis using interval parameters or variables is more convenient for dealing with uncertain information with known ranges but unknown distributions more practically as a basic tool for irrigation planning and management crop water production functions cwpfs can be empirically obtained by the fitting results based on field experimental data these data including actual evapotranspiration et and crop yields are easily influenced by the measurement methods observation error and calculation methods leading to imprecise and uncertain specifications of cwpfs therefore interval cwpfs can be considered as a better choice to quantitatively describe the relationship between et and crop yield in practical problems tong and guo 2013 li et al 2016b accordingly imp is capable of handling such a problem of integration interval cwpfs and other interval information into its optimization framework for example li et al 2016b developed an interval linear fractional irrigation water allocation model by integrating interval cwpfs into the model s framework however it does not allow violation of system constraints and may be infeasible when the right hand side coefficients of constraints are highly uncertain huang et al 1992 furthermore some parameters are subject to human judgments and the linguistic terms of approximately equal and approximately satisfactory are more acceptable in decision making zeng et al 2010 it is desired that optimization methods be developed to further address above mentioned problems therefore fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp as an improved fmp method can be introduced to effectively tackle fuzzy uncertainties and violation of system constraints the fuzzy constraints can be transformed into deterministic ones at predetermined confidence levels which has a lower computational burden and provides more flexible solutions there are two types of fccp model from the literature review including chance constrained programming with fuzzy parameters liu and iwamura 1998 and chance constrained programming with dfp distribution with fuzzy probability parameters iskander 2005 guo and huang 2009 guo et al 2014 for example guo and huang 2009 developed a two stage fuzzy chance constrained programming approach for water resources management under dual uncertainties and applied it to a hypothetical case zhang and guo 2018 developed a fuzzy linear fractional programming model with double sided fuzziness for irrigation water management although the fccp model with dfp parameters can reflect the dual uncertainty feature i e probabilistic and possibilistic information it is difficult to acquire the dual uncertain information and further popularize the model in practical application moreover it can only address the fuzzy uncertainties in the right hand side constraints while those in the left hand side constraints are presented as interval numbers this will lead to the potential to miss some valuable uncertain information in practice fuzzy uncertainties may exist in both sides of constraints of the model thus double sided fccp dfccp is introduced to address the above complexities additionally few studies of the dfccp model for irrigation water management have been conducted therefore this study aims at integrating the advantages of the above outlined methods an interval based fuzzy chance constrained irrigation water allocation ifciwa model with double sided fuzziness is developed for supporting irrigation water management it is derived from incorporating double sided chance constrained programming dfccp into an interval parameter programming ipp framework moreover it integrates the interval cwpfs into its optimization framework the objective of the developed model is to optimize irrigation water allocation to different crops in different subareas achieving maximum system benefits it is able to handle uncertainties that are presented as intervals and fuzzy sets arising from the subjective and objective variability of the irrigation systems to demonstrate its applicability it will be applied to a case study in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin in northwest china to optimize irrigation water allocation under uncertainty thus more flexible and tractable solutions can be generated under different scenarios these optimal solutions can provide decision support for managers to make final decisions for irrigation water allocation fig 1 graphically illustrates the framework of the study 2 methodology in this section three aspects of methodology including interval linear crop water production functions interval based fuzzy chance constrained irrigation water allocation ifciwa model with double sided fuzziness and the corresponding solution method will be presented therefore the further details can be outlined as follows 2 1 interval linear crop water production functions ilcwpfs in this study the linear cwpfs i e y a e t b where y is the harvested crop yield kg ha e t is the actual evapotranspiration m3 ha and a b are empirical coefficients mathematically determined by fitting the field experimental data are chosen to quantitatively express the relationship between crop yield and et li et al 2016b due to the actual conditions the collected field experimental data is easily influenced by measurement methods and observation errors causing uncertainties in determining cwpfs using deterministic cwpfs may thereby have difficulties in dealing with these uncertainties thus interval linear crop water production functions ilcwpfs are introduced to better reflect the above concerns then an interval regression method is used to calculate ilcwpfs for different crops tanaka and lee 1998 tong and guo 2013 it can be written as follows 1a y x a 0 a 1 x 1 a n x n a x where x 1 x 1 x n t is a real input vector a a 0 a 1 a n is an interval coefficient vector and y x is the corresponding interval output an interval coefficient a i is denoted as a i a i c i where a i is a center value and c i is a radius value now an interval regression analysis method based on quadratic programming is adopted because it provides more diverse spread coefficients than linear programming it also considers the central tendency of least squares and possibilistic characteristics of fuzzy regression the objective of the interval regression based on quadratic programming is to minimize the sum of j 1 p y j a t x j 2 and j 1 p c t x j x j t c by giving different weights to obtain expected interval coefficients a i a i c i i 1 n therefore it is presented as follows 1b min j k 1 j 1 p y j a t x j 2 k 2 j 1 p c t x j x j t c where the output y j should be included in the output y x j indicating that these outputs should be satisfied y i y x i j 1 2 p thus the objective function eq 1b should be subjected to the following constraints 1c a t x j c t x j y j j 1 p 1d a t x j c t x j y j j 1 p 1e c i 0 i 1 n where x j 1 x j 1 x j n t a a 0 a n t c c 0 c n t k 1 and k 2 are the given weight coefficients the larger values of k 1 k 2 the more central tendency will appear meaning that the interval regression results approximately tend to be the results obtained from the least squares regression method the regression results may be different with the ratio of k 1 and k 2 changes therefore the corresponding results of ilcwpfs can be obtained which are the basis of the following optimization irrigation water allocation model 2 2 interval based fuzzy chance constrained irrigation water allocation ifciwa model with double sided fuzziness to address interval parameters variables and ilcwpfs in irrigation water management problems interval parameter programming ipp can be used to solve such a problem moreover when the parameters of both left hand and right hand sides in the constraints are fuzzy sets that can be expressed as possibility distributions and the violation of system constraints exists in the optimization model the double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming dfccp method can be adopted fiedler et al 2006 therefore an interval based fuzzy chance constrained irrigation water allocation ifciwa model with double sided fuzziness is formulated to allocate irrigation water to different crops and subareas the system objective is then presented as follows 2a max f i 1 3 j 1 3 n b i j c p i j a i j a j s w i j g w i j p e i b j i 1 3 j 1 3 a i j c s i s w i j Î· s c g i g w i j Î· g where f is system objective that is to maximize system benefits from the agricultural production 109 yuan f is an interval variable and the and represent the upper and lower bounds of an interval parameter or variable i is subarea i 1 2 3 j is type of crop j 1 2 3 n b i j is the price of crop j in subarea i yuan kg c p i j is the cost of crop production for crop j in subarea i including all the costs such as seed fertilizer pesticides machinery harvesting and other costs yuan kg a i j is the irrigated area of crop j in subarea i ha a j and b j are the empirical coefficients of the ilcwpfs for crop j s w i j and g w i j are the decision variables denoting the amount of irrigated surface water and groundwater for crop j in subarea i m3 ha p e i is the effective precipitation of subarea i m3 ha c s i j and c g i j are the cost of surface water and groundwater use in subarea i yuan m3 Î· s and Î· g are the comprehensive irrigation water use coefficients of surface water and groundwater the system objective i e eq 2a is subjected to the following system constraints 1 surface water availability constraint 2b p o s Î» s q s i 1 3 j 1 3 1 Î» s a i j s w i j q s Î· s Î² s Î± 2 groundwater availability constraint 2c p o s Î» g q g i 1 3 j 1 3 1 Î» g a i j g w i j q g Î· g Î² g Î± where constraints 2b and 2c are the water availability constraints Î» s and Î» g are the rates of surface water and groundwater loss during water conveyance that are presented as fuzzy sets q s and q g are the surface water and groundwater availabilities which are also expressed as fuzzy sets 106 m3 Î² s and Î² g are the proportion of surface water and groundwater used for agricultural irrigation in this study Î² s 0 9 and Î² g 0 9 in the above constraints li et al 2016a Î± denotes Î± cut confidence level and it describes the fuzzy degree of membership level 3 fairness constraint 2d i 1 i i 2 i s w i 1 j g w i 1 j p e i 1 j s w i 2 j g w i 2 j p e i 2 j 2 n i 1 i s w i j g w i j p e i j g 0 j a n d i 1 i 2 i where i 1 and i 2 are the two subareas of the three subareas independently n the number of total subareas g 0 is the gini coefficient which is generally used to measure economic inequality this constraint can be interpreted as the ratio between the sum of water shortages of each two subareas and total water demands is not greater than an acceptable gap understandably for some subareas with higher water use efficiency and net benefit will be allocated more water this may not be fair to farmers with lower water use efficiency therefore to achieve a balance to some degree the fairness constraint is considered by introducing the gini coefficient yang et al 2015 theoretically it ranges from 0 to 1 and higher value represents more unequal distribution less than 0 2 denotes the absolute average 0 2 0 3 denotes relatively average 0 3 0 4 denotes relatively reasonable 0 4 0 5 represents relatively bigger gap and more than 0 5 can be regarded as disparity sun 2013 absolute average indicates that each farmer is distributed exactly the same amount of money relatively average indicates that each farmer is distributed almost the same amount of money and a relatively reasonable refers to the existence of an acceptable gap a value of g 0 0 4 was selected for fairness constraints because the international warning level is 0 4 zhang and xu 2011 4 irrigation water demand constraints 2e e t min i j s w i j g w i j p e i j e t max i j i j e t min i j and e t max i j are the minimum and maximum irrigation water requirements of crop j in subarea i m3 ha 5 nonnegative constraints 2f s w i j 0 g w i j 0 i j s w i j and g w i j are the decision variables which should be positive 2 3 solution method to solve the ifciwa model it should be transformed into deterministic submodels therefore the solution method consists of two parts i e solution methods of ipp and dfccp respectively first it should be transformed into the upper and the lower bounds submodels based on the interactive algorithms method proposed by huang et al 1992 because the objective function is maximum system benefits the submodel corresponding to f i e upper bound submodel should be first formulated and solved subsequently the submodel corresponding to f i e lower bound submodel is formulated and solved based on the solutions of the upper bound submodel second for the upper or lower submodels according to fiedler et al 2006 the violation of constraints with double sided fuzziness in the submodel at each confidence level consists of two reliability scenarios i e the minimum reliability and maximum reliability they are defined as follows 3a p o s r i j v max i j inf max 1 Î¼ r i j x i j 1 Î¼ v i j y i j x i j y i j â x i j y i j Î± r i j r 1 Î± v i j l 1 Î± 3b p o s r i j v min i j sup min Î¼ r i j x i j Î¼ v i j y i j x i j y i j â x i j y i j Î± r i j l Î± v i j r Î± where r i j v max i j denotes that the equations r i j v i j are satisfied at the maximum reliability while r i j v min i j denotes that the equations r i j v i j are satisfied at the minimum reliability Î¼ r i j x i j and Î¼ v i j y i j are the fuzzy membership functions of the variables x i j and y i j r i j l Î± is defined as the minimum values of all possible values at Î± cut level that is r i j l Î± inf r r Î¼ 1 Î± likewise v i j r Î± is defined as maximum values of all possible values at Î± cut level that is v i j r Î± sup v v Î¼ 1 Î± Î¼ 1 is the inverse function of Î¼ according to eqs 3a and 3b upper and lower bounds submodels at each confidence level can be transformed into two crisp equivalents accordingly by giving different confidence levels the final solutions of each deterministic submodel can be generated the detailed procedure of the solution method is summarized as follows step 1 acquire the parameters of model required in terms of interval boundaries and fuzzy sets fuzzy membership function under different water levels step 2 formulate the ifciwa model step 3 reformulate the developed model into two submodels through the interactive algorithms method based on the solution method of the ipp the upper bound of submodel f is first solved step 4 transform the submodel corresponding to f into two crisp equivalents i e the minimum and the maximum reliability scenarios based on the solution method of dfccp step 5 give different confidence levels optimal solutions corresponding to f can be completely obtained step 6 solve the other submodel by following steps 4 and 5 and optimal solutions corresponding to f can be completely obtained step 7 combine solutions from steps 5 and 6 and the final solutions of f o p t f o p t f o p t s w i j o p t s w i j o p t s w i j o p t and g w i j o p t g w i j o p t g w i j o p t can be generated under different confidence levels and water levels 3 case study 3 1 study area the heihe river basin is the second largest arid inland in northwest china it is located in the middle of the hexi corridor lying between latitudes 38 and 42 n and longitudes 98 and 101 30 e it has three parts i e upstream midstream and downstream areas the midstream area was selected as the study area see fig 2 mainly including three administrative regions i e ganzhou district gz linze county lz and gaotai county gt the annual average temperature is about 7 6 c and annual average precipitation is 195 mm 90 of all precipitation occurs from march to september and annual average potential evapotranspiration is 1710 mm main crops such as spring wheat maize and economic crops are planted and cultivated economic crops includes cotton fruits and vegetables that can bring higher economic benefits than grain crops the growing period of these crops in the study area ranges from march to october moreover agricultural water consumption in the midstream area utilizes approximately 90 of total water consumptions li et al 2016a crops are mainly irrigated by surface water through densely distributed canal networks and traditional irrigation methods such as flood and furrow methods are generally adopted by farmers groundwater will be extracted to compensate for the deficiency of surface water because of its seasonal variations jiang et al 2016 although nearly all the main canals have been lined a portion of irrigation water is still lost during water conveyance due to multiple levels of the canal system therefore the comprehensive irrigation water use coefficients of surface water and groundwater are 0 52 and 0 60 according to statistical data of zhangye city from 2002 to 2015 how to reasonably manage irrigation water and effectively optimize the limited irrigation water allocation is a critical issue for the sustainable development of agriculture moreover various uncertain factors exist in agricultural systems such as water availability irrigation water demands and market conditions these uncertainties may inevitably influence irrigation water management problems therefore inexact optimization models are desirable to support irrigation water management under uncertainty 3 2 data collection and processing to solve the ifciwa model input parameters are required basically information regarding crop data environmental capabilities and hydrological conditions is collected and calculated each detailed component can be explained as follows 3 2 1 interval linear crop water production functions table 1 presents the ilcwpfs for each study crop spring wheat maize and economic crops were chosen as study crops based on the section 2 1 an interval regression method was adopted to obtain the desired ilcwpfs for different crops the field experimental data originated from li 2005 and the regression results refer to li 2017 to make the regression results tend towards the central tendency the ratio of k 1 1 and k 2 0 0001 was used to determine the specifications of ilcwpfs however for spring wheat the ratio of k 1 0 0001 and k 2 1 was used to minimize the sum of squared spreads because the constant term coefficients of regression result at the ratio of k 1 1 and k 2 0 0001 are deterministic li et al 2016b additionally it is assumed that the ilcwpfs are the same in different subareas attributed to their similar soil physical properties soil types crops hydrological and meteorological conditions 3 2 2 water availability table 2 presents surface water and groundwater availabilities both surface water and groundwater availabilities are presented as symmetric triangular fuzzy numbers under three water levels thereby requiring its middle upper and lower values see fig 3 for surface water availability water supply for the midstream area is directly delivered from the main stream of the heihe river thus the category of three inflow levels is based on the frequency analysis method li et al 2016a that is low level p 75 medium level 25 p 75 and high level p 25 the estimation of the range of availability under each inflow level is based on t distribution method due to its unknown standard deviation of the sample the 95 confidence level was chosen to obtain confidence intervals therefore a triangular fuzzy number with the lower middle and upper values can be obtained under each water level groundwater availability can be obtained from historical records of groundwater use it is also presented as a symmetric triangular fuzzy number with the division of three water levels accordingly the middle and lower values are estimated from the mean and the minimum values of the statistical data from 2002 to 2015 moreover the effective precipitation under three water levels see table 3 was obtained from the observation data of meteorological stations in typical hydrological years 3 2 3 crop irrigation water demand tables 3 and 4 present the irrigation water demands and k c values of the crops crop irrigation water demand is obtained e t c k c e t 0 where e t c is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm day k c is the crop coefficient and e t 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day daily reference evapotranspiration is calculated based on the fao 56 penman monteith method where the basic meteorological data from zhangye no 52562 linze no 52557 and gaotai no 52546 meteorological stations located in midstream area during 1967 2009 yin et al 2012 thus total crop irrigation water demand for the whole growth stage can be obtained by the sum of daily values of each growth stage in typical hydrological years 3 2 4 other related parameters table 5 presents other related parameters associated with the ifciwa model crop planting area crop price and water use cost are obtained from statistical data local government reports and websites especially the rate of water loss during water conveyance is considered as a symmetric triangular fuzzy number in the left hand side constraints the rates of water loss during surface water and groundwater conveyance are 0 20 0 25 0 30 and 0 10 0 15 0 20 respectively 4 results analysis and discussion to examine the effects of Î± cut confidence levels and water levels eleven confidence levels i e Î± 0 0 1 1 0 and three water levels i e high medium and low levels were applied to the ifciwa model each confidence level can be separated into two reliability scenarios i e minimum and maximum reliability scenarios while each scenario can further be transformed into upper and lower bounds of submodels therefore there are a total of 132 submodels that need to be solved and then 66 sets of optimal interval solutions can be generated for supporting irrigation water management as the ifciwa model combines the dfccp method into the ipp optimization framework it thus potentially possesses the advantages of the two methods because the dfccp method addresses violation of system constraints with double sided fuzziness and thus generates the corresponding solutions at different confidence levels choosing the proper confidence level becomes more important for decision making theoretically a confidence level means the corresponding satisfaction degree of fuzzy uncertainty which can basically reflect managers subjective attitudes and directly affect the results moreover the obtained results contain a combination of deterministic and interval information which can reflect different forms of uncertainties and characteristics of model more details about results analysis and discussion are provided in the following three sections 4 1 optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation table 6 presents optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation at different confidence levels and low water level with the confidence level ranging from 0 to 1 0 at intervals of 0 1 the results of lz and gt remain unchanged which is seemingly insensitive to the variation of confidence levels this can be caused by the crop planting area of the lz and gt being less than gz so that the confidence level has an insignificant influence on their optimal solutions besides in the lz and gt the results show that crops are totally irrigated by surface water without using groundwater indicating groundwater will be protected for ensuring local groundwater table and ecological security for example the allocated irrigation surface water is 1907 1 m3 ha for spring wheat 2022 4 m3 ha for maize and 4030 9 5453 6 m3 ha for economic crops in lz under the minimum reliability scenario and the results obtained are the same as the above mentioned under the maximum reliability scenario meanwhile optimal solutions of irrigation surface water allocation are 2193 3 m3 ha for spring wheat 4707 7 6369 9 m3 ha for maize and 4425 4 5987 4 m3 ha for economic crops in gt under minimum and maximum reliability scenarios obviously the fuzzy parameters of both water availability and the rate of water loss during water conveyance have no effect on the system variations in lz and gt subareas however the results from the model developed in gz indicate that confidence levels have slight influences on the output results for example when confidence level is increased from 0 to 1 0 under the minimum reliability scenario the allocated surface water for spring wheat will be slightly decreased from 691 1 m3 ha to 672 0 m3 ha while the allocated groundwater will be gradually increased from 833 0 m3 ha to 852 0 m3 ha moreover for the maize the obtained results have the same falling trends of both the allocated surface water and groundwater furthermore the solutions of surface water for economic crops are decreased from 1200 8 m3 ha to 893 8 m3 ha but the solutions of groundwater present an opposite trend i e from 2272 6 3498 5 m3 ha to 2579 6 3805 5 m3 ha the results indicate that different confidence levels are associated with different optimal solutions which can help managers distinguish desired solutions based on their subjective preferences and choices in fact the interaction between decision variables can reflect the uncertainty and complexity of agricultural systems therefore it is important for managers to figure out the uncertainties and interactions of variables and make a final decision by contrast the results under the maximum reliability scenario show similar changing trend as the confidence level increases in other words the distinctive difference between minimum and maximum reliability scenarios is merely the amount of allocated irrigation surface water and groundwater the reason is that based on the dfccp algorithm the surface water and groundwater availabilities under the maximum reliability scenario are less than the minimum reliability scenario therefore planning under the minimum reliability scenario of the system objective leads to higher system benefits due to the increased water availabilities which represents the optimistic attitudes of managers although they will face higher system failure risk levels however planning under the maximum reliability scenario is related to lower water availabilities and lower system benefits which can provide more reliable results because of conservative attitudes to investigate the effects of different water levels on the variation of results table 7 presents optimal solutions of surface water and groundwater allocation under three water levels and Î± 0 5 the differences among three water levels are their water availabilities irrigation water demands and effective precipitation among them the total water availabilities under the high water level are greater than medium and low water levels at the same confidence level moreover under a higher water level surface water availabilities will increase but groundwater availabilities will decrease therefore when the system objective is to maximize system benefits more surface water will be allocated to different crops and subareas under the higher water level e g high level medium level low level while the allocated groundwater presents an opposite trend it can be explained in that water surface water cost is less than groundwater cost i e c s i c g i thus surface water should be allocated first to satisfy irrigation water demand this promising phenomenon shows that less groundwater will be extracted for agricultural irrigation to alleviate the dropping groundwater table due to previous over exploitation of groundwater furthermore the total amount of allocated surface water and groundwater for three crops in gz under the minimum reliability scenario are not less than that under the maximum reliability scenario taking medium water level as an example the total amount of allocated irrigation is 1591 4 1591 4 m3 ha for spring wheat 4068 2 4070 1 3423 5 m3 ha for maize and 3601 0 4872 0 3601 0 4872 0 m3 ha for economic crops under the minimum maximum reliability scenarios from the perspective of the dfccp algorithm rule the fuzzy chance constraints in the model can be transformed into two crisp equivalents under minimum and maximum reliabilities therefore the above results can provide more choices for managers based on their preferences and help them analyze tradeoffs between system variations and reliability levels 4 2 system economic benefits figs 4 a b 5 a b and 6 a b compare system economic benefits resulting from the ifciwa model at varying confidence levels under the high medium and low water levels respectively as shown in fig 4a system benefits under the high water level are 2 659 7 913 109 yuan when Î± 0 2 650 7 822 109 yuan when Î± 0 5 and 2 642 7 734 109 yuan when Î± 1 0 under the minimum reliability scenario the results show that a higher confidence level will bring lower system benefits and higher reliability level generally an increased confidence level means much higher satisfaction degree level of constraints thereby causing a lower possibility that the constraints can be violated this theoretically leads to an increased strictness for the system constraints and finally results in a narrow decision space e g decreased water availability and increased rate of water loss therefore the confidence level is related to a manager s risk preferences and thus an acceptable and proper risk is critical to generate optimal solutions for decision making according to fiedler et al 2006 each confidence level consists of two reliability scenarios namely the confidence level under minimum and maximum reliabilities similarly from fig 4b system benefits under the maximum reliability scenario can also be seen for example system benefits are 2 642 7 734 109 yuan when Î± 0 2 618 7 650 109 yuan when Î± 0 5 and 2 560 7 568 109 yuan when Î± 1 0 obviously the latter leads to slightly lower system benefits than the former under a series of confidence levels such a difference can be explained by the reason that the former represents an optimistic strategy for decision making but the latter are associated with higher system reliability levels due to pessimistic preferences understandably as shown in fig 4a b planning under a lower confidence level and a minimum reliability scenario can lead to maximize system benefits conversely planning under a higher confidence level and maximum reliability scenario will bring minimized system benefits therefore the above results can support in depth analysis of the interrelationships among system benefits confidence levels reliability levels and risk levels in terms of three water levels the results from figs 4a b to 6a b indicate that system benefits under the high water level are greater than medium and low water levels for example under the minimum reliability scenario when confidence level is increased system benefits resulting from the high medium and low water levels are 2 659 7 913 109 yuan 2 505 7 463 109 yuan and 2 277 6 963 109 yuan Î± 0 2 650 7 822 109 yuan 2 501 7 408 109 yuan and 2 219 6 883 109 yuan Î± 0 5 2 642 7 734 109 yuan 2 463 7 355 109 yuan and 2 164 6 806 109 yuan Î± 1 0 respectively the results also show a tradeoff between system benefits and water levels therefore under advantageous system conditions with higher total water availabilities system benefits may be higher however under demanding conditions due to less total water availability system benefits may be decreased 4 3 discussion because of the uncertainties in agricultural irrigation systems decision variables in the form of intervals are more reasonable because they provide more decision making options to managers moreover Î± cut confidence level is also introduced to quantitatively describe some parameters that are expressed as fuzzy numbers and violation of fuzzy constraints due to their own fuzzy attributes therefore managers can base decisions on these constraints to ultimately generate different types of results by selecting or adjusting within the range of feasible solutions these decision making processes require that managers in combination with their understanding of socio economic and environmental conditions in the study area and the preferences of systemic risk levels and returns should obtain the final plans without accounting for the uncertainties in the system the ifciwa model can be rewritten into a deterministic linear programming model that is taking mean values of interval parameters and middle values of fuzzy parameters as inputs of the ifciwa model then solutions can be obtained by adopting and solving this model see table 8 it can be seen that the results are not as flexible as the results obtained by the ifciwa model because the deterministic model can only provide a set of solutions for managers for example under medium water level only one solution can be generated for irrigation water allocation to each crop in each subarea moreover system benefits obtained under medium water level is 4 753 109 yuan which is a deterministic value between the fluctuant values of 2 392 109 yuan lowest value and 7 463 109 yuan highest value see fig 5a b however the developed model enables to provide more results e g 44 sets of solutions under a certain water level based on the system variations and managers preferences and attitudes this undoubtedly provides managers with more information when deciding on irrigation water management for example planning under a lower confidence level and minimum reliability scenario will achieve higher system benefits but at the same time bear a higher risk level in contrast lower system benefits will be obtained under a decreased system failure risk level in summary the developed model is superior to a deterministic model in its broader applicability it can also be used to better handle tradeoffs among the economy the environment and system reliability and to further provide more flexible and effective solutions for irrigation water allocation 5 conclusions in this study an interval based fuzzy chance constrained irrigation water allocation ifciwa model with double sided fuzziness was developed for irrigation water management this model incorporates interval parameter programming ipp and double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming dfccp into an irrigation water management framework interval linear crop water production functions ilcwpfs are introduced as the basis of irrigation planning which can be obtained by the interval regression method therefore the model can address interval and fuzzy uncertainties it allows violation of double sided constraints at predetermined confidence levels and enables transformation of fuzzy chance constraints into two crisp equivalents under minimum and maximum reliability scenarios respectively a case study of irrigation water management was provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model more flexible and effective solutions can be generated at each confidence level and water level for supporting irrigation water allocation these results are useful for identifying desired solutions with maximized system benefits moreover the solutions obtained can support in depth analysis of interrelationships among system benefits confidence levels reliability levels and risk levels this study developed an irrigation water allocation model associated with interval and fuzzy inputs as well as ilcwpfs the flexible and feasible solutions suggest that it is also applicable to other resource management and environmental problems such as water quality management air quality management and energy system management for potential improvements techniques of quadratic crop water production functions nonlinear programming and stochastic

11302,this study presents an interval based fuzzy chance constrained irrigation water allocation ifciwa model with double sided fuzziness for supporting irrigation water management it is derived from incorporating double sided chance constrained programming dfccp into an interval parameter programming ipp framework the model integrates interval linear crop water production functions into its general framework for irrigation water allocation moreover it can deal with uncertainties presented as discrete intervals and fuzziness it can also allow violation of system constraints with double sided fuzziness where each confidence level consists of two reliability scenarios i e minimum and maximum reliability scenarios to demonstrate its applicability the model is then applied to a case study in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin northwest china therefore optimal solutions have been generated for irrigation water allocation under uncertainty the results indicate that planning under a lower confidence level and a minimum reliability scenario can provide maximized system benefits system benefits under the high water level are 2 659 7 913 109 yuan when Î± 0 2 650 7 822 109 yuan when Î± 0 5 and 2 642 7 734 109 yuan when Î± 1 0 under the minimum reliability scenario furthermore the results can support in depth analysis of interrelationships among system benefits confidence levels reliability levels and risk levels these results can effectively provide decision support for managers identifying desired irrigation water allocation plans in study area keywords irrigation water management interval crop water production function fuzzy chance constrained programming decision making 1 introduction nowadays there is a growing awareness of the necessity to effectively alleviate the contradiction between the increasing demands for agricultural production and the shortages of agricultural water supply from a global perspective which has a profound effect on arid areas already dominated by irrigated agriculture elliott et al 2014 kang et al 2017 in fact irrigation water consumption accounts for nearly 90 of the total water availability in arid areas of northwestern china li et al 2016a moreover unscientific and unreasonable irrigation water management can also directly cause environmental and ecological degradations and natural resources shortages problems therefore it is indeed necessary to improve irrigation water management and optimize irrigation water allocation which will ensure the sustainable development of agricultural production lu et al 2016 optimizing irrigation water allocation in the technical sense implies how much water should be allocated to different subareas under certain goals zeng et al 2010 therefore various mathematical methods have been developed for irrigation planning and management to identify optimal solutions singh and panda 2012 including traditional methods including linear programming bartolini et al 2007 nonlinear programming cai et al 2001 dynamic programming shang and mao 2006 and artificial intelligence search methods like genetic algorithms arabi et al 2006 safavi and esmikhani 2013 and simulated annealing brown et al 2010 pÃ©rez sÃ¡nchez et al 2018 these techniques have made significant contributions to the development of irrigation water management however the above methods may have limitations in response to uncertainties e g stochastic fuzzy and interval variables parameters existing in irrigation water management problems practically an irrigation system typically covers a multitude of aspects associated with resources capacity economic development and environmental impact xu and qin 2010 leading to uncertain factors such as water availability irrigation water demand market price and crop yields such inherent uncertainties may cause intensified difficulties in the decision making of practical applications therefore a series of inexact mathematical programming methods including interval mathematical programming imp stochastic mathematical programming smp and fuzzy mathematical programming fmp have been developed for generating effective decision solutions under uncertainty generally smp can provide more explicit decision solutions while it may be impeded by its rigorous data requirements complicated probability analysis and time consuming computational burden xu and qin 2010 tan et al 2011 conversely imp based on interval analysis using interval parameters or variables is more convenient for dealing with uncertain information with known ranges but unknown distributions more practically as a basic tool for irrigation planning and management crop water production functions cwpfs can be empirically obtained by the fitting results based on field experimental data these data including actual evapotranspiration et and crop yields are easily influenced by the measurement methods observation error and calculation methods leading to imprecise and uncertain specifications of cwpfs therefore interval cwpfs can be considered as a better choice to quantitatively describe the relationship between et and crop yield in practical problems tong and guo 2013 li et al 2016b accordingly imp is capable of handling such a problem of integration interval cwpfs and other interval information into its optimization framework for example li et al 2016b developed an interval linear fractional irrigation water allocation model by integrating interval cwpfs into the model s framework however it does not allow violation of system constraints and may be infeasible when the right hand side coefficients of constraints are highly uncertain huang et al 1992 furthermore some parameters are subject to human judgments and the linguistic terms of approximately equal and approximately satisfactory are more acceptable in decision making zeng et al 2010 it is desired that optimization methods be developed to further address above mentioned problems therefore fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp as an improved fmp method can be introduced to effectively tackle fuzzy uncertainties and violation of system constraints the fuzzy constraints can be transformed into deterministic ones at predetermined confidence levels which has a lower computational burden and provides more flexible solutions there are two types of fccp model from the literature review including chance constrained programming with fuzzy parameters liu and iwamura 1998 and chance constrained programming with dfp distribution with fuzzy probability parameters iskander 2005 guo and huang 2009 guo et al 2014 for example guo and huang 2009 developed a two stage fuzzy chance constrained programming approach for water resources management under dual uncertainties and applied it to a hypothetical case zhang and guo 2018 developed a fuzzy linear fractional programming model with double sided fuzziness for irrigation water management although the fccp model with dfp parameters can reflect the dual uncertainty feature i e probabilistic and possibilistic information it is difficult to acquire the dual uncertain information and further popularize the model in practical application moreover it can only address the fuzzy uncertainties in the right hand side constraints while those in the left hand side constraints are presented as interval numbers this will lead to the potential to miss some valuable uncertain information in practice fuzzy uncertainties may exist in both sides of constraints of the model thus double sided fccp dfccp is introduced to address the above complexities additionally few studies of the dfccp model for irrigation water management have been conducted therefore this study aims at integrating the advantages of the above outlined methods an interval based fuzzy chance constrained irrigation water allocation ifciwa model with double sided fuzziness is developed for supporting irrigation water management it is derived from incorporating double sided chance constrained programming dfccp into an interval parameter programming ipp framework moreover it integrates the interval cwpfs into its optimization framework the objective of the developed model is to optimize irrigation water allocation to different crops in different subareas achieving maximum system benefits it is able to handle uncertainties that are presented as intervals and fuzzy sets arising from the subjective and objective variability of the irrigation systems to demonstrate its applicability it will be applied to a case study in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin in northwest china to optimize irrigation water allocation under uncertainty thus more flexible and tractable solutions can be generated under different scenarios these optimal solutions can provide decision support for managers to make final decisions for irrigation water allocation fig 1 graphically illustrates the framework of the study 2 methodology in this section three aspects of methodology including interval linear crop water production functions interval based fuzzy chance constrained irrigation water allocation ifciwa model with double sided fuzziness and the corresponding solution method will be presented therefore the further details can be outlined as follows 2 1 interval linear crop water production functions ilcwpfs in this study the linear cwpfs i e y a e t b where y is the harvested crop yield kg ha e t is the actual evapotranspiration m3 ha and a b are empirical coefficients mathematically determined by fitting the field experimental data are chosen to quantitatively express the relationship between crop yield and et li et al 2016b due to the actual conditions the collected field experimental data is easily influenced by measurement methods and observation errors causing uncertainties in determining cwpfs using deterministic cwpfs may thereby have difficulties in dealing with these uncertainties thus interval linear crop water production functions ilcwpfs are introduced to better reflect the above concerns then an interval regression method is used to calculate ilcwpfs for different crops tanaka and lee 1998 tong and guo 2013 it can be written as follows 1a y x a 0 a 1 x 1 a n x n a x where x 1 x 1 x n t is a real input vector a a 0 a 1 a n is an interval coefficient vector and y x is the corresponding interval output an interval coefficient a i is denoted as a i a i c i where a i is a center value and c i is a radius value now an interval regression analysis method based on quadratic programming is adopted because it provides more diverse spread coefficients than linear programming it also considers the central tendency of least squares and possibilistic characteristics of fuzzy regression the objective of the interval regression based on quadratic programming is to minimize the sum of j 1 p y j a t x j 2 and j 1 p c t x j x j t c by giving different weights to obtain expected interval coefficients a i a i c i i 1 n therefore it is presented as follows 1b min j k 1 j 1 p y j a t x j 2 k 2 j 1 p c t x j x j t c where the output y j should be included in the output y x j indicating that these outputs should be satisfied y i y x i j 1 2 p thus the objective function eq 1b should be subjected to the following constraints 1c a t x j c t x j y j j 1 p 1d a t x j c t x j y j j 1 p 1e c i 0 i 1 n where x j 1 x j 1 x j n t a a 0 a n t c c 0 c n t k 1 and k 2 are the given weight coefficients the larger values of k 1 k 2 the more central tendency will appear meaning that the interval regression results approximately tend to be the results obtained from the least squares regression method the regression results may be different with the ratio of k 1 and k 2 changes therefore the corresponding results of ilcwpfs can be obtained which are the basis of the following optimization irrigation water allocation model 2 2 interval based fuzzy chance constrained irrigation water allocation ifciwa model with double sided fuzziness to address interval parameters variables and ilcwpfs in irrigation water management problems interval parameter programming ipp can be used to solve such a problem moreover when the parameters of both left hand and right hand sides in the constraints are fuzzy sets that can be expressed as possibility distributions and the violation of system constraints exists in the optimization model the double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming dfccp method can be adopted fiedler et al 2006 therefore an interval based fuzzy chance constrained irrigation water allocation ifciwa model with double sided fuzziness is formulated to allocate irrigation water to different crops and subareas the system objective is then presented as follows 2a max f i 1 3 j 1 3 n b i j c p i j a i j a j s w i j g w i j p e i b j i 1 3 j 1 3 a i j c s i s w i j Î· s c g i g w i j Î· g where f is system objective that is to maximize system benefits from the agricultural production 109 yuan f is an interval variable and the and represent the upper and lower bounds of an interval parameter or variable i is subarea i 1 2 3 j is type of crop j 1 2 3 n b i j is the price of crop j in subarea i yuan kg c p i j is the cost of crop production for crop j in subarea i including all the costs such as seed fertilizer pesticides machinery harvesting and other costs yuan kg a i j is the irrigated area of crop j in subarea i ha a j and b j are the empirical coefficients of the ilcwpfs for crop j s w i j and g w i j are the decision variables denoting the amount of irrigated surface water and groundwater for crop j in subarea i m3 ha p e i is the effective precipitation of subarea i m3 ha c s i j and c g i j are the cost of surface water and groundwater use in subarea i yuan m3 Î· s and Î· g are the comprehensive irrigation water use coefficients of surface water and groundwater the system objective i e eq 2a is subjected to the following system constraints 1 surface water availability constraint 2b p o s Î» s q s i 1 3 j 1 3 1 Î» s a i j s w i j q s Î· s Î² s Î± 2 groundwater availability constraint 2c p o s

water conveyance that are presented as fuzzy sets q s and q g are the surface water and groundwater availabilities which are also expressed as fuzzy sets 106 m3 Î² s and Î² g are the proportion of surface water and groundwater used for agricultural irrigation in this study Î² s 0 9 and Î² g 0 9 in the above constraints li et al 2016a Î± denotes Î± cut confidence level and it describes the fuzzy degree of membership level 3 fairness constraint 2d i 1 i i 2 i s w i 1 j g w i 1 j p e i 1 j s w i 2 j g w i 2 j p e i 2 j 2 n i 1 i s w i j g w i j p e i j g 0 j a n d i 1 i 2 i where i 1 and i 2 are the two subareas of the three subareas independently n the number of total subareas g 0 is the gini coefficient which is generally used to measure economic inequality this constraint can be interpreted as the ratio between the sum of water shortages of each two subareas and total water demands is not greater than an acceptable gap understandably for some subareas with higher water use efficiency and net benefit will be allocated more water this may not be fair to farmers with lower water use efficiency therefore to achieve a balance to some degree the fairness constraint is considered by introducing the gini coefficient yang et al 2015 theoretically it ranges from 0 to 1 and higher value represents more unequal distribution less than 0 2 denotes the absolute average 0 2 0 3 denotes relatively average 0 3 0 4 denotes relatively reasonable 0 4 0 5 represents relatively bigger gap and more than 0 5 can be regarded as disparity sun 2013 absolute average indicates that each farmer is distributed exactly the same amount of money relatively average indicates that each farmer is distributed almost the same amount of money and a relatively reasonable refers to the existence of an acceptable gap a value of g 0 0 4 was selected for fairness constraints because the international warning level is 0 4 zhang and xu 2011 4 irrigation water demand constraints 2e e t min i j s w i j g w i j p e i j e t max i j i j e t min i j and e t max i j are the minimum and maximum irrigation water requirements of crop j in subarea i m3 ha 5 nonnegative constraints 2f s w i j 0 g w i j 0 i j s w i j and g w i j are the decision variables which should be positive 2 3 solution method to solve the ifciwa model it should be transformed into deterministic submodels therefore the solution method consists of two parts i e solution methods of ipp and dfccp respectively first it should be transformed into the upper and the lower bounds submodels based on the interactive algorithms method proposed by huang et al 1992 because the objective function is maximum system benefits the submodel corresponding to f i e upper bound submodel should be first formulated and solved subsequently the submodel corresponding to f i e lower bound submodel is formulated and solved based on the solutions of the upper bound submodel second for the upper or lower submodels according to fiedler et al 2006 the violation of constraints with double sided fuzziness in the submodel at each confidence level consists of two reliability scenarios i e the minimum reliability and maximum reliability they are defined as follows 3a p o s r i j v max i j inf max 1 Î¼ r i j x i j 1 Î¼ v i j y i j x i j y i j â x i j y i j Î± r i j r 1 Î± v i j l 1 Î± 3b p o s r i j v min i j sup min Î¼ r i j x i j Î¼ v i j y i j x i j y i j â x i j y i j Î± r i j l Î± v i j r Î± where r i j v max i j denotes that the equations r i j v i j are satisfied at the maximum reliability while r i j v min i j denotes that the equations r i j v i j are satisfied at the minimum reliability Î¼ r i j x i j and Î¼ v i j y i j are the fuzzy membership functions of the variables x i j and y i j r i j l Î± is defined as the minimum values of all possible values at Î± cut level that is r i j l Î± inf r r Î¼ 1 Î± likewise v i j r Î± is defined as maximum values of all possible values at Î± cut level that is v i j r Î± sup v v Î¼ 1 Î± Î¼ 1 is the inverse function of Î¼ according to eqs 3a and 3b upper and lower bounds submodels at each confidence level can be transformed into two crisp equivalents accordingly by giving different confidence levels the final solutions of each deterministic submodel can be generated the detailed procedure of the solution method is summarized as follows step 1 acquire the parameters of model required in terms of interval boundaries and fuzzy sets fuzzy membership function under different water levels step 2 formulate the ifciwa model step 3 reformulate the developed model into two submodels through the interactive algorithms method based on the solution method of the ipp the upper bound of submodel f is first solved step 4 transform the submodel corresponding to f into two crisp equivalents i e the minimum and the maximum reliability scenarios based on the solution method of dfccp step 5 give different confidence levels optimal solutions corresponding to f can be completely obtained step 6 solve the other submodel by following steps 4 and 5 and optimal solutions corresponding to f can be completely obtained step 7 combine solutions from steps 5 and 6 and the final solutions of f o p t f o p t f o p t s w i j o p t s w i j o p t s w i j o p t and g w i j o p t g w i j o p t g w i j o p t can be generated under different confidence levels and water levels 3 case study 3 1 study area the heihe river basin is the second largest arid inland in northwest china it is located in the middle of the hexi corridor lying between latitudes 38 and 42 n and longitudes 98 and 101 30 e it has three parts i e upstream midstream and downstream areas the midstream area was selected as the study area see fig 2 mainly including three administrative regions i e ganzhou district gz linze county lz and gaotai county gt the annual average temperature is about 7 6 c and annual average precipitation is 195 mm 90 of all precipitation occurs from march to september and annual average potential evapotranspiration is 1710 mm main crops such as spring wheat maize and economic crops are planted and cultivated economic crops includes cotton fruits and vegetables that can bring higher economic benefits than grain crops the growing period of these crops in the study area ranges from march to october moreover agricultural water consumption in the midstream area utilizes approximately 90 of total water consumptions li et al 2016a crops are mainly irrigated by surface water through densely distributed canal networks and traditional irrigation methods such as flood and furrow methods are generally adopted by farmers groundwater will be extracted to compensate for the deficiency of surface water because of its seasonal variations jiang et al 2016 although nearly all the main canals have been lined a portion of irrigation water is still lost during water conveyance due to multiple levels of the canal system therefore the comprehensive irrigation water use coefficients of surface water and groundwater are 0 52 and 0 60 according to statistical data of zhangye city from 2002 to 2015 how to reasonably manage irrigation water and effectively optimize the limited irrigation water allocation is a critical issue for the sustainable development of agriculture moreover various uncertain factors exist in agricultural systems such as water availability irrigation water demands and market conditions these uncertainties may inevitably influence irrigation water management problems therefore inexact optimization models are desirable to support irrigation water management under uncertainty 3 2 data collection and processing to solve the ifciwa model input parameters are required basically information regarding crop data environmental capabilities and hydrological conditions is collected and calculated each detailed component can be explained as follows 3 2 1 interval linear crop water production functions table 1 presents the ilcwpfs for each study crop spring wheat maize and economic crops were chosen as study crops based on the section 2 1 an interval regression method was adopted to obtain the desired ilcwpfs for different crops the field experimental data originated from li 2005 and the regression results refer to li 2017 to make the regression results tend towards the central tendency the ratio of k 1 1 and k 2 0 0001 was used to determine the specifications of ilcwpfs however for spring wheat the ratio of k 1 0 0001 and k 2 1 was used to minimize the sum of squared spreads because the constant term coefficients of regression result at the ratio of k 1 1 and k 2 0 0001 are deterministic li et al 2016b additionally it is assumed that the ilcwpfs are the same in different subareas attributed to their similar soil physical properties soil types crops hydrological and meteorological conditions 3 2 2 water availability table 2 presents surface water and groundwater availabilities both surface water and groundwater availabilities are presented as symmetric triangular fuzzy numbers under three water levels thereby requiring its middle upper and lower values see fig 3 for surface water availability water supply for the midstream area is directly delivered from the main stream of the heihe river thus the category of three inflow levels is based on the frequency analysis method li et al 2016a that is low level p 75 medium level 25 p 75 and high level p 25 the estimation of the range of availability under each inflow level is based on t distribution method due to its unknown standard deviation of the sample the 95 confidence level was chosen to obtain confidence intervals therefore a triangular fuzzy number with the lower middle and upper values can be obtained under each water level groundwater availability can be obtained from historical records of groundwater use it is also presented as a symmetric triangular fuzzy number with the division of three water levels accordingly the middle and lower values are estimated from the mean and the minimum values of the statistical data from 2002 to 2015 moreover the effective precipitation under three water levels see table 3 was obtained from the observation data of meteorological stations in typical hydrological years 3 2 3 crop irrigation water demand tables 3 and 4 present the irrigation water demands and k c values of the crops crop irrigation water demand is obtained e t c k c e t 0 where e t c is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm day k c is the crop coefficient and e t 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day daily reference evapotranspiration is calculated based on the fao 56 penman monteith method where the basic meteorological data from zhangye no 52562 linze no 52557 and gaotai no 52546 meteorological stations located in midstream area during 1967 2009 yin et al 2012 thus total crop irrigation water demand for the whole growth stage can be obtained by the sum of daily values of each growth stage in typical hydrological years 3 2 4 other related parameters table 5 presents other related parameters associated with the ifciwa model crop planting area crop price and water use cost are obtained from statistical data local government reports and websites especially the rate of water loss during water conveyance is considered as a symmetric triangular fuzzy number in the left hand side constraints the rates of water loss during surface water and groundwater conveyance are 0 20 0 25 0 30 and 0 10 0 15 0 20 respectively 4 results analysis and discussion to examine the effects of Î± cut confidence levels and water levels eleven confidence levels i e Î± 0 0 1 1 0 and three water levels i e high medium and low levels were applied to the ifciwa model each confidence level can be separated into two reliability scenarios i e minimum and maximum reliability scenarios while each scenario can further be transformed into upper and lower bounds of submodels therefore there are a total of 132 submodels that need to be solved and then 66 sets of optimal interval solutions can be generated for supporting irrigation water management as the ifciwa model combines the dfccp method into the ipp optimization framework it thus potentially possesses the advantages of the two methods because the dfccp method addresses violation of system constraints with double sided fuzziness and thus generates the corresponding solutions at different confidence levels choosing the proper confidence level becomes more important for decision making theoretically a confidence level means the corresponding satisfaction degree of fuzzy uncertainty which can basically reflect managers subjective attitudes and directly affect the results moreover the obtained results contain a combination of deterministic and interval information which can reflect different forms of uncertainties and characteristics of model more details about results analysis and discussion are provided in the following three sections 4 1 optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation table 6 presents optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation at different confidence levels and low water level with the confidence level ranging from 0 to 1 0 at intervals of 0 1 the results of lz and gt remain unchanged which is seemingly insensitive to the variation of confidence levels this can be caused by the crop planting area of the lz and gt being less than gz so that the confidence level has an insignificant influence on their optimal solutions besides in the lz and gt the results show that crops are totally irrigated by surface water without using groundwater indicating groundwater will be protected for ensuring local groundwater table and ecological security for example the allocated irrigation surface water is 1907 1 m3 ha for spring wheat 2022 4 m3 ha for maize and 4030 9 5453 6 m3 ha for economic crops in lz under the minimum reliability scenario and the results obtained are the same as the above mentioned under the maximum reliability scenario meanwhile optimal solutions of irrigation surface water allocation are 2193 3 m3 ha for spring wheat 4707 7 6369 9 m3 ha for maize and 4425 4 5987 4 m3 ha for economic crops in gt under minimum and maximum reliability scenarios obviously the fuzzy parameters of both water availability and the rate of water loss during water conveyance have no effect on the system variations in lz and gt subareas however the results from the model developed in gz indicate that confidence levels have slight influences on the output results for example when confidence level is increased from 0 to 1 0 under the minimum reliability scenario the allocated surface water for spring wheat will be slightly decreased from 691 1 m3 ha to 672 0 m3 ha while the allocated groundwater will be gradually increased from 833 0 m3 ha to 852 0 m3 ha moreover for the maize the obtained results have the same falling trends of both the allocated surface water and groundwater furthermore the solutions of surface water for economic crops are decreased from 1200 8 m3 ha to 893 8 m3 ha but the solutions of groundwater present an opposite trend i e from 2272 6 3498 5 m3 ha to 2579 6 3805 5 m3 ha the results indicate that different confidence levels are associated with different optimal solutions which can help managers distinguish desired solutions based on their subjective preferences and choices in fact the interaction between decision variables can reflect the uncertainty and complexity of agricultural systems therefore it is important for managers to figure out the uncertainties and interactions of variables and make a final decision by contrast the results under the maximum reliability scenario show similar changing trend as the confidence level increases in other words the distinctive difference between minimum and maximum reliability scenarios is merely the amount of allocated irrigation surface water and groundwater the reason is that based on the dfccp algorithm the surface water and groundwater availabilities under the maximum reliability scenario are less than the minimum reliability scenario therefore planning under the minimum reliability scenario of the system objective leads to higher system benefits due to the increased water availabilities which represents the optimistic attitudes of managers although they will face higher system failure risk levels however planning under the maximum reliability scenario is related to lower water availabilities and lower system benefits which can provide more reliable results because of conservative attitudes to investigate the effects of different water levels on the variation of results table 7 presents optimal solutions of surface water and groundwater allocation under three water levels and Î± 0 5 the differences among three water levels are their water availabilities irrigation water demands and effective precipitation among them the total water availabilities under the high water level are greater than medium and low water levels at the same confidence level moreover under a higher water level surface water availabilities will increase but groundwater availabilities will decrease therefore when the system objective is to maximize system benefits more surface water will be allocated to different crops and subareas under the higher water level e g high level medium level low level while the allocated groundwater presents an opposite trend it can be explained in that water surface water cost is less than groundwater cost i e c s i c g i thus surface water should be allocated first to satisfy irrigation water demand this promising phenomenon shows that less groundwater will be extracted for agricultural irrigation to alleviate the dropping groundwater table due to previous over exploitation of groundwater furthermore the total amount of allocated surface water and groundwater for three crops in gz under the minimum reliability scenario are not less than that under the maximum reliability scenario taking medium water level as an example the total amount of allocated irrigation is 1591 4 1591 4 m3 ha for spring wheat 4068 2 4070 1 3423 5 m3 ha for maize and 3601 0 4872 0 3601 0 4872 0 m3 ha for economic crops under the minimum maximum reliability scenarios from the perspective of the dfccp algorithm rule the fuzzy chance constraints in the model can be transformed into two crisp equivalents under minimum and maximum reliabilities therefore the above results can provide more choices for managers based on their preferences and help them analyze tradeoffs between system variations and reliability levels 4 2 system economic benefits figs 4 a b 5 a b and 6 a b compare system economic benefits resulting from the ifciwa model at varying confidence levels under the high medium and low water levels respectively as shown in fig 4a system benefits under the high water level are 2 659 7 913 109 yuan when Î± 0 2 650 7 822 109 yuan when Î± 0 5 and 2 642 7 734 109 yuan when Î± 1 0 under the minimum reliability scenario the results show that a higher confidence level will bring lower system benefits and higher reliability level generally an increased confidence level means much higher satisfaction degree level of constraints thereby causing a lower possibility that the constraints can be violated this theoretically leads to an increased strictness for the system constraints and finally results in a narrow decision space e g decreased water availability and increased rate of water loss therefore the confidence level is related to a manager s risk preferences and thus an acceptable and proper risk is critical to generate optimal solutions for decision making according to fiedler et al 2006 each confidence level consists of two reliability scenarios namely the confidence level under minimum and maximum reliabilities similarly from fig 4b system benefits under the maximum reliability scenario can also be seen for example system benefits are 2 642 7 734 109 yuan when Î± 0 2 618 7 650 109 yuan when Î± 0 5 and 2 560 7 568 109 yuan when Î± 1 0 obviously the latter leads to slightly lower system benefits than the former under a series of confidence levels such a difference can be explained by the reason that the former represents an optimistic strategy for decision making but the latter are associated with higher system reliability levels due to pessimistic preferences understandably as shown in fig 4a b planning under a lower confidence level and a minimum reliability scenario can lead to maximize system benefits conversely planning under a higher confidence level and maximum reliability scenario will bring minimized system benefits therefore the above results can support in depth analysis of the interrelationships among system benefits confidence levels reliability levels and risk levels in terms of three water levels the results from figs 4a b to 6a b indicate that system benefits under the high water level are greater than medium and low water levels for example under the minimum reliability scenario when confidence level is increased system benefits resulting from the high medium and low water levels are 2 659 7 913 109 yuan 2 505 7 463 109 yuan and 2 277 6 963 109 yuan Î± 0 2 650 7 822 109 yuan 2 501 7 408 109 yuan and 2 219 6 883 109 yuan Î± 0 5 2 642 7 734 109 yuan 2 463 7 355 109 yuan and 2 164 6 806 109 yuan Î± 1 0 respectively the results also show a tradeoff between system benefits and water levels therefore under advantageous system conditions with higher total water availabilities system benefits may be higher however under demanding conditions due to less total water availability system benefits may be decreased 4 3 discussion because of the uncertainties in agricultural irrigation systems decision variables in the form of intervals are more reasonable because they provide more decision making options to managers moreover Î± cut confidence level is also introduced to quantitatively describe some parameters that are expressed as fuzzy numbers and violation of fuzzy constraints due to their own fuzzy attributes therefore managers can base decisions on these constraints to ultimately generate different types of results by selecting or adjusting within the range of feasible solutions these decision making processes require that managers in combination with their understanding of socio economic and environmental conditions in the study area and the preferences of systemic risk levels and returns should obtain the final plans without accounting for the uncertainties in the system the ifciwa model can be rewritten into a deterministic linear programming model that is taking mean values of interval parameters and middle values of fuzzy parameters as inputs of the ifciwa model then solutions can be obtained by adopting and solving this model see table 8 it can be seen that the results are not as flexible as the results obtained by the ifciwa model because the deterministic model can only provide a set of solutions for managers for example under medium water level only one solution can be generated for irrigation water allocation to each crop in each subarea moreover system benefits obtained under medium water level is 4 753 109 yuan which is a deterministic value between the fluctuant values of 2 392 109 yuan lowest value and 7 463 109 yuan highest value see fig 5a b however the developed model enables to provide more results e g 44 sets of solutions under a certain water level based on the system variations and managers preferences and attitudes this undoubtedly provides managers with more information when deciding on irrigation water management for example planning under a lower confidence level and minimum reliability scenario will achieve higher system benefits but at the same time bear a higher risk level in contrast lower system benefits will be obtained under a decreased system failure risk level in summary the developed model is superior to a deterministic model in its broader applicability it can also be used to better handle tradeoffs among the economy the environment and system reliability and to further provide more flexible and effective solutions for irrigation water allocation 5 conclusions in this study an interval based fuzzy chance constrained irrigation water allocation ifciwa model with double sided fuzziness was developed for irrigation water management this model incorporates interval parameter programming ipp and double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming dfccp into an irrigation water management framework interval linear crop water production functions ilcwpfs are introduced as the basis of irrigation planning which can be obtained by the interval regression method therefore the model can address interval and fuzzy uncertainties it allows violation of double sided constraints at predetermined confidence levels and enables transformation of fuzzy chance constraints into two crisp equivalents under minimum and maximum reliability scenarios respectively a case study of irrigation water management was provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model more flexible and effective solutions can be generated at each confidence level and water level for supporting irrigation water allocation these results are useful for identifying desired solutions with maximized system benefits moreover the solutions obtained can support in depth analysis of interrelationships among system benefits confidence levels reliability levels and risk levels this study developed an irrigation water allocation model associated with interval and fuzzy inputs as well as ilcwpfs the flexible and feasible solutions suggest that it is also applicable to other resource management and environmental problems such as water quality management air quality management and energy system management for potential improvements techniques of quadratic crop water production functions nonlinear programming and stochastic

11303,yield the final goal in agricultural systems is highly determined by fruit growth however most works on deficit irrigation did not consider the physiology and dynamics of fruit growth in this study we explore the effect of water relations between leaves and fruits on fruit growth in well watered ww and water stressed ws trees in a super high density olive orchard cv arbequina over a full irrigation season june october of 2017 in southern spain both leaf and fruit water potential were measured along with pressure volume curves concomitantly fruit growth and diurnal changes in six fruits of each irrigation treatment were continuously monitored with fruit gauges which recorded changes in the equatorial diameter of the fruit fruit water status and growth were greatly affected by water stress the latter recovering markedly following our regulated deficit irrigation strategy the gradient between leaf and fruit water potential was positive most of the time for both irrigation treatments and greater for ws than ww trees which suggests water flow into the fruit however we also observed negative fruit growth in ws which together with the positive gradient suggests that water flow from the parent plant to the fruit was insufficient to balance fruit transpiration under conditions of water deficit although a strong correlation was found between leaf water potential and the amplitude of fruit contraction in ww trees this relationship did not hold for ws trees suggesting a progressive decoupling of fruit water status from leaves as water stress progressed accordingly an osmotic adjustment as evidenced by the analyses of pressure volume curves occurred in ws fruits towards the end of the season these results indicate that leaf fruit water potential measurements may not be sufficient to study fruit leaf water relationships in the canopy however fruit gauges may serve as highly useful instruments to understand the water status and daily dynamics of fruit growth keywords fruit gauges fruit water potential fruit osmotic adjustment leaf water potential regulated deficit irrigation water potential gradient 1 introduction the world sagricultural production needs to continue to grow to meet the increasing demand for food challenge aggravated by climate change production is highly determined by fruit size among other factors such as crop load naor et al 2013 and leaf area hernandez santana et al 2017 and thus the study of fruit growth can provide information on final yield moreover fruit growth is highly sensitive to water deficit which decreases its biomass accumulation and tissue expansion and reduces cell number tardieu et al 2011 the aforementioned characteristics make fruit growth to be a sensitive water stress indicator directly related to plant function and yield specifically the study of the water potential gradients between the parent plant and the fruit which determine water flux into and out of the fruit and also of transpiration losses from the fruit greenspan et al 1994 1996 would help to understand the diurnal diameter fluctuations in fruit size moreover osmotic adjustment could also contribute to investigate fruit growth and crop yield under drought stress osmotic adjustment or the decrease in osmotic potential is a beneficial mechanisms to respond to water stress because it helps to maintain cell turgor which is together with biomass accumulation the main drivers of growth hsiao et al 1976 ho et al 1987 fishman and gÃ©nard 1998 however despite its relevance osmotic adjustment in fruits has been addressed in relatively few studies mills et al 1996 pomper and breen 1997 girÃ³n et al 2015 interestingly previous studies on olive trees have shown that fruit growth has preference over vegetative growth stem or leaves especially under water stress iniesta et al 2009 dag et al 2010 hernandez santana et al 2017 under such conditions the fruit is the main sink for new carbon assimilates similarly it has been reported that olive fruits are the main water sinks during water stress periods and that this decreases in importance under conditions of no water stress girÃ³n et al 2015 however opposite results have also been reported dell amico et al 2012 being the different crop load in each study a possible explanation for these contrasting results girÃ³n et al 2015 fruit diameter has been monitored successfully with fruit gauges in different crop species such as apples jones and higgs 1982 zibordi et al 2009 morandi et al 2011c pears morandi et al 2014 peaches morandi et al 2007 2011a and kiwifruit morandi et al 2011a b although studies showing their use with small fruits are less frequent greenspan et al 1996 and to the best of our knowledge they have not been used in olives fruit gauge measurements can provide useful information on daily growth and shrinkage and related water movement into and out of fruits morandi et al 2007 2010 2011a b c however as for trunk dendrometers the interpretation of data to allow the effect of water fluxes to be separated from biomass accumulation is challenging which complicates its use as a water stress index fernÃ¡ndez and cuevas 2010 mencuccini et al 2013 de swaef et al 2015 thus more information on the mechanisms impacting fruit growth is needed to evaluate its use as a water stress indicator and its relation to final yield to the best of our knowledge this constitutes the first study of this type on the olive tree and one of the few in other species because fruit dendrometers are normally used to measure fruit growth in wet or well irrigated orchards but they are not usually used to study fruit growth dynamics provoked by water stress the objective of this work is to study the effect of water stress on fruit growth dynamics of trees in a super high density olive orchard cv arbequina and the water potential gradient between leaves and fruits as a possible mechanism to explain these dynamics to fulfill this objective we established the following aims i to assess changes in fruit growth in response to water stress ii to evaluate the relations between changes in fruit diameter and the gradient of water potential between leaves and fruits and iii to study osmotic adjustments in fruits as a consequence of water availability fruit growth was measured continuously with fruit gauges and the water potential gradient between fruits and leaves was assessed with a view to increase our understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying fruit growth and water relations in the canopy in response to water stress we believe this knowledge is crucial for the development in the future of new deficit irrigation methods based on process based models focused on the improvement of crop water productivity to schedule irrigation and predict yield 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental orchard and irrigation treatments the experiments were performed in a super high density olive orchard olea europaea l cv arbequina located 25 km to the south east of seville spain 37 15 n 5 48 w trees were planted in a configuration of 4 m x 1 5 m 1667 trees ha 1 at the top of 0 4 m high ridges

humidity radiation and wind speed from the eto data the crop coefficient approach was used to calculate etc we applied a well watered ww treatment and a water stressed ws treatment each treatment involved three 12 m 16 m plots in a randomized block design each plot had 24 trees and measurements were made in the central 8 trees to avoid border effects for the ww treatment trees were irrigated

latter estimated once every two weeks for each plot during the irrigation season measurements were made at dawn with a lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor inc lincoln ne usa following the procedure described by diaz espejo et al 2012 the percentage of sunny to total leaf area was estimated to be 35 according to diaz espejo et al 2002 and fernÃ¡ndez et al 2008 assuming a perfect coupling between

deficit irrigation rdi strategy recommended by fernÃ¡ndez et al 2013 for super high density olive orchards this strategy considers three periods over the course of the olive growing cycle during which the crop is highly sensitive to water stress during these periods irrigation replaced the crop water needs period 1 extended from the final stages of floral development to full bloom second fortnight of april period 2 took place at the end of the first phase of fruit development june and period 3 related to a period of approximately three weeks prior to ripening after the midsummer period of high atmospheric demand from late august to mid september between periods 2 and 3 late june late august the olive tree is highly resistant to drought alegre et al 2002 moriana et al 2003 iniesta et al 2009 fernÃ¡ndez et al 2013 such that irrigation was only applied twice per week amounting to a total of ca 20 in for that period from the end of period 3 to harvesting end of october ca 40 of in was supplied further details on rdi can be found in fernÃ¡ndez et al 2013 and hernandez santana et al 2016 for the experimental period doy 151 296 the total applied irrigation was equal to 3620 95 and 1631 52 mÂ³ ha 1 for the ww and ws treatments respectively ws was 45 of the ww irrigation applied the irrigation system consisted of a single pipe per tree row with three 2 l h 1 drippers per tree spaced 0 5 m apart to assess soil volumetric water content Î¸ m3 m 3 we used a profile probe delta t devices ltd cambridge uk calibrated in situ fernÃ¡ndez et al 2011a b and two access tubes in each plot placed 0 1 and 0 4 m from the drippers and 0 5 m from the tree trunk measurements were performed at the time of maximum g s ca 9 00 gmt at depths of 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 6 and 1 0 m for the calculations of average Î¸ for each treatment a weighted average was calculated for each plot with the measurements from 0 1 to 0 4 m weighted by the percentage of roots and then by a simple average of the averages obtained for each plot 2 2 leaf and fruit water potential leaf water potential Ï leaf and fruit water potential Ï fruit were measured with a scholander type pressure chamber pms instrument company albany oregon usa measurements of Ï leaf were performed every two weeks between day of year doy 151 and 296 i e between may 31 and october 23 measurements of Ï fruit were made on the same days but starting from doy 200 july 19 leaves and fruits were sampled before sunrise predawn and at midday ca 11 00 gmt additional measurements of both Ï leaf and Ï fruit were performed at doy 212 226 228 243 and 256 but only at midday measurements of Ï leaf were made in two leaves per plot n 6 sampled from current year shoots of two central trees from the outer part of the canopy the leaf blade was cut to allow the insertion of the leaf petiole into the pressure chamber for Ï fruit two fruits per plot from the central trees of three plots were sampled n 6 the chosen fruits had a long pedicel ca 2 cm to allow the use of the pressure chamber once the fruits and leaves were excised they were placed in a closed bag with a soaked paper in it with a saturated atmosphere of h2o and co2 to force stomata to close and avoid transpiration to allow the water potential of the sample to equilibrate this bag was introduced in a second zip bag which in turn was introduced in a black plastic bag inside a field fridge with ice containers this sampling method also allowed us to collect all the samples in a very short time reducing the variability among them due to different collecting time preliminary tests were conducted to test that the water potential was not changing significantly for hours leaf water potential and Ï fruit were measured precisely in the laboratory on the afternoon of the sampling days using magnification lens 2 3 fruit growth fruit gauges were installed in one fruit of two representative trees per plot totaling six monitored fruits per treatment we used two types of fruit dendrometers one model was the fi xssf from solfranc solfranc tecnologias sl tarragona spain and the other model was adapted using a linear potentiometer model mm r 10 11 with internal spring return from megatron elektronik gmbh co munich germany coupled to a sensor holder we had 2 of the solfranc fruit dendrometers and four of the megatron fruit dendrometers per treatment the fruit dendrometers recorded fruit equatorial diameter every 5 min with the use of a datalogger cr1000 campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk from the fruit gauge measurements we calculated cumulative fruit growth as the maximum daily diameter of the fruit minus the maximum diameter of the previous day the fruit daily contraction was obtained by subtracting the maximum diameter from the minimum diameter of a certain day which results in negative values the megatron model was already used by morandi et al 2007 to monitor apple fruit diameter presenting useful and relevant data a comparison was performed between the two models of fruit dendrometers aiming at analyzing the similarity of the measured data between each model showing very similar results megatron

the ws treatment were sampled and immediately subjected to rehydration by immersing their petioles into distilled water these leaves were then stored in complete darkness at 2 4 c for 24 h for complete rehydration six fruits from ww plots and 11 fruits from ws plots were sampled from central trees by cutting the pedicel immersed in distilled water and then the fruit was left in distilled water and complete darkness at 2 4 c for 24 h these measurements were conducted on four different days for ws trees august 28 september 14 october 19 and 20 and on two different days for ww trees september 1 and october 19 after rehydration pressure volume pv curves were measured by weighing the tissue leaf or fruit shortly before measuring its water potential Ï with a scholander type pressure chamber pms instrument company albany oregon usa at the start of the curves the increase in pressure was about 0 01 mpa s 1 increasing to 0 1 mpa s 1 for points with Ï more negative than 1 8 mpa after the measurement of the whole pv curve the dry weight of the fruit or leaf was obtained by placing samples for 48 h in a drying oven maintained at 65 c the pv curves for each leaf and fruit were obtained by expressing relative water content rwc versus the respective water potential Ï where values were plotted for 100 rwc against 1 Ï based on these plots the turgor loss point tlp was obtained by the inflection point of the relation 1 Ï vs 100 relative water content providing the water potential and the relative water content at the turgor loss point Ï tlp and rwctlp respectively the calculation of the osmotic potential at saturation Ï Ï100 was performed according to nguyen et al 2017 2 5 calculations and statistical analysis we calculated the average Ï leaf and Ï fruit

daily maximum temperatures t max exceeding 30 c on 80 of days fig 1 a precipitation was scarce totaling just 17 62 mm on six days during the 145 day experimental period fig 1b daily crop evapotranspiration etc averaged 3 31 mm from the beginning of the experiment until doy 230 august 18 and decreased thereafter giving an overall average of 2 82 mm for the experimental period fig 1b daily average of vapor pressure deficit d a was around 2 16 kpa before doy 240 august 28 and decreased slightly thereafter for an average value of 1 93 kpa for the experimental period fig 1c of note is the fact that a large number of days had a maximum d a of over 6 kpa which imposed a large demand for transpiration soil volumetric water content Î¸ m3 m 3 in the ws treatment was significantly lower ca 57 lower p 0 05 than the ww treatment between the pit hardening period and the irrigation recovery period from doy 185 to 238 i e from july 4 to august 26 and also after the irrigation recovery period fig 2 3 2 fruit growth and diameter variation the average cumulative fruit growth for the ww treatment was relatively steady during the early part of the experiment with a slope of 0 07 mm d 1 from doy 151 until doy 190 and decreasing thereafter 0 018 mm d 1 until approximately doy 238 fig 3 the fruits from the ws treatment on the other hand exhibited a decrease as evidenced by negative slopes of cumulative fruit growth during the drought period ca doy 190 to 238 and after the irrigation recovery period ca doy 262 to 286 the plot of cumulative fruit growth for the ws treatment had a slope of 0 11 mm d 1 during the pit hardening period ca doy 159 to 185 which was higher than the slope at the same period for the ww treatment the ws treatment also exhibited a high recovery rate at the beginning of the recovery period with a slope of 0 23 mm d 1 between doy 238 and 242 reaching a similar cumulative growth rate to that of fruits in the control irrigation treatment ww 6 02 mm ws 5 70 mm fruits from both treatments grew at similar rate thereafter in agreement with the commented findings a greater daily equatorial diameter contraction was observed for the ws treatment than for the ww treatment fig 4 fruits from the ws treatment exhibited contractions greater than 0 5 mm during most of the period when deficit irrigation was applied ca doy 185 to 238 these contractions followed the irrigation frequency which was programmed to take place twice per week and suggest a close correlation with soil water availability in contrast fruits from the ww treatment exhibited a lower contraction due to their daily irrigation and better water status it is also interesting to note that the contractions of fruits from the ws treatment were lower than those from the ww treatment during the recovery period doy 238 to 262 the daily patterns on a 24 h time scale showed that fruit contraction occurred during the day light hours mainly during the afternoon and its expansion and growth during the evening night fig 5 however in periods of maximum stress ws fruits were able to grow at night only when irrigation occurred showing practically no contraction fig 5b doy 226 and 229 being the fruit expansion the rest of the nights much smaller or not happening at all during the recovery period from doy 238 onward we observed a remarkable growth at nights in ws fruits fig 5d higher than the expansion showed by ww fruits for the same period fig 5c 3 3 water relations between fruits and leaves for the predawn and midday sampling times and in the period when

when irrigation was lower for the ws treatment than for ww and differences between the treatments were more frequently for Ï fruit than Ï leaf p 0 05 predawn values fig 6c of Ï fruit for the ww treatment were always higher than 2 mpa with a slightly decreasing trend seen over the experimental period midday values of fruit water potential fig 6d ranged from 1 to 2 mpa for the ww treatment and were relatively stable during the measurement period in contrast Ï fruit in ws was lower than 2 mpa in predawn measurements and lower than 3 mpa at midday at times when olive trees were water stressed predawn and midday Ï fruit values during the recovery period period 3 were similar for both treatments the difference between Ï leaf and Ï fruit Î´Ï leaf fruit Ï leaf Ï fruit i e the water potential gradient between leaves and fruits was relatively stable and close to zero for predawn values in ww treated olive trees fig 6e with a slight increasing trend on the last two measurement days in contrast at midday these differences were positive and only close to zero after the recovery irrigation fig 6f on the other hand higher values of Î´Ï leaf fruit were more often found in ws trees than in ww trees 3 4 fruit diameter variations and canopy water relations fruit contraction was significantly correlated to Ï leaf in ww treated olives r2 0 48 p 0 001 fig 7 for the

values than fruits from the ww treatment these being similar to average Ï tlp values obtained in leaves from the ws treatment 4 discussion 4 1 response of fruit growth to water stress in this work we have studied the fruit leaf water relations in olive trees and their influence on fruit growth although previous studies have extensively researched fruit development jones and higgs 1982 lang 1990 higuchi and sakuratani 2006 greer and rogiers 2009 few have focused on the interaction between water relations of fruits and leaves in the canopy under conditions of water stress greenspan et al 1994 1996 mills et al 1996 pomper and breen 1997 dell amico et al 2012 girÃ³n et al 2015 the results presented here showed significant daily expansion and contraction of fruit diameters in response to both irrigation treatments fig 4 with greater contraction seen for ws than for ww in the period when irrigation for the former was much lower than that for the latter i e between period 2 and 3 and after period 3 contractions usually happened in the afternoon and expansion at nights except for periods of severe water stress when it did not occur fig 5 these increased contractions reflected fluctuations in soil water content as a consequence of the irrigation scheduling used for that treatment in contrast fruit contraction in response to the ww treatment was mainly driven by the high vapor pressure deficit present in the study area fig 1 these daily variations mainly that of daily shrinkage are usually interpreted as elastic variations in tissue volume lechaudel et al 2007 indeed the daily changes of fleshy fruits involves a balance between supply and withdrawal of water via the vascular tissue and losses through transpiration clearwater et al 2012 the observed daily variations in fruit diameters can be interpreted as changes in water flows into and out of the fruit the water stress caused greater fruit contraction during the day light hours within the deficit irrigated period for the ws treatment compared to ww and the recovery at evening night was not enough to increase or maintain the fruit diameter fig 5 causing an apparent negative fruit growth fig 3 under conditions of water stress there is also a limitation of the carbon assimilated due to stomatal closure hernandez santana et al 2018 demonstrated that cumulative fruit growth more specifically biomass accumulation was directly related to accumulated co2 assimilation as other authors have reported matthews and shackel 2005 gÃ©nard et al 2008 cumulative fruit growth is determined by biomass accumulation confirming that co2 assimilation plays a major role in fruit growth together with turgor maintenance further studies to examine the effect of water and photoassimilate relationships between fruits and leaves on fruit growth would help greatly to increase our understanding of fruit growth mechanisms although ws fruits were growing at a higher rate than ww fruits in the beginning likely due to natural variability the drop in the cumulative fruit growth was relevant compared to ww however even after that significant growth stop the studied ws trees recovered quickly showing the daily pattern almost no contraction in some fruits during the afternoon fig 5 such that the final fruit diameter of ws trees became similar to that of fruits from olive trees subjected to the ww treatment fig 3 similar to what we found in the same orchard for several years hernandez santana et al 2017 2018 it is likely that the full irrigation applied during the critical stage of pit hardening when most of the cell division and size are defined hammami et al 2011 helped to reduce differences between water treatments these results support the irrigation strategy used in this work since water use was reduced and a similar final fruit growth was achieved 4 2 water relations between fruits and leaves under water stress we identified positive Î´Ï leaf fruit values fig 6 similar to that of girÃ³n et al 2015 although they measured smaller water potential gradients in the study by dell amico et al 2012 which was conducted in the same trees as those used by girÃ³n el al 2015 44 year old table olive trees cv manzanillo even smaller gradients were reported and in most cases the gradient was negative leaf water potential was lower than fruit water potential in both studies both leaf and fruit water potentials were higher than values measured in our study indicating that the water stress was more severe in our study which could explain the greater water potential gradients between leaves and fruits indeed in the present work where less stressful conditions prevailed at the end of the summer more frequent irrigation and lower evaporative demand the water potential gradient became smaller and closer to zero particularly for midday measurements they studied a different cultivar manzanilla than in this study which may help to explain also these differences the two aforementioned studies dell amico et al 2012 girÃ³n et al 2015 did not report continuous measurements of fruit growth as in our study thus making it more difficult to interpret how Î´Ï leaf fruit affected fruit growth in dell amico et al 2012 fruit size was measured two times during the study with a larger fruit size measured in stressed than in control trees in girÃ³n et al 2015 which reported results more in line with ours fruit volume was measured regularly 13 times in 110 days and they observed also a fruit volume decrease at the end of the water stress period with their data they could conclude that water stress provoked that fruit was a stronger water sink than leaf however we demonstrated with our concomitant measurements of fruit growth dynamics figs 3 and 5 and leaf fruit water potentials fig 6 that even according to the leaf fruit water potentials the fruit would be a stronger water sink the reduction of the fruit growth diameter may be explained by an imbalance in water discharge refilling processes which in turn may lead to a depletion of water reserves in fruit exposed to water stress this gradient towards the fruit may help olive fruits to recover growth quickly after stress compared to other temperate fruit species where fruit have less negative water potentials than leaves greenspan et al 1996 morandi et al 2010 2011a c thus the study of water sink relationships between fruits and leaves would benefit greatly from the continuous monitoring of fruit growth in addition to water potential measurements although this and the mentioned works dell amico et al 2012 girÃ³n et al 2015 were conducted comparing the water potentials of leaves and fruits fruit vascular flows are driven usually by the water potential gradient between the stem and the fruit thus stem water potential would be a more direct measurement influencing fruit water potential changes and their effects on fruit growth and daily shrinkage 4 3 effect of canopy water relations on fruit growth as fruits and leaves can be considered as competing sinks for water it has been assumed that the difference between fruit and leaf water potential determines the directionality of water exchange between the fruit and the parent plant matthews and shackel 2005 thus the positive Î´Ï leaf fruit observed during maximum water stress would indicate water flow into the fruit from the parent tree in this study this phenomenon did take place in ww trees but the greatest positive Î´Ï leaf fruit measured in ws trees fig 6 coincided with times of fruit contractions in these same trees fig 3 indeed the greatest positive Î´Ïleaf fruit during ws occurred when the highest fruit contractions were observed the enhanced fruit contraction along with positive Î´Ï leaf fruit could be explained by an insufficient water flow into the fruit to balance fruit transpiration under water deficit conditions greenspan et al 1994 1996 water entering the fruit can be used for growth evaporation or subsequently a reverse flow to other tissues the idea of sustained reverse flows from fruits to other tissues has been challenged clearwater et al 2012 and it has been hypothesized that this probably occurs only as a transient morning reversal in sap flow higuchi and sakuratani 2006 clearwater et al 2009 or when plants undergo severe water stress greenspan et al 1996 clearwater et al 2012 thus fruit transpiration together with a reduced fruit water inflow with water stress may be the most likely explanation for negative fruit growth as reported for other species greenspan et al 1994 1996 morandi et al 2007 greer and rogiers 2009 clearwater et al 2012 and especially in our case where Î´Ï leaf fruit was positive the lack of correlation between leaf water potential and fruit contraction in ws trees fig 7 may be considered as circumstantial evidence of a high resistance to flow from the parent tree to fruit which could have resulted in impaired xylem water exchange in ws trees in ww however the relationship between leaf water status and fruit contractions was robust and significant a change in the relative importance of xylem phloem flows matthews and shackel 2005 as water stress develops may help to explain the lack of correlation between fruits and Ï leaf in ws trees as fruits would have had less influence from xylem Ï leaf this phenomenon has also been described to occur towards the end of fruit development as fruits become stronger sinks for water and carbohydrates mills et al 1996 in addition fruit transpiration has been reported to be relatively independent of stomatal regulation greenspan et al 1994 fishman and gÃ©nard 1998 montanaro et al 2012 depending mainly on cuticular transpiration driven by vapor pressure deficit morandi et al 2007 montanaro et al 2012 this would result in a higher fruit transpiration on those days with remarkable a high atmospheric demand and again more independent of Ïleaf than leaf transpiration the greater importance of phloem compared to xylem flow could also help to explain the osmotic adjustment observed in ws fruits table 1 towards the end of the season matthews and shackel 2005 as this mechanism relies on the accumulation of solutes within the cells under water stress these results indicate that leaf fruit water potential measurements alone may not be sufficient to study competitiveness for water in the canopy as such fruit gauges could serve a useful role to help elucidate the water status and daily dynamics of fruit growth and to establish deficit irrigation practices indeed fruit growth is a sensitive water stress indicator as demonstrated here with a remarkable capacity of recovery and importantly it is directly related to plant function and yield these characteristics make fruit growth tracking a good candidate to schedule deficit irrigation but more work is needed before it can be used with that purpose 5 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this report marks the first attempt to measure fruit growth dynamics continuously in olive trees and to evaluate the role of water potential gradients between fruits and leaves on those dynamics at the same time we confirm that olive fruit growth is sensitive to water stress and shows a remarkable capacity to recover following the irrigation strategy employed here our results also indicate that the study of water sink relationships between fruits and leaves would benefit greatly from the continuous monitoring of fruit growth in addition to water potential measurements as a progressive decoupling of fruit water status from leaves can arise as water stress progresses we conclude that the imbalance in water discharge refilling processes may lead to a depletion of water reserves in fruit exposed to water stress and accordingly to a net reduction in fruit diameter tracking fruit growth could serve as a promising approach to schedule regulated deficit irrigation enabling determination of the level of water stress that fruit can experience without affecting the recovery of their full size while using less water in the process moreover fruit growth is a highly relevant variable to measure because of its relationship to fruit yield while more work is needed to fully evaluate the usefulness of fruit gauges to schedule regulated deficit irrigation these results can be considered a first step towards achieving that purpose the information provided by the fruit dendrometers could be integrated in increasingly used mechanistic models to schedule irrigation and predict yield for different environmental conditions management approaches and cultivars future work should also consider the effect of biomass along with water accumulation and their relation to leaf water status

11303,yield the final goal in agricultural systems is highly determined by fruit growth however most works on deficit irrigation did not consider the physiology and dynamics of fruit growth in this study we explore the effect of water relations between leaves and fruits on fruit growth in well watered ww and water stressed ws trees in a super high density olive orchard cv arbequina over a full irrigation season june october of 2017 in southern spain both leaf and fruit water potential were measured along with pressure volume curves concomitantly fruit growth and diurnal changes in six fruits of each irrigation treatment were continuously monitored with fruit gauges which recorded changes in the equatorial diameter of the fruit fruit water status and growth were greatly affected by water stress the latter recovering markedly following our regulated deficit irrigation strategy the gradient between leaf and fruit water potential was positive most of the time for both irrigation treatments and greater for ws than ww trees which suggests water flow into the fruit however we also observed negative fruit growth in ws which together with the positive gradient suggests that water flow from the parent plant to the fruit was insufficient to balance fruit transpiration under conditions of water deficit although a strong correlation was found between leaf water potential and the amplitude of fruit contraction in ww trees this relationship did not hold for ws trees suggesting a progressive decoupling of fruit water status from leaves as water stress progressed accordingly an osmotic adjustment as evidenced by the analyses of pressure volume curves occurred in ws fruits towards the end of the season these results indicate that leaf fruit water potential measurements may not be sufficient to study fruit leaf water relationships in the canopy however fruit gauges may serve as highly useful instruments to understand the water status and daily dynamics of fruit growth keywords fruit gauges fruit water potential fruit osmotic adjustment leaf water potential regulated deficit irrigation water potential gradient 1 introduction the world sagricultural production needs to continue to grow to meet the increasing demand for food challenge aggravated by climate change production is highly determined by fruit size among other factors such as crop load naor et al 2013 and leaf area hernandez santana et al 2017 and thus the study of fruit growth can provide information on final yield moreover fruit growth is highly sensitive to water deficit which decreases its biomass accumulation and tissue expansion and reduces cell number tardieu et al 2011 the aforementioned characteristics make fruit growth to be a sensitive water stress indicator directly related to plant function and yield specifically the study of the water potential gradients between the parent plant and the fruit which determine water flux into and out of the fruit and also of transpiration losses from the fruit greenspan et al 1994 1996 would help to understand the diurnal diameter fluctuations in fruit size moreover osmotic adjustment could also contribute to investigate fruit growth and crop yield under drought stress osmotic adjustment or the decrease in osmotic potential is a beneficial mechanisms to respond to water stress because it helps to maintain cell turgor which is together with biomass accumulation the main drivers of growth hsiao et al 1976 ho et al 1987 fishman and gÃ©nard 1998 however despite its relevance osmotic adjustment in fruits has been addressed in relatively few studies mills et al 1996 pomper and breen 1997 girÃ³n et al 2015 interestingly previous studies on olive trees have shown that fruit growth has preference over vegetative growth stem or leaves especially under water stress iniesta et al 2009 dag et al 2010 hernandez santana et al 2017 under such conditions the fruit is the main sink for new carbon assimilates similarly it has been reported that olive fruits are the main water sinks during water stress periods and that this decreases in importance under conditions of no water stress girÃ³n et al 2015 however opposite results have also been reported dell amico et al 2012 being the different crop load in each study a possible explanation for these contrasting results girÃ³n et al 2015 fruit diameter has been monitored successfully with fruit gauges in different crop species such as apples jones and higgs 1982 zibordi et al 2009 morandi et al 2011c pears morandi et al 2014 peaches morandi et al 2007 2011a and kiwifruit morandi et al 2011a b although studies showing their use with small fruits are less frequent greenspan et al 1996 and to the best of our knowledge they have not been used in olives fruit gauge measurements can provide useful information on daily growth and shrinkage and related water movement into and out of fruits morandi et al 2007 2010 2011a b c however as for trunk dendrometers the interpretation of data to allow the effect of water fluxes to be separated from biomass accumulation is challenging which complicates its use as a water stress index fernÃ¡ndez and cuevas 2010 mencuccini et al 2013 de swaef et al 2015 thus more information on the mechanisms impacting fruit growth is needed to evaluate its use as a water stress indicator and its relation to final yield to the best of our knowledge this constitutes the first study of this type on the olive tree and one of the few in other species because fruit dendrometers are normally used to measure fruit growth in wet or well irrigated orchards but they are not usually used to study fruit growth dynamics provoked by water stress the objective of this work is to study the effect of water stress on fruit growth dynamics of trees in a super high density olive orchard cv arbequina and the water potential gradient between leaves and fruits as a possible mechanism to explain these dynamics to fulfill this objective we established the following aims i to assess changes in fruit growth in response to water stress ii to evaluate the relations between changes in fruit diameter and the gradient of water potential between leaves and fruits and iii to study osmotic adjustments in fruits as a consequence of water availability fruit growth was measured continuously with fruit gauges and the water potential gradient between fruits and leaves was assessed with a view to increase our understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying fruit growth and water relations in the canopy in response to water stress we believe this knowledge is crucial for the development in the future of new deficit irrigation methods based on process based models focused on the improvement of crop water productivity to schedule irrigation and predict yield 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental orchard and irrigation treatments the experiments were performed in a super high density olive orchard olea europaea l cv arbequina located 25 km to the south east of seville spain 37 15 n 5 48 w trees were planted in a configuration of 4 m x 1 5 m 1667 trees ha 1 at the top of 0 4 m high ridges

latter estimated once every two weeks for each plot during the irrigation season measurements were made at dawn with a lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor inc lincoln ne usa following the procedure described by diaz espejo et al 2012 the percentage of sunny to total leaf area was estimated to be 35 according to diaz espejo et al 2002 and fernÃ¡ndez et al 2008 assuming a perfect coupling between

deficit irrigation rdi strategy recommended by fernÃ¡ndez et al 2013 for super high density olive orchards this strategy considers three periods over the course of the olive growing cycle during which the crop is highly sensitive to water stress during these periods irrigation replaced the crop water needs period 1 extended from the final stages of floral development to full bloom second fortnight of april period 2 took place at the end of the first phase of fruit development june and period 3 related to a period of approximately three weeks prior to ripening after the midsummer period of high atmospheric demand from late august to mid september between periods 2 and 3 late june late august the olive tree is highly resistant to drought alegre et al 2002 moriana et al 2003 iniesta et al 2009 fernÃ¡ndez et al 2013 such that irrigation was only applied twice per week amounting to a total of ca 20 in for that period from the end of period 3 to harvesting end of october ca 40 of in was supplied further details on rdi can be found in fernÃ¡ndez et al 2013 and hernandez santana et al 2016 for the experimental period doy 151 296 the total applied irrigation was equal to 3620 95 and 1631 52 mÂ³ ha 1 for the ww and ws treatments respectively ws was 45 of the ww irrigation applied the irrigation system consisted of a single pipe per tree row with three 2 l h 1 drippers per tree spaced 0 5 m apart to assess soil volumetric water content Î¸ m3 m 3 we used a profile probe delta t devices ltd cambridge uk calibrated in situ fernÃ¡ndez et al 2011a b and two access tubes in each plot placed 0 1 and 0 4 m from the drippers and 0 5 m from the tree trunk measurements were performed at the time of maximum g s ca 9 00 gmt at depths of 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 6 and 1 0 m for the calculations of average Î¸ for each treatment a weighted average was calculated for each plot with the measurements from 0 1 to 0 4 m weighted by the percentage of roots and then by a simple average of the averages obtained for each plot 2 2 leaf and fruit water potential leaf water potential Ï leaf and fruit water potential Ï fruit were measured with a scholander type pressure chamber pms instrument company albany oregon usa measurements of Ï leaf were performed every two weeks between day of year doy 151 and 296 i e between may 31 and october 23 measurements of Ï fruit were made on the same days but starting from doy 200 july 19 leaves and fruits were sampled before sunrise predawn and at midday ca 11 00 gmt additional measurements of both Ï leaf and Ï fruit were performed at doy 212 226 228 243 and 256 but only at midday measurements of Ï leaf were made in two leaves per plot n 6 sampled from current year shoots of two central trees from the outer part of the canopy the leaf blade was cut to allow the insertion of the leaf petiole into the pressure chamber for Ï fruit two fruits per plot from the central trees of three plots were sampled n 6 the chosen fruits had a long pedicel ca 2 cm to allow the use of the pressure chamber once the fruits and leaves were excised they were placed in a closed bag with a soaked paper in it with a saturated atmosphere of h2o and co2 to force stomata to close and avoid transpiration to allow the water potential of the sample to equilibrate this bag was introduced in a second zip bag which in turn was introduced in a black plastic bag inside a field fridge with ice containers this sampling method also allowed us to collect all the samples in a very short time reducing the variability among them due to different collecting time preliminary tests were conducted to test that the water potential was not changing significantly for hours leaf water potential and Ï fruit were measured precisely in the laboratory on the afternoon of the sampling days using magnification lens 2 3 fruit growth fruit gauges were installed in one fruit of two representative trees per plot totaling six monitored fruits per treatment we used two types of fruit dendrometers one model was the fi xssf from solfranc solfranc tecnologias sl tarragona spain and the other model was adapted using a linear potentiometer model mm r 10 11 with internal spring return from megatron elektronik gmbh co munich germany coupled to a sensor holder we had 2 of the solfranc fruit dendrometers and four of the megatron fruit dendrometers per treatment the fruit dendrometers recorded fruit equatorial diameter every 5 min with the use of a datalogger cr1000 campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk from the fruit gauge measurements we calculated cumulative fruit growth as the maximum daily diameter of the fruit minus the maximum diameter of the previous day the fruit daily contraction was obtained by subtracting the maximum diameter from the minimum diameter of a certain day which results in negative values the megatron model was already used by morandi et al 2007 to monitor apple fruit diameter presenting useful and relevant data a comparison was performed between the two models of fruit dendrometers aiming at analyzing the similarity of the measured data between each model showing very similar results megatron

the ws treatment were sampled and immediately subjected to rehydration by immersing their petioles into distilled water these leaves were then stored in complete darkness at 2 4 c for 24 h for complete rehydration six fruits from ww plots and 11 fruits from ws plots were sampled from central trees by cutting the pedicel immersed in distilled water and then the fruit was left in distilled water and complete darkness at 2 4 c for 24 h these measurements were conducted on four different days for ws trees august 28 september 14 october 19 and 20 and on two different days for ww trees september 1 and october 19 after rehydration pressure volume pv curves were measured by weighing the tissue leaf or fruit shortly before measuring its water potential Ï with a scholander type pressure chamber pms instrument company albany oregon usa at the start of the curves the increase in pressure was about 0 01 mpa s 1 increasing to 0 1 mpa s 1 for points with Ï more negative than 1 8 mpa after the measurement of the whole pv curve the dry weight of the fruit or leaf was obtained by placing samples for 48 h in a drying oven maintained at 65 c the pv curves for each leaf and fruit were obtained by expressing relative water content rwc versus the respective water potential Ï where values were plotted for 100 rwc against 1 Ï based on these plots the turgor loss point tlp was obtained by the inflection point of the relation 1 Ï vs 100 relative water content providing the water potential and the relative water content at the turgor loss point Ï tlp and rwctlp respectively the calculation of the osmotic potential at saturation Ï Ï100 was performed according to nguyen et al 2017 2 5 calculations and statistical analysis we calculated the average Ï leaf and Ï fruit values for each plot and then a general average and standard error for each treatment with the average for each plot we calculated the difference between Ï leaf and Ï fruit Î´Ï leaf fruit Ï leaf Ï fruit following which the average Î´Ï leaf fruit value and its standard error were calculated for each treatment the same approach was used for data regarding soil water content the vertical bars in graphs represent the standard error of the mean between the three plots of each treatment data for soil volumetric water content leaf and fruit water potential and the indexes calculated by the pv

daily maximum temperatures t max exceeding 30 c on 80 of days fig 1 a precipitation was scarce totaling just 17 62 mm on six days during the 145 day experimental period fig 1b daily crop evapotranspiration etc averaged 3 31 mm from the beginning of the experiment until doy 230 august 18 and decreased thereafter giving an overall average of 2 82 mm for the experimental period fig 1b daily average of vapor pressure deficit d a was around 2 16 kpa before doy 240 august 28 and decreased slightly thereafter for an average value of 1 93 kpa for the experimental period fig 1c of note is the fact that a large number of days had a maximum d a of over 6 kpa which imposed a large demand for transpiration soil volumetric water content Î¸ m3 m 3 in the ws treatment was significantly lower ca 57 lower p 0 05 than the ww treatment between the pit hardening period and the irrigation recovery period from doy 185 to 238 i e from july 4 to august 26 and also after the irrigation recovery period fig 2 3 2 fruit growth and diameter variation the average cumulative fruit growth for the ww treatment was relatively steady during the early part of the experiment with a slope of 0 07 mm d 1 from doy 151 until doy 190 and decreasing thereafter 0 018 mm d 1 until approximately doy 238 fig 3 the fruits from the ws treatment on the other hand exhibited a decrease as evidenced by negative slopes of cumulative fruit growth during the drought period ca doy 190 to 238 and after the irrigation recovery period ca doy 262 to 286 the plot of cumulative fruit growth for the ws treatment had a slope of 0 11 mm d 1 during the pit hardening period ca doy 159 to 185 which was higher than the slope at the same period for the ww treatment the ws treatment also exhibited a high recovery rate at the beginning of the recovery period with a slope of 0 23 mm d 1 between doy 238 and 242 reaching a similar cumulative growth rate to that of fruits in the control irrigation treatment ww 6 02 mm ws 5 70 mm fruits from both treatments grew at similar rate thereafter in agreement with the commented findings a greater daily equatorial diameter contraction was observed for the ws treatment than for the ww treatment fig 4 fruits from the ws treatment exhibited contractions greater than 0 5 mm during most of the period when deficit irrigation was applied ca doy 185 to 238 these contractions followed the irrigation frequency which was programmed to take place twice per week and suggest a close correlation with soil water availability in contrast fruits from the ww treatment exhibited a lower contraction due to their daily irrigation and better water status it is also interesting to note that the contractions of fruits from the ws treatment were lower than those from the ww treatment during the recovery period doy 238 to 262 the daily patterns on a 24 h time scale showed that fruit contraction occurred during the day light hours mainly during the afternoon and its expansion and growth during the evening night fig 5 however in periods of maximum stress ws fruits were able to grow at night only when irrigation occurred showing practically no contraction fig 5b doy 226 and 229 being the fruit expansion the rest of the nights much smaller or not happening at all during the recovery period from doy 238 onward we observed a remarkable growth at nights in ws fruits fig 5d higher than the expansion showed by ww fruits for the same period fig 5c 3 3 water relations between fruits and leaves for the predawn and midday sampling times and in the period when deficit irrigation was applied between period 2 and 3 and after period 3 leaf water potential Ï leaf values for the ws treatment were lower than for the ww treatment with significant differences

treatment were always higher than 2 mpa with a slightly decreasing trend seen over the experimental period midday values of fruit water potential fig 6d ranged from 1 to 2 mpa for the ww treatment and were relatively stable during the measurement period in contrast Ï fruit in ws was lower than 2 mpa in predawn measurements and lower than 3 mpa at midday at times when olive trees were water stressed predawn and midday Ï fruit values during the recovery period period 3 were similar for both treatments the difference between Ï leaf and Ï fruit Î´Ï leaf fruit Ï leaf Ï fruit i e the

values than fruits from the ww treatment these being similar to average Ï tlp values obtained in leaves from the ws treatment 4 discussion 4 1 response of fruit growth to water stress in this work we have studied the fruit leaf water relations in olive trees and their influence on fruit growth although previous studies have extensively researched fruit development jones and higgs 1982 lang 1990 higuchi and sakuratani 2006 greer and rogiers 2009 few have focused on the interaction between water relations of fruits and leaves in the canopy under conditions of water stress greenspan et al 1994 1996 mills et al 1996 pomper and breen 1997 dell amico et al 2012 girÃ³n et al 2015 the results presented here showed significant daily expansion and contraction of fruit diameters in response to both irrigation treatments fig 4 with greater contraction seen for ws than for ww in the period when irrigation for the former was much lower than that for the latter i e between period 2 and 3 and after period 3 contractions usually happened in the afternoon and expansion at nights except for periods of severe water stress when it did not occur fig 5 these increased contractions reflected fluctuations in soil water content as a consequence of the irrigation scheduling used for that treatment in contrast fruit contraction in response to the ww treatment was mainly driven by the high vapor pressure deficit present in the study area fig 1 these daily variations mainly that of daily shrinkage are usually interpreted as elastic variations in tissue volume lechaudel et al 2007 indeed the daily changes of fleshy fruits involves a balance between supply and withdrawal of water via the vascular tissue and losses through transpiration clearwater et al 2012 the observed daily variations in fruit diameters can be interpreted as changes in water flows into and out of the fruit the water stress caused greater fruit contraction during the day light hours within the deficit irrigated period for the ws treatment compared to ww and the recovery at evening night was not enough to increase or maintain the fruit diameter fig 5 causing an apparent negative fruit growth fig 3 under conditions of water stress there is also a limitation of the carbon assimilated due to stomatal closure hernandez santana et al 2018 demonstrated that cumulative fruit growth more specifically biomass accumulation was directly related to accumulated co2 assimilation as other authors have reported matthews and shackel 2005 gÃ©nard et al 2008 cumulative fruit growth is determined by biomass accumulation confirming that co2 assimilation plays a major role in fruit growth together with turgor maintenance further studies to examine the effect of water and photoassimilate relationships between fruits and leaves on fruit growth would help greatly to increase our understanding of fruit growth mechanisms although ws fruits were growing at a higher rate than ww fruits in the beginning likely due to natural variability the drop in the cumulative fruit growth was relevant compared to ww however even after that significant growth stop the studied ws trees recovered quickly showing the daily pattern almost no contraction in some fruits during the afternoon fig 5 such that the final fruit diameter of ws trees became similar to that of fruits from olive trees subjected to the ww treatment fig 3 similar to what we found in the same orchard for several years hernandez santana et al 2017 2018 it is likely that the full irrigation applied during the critical stage of pit hardening when most of the cell division and size are defined hammami et al 2011 helped to reduce differences between water treatments these results support the irrigation strategy used in this work since water use was reduced and a similar final fruit growth was achieved 4 2 water relations between fruits and leaves under water stress we identified positive Î´Ï leaf fruit values fig 6 similar to that of girÃ³n et al 2015 although they measured smaller water potential gradients in the study by dell amico et al 2012 which was conducted in the same trees as those used by girÃ³n el al 2015 44 year old table olive trees cv manzanillo even smaller gradients were reported and in most cases the gradient was negative leaf water potential was lower than fruit water potential in both studies both leaf and fruit water potentials were higher than values measured in our study indicating that the water stress was more severe in our study which could explain the greater water potential gradients between leaves and fruits indeed in the present work where less stressful conditions prevailed at the end of the summer more frequent irrigation and lower evaporative demand the water potential gradient became smaller and closer to zero particularly for midday measurements they studied a different cultivar manzanilla than in this study which may help to explain also these differences the two aforementioned studies dell amico et al 2012 girÃ³n et al 2015 did not report continuous measurements of fruit growth as in our study thus making it more difficult to interpret how Î´Ï leaf fruit affected fruit growth in dell amico et al 2012 fruit size was measured two times during the study with a larger fruit size measured in stressed than in control trees in girÃ³n et al 2015 which reported results more in line with ours fruit volume was measured regularly 13 times in 110 days and they observed also a fruit volume decrease at the end of the water stress period with their data they could conclude that water stress provoked that fruit was a stronger water sink than leaf however we demonstrated with our concomitant measurements of fruit growth dynamics figs 3 and 5 and leaf fruit water potentials fig 6 that even according to the leaf fruit water potentials the fruit would be a stronger water sink the reduction of the fruit growth diameter may be explained by an imbalance in water discharge refilling processes which in turn may lead to a depletion of water reserves in fruit exposed to water stress this gradient towards the fruit may help olive fruits to recover growth quickly after stress compared to other temperate fruit species where fruit have less negative water potentials than leaves greenspan et al 1996 morandi et al 2010 2011a c thus the study of water sink relationships between fruits and leaves would benefit greatly from the continuous monitoring of fruit growth in addition to water potential measurements although this and the mentioned works dell amico et al 2012 girÃ³n et al 2015 were conducted comparing the water potentials of leaves and fruits fruit vascular flows are driven usually by the water potential gradient between the stem and the fruit thus stem water potential would be a more direct measurement influencing fruit water potential changes and their effects on fruit growth and daily shrinkage 4 3 effect of canopy water relations on fruit growth as fruits and leaves can be considered as competing sinks for water it has been assumed that the difference between fruit and leaf water potential determines the directionality of water exchange between the fruit and the parent plant matthews and shackel 2005 thus the positive Î´Ï leaf fruit observed during maximum water stress would indicate water flow into the fruit from the parent tree in this study this phenomenon did take place in ww trees but the greatest positive Î´Ï leaf fruit measured in ws trees fig 6 coincided with times of fruit contractions in these same trees fig 3 indeed the greatest positive Î´Ïleaf fruit during ws occurred when the highest fruit contractions were observed the enhanced fruit contraction along with positive Î´Ï leaf fruit could be explained by an insufficient water flow into the fruit to balance fruit transpiration under water deficit conditions greenspan et al 1994 1996 water entering the fruit can be used for growth evaporation or subsequently a reverse flow to other tissues the idea of sustained reverse flows from fruits to other tissues has been challenged clearwater et al 2012 and it has been hypothesized that this probably occurs only as a transient morning reversal in sap flow higuchi and sakuratani 2006 clearwater et al 2009 or when plants undergo severe water stress greenspan et al 1996 clearwater et al 2012 thus fruit transpiration together with a reduced fruit water inflow with water stress may be the most likely explanation for negative fruit growth as reported for other species greenspan et al 1994 1996 morandi et al 2007 greer and rogiers 2009 clearwater et al 2012 and especially in our case where Î´Ï leaf fruit was positive the lack of correlation between leaf water potential and fruit contraction in ws trees fig 7 may be considered as circumstantial evidence of a high resistance to flow from the parent tree to fruit which could have resulted in impaired xylem water exchange in ws trees in ww however the relationship between leaf water status and fruit contractions was robust and significant a change in the relative importance of xylem phloem flows matthews and shackel 2005 as water stress develops may help to explain the lack of correlation between fruits and Ï leaf in ws trees as fruits would have had less influence from xylem Ï leaf this phenomenon has also been described to occur towards the end of fruit development as fruits become stronger sinks for water and carbohydrates mills et al 1996 in addition fruit transpiration has been reported to be relatively independent of stomatal regulation greenspan et al 1994 fishman and gÃ©nard 1998 montanaro et al 2012 depending mainly on cuticular transpiration driven by vapor pressure deficit morandi et al 2007 montanaro et al 2012 this would result in a higher fruit transpiration on those days with remarkable a high atmospheric demand and again more independent of Ïleaf than leaf transpiration the greater importance of phloem compared to xylem flow could also help to explain the osmotic adjustment observed in ws fruits table 1 towards the end of the season matthews and shackel 2005 as this mechanism relies on the accumulation of solutes within the cells under water stress these results indicate that leaf fruit water potential measurements alone may not be sufficient to study competitiveness for water in the canopy as such fruit gauges could serve a useful role to help elucidate the water status and daily dynamics of fruit growth and to establish deficit irrigation practices indeed fruit growth is a sensitive water stress indicator as demonstrated here with a remarkable capacity of recovery and importantly it is directly related to plant function and yield these characteristics make fruit growth tracking a good candidate to schedule deficit irrigation but more work is needed before it can be used with that purpose 5 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this report marks the first attempt to measure fruit growth dynamics continuously in olive trees and to evaluate the role of water potential gradients between fruits and leaves on those dynamics at the same time we confirm that olive fruit growth is sensitive to water stress and shows a remarkable capacity to recover following the irrigation strategy employed here our results also indicate that the study of water sink relationships between fruits and leaves would benefit greatly from the continuous monitoring of fruit growth in addition to water potential measurements as a progressive decoupling of fruit water status from leaves can arise as water stress progresses we conclude that the imbalance in water discharge refilling processes may lead to a depletion of water reserves in fruit exposed to water stress and accordingly to a net reduction in fruit diameter tracking fruit growth could serve as a promising approach to schedule regulated deficit irrigation enabling determination of the level of water stress that fruit can experience without affecting the recovery of their full size while using less water in the process moreover fruit growth is a highly relevant variable to measure because of its relationship to fruit yield while more work is needed to fully evaluate the usefulness of fruit gauges to schedule regulated deficit irrigation these results can be considered a first step towards achieving that purpose the information provided by the fruit dendrometers could be integrated in increasingly used mechanistic models to schedule irrigation and predict yield for different environmental conditions management approaches and cultivars future work should also consider the effect of biomass along with water accumulation and their relation to leaf water status

11304,heavy rainfall becomes more variable and erratic in the subtropical areas increasing unpredictable risks of soil erosion and nutrient losses on the sloping farmland soil management practice also plays an important role in soil erosion however the effects of management practices on soil erosion and nutrient losses in response to heavy rainfall remain uncertain a field study was carried out under natural rainfalls including five treatments bare land as control ck downslope tillage dt hedgerows with downslope tillage dt hg contour ridge tillage ct and straw mulch sm the effects of management measures on runoff depth sediment yield and nutrient losses were evaluated during peanut growth the results indicated that heavy rainfalls caused severer soil erosion and nutrient losses significantly reduced runoff and sediment loss were found in all the conservation measures p 0 05 compared with ck the runoff depths under dt dt hg ct and sm were reduced by 10 37 49 and 81 respectively under heavy rainfalls in addition sediment loss under dt dt hg ct and sm were 30 81 7 42 1 83 and 1 34 mg ha 1 respectively these values were 42 86 97 and 97 lower than that for ck respectively tn and tp losses were mainly controlled by sediment yield the majority of nutrient losses occurred in the particulate fraction 93 of tn and 99 of tp generally much of the tn and tp were transported by the particles 0 05 mm over 51 of tn was transported by fractions of 0 05 mm in ck and dt sediments under heavy rainfalls in ct and sm this percentage increased to 61 and 74 respectively the findings indicated that straw mulch is the most cost effective management measure to control soil and nutrient losses in sloping farmland of southern china keywords soil management measures sloping farmland sediment transport nutrient losses heavy rainfall 1 introduction soil erosion caused by water is a significant cause of land degradation and productivity declines around the world fang et al 2017 prosdocimi et al 2017 rodrigo et al 2016 wei et al 2017 approximately 751 million ha of land worldwide is affected by moderate to severe water erosion processes lal 2004 it may cause the detachment or redistribution of soil particles in the topsoil layer and lead to adverse impacts to the downstream quinton et al 2010 jarvie et al 2013 lÃ³pez et al 2016 water and sediments transported by water erosion contain various nutrients removed from the soil such as nitrogen and phosphorus which are regarded as the principal nutrients causing eutrophication xu et al 2013 the loss of excessive nutrients in agricultural areas reduces soil fertility furthermore the quality of water resources is being progressively degraded bertol et al 2003 baptista et al 2015 accelerated soil water and nutrient losses are attributed to intense cultivation inappropriate agricultural soil and water managements and erratic rainfalls rainfall runoff generation and the related soil erosion are extremely dynamic and complex processes which are affected by many factors many studies have proved that rainfall characteristics e g rainfall intensity duration pattern and rainfall energy and soil management practices are the two primary factors influencing runoff generation and soil erosion truman et al 2007 girmay et al 2009 shipitalo et al 2013 wang et al 2014 among these factors heavy rainfalls in particular play important roles in causing severe soil erosion and nutrient loss for example studies have showed that the annual nitrogen and phosphorus loss under extremely heavy rainfall exceeded 50 of the total loss amount gao et al 2005 the temporal distribution of heavy rainfalls is particularly important for assessing runoff and erosion rate apaydin et al 2006 wei et al 2007 also found that rainfall patterns with high intensity short duration and high frequency were the dominant causes of runoff and sediment there is no doubt that the variability of natural rainfall will increase the complexity and uncertainty of runoff generation and erosion process extreme rainfall variability characterized by large precipitation high rainfall intensity few rainfall events and poor temporal distribution exert a direct impact on soil and water holding capacity and associated nutrient levels brouder and volenec 2008 however the deep rainfall runoff erosion relation is also greatly regulated by soil management practices mchugh et al 2007 lanckriet et al 2012 dagnew et al 2015 many studies have confirmed that various runoff and erosion responses occur under different soil management practices studies mostly focus on the effects of different management practices such as conservation tillage hÃ¶sl and strauss 2016 tied ridges ngetich et al 2014 mulching okeyo et al 2014 grum et al 2017 hedgerow systems kinama et al 2007 lin et al 2009 xia et al 2013 on runoff generation and erosion processes they concluded that application of appropriate management measures can be the key in reducing runoff and sediment loss these management practices can intercept rainfall reduce raindrop energy improve infiltration of rainwater enhance soil fertility and trap sediment compared to the conventional practices for example cropping studies in semi arid kenya conducted by kinama et al 2007 found that hedgerows with mulch successfully reduced soil loss from just over 100 to only 2 mg ha 1 and runoff from just below 100 20 mm grum et al 2017 carried out field experiment during the rainy seasons in arid and semi arid environments and their findings showed that tied ridges or straw mulch significantly reduced runoff by 56 and 53 respectively and improved soil moisture content ngetich et al 2014 investigated the consequences of selected tillage practices on runoff and sediment loss under semi arid and sub humid environments their findings reported that tied ridging was the most efficient measure in reducing runoff and sediment yield in the semi arid region although lots of studies have reported the effectiveness of various management measures on runoff and sediment reduction in different climatic zones pan et al 2010 baptista et al 2015 donjadee and tingsanchali 2016 few studies have actually linked these measures to rainfall variabilities particularly when experiencing heavy rainfalls due to well developed monsoon in the red soil region of southern china heavy rainfall characterized by high rainfall intensity and high precipitation amounts occurs frequently which can lead to severer consequences of soil and water loss and further land degradation however the potential of management measures in combating soil erosion and nutrient loss under heavy rainfall remains unclear understanding the efficacy of selected measures on reducing runoff sediment and associated nutrient loss is essential for developing further policies for soil and water conservation in the humid subtropical environments of southern china hence the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the effects of soil management measures on controlling soil erosion in the red soil region of southern china 2 to investigate the effects of management measures on reducing nutrients loss under heavy rainfalls 3 to select the optimal measures for soil and water conservation in the area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the field experiment was conducted in the jiangxi eco science park of soil and water conservation which is located in the yangou watershed in de an county of jiangxi province 115 42 38 to 115 43 06 e 29 16 37 to 29 17 40 n this region is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate zone with an average temperature of 16 7 c annually the mean annual precipitation is 1350 9 mm which is distributed unevenly through the year with 70 of the total precipitation occurring from april to september the more intense rainfall during the rainy season has led to severe soil erosion and nutrient loss in arable sloping land the topography is generally characterized by low hills with elevations of 30 100 m the slope across the area varies from 5 to 25 the crop rotation of winter rapeseed brassica napus and summer peanut arachis hypogaea accounts for the use of sloping farmland in this district the dominant soil type of the region is red clay soil formed by the decomposition of quaternary sediments liu et al 2016 the soil has a depth of approximately 50 cm 150 cm with a ph of 6 67 and organic carbon matter of 8 64 g kg 1 the total nitrogen tn concentration total phosphorus tp concentration and total potassium tk concentration in the soil tillage layer are 0 55 g kg 1 0 31 g kg 1 15 87 g kg 1 respectively the soil contains approximately 18 34 sand 2 0 05 mm 65 60 silt 0 05 0 002 mm and 16 06 clay 0 002 mm the soil bulk density is 1 13 1 52 g cm 3 in the 0 20 cm layer and 1 18 1 72 g cm 3 in 20 40 cm soil culturing layer 2 2 experimental design and agricultural practices the field experiment was designed with five treatments bare land as control ck downslope tillage dt downslope tillage with two hedgerows of daylily hemerocallis citrina planted in contour dt hg contour ridge tillage ct and straw mulch sm fig 1 each treatment was arranged in three 20 m long 5 m wide in situ runoff plots which were installed on a 10 slope cement walls inserted vertically 30 cm into the soil and 20 cm above the soil surface on each side of the plots were established to disconnect adjacent plots and avoid hydrological interferences to collect the runoff and sediments under rainfall events a trench and two runoff collection tanks were constructed at the bottom of each plot a water level gauge installed in each tank was used to record the runoff volume for each event all the treatments were fertilized with 300 kg ha 1 of urea containing n 46 4 600 kg ha 1 of mineral fertilizers containing p2o5 12 and water soluble p 18 and 2 25 kg ha 1 for potassium chloride containing k2o 60 for each plot before planting on may 4 peanuts were seeded at 0 3 m row spacing on may 6 on june 14 the remaining n fertilizer with urea of 300 kg ha 1 was applied to each plot the peanuts were harvested on august 22 observations were conducted during the entire peanut growth period the cropping system and cultivated practices were applied in accordance with the local typical agricultural management in the red soil region of southern china 2 3 sample collection and laboratory analysis precipitation was measured by an automatic meteorological station 20 m from the experimental plots the key characteristics of rainfall including duration h mean intensity mm h 1 maximum intensity in 30 min mm h 1 and daily rainfall amount mm were recorded rainfalls are classified into six different patterns based on the rainfall variation in daily precipitation table 1 heavy rainfall refers to the rainfall event with total precipitation in 24 h ranging from 50 to 99 9 mm the runoff volume of each runoff event was measured by multiplying the water level in the tank by the base area of the tank the runoff depth was calculated as runoff divided by the area of experimental plots after each rainfall event a runoff sample mixed with sediments was collected in a plastic bottle to measure the sediment concentration by drying in an oven to constant weight at 105 c the sediment loss of each rainfall event was calculated by multiplying the runoff volume and sediment concentration another runoff water sample was collected in a 500 ml plastic bottle and immediately taken to the laboratory and stored at 4 c with 0 5 ml of 98 h2so4 which was added to avoid microbial activity the water samples were filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m membrane for chemical analysis the tn and tp concentration of each runoff sample were analyzed by alkaline potassium persulfate oxidation ultraviolet spectrophotometry and ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric methods respectively lu 2000 all the sediment samples of each plot were collected and then transported immediately to laboratory for physical and chemical analyses sediment samples of 200 g were air dried to determine the tn and tp in the sediments other suspended sediments were wet sieved through a nest of sieves with 0 25 and 0 05 mm openings the fractions of 0 05 mm were collected to determine the silt and clay sized percentage using hydrometer method arriaga et al 2006 the sediments that remained on each screen were transferred to a large dry beaker the samples were dried at 50 c and then weighed after measuring the undispersed particle size distributions samples were classified into three sediment size fractions a 0 25 mm b 0 05 0 25 mm and c 0 05 mm to analyze the level of tn and tp in different size fractions of sediment tn and tp concentration of each size fraction was measured by the kjeldahl method and molybdenum blue colorimetric method bao 2000 the nutrient losses in different sediment size fractions were calculated by multiplying nutrient concentrations and the corresponding sediment content of each size fraction the nutrient flux of sediments q kg ha 1 were converted to area based on the following equation 1 q 10 6 cimpi s where ci mg kg 1 represents the nutrient concentration of sediment in i size fraction m kg represents sediment yield pi represents the percentage of i size fraction in sediments and s ha represents the area of the runoff plot 2 4 statistical analysis all statistics were analyzed by ibm spss statistics 21 0 and originpro 2016 the kolmogorov smirnov test showed that the data were normally or log normally distributed one way anova was used to assess the effects of treatments on the measured variables duncan s test was used to identify the significant differences among the treatments at a significance level of p 0 05 rainfall was plotted against runoff and regression line were fitted by least square method multiple stepwise linear regression was used to quantify the effects of rainfall characteristics and runoff on soil and nutrient loss for each treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 heavy rainfall events selection the depths of erosive rainfall during the experiment varied highly among events ranging from 10 0 mm to 385 0 mm table 2 the total rainfall recorded was 955 7 mm according to the classification standard of precipitation grade of precipitation 2012 four heavy rainfall events were selected for further analyses including rainfall events on june 1 3 june 15 june 30 to july 5 and july 15 the maximum intensity in 30 min of these heavy rainfalls all exceeded 30 mm h 1 the rainfall depths under heavy rainfalls were 666 4 mm accounting for 70 of the total rainfalls eight moderate rainfall events and four large rainfall events only contributed 30 of the total rainfalls heavy rainfall played a key role in soil and water loss 3 2 runoff and sediment yield the runoff and sediment loss showed large variations among different rainfall events throughout peanut growth figs 2 and 3 heavy rainfalls were the major causes of runoff and sediment loss in all treatments fig 4 in the ck plots runoff depth and sediment yield under heavy rainfalls were respectively 170 57 mm and 53 23 mg ha 1 which accounted for 86 and 87 of the total runoff depth and total sediment yield during the experimental period in the dt treatment heavy rainfalls contributed to 90 of the total runoff and 86 of the total sediment loss the proportions of heavy rainfalls in runoff depth and sediment yield were on average 95 and 92 respectively under dt hg ct and sm treatments runoff depth was significantly p 0 05 lower in all measures compared with the control fig 4a total runoff depth was highest and lowest in ck 199 20 mm and sm 34 61 mm respectively in general the effectiveness of downslope tillage practice at reducing runoff was the lowest among all measures the runoff depth of the dt treatments under heavy rainfalls was reduced only by 10 compared with ck dt hg and ct significantly p 0 05 decreased the runoff by 37 and 49 respectively compared with ck under heavy rainfalls no significant differences were showed in runoff depths between dt hg and ct treatments straw mulch was most effective at reducing runoff loss the runoff reduction rate of sm compared with ck reached to 81 under heavy rainfalls soil management measures also had significant effects on sediment loss fig 4b the sediment yield were the highest in the control with total amounts of 61 38 mg ha 1 sediment losses were significantly p 0 05 lower in all measures than in the control sediment losses were lowest in sm but showed no significant difference from the losses in dt hg and ct treatments dt 42 and sm 97 reduced sediment yields the least and most respectively under heavy rainfalls fig 4b the sediment yields of the dt hg and ct treatments were significantly p 0 05 decreased by 86 and 96 respectively compared with ck under heavy rainfalls it was found that the sediment reduction by management measures was more effective under heavy rainfalls compared with runoff reduction 3 3 nitrogen and phosphorus loss along with runoff and sediment loss the associated nutrients were also lost heavy rainfalls contributed to 88 97 of the total dissolved n and 78 97 of the total dissolved p losses in all treatments the export of tn and tp in runoff was different among the five treatments fig 5 the tn and tp losses in the runoff were the highest under the ck plots with total amounts of 4 09 kg ha 1 and 0 36 kg ha 1 respectively the efficiencies of reductions for the measures ranged between 4 and 88 for tn and ranged between 26 and 91 for tp in runoff under heavy rainfalls the dt treatments caused more dissolved tn losses than ck under heavy rainfalls no significant differences were observed in dissolved tn losses between ck and dt treatments dt significantly p 0 05 decreased dissolved tp losses by 26 under heavy rainfalls sm reduced the loss of both tn and tp in runoff the most by 88 and 91 respectively under heavy rainfalls nutrient losses were generally higher for n than for p sediments were the major carriers of nutrients tn and tp losses in the sediments were much higher than that in runoff water in all treatments ranging from 0 75 kg ha 1 to 38 58 kg ha 1 and 0 64 kg ha 1 to 26 75 kg ha 1 respectively the management measures had significant effects on tn and tp losses in the sediments sediment associated n and p losses were significantly p 0 05 lower in all measures than in the control dt and dt hg decreased tn and tp losses in the sediment by 43 and 86 respectively under heavy rainfalls no significant differences were observed in tn and tp losses between ct and sm treatments the reduction in tn and tp losses by ct and sm were up to 97 averagely under heavy rainfalls 3 4 sediment size distribution and associated nutrients adsorption sediment characteristics and associated nutrients concentration under heavy rainfalls were analyzed to investigate the sediment transport potential of different measures results showed that the different treatments resulted in different undispersed sediment size distribution table 3 in general the proportions of particles 0 25 mm were the highest in the control among all treatments accounting for 26 averagely there were no significant differences between dt and ct in sediment size distribution dt and ct were less effective at decreasing the quantity of larger particles in the sediments dt hg and sm treatments significantly p 0 05 decreased the percentage of coarse fractions 0 25 mm by 39 and 56 respectively meanwhile fine particles of 0 05 mm accounted for the largest proportions of sm and dt hg sediments with an average of 72 and 62 respectively the distribution of nutrients in sediments also varied with size classes and management measures nutrients were distributed unevenly among different size classes results show that tn and tp were generally greatest in the 0 05 mm size class for all the treatments for ck and dt plots often twice as much tn and tp were in 0 05 mm size class than in other two size classes the particles of 0 05 mm contributed over 70 to the tn losses in dt hg and sm treatments the proportions of 0 05 mm fractions in tp losses were relatively lower than that in tn losses under dt hg and sm plots with a median of 64 and 50 respectively although the management measures did not affect tn and tp concentration distribution patterns with smaller particles having greater concentrations than larger particles management measures did affect the proportion of nutrients associated with different size sediments by influencing changes in the sediment size distribution these changes in sediment size distribution could have a strong effect on nutrient transport risk finer sediments easily transported with runoff water could result in downstream water quality problems 4 discussion our study indicates that heavy rainfall events were responsible for the majority of seasonal water erosion four heavy rainfall events produced 86 of the total runoff and 87 of the total sediment yield in the control the runoff under heavy rainfalls varied between 31 93 mm and 170 57 mm with sediment yield from 1 34 mg ha 1 to 53 23 mg ha 1 fig 4 these runoff values are much higher than the results from other studies conducted in the region for example chen et al 2015 reported a total runoff of 15 87 mm in the control during the soybean growth season the differences could be attributed to the high variability of rainfalls in our study period the results reconfirmed the destructive effect of heavy rainfall on water erosion reported in previous studies gao et al 2005 mohamadi and kavian 2015 wei et al 2010 also reported only a few of rainfall events were important for severe soil and water loss for instance 64 1 of the total annual sediment loss was caused by the rainfall event occurred on 8th july meanwhile the key periods for heavy rainfall to occur are june and july more attention should be paid to the most sensitive rainy season when soil erosion potentials are much higher furthermore in order to control severe soil erosion caused by heavy rainfall more successfully other combined measures such as grass buffer and grass waterway should be taken into account many researches have reported the relationship between rainfall runoff and sediment loss mathys et al 2005 wang et al 2010 linear power or exponential correlations have been used to describe these relationships field experiment conducted by liu et al 2012 reported that the relationship between rainfall and runoff could be positively exponential in our study regression analysis shows that rainfall was significant p 0 05 and positively correlated with runoff for each treatment fig 7 previous studies reported that linear correlation was observed between runoff and sediment loss kothyari et al 2004 zhang 2016 however stepwise regression analysis shows that sediment loss was the result of rainfall and runoff table 4 sediment loss was affected by runoff and rainfall intensity under contour ridge tillage and control factors influencing sediment loss were different among various treatments sediment yield was significantly positive correlated with runoff under downslope tillage and hedges along with runoff and sediment loss nutrient removal also occurs which eventually deposits in depressions or further downstream in rivers lakes and reservoirs figs 5 and 6 showed the nutrients loss loads in the control were the highest among all the treatments soil management measures could enhance the soil nutrients availability and reduce nutrient losses results showed that sediments were the major carriers of nutrients in our study up to 73 of n and 94 of p were transported with the eroded sediments averagely among treatments and events for the reductions of nitrogen and phosphorus losses no significant correlations were observed with rainfall intensities especially under heavy rainfall events the nutrient content is the result of many complex interactions for example nutrient transport depends on the amount and intensity of runoff fluxes hong and li 2011 the content of nutrient in the soil also varies with the time and amount of fertilizer applied cheng et al 2008 in our study the effectiveness of management measures on decreasing nutrient losses compared with the control was mainly associated with the reduction of sediment loss the multiple stepwise regression results showed that the total nitrogen and phosphorus loss were controlled by sediment loss tables 5 and 6 positive linear correlations were found between nutrient loss and sediment yield this result was consistent with other findings where nutrient loss was principally related to the amounts of runoff and sediment loss ali et al 2007 zougmorÃ© et al 2009 baptista et al 2015 however in disagreement with our results girmay et al 2009 observed a negative logarithmic relationship between sediment yield and sediment associated nutrient they suggested that rainfall with low intensity was more important for nutrient rich sediment loss the differences may be attributed to the different rainfall intensities in two studies sediment properties also have dramatic effects on the nutrient transport the results showed that nutrients were enriched in the fractions of 0 05 mm particles similar phenomenon is reported by barbosa et al 2009 who found the phosphorus contents in the sediments reduced with the size of eroded sediments increased the removal of nutrients by water erosion is selective because finer particles can absorb large amounts of nutrients due to their greater specific surface areas issa et al 2006 zhang 2016 and are more easily transported in runoff water management measures also influence the nutrient concentrations in different sediment size fractions hedgerows and straw mulch are more efficient to trap coarser particles on the plots compared with downslope and contour tillage thus our results suggest that management measures combined with additional off site techniques should be applied to reduce downstream water contamination in the sloping farmland of southern china soil management measures are effective in reducing water erosion thereby decreasing nutrient losses straw mulch is most effective at controlling water erosion which significantly decreased runoff and sediment yield by 81 and 97 respectively under heavy rainfalls effectiveness of straw mulch in managing soil water and nutrient loss arises from protection provided against splash erosion mulch provides a buffer for rain drops and increases water infiltration during heavy rainfall liu et al 2016 also reported that mulching with grass significantly decrease runoff by 93 compared with bare land in red soil region an increase in water erosion and nutrient loss is caused by downslope tillage compared to contour ridge tillage figs 4 and 5 relatively lower effectiveness of downslope tillage in reducing runoff and sediment loss was also found in other researches quinton and catt 2004 barbosa et al 2009 the effectiveness of downslope tillage on runoff reduction is more sensitive to heavy rainfalls with only 10 of runoff was reduced by downslope tillage compared with the control contour ridges across the slope can form barriers that trap the sediments in runoff water and increase water storage and thus influencing the nutrients level in water and eroded sediments liu et al 2014 2016 49 of runoff and 97 of sediments were reduced by contour ridge tillage under heavy rainfalls compared with the control fig 2 this result is consistent with previous findings for instance grum et al 2017 reported that runoff in the tied ridges was significantly reduced by 65 compared with normal agricultural practices without treatment reduced soil water and nutrient losses by hedgerows could be attributed to increased hydraulic resistance of runoff and soil deposition under contour hedgerows practice and reshaped micro topography of the slope blanco canqui et al 2004 ma et al 2013 pan et al 2010 the findings are in agreement with that of fan et al 2015 who reported that surface runoff and erosion with hedgerow systems was much lower than that from the control however hedgerow combined with downslope tillage in our study area also showed a lower reduction rate of runoff and soil loss compared with contour ridges downslope and contour ridge tillage are labor intensive and expensive 6000 rmb per hectare to construct require costly maintenance straw mulch and hedgerows are relatively inexpensive and demand little extra labor compared to agricultural tillage with the labor cost of 5250 rmb per hectare however our study failed to analyze the social acceptance and profits of straw mulch and hedgerows in the study area some studies have investigated the effect of different mulching rates jordÃ¡n et al 2010 donjadee and tingsanchali 2016 and hedgerow species lin et al 2009 lenka et al 2012 on water erosion in the farmlands further researches are needed to evaluate an optimal rate of mulching application and explore the most cost effective hedgerow species in terms of soil erosion and nutrient loss control 5 conclusions in a field observation experiment we investigated the performance of different soil management measures downslope tillage hedgerows with downslope tillage contour ridge tillage and straw mulch the results showed that heavy rainfalls caused severer hydrological and erosional destruction during the rainy summer season during peanut growth 93 of the total runoff and 90 of the total sediments came from heavy rainfall events all management measures effectively reduced runoff sediment yield and nutrient losses the runoff depth was positively correlated with rainfall amount in all treatments compared with ck the runoff depths under heavy rainfalls for dt dt hr ct and sm were reduced by 10 37 49 and 81 respectively sediment yields were reduced by 42 86 97 and 97 respectively tn and tp losses were mainly associated with eroded sediments 93 of tn and 99 of tp were transported with sediments these findings provide important implications for combating soil erosion and nutrient losses caused by heavy rainfall we conclude that straw mulch is the most cost effective management measure to mitigate soil erosion and nutrient losses from the sloping farmland in the red soil region of southern china acknowledgments financial support for this study was provided by the special fund for agro scientific research in the public interest of china no 201503106 and national natural science foundation of china no 41571266 
11304,heavy rainfall becomes more variable and erratic in the subtropical areas increasing unpredictable risks of soil erosion and nutrient losses on the sloping farmland soil management practice also plays an important role in soil erosion however the effects of management practices on soil erosion and nutrient losses in response to heavy rainfall remain uncertain a field study was carried out under natural rainfalls including five treatments bare land as control ck downslope tillage dt hedgerows with downslope tillage dt hg contour ridge tillage ct and straw mulch sm the effects of management measures on runoff depth sediment yield and nutrient losses were evaluated during peanut growth the results indicated that heavy rainfalls caused severer soil erosion and nutrient losses significantly reduced runoff and sediment loss were found in all the conservation measures p 0 05 compared with ck the runoff depths under dt dt hg ct and sm were reduced by 10 37 49 and 81 respectively under heavy rainfalls in addition sediment loss under dt dt hg ct and sm were 30 81 7 42 1 83 and 1 34 mg ha 1 respectively these values were 42 86 97 and 97 lower than that for ck respectively tn and tp losses were mainly controlled by sediment yield the majority of nutrient losses occurred in the particulate fraction 93 of tn and 99 of tp generally much of the tn and tp were transported by the particles 0 05 mm over 51 of tn was transported by fractions of 0 05 mm in ck and dt sediments under heavy rainfalls in ct and sm this percentage increased to 61 and 74 respectively the findings indicated that straw mulch is the most cost effective management measure to control soil and nutrient losses in sloping farmland of southern china keywords soil management measures sloping farmland sediment transport nutrient losses heavy rainfall 1 introduction soil erosion caused by water is a significant cause of land degradation and productivity declines around the world fang et al 2017 prosdocimi et al 2017 rodrigo et al 2016 wei et al 2017 approximately 751 million ha of land worldwide is affected by moderate to severe water erosion processes lal 2004 it may cause the detachment or redistribution of soil particles in the topsoil layer and lead to adverse impacts to the downstream quinton et al 2010 jarvie et al 2013 lÃ³pez et al 2016 water and sediments transported by water erosion contain various nutrients removed from the soil such as nitrogen and phosphorus which are regarded as the principal nutrients causing eutrophication xu et al 2013 the loss of excessive nutrients in agricultural areas reduces soil fertility furthermore the quality of water resources is being progressively degraded bertol et al 2003 baptista et al 2015 accelerated soil water and nutrient losses are attributed to intense cultivation inappropriate agricultural soil and water managements and erratic rainfalls rainfall runoff generation and the related soil erosion are extremely dynamic and complex processes which are affected by many factors many studies have proved that rainfall characteristics e g rainfall intensity duration pattern and rainfall energy and soil management practices are the two primary factors influencing runoff generation and soil erosion truman et al 2007 girmay et al 2009 shipitalo et al 2013 wang et al 2014 among these factors heavy rainfalls in particular play important roles in causing severe soil erosion and nutrient loss for example studies have showed that the annual nitrogen and phosphorus loss under extremely heavy rainfall exceeded 50 of the total loss amount gao et al 2005 the temporal distribution of heavy rainfalls is particularly important for assessing runoff and erosion rate apaydin et al 2006 wei et al 2007 also found that rainfall patterns with high intensity short duration and high frequency were the dominant causes of runoff and sediment there is no doubt that the variability of natural rainfall will increase the complexity and uncertainty of runoff generation and erosion process extreme rainfall variability characterized by large precipitation high rainfall intensity few rainfall events and poor temporal distribution exert a direct impact on soil and water holding capacity and associated nutrient levels brouder and volenec 2008 however the deep rainfall runoff erosion relation is also greatly regulated by soil management practices mchugh et al 2007 lanckriet et al 2012 dagnew et al 2015 many studies have confirmed that various runoff and erosion responses occur under different soil management practices studies mostly focus on the effects of different management practices such as conservation tillage hÃ¶sl and strauss 2016 tied ridges ngetich et al 2014 mulching okeyo et al 2014 grum et al 2017 hedgerow systems kinama et al 2007 lin et al 2009 xia et al 2013 on runoff generation and erosion processes they concluded that application of appropriate management measures can be the key in reducing runoff and sediment loss these management practices can intercept rainfall reduce raindrop energy improve infiltration of rainwater enhance soil fertility and trap sediment compared to the conventional practices for example cropping studies in semi arid kenya conducted by kinama et al 2007 found that hedgerows with mulch successfully reduced soil loss from just over 100 to only 2 mg ha 1 and runoff from just below 100 20 mm grum et al 2017 carried out field experiment during the rainy seasons in arid and semi arid environments and their findings showed that tied ridges or straw mulch significantly reduced runoff by 56 and 53 respectively and improved soil moisture content ngetich et al 2014 investigated the consequences of selected tillage practices on runoff and sediment loss under semi arid and sub humid environments their findings reported that tied ridging was the most efficient measure in reducing runoff and sediment yield in the semi arid region although lots of studies have reported the effectiveness of various management measures on runoff and sediment reduction in different climatic zones pan et al 2010 baptista et al 2015 donjadee and tingsanchali 2016 few studies have actually linked these measures to rainfall variabilities particularly when experiencing heavy rainfalls due to well developed monsoon in the red soil region of southern china heavy rainfall characterized by high rainfall intensity and high precipitation amounts occurs frequently which can lead to severer consequences of soil and water loss and further land degradation however the potential of management measures in combating soil erosion and nutrient loss under heavy rainfall remains unclear understanding the efficacy of selected measures on reducing runoff sediment and associated nutrient loss is essential for developing further policies for soil and water conservation in the humid subtropical environments of southern china hence the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the effects of soil management measures on controlling soil erosion in the red soil region of southern china 2 to investigate the effects of management measures on reducing nutrients loss under heavy rainfalls 3 to select the optimal measures for soil and water conservation in the area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the field experiment was conducted in the jiangxi eco science park of soil and water conservation which is located in the yangou watershed in de an county of jiangxi province 115 42 38 to 115 43 06 e 29 16 37 to 29 17 40 n this region is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate zone with an average temperature of 16 7 c annually the mean annual precipitation is 1350 9 mm which is distributed unevenly through the year with 70 of the total precipitation occurring from april to september the more intense rainfall during the rainy season has led to severe soil erosion and nutrient loss in arable sloping land the topography is generally characterized by low hills with elevations of 30 100 m the slope across the area varies from 5 to 25 the crop rotation of winter rapeseed brassica napus and summer peanut arachis hypogaea accounts for the use of sloping farmland in this district the dominant soil type of the region is red clay soil formed by the decomposition of quaternary sediments liu et al 2016 the soil has a depth of approximately 50 cm 150 cm with a ph of 6 67 and organic carbon matter of 8 64 g kg 1 the total nitrogen tn concentration total phosphorus tp concentration and total potassium tk concentration in the soil tillage layer are 0 55 g kg 1 0 31 g kg 1 15 87 g kg 1 respectively the soil contains approximately 18 34 sand 2 0 05 mm 65 60 silt 0 05 0 002 mm and 16 06 clay 0 002 mm the soil bulk density is 1 13 1 52 g cm 3 in the 0 20 cm layer and 1 18 1 72 g cm 3 in 20 40 cm soil culturing layer 2 2 experimental design and agricultural practices the field experiment was designed with five treatments bare land as control ck downslope tillage dt downslope tillage with two hedgerows of daylily hemerocallis citrina planted in contour dt hg contour ridge tillage ct and straw mulch sm fig 1 each treatment was arranged in three 20 m long 5 m wide in situ runoff plots which were installed on a 10 slope cement walls inserted vertically 30 cm into the soil and 20 cm above the soil surface on each side of the plots were established to disconnect adjacent plots and avoid hydrological interferences to collect the runoff and sediments under rainfall events a trench and two runoff collection tanks were constructed at the bottom of each plot a water level gauge installed in each tank was used to record the runoff volume for each event all the treatments were fertilized with 300 kg ha 1 of urea containing n 46 4 600 kg ha 1 of mineral fertilizers containing p2o5 12 and water soluble p 18 and 2 25 kg ha 1 for potassium chloride containing k2o 60 for each plot before planting on may 4 peanuts were seeded at 0 3 m row spacing on may 6 on june 14 the remaining n fertilizer with urea of 300 kg ha 1 was applied to each plot the peanuts were harvested on august 22 observations were conducted during the entire peanut growth period the cropping system and cultivated practices were applied in accordance with the local typical agricultural management in the red soil region of southern china 2 3 sample collection and laboratory analysis precipitation was measured by an automatic meteorological station 20 m from the experimental plots the key characteristics of rainfall including duration h mean intensity mm h 1 maximum intensity in 30 min mm h 1 and daily rainfall amount mm were recorded rainfalls are classified into six different patterns based on the rainfall variation in daily precipitation table 1 heavy rainfall refers to the rainfall event with total precipitation in 24 h ranging from 50 to 99 9 mm the runoff volume of each runoff event was measured by multiplying the water level in the tank by the base area of the tank the runoff depth was calculated as runoff divided by the area of experimental plots after each rainfall event a runoff sample mixed with sediments was collected in a plastic bottle to measure the sediment concentration by drying in an oven to constant weight at 105 c the sediment loss of each rainfall event was calculated by multiplying the runoff volume and sediment concentration another runoff water sample was collected in a 500 ml plastic bottle and immediately taken to the laboratory and stored at 4 c with 0 5 ml of 98 h2so4 which was added to avoid microbial activity the water samples were filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m membrane for chemical analysis the tn and tp concentration of each runoff sample were analyzed by alkaline potassium persulfate oxidation ultraviolet spectrophotometry and ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric methods respectively lu 2000 all the sediment samples of each plot were collected and then transported immediately to laboratory for physical and chemical analyses sediment samples of 200 g were air dried to determine the tn and tp in the sediments other suspended sediments were wet sieved through a nest of sieves with 0 25 and 0 05 mm openings the fractions of 0 05 mm were collected to determine the silt and clay sized percentage using hydrometer method arriaga et al 2006 the sediments that remained on each screen were transferred to a large dry beaker the samples were dried at 50 c and then weighed after measuring the undispersed particle size distributions samples were classified into three sediment size fractions a 0 25 mm b 0 05 0 25 mm and c 0 05 mm to analyze the level of tn and tp in different size fractions of sediment tn and tp concentration of each size fraction was measured by the kjeldahl method and molybdenum blue colorimetric method bao 2000 the nutrient losses in different sediment size fractions were calculated by multiplying nutrient concentrations and the corresponding sediment content of each size fraction the nutrient flux of sediments q kg ha 1 were converted to area based on the following equation 1 q 10 6 cimpi s where ci mg kg 1 represents the nutrient concentration of sediment in i size fraction m kg represents sediment yield pi represents the percentage of i size fraction in sediments and s ha represents the area of the runoff plot 2 4 statistical analysis all statistics were analyzed by ibm spss statistics 21 0 and originpro 2016 the kolmogorov smirnov test showed that the data were normally or log normally distributed one way anova was used to assess the effects of treatments on the measured variables duncan s test was used to identify the significant differences among the treatments at a significance level of p 0 05 rainfall was plotted against runoff and regression line were fitted by least square method multiple stepwise linear regression was used to quantify the effects of rainfall characteristics and runoff on soil and nutrient loss for each treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 heavy rainfall events selection the depths of erosive rainfall during the experiment varied highly among events ranging from 10 0 mm to 385 0 mm table 2 the total rainfall recorded was 955 7 mm according to the classification standard of precipitation grade of precipitation 2012 four heavy rainfall events were selected for further analyses including rainfall events on june 1 3 june 15 june 30 to july 5 and july 15 the maximum intensity in 30 min of these heavy rainfalls all exceeded 30 mm h 1 the rainfall depths under heavy rainfalls were 666 4 mm accounting for 70 of the total rainfalls eight moderate rainfall events and four large rainfall events only contributed 30 of the total rainfalls heavy rainfall played a key role in soil and water loss 3 2 runoff and sediment yield the runoff and sediment loss showed large variations among different rainfall events throughout peanut growth figs 2 and 3 heavy rainfalls were the major causes of runoff and sediment loss in all treatments fig 4 in the ck plots runoff depth and sediment yield under heavy rainfalls were respectively 170 57 mm and 53 23 mg ha 1 which accounted for 86 and 87 of the total runoff depth and total sediment yield during the experimental period in the dt treatment heavy rainfalls contributed to 90 of the total runoff and 86 of the total sediment loss the proportions of heavy rainfalls in runoff depth and sediment yield were on average 95 and 92 respectively under dt hg ct and sm treatments runoff depth was significantly p 0 05 lower in all measures compared with the control fig 4a total runoff depth was highest and lowest in ck 199 20 mm and sm 34 61 mm respectively in general the effectiveness of downslope tillage practice at reducing runoff was the lowest among all measures the runoff depth of the dt treatments under heavy rainfalls was reduced only by 10 compared with ck dt hg and ct significantly p 0 05 decreased the runoff by 37 and 49 respectively compared with ck under heavy rainfalls no significant differences were showed in runoff depths between dt hg and ct treatments straw mulch was most effective at reducing runoff loss the runoff reduction rate of sm compared with ck reached to 81 under heavy rainfalls soil management measures also had significant effects on sediment loss fig 4b the sediment yield were the highest in the control with total amounts of 61 38 mg ha 1 sediment losses were significantly p 0 05 lower in all measures than in the control sediment losses were lowest in sm but showed no significant difference from the losses in dt hg and ct treatments dt 42 and sm 97 reduced sediment yields the least and most respectively under heavy rainfalls fig 4b the sediment yields of the dt hg and ct treatments were significantly p 0 05 decreased by 86 and 96 respectively compared with ck under heavy rainfalls it was found that the sediment reduction by management measures was more effective under heavy rainfalls compared with runoff reduction 3 3 nitrogen and phosphorus loss along with runoff and sediment loss the associated nutrients were also lost heavy rainfalls contributed to 88 97 of the total dissolved n and 78 97 of the total dissolved p losses in all treatments the export of tn and tp in runoff was different among the five treatments fig 5 the tn and tp losses in the runoff were the highest under the ck plots with total amounts of 4 09 kg ha 1 and 0 36 kg ha 1 respectively the efficiencies of reductions for the measures ranged between 4 and 88 for tn and ranged between 26 and 91 for tp in runoff under heavy rainfalls the dt treatments caused more dissolved tn losses than ck under heavy rainfalls no significant differences were observed in dissolved tn losses between ck and dt treatments dt significantly p 0 05 decreased dissolved tp losses by 26 under heavy rainfalls sm reduced the loss of both tn and tp in runoff the most by 88 and 91 respectively under heavy rainfalls nutrient losses were generally higher for n than for p sediments were the major carriers of nutrients tn and tp losses in the sediments were much higher than that in runoff water in all treatments ranging from 0 75 kg ha 1 to 38 58 kg ha 1 and 0 64 kg ha 1 to 26 75 kg ha 1 respectively the management measures had significant effects on tn and tp losses in the sediments sediment associated n and p losses were significantly p 0 05 lower in all measures than in the control dt and dt hg decreased tn and tp losses in the sediment by 43 and 86 respectively under heavy rainfalls no significant differences were observed in tn and tp losses between ct and sm treatments the reduction in tn and tp losses by ct and sm were up to 97 averagely under heavy rainfalls 3 4 sediment size distribution and associated nutrients adsorption sediment characteristics and associated nutrients concentration under heavy rainfalls were analyzed to investigate the sediment transport potential of different measures results showed that the different treatments resulted in different undispersed sediment size distribution table 3 in general the proportions of particles 0 25 mm were the highest in the control among all treatments accounting for 26 averagely there were no significant differences between dt and ct in sediment size distribution dt and ct were less effective at decreasing the quantity of larger particles in the sediments dt hg and sm treatments significantly p 0 05 decreased the percentage of coarse fractions 0 25 mm by 39 and 56 respectively meanwhile fine particles of 0 05 mm accounted for the largest proportions of sm and dt hg sediments with an average of 72 and 62 respectively the distribution of nutrients in sediments also varied with size classes and management measures nutrients were distributed unevenly among different size classes results show that tn and tp were generally greatest in the 0 05 mm size class for all the treatments for ck and dt plots often twice as much tn and tp were in 0 05 mm size class than in other two size classes the particles of 0 05 mm contributed over 70 to the tn losses in dt hg and sm treatments the proportions of 0 05 mm fractions in tp losses were relatively lower than that in tn losses under dt hg and sm plots with a median of 64 and 50 respectively although the management measures did not affect tn and tp concentration distribution patterns with smaller particles having greater concentrations than larger particles management measures did affect the proportion of nutrients associated with different size sediments by influencing changes in the sediment size distribution these changes in sediment size distribution could have a strong effect on nutrient transport risk finer sediments easily transported with runoff water could result in downstream water quality problems 4 discussion our study indicates that heavy rainfall events were responsible for the majority of seasonal water erosion four heavy rainfall events produced 86 of the total runoff and 87 of the total sediment yield in the control the runoff under heavy rainfalls varied between 31 93 mm and 170 57 mm with sediment yield from 1 34 mg ha 1 to 53 23 mg ha 1 fig 4 these runoff values are much higher than the results from other studies conducted in the region for example chen et al 2015 reported a total runoff of 15 87 mm in the control during the soybean growth season the differences could be attributed to the high variability of rainfalls in our study period the results reconfirmed the destructive effect of heavy rainfall on water erosion reported in previous studies gao et al 2005 mohamadi and kavian 2015 wei et al 2010 also reported only a few of rainfall events were important for severe soil and water loss for instance 64 1 of the total annual sediment loss was caused by the rainfall event occurred on 8th july meanwhile the key periods for heavy rainfall to occur are june and july more

runoff could be positively exponential in our study regression analysis shows that rainfall was significant p 0 05 and positively correlated with runoff for each treatment fig 7 previous studies reported that linear correlation was observed between runoff and sediment loss kothyari et al 2004 zhang 2016 however stepwise regression analysis shows that sediment loss was the result of rainfall and runoff table 4 sediment loss was affected by runoff and rainfall intensity under contour ridge tillage and control factors influencing sediment loss were different among various treatments sediment yield was significantly positive correlated with runoff under downslope tillage and hedges along with runoff and sediment loss nutrient removal also occurs which eventually deposits in depressions or further downstream in rivers lakes and reservoirs figs 5 and 6 showed the nutrients loss loads in the control were the highest among all the treatments soil management measures could enhance the soil nutrients availability and reduce nutrient losses results showed that sediments were the major carriers of nutrients in our study up to 73 of n and 94 of p were transported with the

significantly decreased runoff and sediment yield by 81 and 97 respectively under heavy rainfalls effectiveness of straw mulch in managing soil water and nutrient loss arises from protection provided

by 93 compared with bare land in red soil region an increase in water erosion and nutrient loss is caused by downslope tillage compared to contour ridge tillage figs 4 and 5 relatively lower

the rainy summer season during peanut growth 93 of the total runoff and 90 of the total sediments came from heavy rainfall events all management measures effectively reduced runoff sediment yield and nutrient losses the runoff depth was positively correlated with rainfall amount in all treatments compared with ck the runoff depths under heavy rainfalls for dt dt hr ct and sm were reduced by 10 37 49 and 81 respectively sediment yields were reduced by 42 86 97 and 97 respectively tn and tp losses were mainly associated with eroded sediments 93 of tn and 99 of tp were transported with sediments these findings provide important implications for combating soil erosion and nutrient losses caused by heavy rainfall we conclude that straw mulch is the most cost effective management measure to mitigate soil erosion and nutrient losses from the sloping farmland in the red soil region of southern china acknowledgments financial support for this study was provided by the special fund for agro
