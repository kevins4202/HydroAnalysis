2980,the soil water retention curve swrc is usually measured by the axis translation technique att assuming a specimen thickness of a few centimetres usually this assumption is unquestionable to ensure the representative elementary volume rev however such an assumption cannot always be conserved with coarser soil regarding the local heterogeneities generated by larger pore sizes in addition the authentic swrc is supposed to be the soil moisture profile above the phreatic surface those issues therefore raise concerns about the scale effects in swrc with an aim to investigate them this work compared the primary drainage swrcs of coarse medium and fine sand measured by the standard hanging column and full scale soil column 150 cm the soil moisture profile at the final drainage stage was detected using the spatial time domain reflectometry spatial tdr technique with a presentation of sensor calibrations and validations the observations showed discrepancies between swrcs given by two methods in terms of air entry value aev and slope of swrc but agreements on residual moisture content moreover such differences could be alleviated with the soil becoming finer and better graded finally the physical reasons are discussed referring to local heterogeneity and pressure gradient changes on the top boundary in conclusion the full scale soil column test can be utilised to avoid scale effects despite demanding high costs and massive labour efforts also a shorter soil column incorporating point wise suction and moisture sensors in prior studies could be an alternative solution keywords swrc scale effects spatial tdr moisture content profile data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the extensions of mechanics from saturated to unsaturated soil and single phase to multiphase flow seepage were achieved by incorporating interfacial physics for engineering application the complex interfacial physics in soil pore matrix can be upscaled and simplified into the soil water retention curve swrc or capillary pressure saturation pc s and corresponding hydraulic conductivity function hcf or relative permeability saturation kr s bear 1972

1978 scheuermann and bieberstein 2007 van genuchten 1980 the only constitutive relationship of porous media representative elementary volume rev has been narrowed down to swrc pc s therefore the accuracy of swrc pc s measurement dominates the performance of modelling unsaturated soil seepage slope stability reduction under environmental conditions fredlund and rahardjo 1993 lu and likos 2004 and oil gas production bear 1972 the direct and indirect measurement of swrc and hcf has been standardised into american testing standard methods astm d6836 02 2003 astm d7664 10 2010 conventional methods integrate various testing techniques to cover the full soil suction range for natural well graded soil however many research studies have reported significant differences between laboratory and field scale measurements the reasons for such discrepancies have been investigated in terms of local heterogeneity kang et al 2014 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 large scale heterogeneity bordoni et al 2017 hysteresis mualem 1974 pham et al 2005 and dynamic nonequilibrium effect diamantopoulos and durner 2012 hassanizadeh et al 2002 yan et al 2021b yan et al 2022b yan et al 2022c etc this study focuses on the scale effects in swrc measurement for coarse grained soil using the conventional axis translation technique att the scale effects are due to a combination of pressure gradient steep variation and local heterogeneity which inevitably occurs on the top of coarse soil specimens according to the unsaturated soil mechanics and hydrology bear 1972 fredlund and rahardjo 1993 lu and likos 2004 the swrc should be the final moisture profile above the groundwater table after a drainage process because the elevation corresponding to each moisture is exact the hydrostatic soil suction head however the hanging column method soil suction range 0 80 kpa often adopts a saturated soil specimen prepared in a few centimetres under which a high air entry ceramic disk instead of a real saturated zone is used to prevent air breakthrough for such a case the rev concept is reliable for finer soil due to statistical stability of porosity and relatively higher air entry value aev astm d6836 02 2003 bear 1972 kang et al 2014 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 vanapalli et al 2008 nevertheless for coarser soil having a higher percentage of sand and fine gravel this rev concept has been challenged by many experimental observations using new sensor techniques sakaki and illangasekare 2007 radiography kang et al 2014 etc inside laboratories and even in the field bordoni et al 2017 bottero et al 2011 dane et al 1992 jalbert and dane 2001 perfect et al 2004 tokunaga et al 2002 specifically possible reasons include soil moisture underestimation and scale discrepancy between soil suction and moisture determinations for the hanging column test the equilibrium suction head is defined as the vertical distance between the ceramic disk and the water table in an outward burette therefore the rev scale should be treated as a thin soil layer above the disk however it is not often applicable to a coarse material regarding the homogeneous assumption to overcome this issue the thickness has to be increased to at least 2 3 cm for finer sand or even a few ten centimetres for fine gravel with such a thicker specimen the moisture content is calculated by spatial averaging operation through the measuring domain miscorrelating the suction head assigned to the rev bottom and moisture content of the entire rev causes the scale discrepancy furthermore compared to a complete soil suction moisture profile the hydraulic connectivity on the rev top is broken from a potential upper layer but replaced by a directly applied atmospheric pressure subsequently the local heterogeneities manifested as large pore throats lead to more water being drained as a result the domain averaged moisture content of coarser material will be underestimated dane et al 1992 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 schroth et al 1996 tokunaga et al 2002 many studies have investigated the scale effects mainly following two streams as the hanging column method was preserved in the first stream the mathematical tools were developed for corrections including averaging operating methods bottero et al 2011 cropper et al 2011 dane et al 1992 better fitting tools cropper et al 2011 dane et al 1992 liu and dane 1995 peters and durner 2006 and inverse modelling outflow data from a multistep drainage test simunek et al 2013 moreover as this method was challenged for the coarser soil in the second stream alternative soil column tests were presented with novel sensor techniques bayer et al 2004 chen and balcom 2005 dane et al 1992 kang et al 2014 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 finally a consensus settled amongst those experimental studies was that the hanging column method should be coupled with point wise suction and moisture sensors in the rev centre sakaki and illangasekare 2007 or replaced by an innovative technique measuring the entire soil moisture profile kang et al 2014 in this study the spatial time domain reflectometry spatial tdr technique developed by the soil moisture group smg at the university of karlsruhe hübner and kupfer 2007 schlaeger 2005 scheuermann et al 2009 wagner et al 2007 was applied to a series of soil column tests in 150 cm long three types of sand were selected including coarse medium and fine sand those long columns cover the full range of their suction head also the saturated zone was retained under the unsaturated zone instead of setting the ceramic disk underneath therefore this experimental platform could be seen as an idealised testing condition for measuring the in situ primary swrc without any environmental impacts in principle this work investigates the scale effects by comparing primary swrcs measured by the standard hanging column and full scale soil column tests besides the spatial tdr sensor calibration and inversion analysis of tdr waveform for extracting soil moisture profile are presented for any interests of measurements so far although many prior works studied scale effects in swrc of coarse soil using the standard att coupled with point wise soil suction and moisture measurements or inverse modelling there have been no investigations of scale effects using full scale soil column integrated with the soil moisture profile measurement therefore this work is a pioneer exploration of scale effects in swrc of sandy soil using the innovative spatial tdr technique 2 material and experimental setup 2 1 material selection three types of sand were selected to provide corresponding suction ranges under 15 kpa 150 cm because the vertical space is limited in the laboratory the coarse 18 40 and fine 50 n sand were purchased from the commercial supplier sebilco qld australia while the medium sand was collected from a construction site in brisbane qld australia the standard geotechnical tests were carried out for those selections including sieving analysis astm d422 63 2007 gas pycnometer astm d5550 06 2006 and mechanical shaking test as 1289 5 5 1 1998 for sequentially determining grain size distribution gsd specific gravity gs minimum maximum dry densities ρdry max ρdry min the soil gsds are shown in fig 1 according to the unified soil classification system uscs all chosen samples are poor graded uniform quartz sand s p with the same specific gravity gs of 2 65 the d50 of each selected sample ranges from 0 15 mm up to 0 55 mm compared to the other two commercial products the medium sand has a 2 3 fine content 0 075 mm slightly increasing the cohesion and adsorption between quartz sand particles the soil specifications are listed in table 1 three uniform poor graded sand samples are only selected rather than other soils in consideration of three main aspects 1 research interests 2 geotechnical laboratory vertical dimension and 3 sensor limitations first as the problem statement in the previous section the scale effects mostly matter with coarse soil e g sand and gravel but not fine soil e g silt and clay hence the sand becomes the prior option in comparison to fine gravel which has a short suction range second well graded sandy soil e g mainly sand mixed up with a small amount of gravel silty and clay could yield suction ranges over 20 kpa or even up to 100 kpa corresponding to 2 m or even up to 10 m in suction heads those higher suction ranges demand full scale soil columns over 2 m or even up to 10 m which is not feasible in most geotechnical laboratories third the sensors adopted in this work have a few limitations the hydraulic tensiometers usually work under an upper suction limit of 85 kpa so it is not applicable to fine soil under a high suction range 100 kpa in addition the spatial tdr technique relies on several assumptions of frequency independence on electrical parameters constraining the fine content 5 10 in the measured samples higher fine content or salinity in pore fluid will fail those assumptions last uniform sand and fine gravel have been often utilised in prior works investigating scale effects based on the above considerations sandy samples were only selected in this work 2 2 the hanging column test setup the hanging column method is illustrated in fig 2 a according to astm d6836 02 2003 this experiment could be set up in the following steps the entire column including a ceramic disk in air entry value aev of 1 01 103 kpa fixed inside was firstly degassed in deionised water under 1 01 103 kpa for 24 h to ensure the column bottom was utterly filled with degassed water the column bottom was then connected to a scaled burette by a floppy hose filled with degassed water all connecting processes were completed inside the degassed water so there should be a perfect bubble free hydraulic connection also the column was set in a climate chamber to alleviate evaporation after levelling the column in the chamber the static soil suction could be applied by vertically adjusting the burette elevation along with the rack a lower soil suction range of 22 kpa could be achieved in this setup because the vertical dimension was 220 cm as for the initial condition of the primary drainage test the water level in the burette should be set to the elevation of the ceramic disk after the experiment set the soil specimen should be prepared in a designated dry density ρdry porosity and initial volumetric moisture content at a fully saturated condition θ0 θs the cling wrap was then used to cover up the column top to mitigate evaporation further a few holes were pinned on the cling wrap by needles to apply the atmospheric pressure for comparing different testing methods the specimen density should be identical to the one achieved in the full scale soil column test later illustrated the specimen for this test was prepared in a column diameter of 9 5 cm with a thickness of 3 0 1 cm the tap water in the geomechanics laboratory of the university of queensland uq was used to prepare soil specimens on the rev scale under the soil suction range of 22 kpa and soil water temperature of 25 c no gas bubbles were observed under the ceramic disk during the tests according to astm d6836 02 2003 the specimen thickness was suggested to be the sampling o rings thickness at a minimum of 0 5 cm however the specimen thickness for coarse soil which has not been precisely specified in the standard raises controversies in many prior studies bottero et al 2011 dane et al 1992 liu and dane 1995 perfect et al 2004 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 schroth et al 1996 tokunaga et al 2002 therefore it is subjected to the scale effect of static swrc after the saturated specimen was loaded inside the test could be initiated by adjusting the elevation of the measuring cylinder downward in multistep the water level volume increment inside the burette equals the soil moisture expelled from the saturated specimen the volumetric moisture content after each step of outflow therefore can be calculated by 1 θ i θ i 1 v δ i v t for drainage where θi 1 and θi are previous and current volumetric moisture content vδi is the volume of expelled water for the drainage step i measured by burette and vt is the total volume of the prepared specimen as for the soil suction head hc determination many previous studies have debated it continuously a few studies recommended that the soil suction head should be the vertical distance between the specimen centre and water level in the burette when the equilibrium condition is achieved cropper et al 2011 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 however the astm d6836 02 2003 sourced from many earlier works defines the soil suction head as the vertical distance between the ceramic disk and water level in the burette every 48 h after each step of outflow for comparison between the two methods the standard method was followed ten to twenty data points were collected after the burette was moved downward every 5 10 cm for each drainage step the incremental resolution should depend on whether the suction head is close to the inflection points including aev and residual water content θr finally the static primary swrc can be given by the van genuchten swrc model van genuchten 1980 2 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h c n m where θ and hc are the volumetric moisture content and soil suction head θs and θr are the fully saturated and residual volumetric moisture contents a n and m are fitting parameters of the van genuchten swrc model the fitting work was accomplished by retc software van genuchten et al 1991 2 3 the full scale soil column test setup the full scale soil column test setup is illustrated in fig 2 b three sample selections were separately loaded into three polyvinyl chloride pvc columns length 160 cm and diameter 15 cm to measure primary drainage swrc using the one step outflow method according to fig 2 b the testing platform consists of two logging systems the accumulative outflow and soil moisture content profile logging systems the accumulative outflow logging system was made up of three ohaus ranger 3000 r31p30 bench scales for weighing the accumulative overflow from the constant head tanks this scale has a maximum capacity of 30 kg with a precision of 1 kg the weight of the overflow tank was automatically measured every 30 s by a self developed computer program the moisture content profile logging system was composed of three spatial time domain reflectometry spatial tdr flat ribbon cable frc sensors with a length of 150 cm and a width of 6 cm there were two in outputs of signal on two sensor terminals which were packed with black epoxy in a length of 5 cm for waterproofing the six terminals from three sensors were connected to the six channels on a campbell scientific sdm x50 multiplexer by coaxial cables of the same length of 300 cm the multiplexer was then connected to a campbell scientific tdr 100 and cr 1000 datalogger as tdr pulse generator receiver and automatic data collector a cr basic program was custom designed to automatically generate and receive tdr pulses from six multiplexer channels with this tdr logging system the spatial and temporal resolutions of the moisture content profile could achieve 1 cm and 1 min separately a detailed illustration of applying the spatial tdr technique particularly on tdr inversion analysis could be found in appendix a for any interest in soil moisture profile measurement the technical challenges in applying this technique for the full scale soil column tests could be found in the work of yan et al 2022a the soil column test was prepared in the following steps fig 2 b shows that the frc sensor was pre located into the column centre before the specimen fabrication a gravel filter designed based on published standards giroud 2010 was then filled down to the column bottom to fix one sensor end the soil specimen was fabricated above the gravel filter by tamping outside the column and compacting on top the water table was consistently controlled above the specimen top to ensure a fully saturated condition the tap water in the geomechanics laboratory of uq was used to fabricate full scale soil specimens the soil water temperature was kept at 25 c continuously verified by a thermometer throughout the tests as the 150 cm column provided the soil suction range of 15 kpa there should not be any issue of nucleation as well the soil sample was oven dried at 200 c for 48 h followed by mechanical crushes to eliminate segregations before filling the column adequate compactions ensured no distortion of sensor geometry and firm contact between the frc sensor and ambient soil finally the specimen was successfully fabricated as a homogeneous soil profile inside each opaque pvc column based on experiences from previous soil column tests adopting the transparent acrylic column allowing for density control by compaction in multilayers yan et al 2017 yan et al 2021a yan et al 2022a this compacting procedure could control the standard deviation of porosity under 2 the densities control for three soil columns is presented in table 2 the one step outflow soil column test was operated as follows in the beginning the groundwater table was set above the specimen top and the bottom output was connected to a constant head tank whose overflow was collected by an overflow tank measured by the bench scale then the cling wrap was used to cover the column top and other opening areas to minimise evaporation also small holes were pinned on cling wrap to apply atmospheric pressure since the one step drainage started the final equilibrium could be identified with no overflow and tdr waveform variations usually this final equilibrium condition could be achieved in a week for those uniform sandy samples see outflow logging in fig a5 in appendix a in addition as the cling wrap covers all open areas this short testing period could efficiently prevent potential evaporation see steady mean moisture logging for each soil column in fig a5 in appendix a finally the authentic primary drainage swrc the moisture content profile at the final equilibrium stage could be indirectly determined from the latest tdr waveform using the spatial tdr technique 3 result and discussion 3 1 the full scale soil column tests the final soil moisture content profiles for three soil columns are plotted in fig 3 a the soil moisture profiles above the blue highlighted phreatic line are the static primary drainage soil water retention curve swrc those swrcs clearly manifest the dependence of swrc on grain size distribution gsd soil density porosity and fine content silt and clay particles 0 075 mm for instance the swrc of medium sand in fig 3 a has the highest air entry value aev residual moisture content θr and most gradual variation of swrc slope because finer pore sizes could be generated by fitting the higher fine content 2 3 into coarse particles and a better graded pore size distribution could be generated with the higher uniformity coefficient 2 39 amongst those three selections in addition compared to the swrc of medium sand the swrcs of uniform coarse and fine sand have smaller aevs θr and steeper swrc slopes with the fine content approaching almost 0 mean grain size increasing and uniformity coefficient 1 5 moreover it should be noted that the significant fluctuations of moisture contents in the residual content zone nearby the top end and slightly abnormal close to the bottom end are due to the boundary effect of the spatial tdr technique yan et al 2021a yan et al 2022a the waterproof of sensor terminals by filling black epoxy suddenly changed the impedance continuities on both ends later involved in tdr measurement and inversion analysis yan et al 2021a yan et al 2022a it is an inevitable boundary effect embedded in the current sensor design manufacturing and mathematical inversion analysis this might occur in finer sandy soil it can be overcome by applying more extended sensors long enough to be much over the suction range of residual water content for instance as fig 3 a shows such boundary effects as long as the residual water content is achieved for the elevation over 95 cm the unreliable moisture content above 125 cm could be eliminated from the measuring focus 3 2 the standard hanging column tests fig 3 b shows the static primary drainage swrcs measured by the hanging column method for three selected samples this standard method can provide the soil moisture content and suction head in several discrete data points where the van genuchten fitting model in equation 2 was therefore fitted by retc van genuchten et al 1991 the similar dependence of swrcs on mean grain size soil grade uniformity and fine content from fig 3 a can also be found in fig 3 b however compared to fig 3 a the swrcs of coarse and medium sand in fig 3 a present much sharper swrc slopes and smaller aevs based on criticism in measuring swrc of coarse grain soil using the standard hanging column tests from previous studies dane et al 1992 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 schroth et al 1996 tokunaga et al 2002 those differences could raise concerns about the scale effect and local heterogeneity issue in the hanging column test regarding specimen thickness and suction moisture determination therefore the differences of swrcs measured by both methods need to be illustrated in detail for further discussions on physical reasons and inappropriate assumptions 3 3 the comparison between two methods fig 4 a c shows the comparisons between static primary swrcs measured using standard and full scale soil column tests for coarse medium and fine sand the fitting parameters of van genuchten for both testing methods are given in table 3 the fitting performance is good due to the root square r2 0 97 as for the coarse sand in fig 4 a it is clear to observe that the standard method compared to the full scale soil column test determines the swrc in a sharper swrc slope indicating a sharper wetting front in soil moisture profile this could also be quantitatively confirmed from van genuchten fitting parameters n for coarse sand in table 3 the higher value of n generates the sharper swrc slope in fig 4 a moreover for each soil suction head the corresponding moisture is underestimated in addition the fitting parameters a 1 aev for both methods are similar the aev given by the standard method 12 cm is 1 cm smaller than that measured by the full scale soil column test 13 cm which is smaller than the spatial resolution of the spatial tdr technique note that differences in aev 2 cm could be constrained by the aforementioned spatial resolution of 1 cm as for medium and fine sand the differences in swrc slopes given by the two methods are alleviated according to table 3 although the n values for the full scale test 50 60 are much higher than the n values for the standard test 6 10 the much lower m values 0 066 0 069 for the full scale test led to slightly sharper swrc slopes compared to the higher m values 0 47 0 63 for the standard test see fig 4 b and c in contrast the different aevs between the two methods are pretty obvious with the fitting parameter a 1 aev the aevs determined by the standard method are a few centimetres 2 cm smaller than the aevs measured by the full scale soil column test those distinctions highlighted here are due to the so called scale effect in the swrc measured using the hanging column method the scale effect challenges the representativeness of soil specimen loaded in the hanging column as a genuine and effective soil representative elementary volume rev being tested regarding specimen thickness soil suction and moisture content determination and correlation 3 4 discussion and illustration based on previous studies bottero et al 2011 dane et al 1992 jalbert and dane 2001 kang et al 2014 perfect et al 2004 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 tokunaga et al 2002 the possible reasons for scale effects could be categorised into three main aspects incorrectly assigning soil suction to a coarse soil rev miscorrelating the bulk moisture content with such a soil suction and soil moisture underestimation caused by a combination of local heterogeneity and atmospheric pressure on rev top as illustrated in fig 5 the specimen was prepared with a sampling o ring in a thickness of a few centimetres for a coarser soil the larger pores could be formed on top of the specimen surface which allows a lower aev and reduction of the initial and following bulk moisture contents as the atmospheric pressure directly was applied on the top boundary in contrast the upper boundary of an authentic rev as a point wise segment in the soil column was directly connected to an upper layer specifically the pressure gradient between the top and bottom of the specimen in the hanging column is the pressure difference between suction applied on ceramic disk and atmospheric pressure while the suction gradient for a point wise rev in soil column can approach the ideal case as infinitely small due to such an inevitable local heterogeneity on the top boundary the larger pressure gradient applied on the specimen in the standard test is not exactly identical to the suction gradient on the point wised rev in the soil profile and further results in the underestimation of bulk moisture contents and aev in addition the slope of swrc can also be sharpened due to such underestimations see fig 4 a with an underestimated aev and overestimated capillary specific storage slope of swrc both thicknesses of fully saturated capillary fringe and capillary fingers in the vadose zone could not be precisely modelled using the richards equation furthermore according to fig 4 a c it is also clear to see that with the sample becomes finer and better graded such a pressure gradient and local heterogeneous effects less influence the swrcs measured by the standard test as the results from both methods mutually overlap better in fig 4 b and c on the other hand despite the bulk moisture contents being underestimated the soil suction assigned to the specimen is also not the representative soil suction but the backpressure applied on the ceramic disk the soil suction assigned is also shifted downward with the variation of specimen thickness it further underestimates the actual soil suction for each bulk moisture content including aev a combining effect also smooths the swrcs around the aev by correlating the backpressures with potentially undervalued moisture contents also it slightly levels up the moisture contents above the saturated capillary fringe shown in fig 4 b and c indicating more gradual slopes of swrcs this finding is similar to the smoothing effect defined by sakaki and illangasekare 2007 in such a case the aev and capillary specific storage of the vadose zone slope of swrc will be both underestimated leading to inaccurate predictions by the richards model as well in order to resolve the scale effects several previous contributions already recommended the application of point wise moisture and suction measurement inside a hanging column test instead of conventional determination for both variables liu and dane 1995 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 others also applied the suction averaging method for correction and comparison bottero et al 2011 dane et al 1992 schroth et al 1996 tokunaga et al 2002 and inversion analysis of the richards model on accumulative outflow data to back calculate swrc cropper et al 2011 peters and durner 2006 simunek et al 2013 nevertheless only a few studies have measured the final moisture content profile using multiple point wise tdr sensors in those studies there are fewer findings of disagreement between soil column and standard tests chapuis et al 2007 lins et al 2009 this work implemented the one step outflow drainage test using the spatial tdr technique it indirectly measured the soil moisture content profile at the final stage through tdr inversion analysis the research findings unveil the scale effect in swrc tested by the standard method for poorly graded sand also the results certainly agree with the smoothing effects investigated in several previous studies using point wise tdr and neutron radiography kang et al 2014 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 4 concluding remarks this work investigated the scale effects in soil water retention curve swrc of coarse grained soil by comparing primary swrcs measured by the standard hanging column method and full scale soil column test compared to other full scale column tests that adopted point wise sensors in prior studies this work applied the spatial time domain reflectometry spatial tdr technique to measure the final soil moisture profile after a one step outflow was accomplished the authentic primary drainage curves could be identified as the final soil moisture profiles based on unsaturated soil theory the experimental outcomes show that the primary drainage curves determined by the standard method differ from the authentic primary drainage curves for coarse sand the standard method underestimates the aev and moisture content for each soil suction head resulting in a steeper swrc slope a sharper wetting front but only agrees on residual moisture content for medium and fine sand such discrepancies are diminished whereas the aev is still slightly underestimated by the standard method and moisture contents along the vadose zone are slightly overestimated leading to a more gradual swrc slope a more gradual wetting front based on former and current works reporting those issues the reasons for observing such disagreements are theoretically illustrated in the following points 1 the local heterogeneity large pore throats on the top surface of coarse grained soil cannot self sustain water under atmospheric pressure without connecting to a potential upper layer like a continuous soil profile the bulk moisture of a soil specimen will be underestimated due to this moisture loss which is manifested as a sharper swrc with a lower air entry value aev 2 as the soil suction determined by the standard method is in fact the backpressure applied on the ceramic disk the soil suction measurement accuracy is highly sensitive to the thickness of a soil specimen with a thicker specimen of coarse soils that complies with the representative elementary volume rev concept the backpressure applied might differ from the actual soil suction 3 correlating the backpressure with the underestimated bulk moisture content can further deviate the measured curve from the actual swrc which is demonstrated as smoothing the curve around an underestimated aev and slightly overestimated swrc slope moreover the challenges and limitations of carrying out the full scale soil column tests have to be noted first to ensure the homogeneity of a soil column the dry density along the soil profile should be carefully controlled to achieve a mean porosity with a standard deviation of 1 2 failing to control the dry density close to the maximum dry density may cause volume change during drainage second the spatial tdr technique can only accurately measure soil moisture profiles for coarse particles e g gravel sand glass beads etc without high fine content e g silt and clay 10 more fine content could challenge the assumptions of frequency independent electrical parameters along the spatial tdr sensor also higher clay content may lead to drying induced volume shrinkage the shrunk soil specimen will jeopardise the intimate contact between the sensor and ambient soil further causing the underestimation of soil moisture there is a wish that further developing the frequency domain reflectometry fdr with the fdr inversion technique can provide an alternative technique to measure the soil moisture profile for a soil sample having high fine content nonetheless since the scale effects often occur for coarser soil the point wise measurement should be much more reliable for finer soil hence soil moisture profile detection seems not urgent for such samples in conclusion the full scale soil column test can be applied to avoid scale effects despite demanding high costs and massive labour efforts besides a shorter soil column incorporating point wise suction and moisture sensors in prior studies could also be a fast alternative solution credit authorship contribution

monitor unsaturated soil moisture content and density bhuyan et al 2017 topp et al 1980 saturated soil porosity and permeability bittner et al 2019 scheuermann 2012 the success of quantitative water content estimation in porous media by tdr techniques is caused by the dipolar character of the water molecules resulting in a high permittivity in comparison to other phases such as solid particles or gas inclusions an illustration of tdr measurement and waveform analysis is shown in fig a1 conventional tdr sensors for soil applications consist of a one port waveguide made of several rods the probe is connected to a tdr device via a coaxial cable the tdr device consists of a tdr pulse generator for sending tdr pulse and an oscilloscope for recording the reflection returned with the pulse transmitted through the coaxial cable and probe surrounded by soil the impedance mismatch caused by variation of surrounding material can be reflected from the beginning to the end of a tdr probe this reflection in time scale is received into oscilloscope as a tdr trace or waveform the dual tangent method huisman et al 2002 can then be applied to the tdr waveform to determine the first and second inflection points highlighting the impedance variation from the beginning to the end of the tdr probe the flight time between two inflection points is identified as the travel time δ t along with the tdr probe an apparent permittivity εapp can be computed from the travel time with the following equation a1 ε app 1 4 c δ t l probe 2 where c is the speed of the light and lprobe is the length of the probe for most soils the relative permittivity εr is a frequency dependent complex number with the imaginary part reflecting dielectric loss which can arise from electrical conduction or different polarisation processes bore et al 2016 in general moist soils present complex permittivity values depending on frequency dispersion but tdr measurements result in a single bulk permittivity or apparent permittivity εapp value that corresponds to a particular but unknown effective frequency called feff several studies have investigated these effective frequencies in past years robinson et al 2005 although the influencing parameters are not well understood it is well accepted that soil with moderate dispersion e g without clays presents an effective frequency around 1 ghz εapp εr feff 1

despite its broad use in soil science it is well known that topp s equation fails to describe the θ εapp relationship for clayey soils bore et al 2018 in order to account for soil structure theoretical mixture rules dobson et al 1985 were introduced to compute the θ εapp relationship and were later extended by introducing phenomenological materials equations bore et al 2018 although this approach has shown promising results it is still confronted with theoretical challenges in this context specific material calibration is generally preferred but requires an important of amount work in the laboratory a2 soil moisture apparent permittivity calibration in order to avoid manipulating a large amount of material to perform the specific calibration the complex permittivity of the three selected soils was measured for different water content and density with the combination of a vector network analyzer vna and open ended oe probe in fig a2 this method is prevalent due to its simplicity it can be shown that the frequency dependant complex permittivity can be linked to the measured scattering function with a simple bilinear relationship wagner et al 2013 a3 ε r ω c 1 ω s 11 ω c 2 ω c 3 ω s 11 ω where s11 ω is the measured scattering function reflection only c1 ω c2 ω c3 ω are the frequency dependent calibration functions an in house oe probe was built based on an n type connector and embedded in a cylindrical sample holder mishra et al 2018 bore et al 2021 see fig a2 a and b before measurements an open short load osl calibration was performed the probe was then calibrated by measuring three perfectly known dielectric materials deionised water methanol and air the theoretical values for the complex permittivity of the two fluids were found in the literature kaatze 2007 the complete details of the procedure can be sourced from the work of wagner et al 2013 the specific calibrations for three samples are shown in fig a3 a c according to fig a3 b and c topp s equation seems to be relatively reliable for the finer group including the medium and fine sand with a slight bias of 1 3 volumetric moisture content however fig a3 a shows the coarse sand having different fitting parameters in the third order polynomial equation therefore if the vna tests were not carried out the inaccuracy caused by directly applying topp s equation would be over 3 volumetric moisture content thus the vna test is highly recommended to be implemented for a more precise tdr measurement a3 spatial tdr sensor design and validation the soil moisture group smg at the karlsruhe institute of technology kit germany improved the conventional tdr to the spatial tdr technique in order to measure soil moisture content distribution for a soil profile using only one sensor instead of multiple sensors point wisely the probe type tdr sensor was modified to become the flat ribbon cable frc sensor made of polyethene in which three copper wires are packed as shown in fig a4 b both terminals of the sensor body are configured to a coaxial cable see fig a4 a and later covered by a black epoxy package for waterproofing see fig a4 b fig a4 c illustrates the capacitance model of the frc sensor cross section in fig a4 b the capacitance model of the sensor cross section already specifies the capacitances c1 c 2 and c3 as well as the soil permittivity εr the capacitances were calibrated in previous works schlaeger 2005 and the soil permittivity is calculated by a4 c ε r ε r c 3 c 2 ε r c 3 c 2 c 1 where c1 3 4 pf m c 2 323 pf m and c3 14 8 pf m c is the total capacitance for the coating material and ambient soil εr is the corresponding relative permittivity then the soil permittivity profile surrounding the frc sensor can be calculated from the total capacitance profile using equation a4 also the spatial tdr sensor can be used to measure the mean soil moisture content of a soil profile after the travel time δ t is determined by the dual tangent method the total capacitance of the entire soil profile can be given by a5 c ε r 1 l 0 δ t 2 l probe 2 where c and εr are separately the total capacitance and relative permittivity for a soil profile l0 is the sensor inductance l0 756 nh m δ t is the travel time given by the dual tangent method on a tdr waveform lprobe is the sensor length with conventional tdr waveform analysis and equations a4 and a5 the mean soil moisture content variation could be continually detected for each soil column under transient draining conditions and later validated by the outflow logging the specific calibrations provided by the vna tests also have potential errors resulting from any human operation on soil density and moisture control the outflow logging data can be used as a backup method to validate those calibrations on the one hand the accumulative outflow is the water drained out of each soil column therefore the mean moisture content for each column can be inversely calculated from the volume of accumulative discharge on the other hand the spatial tdr technique can be downgraded to the conventional tdr technique hence the mean moisture content for each column can also be detected using a traditional tdr analysis the moisture contents given by both methods are mutually compared for the three samples in fig a5 a c according to the good agreements shown in fig a5 it is able to confirm the apparent permittivity volumetric moisture content calibrations by vna tests as reliable and robust specific calibrations a4 tdr inversion analysis and performance in order to extract the capacitance profile from a pair of tdr waveforms collected from two sensor terminals two way tdr tracing an infinite small section of sensor electrical circuit was conceptually modelled in fig a6 a and the two way tdr tracing is illustrated in fig a6 b where r and l are the resistivity r 0 and inductance l l0 756 nh m c and g are unknown capacitance and conductance profiles in need of numerical solutions v is the voltage plotted in the form of the reflection coefficient in tdr waveform huebner et al 2005 as the reflection coefficient is the ratio between reflecting and exciting voltages v v0 for this conceptual model the electrical parameter settings with an assumption for lower frequency 104 hz can be found in previous developments in detail scheuermann et al 2009 huebner et al 2005 based on the electrical model shown in fig a6 the frc sensor can be mathematically simulated by the telegraph equations schlaeger 2005 schlaeger 2005 transformed two telegraph governing equations into single partial differential equations pde in second order as a6 lc x 2 t 2 l g x t 1 l l x x 2 x 2 v i x t 0 where x is the sensor length t is the time c x and g x are capacitance and conductance profiles vi x is the voltage profile that can be transformed into tdr waveforms i 1 2 indicate the first and second tdr tracing from both terminals the c and g profiles are inputs for the forward modelling so the outcomes in tdr waveforms can be numerically solved from equation a6 using a finite difference scheme schlaeger 2005 as the tdr waveforms can be measured using tdr devices and the c and g profiles are two unknown inputs an optimisation algorithm was subsequentially developed by schlaeger 2005 to determine the c and g profiles inversely the cost function of tdr waveform inversion analysis is a7 j c g i 1 2 0 2 t v i s x i t c g v i m x i t 2 d t where j is the cost function of c and g profiles t is the travel time δ t between x1 and x2 vi s and vi m are the simulated and measured voltage profiles i indicates the first and second tdr tracing the optimisation method has been detailed by schlaeger 2005 the comparison between the measured and simulated tdr waveforms individually highlighted in green and blue is shown in fig a7 to demonstrate the performance of tdr inversion analysis applied to the tdr waveforms at the final equilibrium stage fig a7 a c shows acceptable agreements between the measured and simulated tdr waveforms therefore it is able to confirm the reliability of capacitance profiles inversely determined by the optimisation algorithm developed by schlaeger 2005 the capacitance profiles reconstructed by the inversion analysis can be subsequentially transferred into the permittivity profile using equation a4 eventually the soil volumetric moisture content distribution can be determined from the permittivity profile using specific calibrations in fig a3 a c to better illustrate the aforementioned process the tdr inversion analysis is schematically sketched in fig a8 
2980,the soil water retention curve swrc is usually measured by the axis translation technique att assuming a specimen thickness of a few centimetres usually this assumption is unquestionable to ensure the representative elementary volume rev however such an assumption cannot always be conserved with coarser soil regarding the local heterogeneities generated by larger pore sizes in addition the authentic swrc is supposed to be the soil moisture profile above the phreatic surface those issues therefore raise concerns about the scale effects in swrc with an aim to investigate them this work compared the primary drainage swrcs of coarse medium and fine sand measured by the standard hanging column and full scale soil column 150 cm the soil moisture profile at the final drainage stage was detected using the spatial time domain reflectometry spatial tdr technique with a presentation of sensor calibrations and validations the observations showed discrepancies between swrcs given by two methods in terms of air entry value aev and slope of swrc but agreements on residual moisture content moreover such differences could be alleviated with the soil becoming finer and better graded finally the physical reasons are discussed referring to local heterogeneity and pressure gradient changes on the top boundary in conclusion the full scale soil column test can be utilised to avoid scale effects despite demanding high costs and massive labour efforts also a shorter soil column incorporating point wise suction and moisture sensors in prior studies could be an alternative solution keywords swrc scale effects spatial tdr moisture content profile data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the extensions of mechanics from saturated to unsaturated soil and single phase to multiphase flow seepage were achieved by incorporating interfacial physics for engineering application the complex interfacial physics in soil pore matrix can be upscaled and simplified into the soil water retention curve swrc or capillary pressure saturation pc s and corresponding hydraulic conductivity function hcf or relative permeability saturation kr s bear 1972 fredlund and rahardjo 1993 lu and likos 2004 with the development of the transformation functions between swrc pc s and hcf kr s brooks and corey 1964 fredlund et al 1994 hu et al 2013 mualem 1976 1978 scheuermann and bieberstein 2007 van genuchten 1980 the only constitutive relationship of porous media representative elementary volume rev has been narrowed down to swrc pc s therefore the accuracy of swrc pc s measurement dominates the performance of modelling unsaturated soil seepage slope stability reduction under environmental conditions fredlund and rahardjo 1993 lu and likos 2004 and oil gas production bear 1972 the direct and indirect measurement of swrc and hcf has been standardised into american testing standard methods astm d6836 02 2003 astm d7664 10 2010 conventional methods integrate various testing techniques to cover the full soil suction range for natural well graded soil however many research studies have reported significant differences between laboratory and field scale measurements the reasons for such discrepancies have been investigated in terms of local heterogeneity kang et al 2014 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 large scale heterogeneity bordoni et al 2017 hysteresis mualem 1974 pham et al 2005 and dynamic nonequilibrium effect diamantopoulos and durner 2012 hassanizadeh et al 2002 yan et al 2021b yan et al 2022b yan et al 2022c etc this study focuses on the scale effects in swrc measurement for coarse grained soil using the conventional axis translation technique att the scale effects are due to a combination of pressure gradient steep variation and local heterogeneity which inevitably occurs on the top of coarse soil specimens according to the unsaturated soil mechanics and hydrology bear 1972 fredlund and rahardjo 1993 lu and likos 2004 the swrc should be the final moisture profile above the groundwater table after a drainage process because the elevation corresponding to each moisture is exact the hydrostatic soil suction head however the hanging column method soil suction range 0 80 kpa often adopts a saturated soil specimen prepared in a few centimetres under which a high air entry ceramic disk instead of a real saturated zone is used to prevent air breakthrough for such a case the rev concept is reliable for finer soil due to statistical stability of porosity and relatively higher air entry value aev astm d6836 02 2003 bear 1972 kang et al 2014 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 vanapalli et al 2008 nevertheless for coarser soil having a higher percentage of sand and fine gravel this rev concept has been challenged by many experimental observations using new sensor techniques sakaki and illangasekare 2007 radiography kang et al 2014 etc inside laboratories and even in the field bordoni et al 2017 bottero et al 2011 dane et al 1992 jalbert and dane 2001 perfect et al 2004 tokunaga et al 2002 specifically possible reasons include soil moisture underestimation and scale discrepancy between soil suction and moisture determinations for the hanging column test the equilibrium suction head is defined as the vertical distance between the ceramic disk and the water table in an outward burette therefore the rev scale should be treated as a thin soil layer above the disk however it is not often applicable to a coarse material regarding the homogeneous assumption to overcome this issue the thickness has to be increased to at least 2 3 cm for finer sand or even a few ten centimetres for fine gravel with such a thicker specimen the moisture content is calculated by spatial averaging operation through the measuring domain miscorrelating the suction head assigned to the rev bottom and moisture content of the entire rev causes the scale discrepancy furthermore compared to a complete soil suction moisture profile the hydraulic connectivity on the rev top is broken from a potential upper layer but replaced by a directly applied atmospheric pressure subsequently the local heterogeneities manifested as large pore throats lead to more water being drained as a result the domain averaged moisture content of coarser material will be underestimated dane et al 1992 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 schroth et al 1996 tokunaga et al 2002 many studies have investigated the scale effects mainly following two streams as the hanging column method was preserved in the first stream the mathematical tools were developed for corrections including averaging operating methods bottero et al 2011 cropper et al 2011 dane et al 1992 better fitting tools cropper et al 2011 dane et al 1992 liu and dane 1995 peters and durner 2006 and inverse modelling outflow data from a multistep drainage test simunek et al 2013 moreover as this method was challenged for the coarser soil in the second stream alternative soil column tests were presented with novel sensor techniques bayer et al 2004 chen and balcom 2005 dane et al 1992 kang et al 2014 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 finally a consensus settled amongst those experimental studies was that the hanging column method should be coupled with point wise suction and moisture sensors in the rev centre sakaki and illangasekare 2007 or replaced by an innovative technique measuring the entire soil moisture profile kang et al 2014 in this study the spatial time domain reflectometry spatial tdr technique developed by the soil moisture group smg at the university of karlsruhe hübner and kupfer 2007 schlaeger 2005 scheuermann et al 2009 wagner et al 2007 was applied to a series of soil column tests in 150 cm long three types of sand were selected including coarse medium and fine sand those long columns cover the full range of their suction head also the saturated zone was retained under the unsaturated zone instead of setting the ceramic disk underneath therefore this experimental platform could be seen as an idealised testing condition for measuring the in situ primary swrc without any environmental impacts in principle this work investigates the scale effects by comparing primary swrcs measured by the standard hanging column and full scale soil column tests besides the spatial tdr sensor calibration and inversion analysis of tdr waveform for extracting soil moisture profile are presented for any interests of measurements so far although many prior works studied scale effects in swrc of coarse soil using the standard att coupled with point wise soil suction and moisture measurements or inverse modelling there have been no investigations of scale effects using full scale soil column integrated with the soil moisture profile measurement therefore this work is a pioneer exploration of scale effects in swrc of sandy soil using the innovative spatial tdr technique 2 material and experimental setup 2 1 material selection three types of sand were selected to provide corresponding suction ranges under 15 kpa 150 cm because the vertical space is limited in the laboratory the coarse 18 40 and fine 50 n sand were purchased from the commercial supplier sebilco qld australia while the medium sand was collected from a construction site in brisbane qld australia the standard geotechnical tests were carried out for those selections including sieving analysis astm d422 63 2007 gas pycnometer astm d5550 06 2006 and mechanical shaking test as 1289 5 5 1 1998 for sequentially determining grain size distribution gsd specific gravity gs minimum maximum dry densities ρdry max ρdry min the soil gsds are shown in fig 1 according to the unified soil classification system uscs all chosen samples are poor graded uniform quartz sand s p with the same specific gravity gs of 2 65 the d50 of each selected sample ranges from 0 15 mm up to 0 55 mm compared to the other two commercial products the medium sand has a 2 3 fine content 0 075 mm slightly increasing the cohesion and adsorption between quartz sand particles the soil specifications are listed in table 1 three uniform poor graded sand samples are only selected rather than other soils in consideration of three main aspects 1 research interests 2 geotechnical laboratory vertical dimension and 3 sensor limitations first as the problem statement in the previous section the scale effects mostly matter with coarse soil e g sand and gravel but not fine soil e g silt and clay hence the sand becomes the prior option in comparison to fine gravel which has a short suction range second well graded sandy soil e g mainly sand mixed up with a small amount of gravel silty and clay could yield suction ranges over 20 kpa or even up to 100 kpa corresponding to 2 m or even up to 10 m in suction heads those higher suction ranges demand full scale soil columns over 2 m or even up to 10 m which is not feasible in most geotechnical laboratories third the sensors adopted in this work have a few limitations the hydraulic tensiometers usually work under an upper suction limit of 85 kpa so it is not applicable to fine soil under a high suction range 100 kpa in addition the spatial tdr technique relies on several assumptions of frequency independence on electrical parameters constraining the fine content 5 10 in the measured samples higher fine content or salinity in pore fluid will fail those assumptions last uniform sand and fine gravel have been often utilised in prior works investigating scale effects based on the above considerations sandy samples were only selected in this work 2 2 the hanging column test setup the hanging column method is illustrated in fig 2 a according to astm d6836 02 2003 this experiment could be set up in the following steps the entire column including a ceramic disk in air entry value aev of 1 01 103 kpa fixed inside was firstly degassed in deionised water under 1 01 103 kpa for 24 h to ensure the column bottom was utterly filled with degassed water the column bottom was then connected to a scaled burette by a floppy hose filled with degassed water all connecting processes were completed inside the degassed water so there should be a perfect bubble free hydraulic connection also the column was set in a climate chamber to alleviate evaporation after levelling the column in the chamber the static soil suction could be applied by vertically adjusting the burette elevation along with the rack a lower soil suction range of 22 kpa could be achieved in this setup because the vertical dimension was 220 cm as for the initial condition of the primary drainage test the water level in the burette should be set to the elevation of the ceramic disk after the experiment set the soil specimen should be prepared in a designated dry density ρdry porosity and initial volumetric moisture content at a fully saturated condition θ0 θs the cling wrap was then used to cover up the column top to mitigate evaporation further a few holes were pinned on the cling wrap by needles to apply the atmospheric pressure for comparing different testing methods the specimen density should be identical to the one achieved in the full scale soil column test later illustrated the specimen for this test was prepared in a column diameter of 9 5 cm with a thickness of 3 0 1 cm the tap water in the geomechanics laboratory of the university of queensland uq was used to prepare soil specimens on the rev scale under the soil suction range of 22 kpa and soil water temperature of 25 c no gas bubbles were observed under the ceramic disk during the tests according to astm d6836 02 2003 the specimen thickness was suggested to be the sampling o rings thickness at a minimum of 0 5 cm however the specimen thickness for coarse soil which has not been precisely specified in the standard raises controversies in many prior studies bottero et al 2011 dane et al 1992 liu and dane 1995 perfect et al 2004 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 schroth et al 1996 tokunaga et al 2002 therefore it is subjected to the scale effect of static swrc after the saturated specimen was loaded inside the test could be initiated by adjusting the elevation of the measuring cylinder downward in multistep the water level volume increment inside the burette equals the soil moisture expelled from the saturated specimen the volumetric moisture content after each step of outflow therefore can be calculated by 1 θ i θ i 1 v δ i v t for drainage where θi 1 and θi are previous and current volumetric moisture content vδi is the volume of expelled water for the drainage step i measured by burette and vt is the total volume of the prepared specimen as for the soil suction head hc determination many previous studies have debated it continuously a few studies recommended that the soil suction head should be the vertical distance between the specimen centre and water level in the burette when the equilibrium condition is achieved cropper et al 2011 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 however the astm d6836 02 2003 sourced from many earlier works defines the soil suction head as the vertical distance between the ceramic disk and water level in the burette every 48 h after each step of outflow for comparison between the two methods the standard method was followed ten to twenty data points were collected after the burette was moved downward every 5 10 cm for each drainage step the incremental resolution should depend on whether the suction head is close to the inflection points including aev and residual water content θr finally the static primary swrc can be given by the van genuchten swrc model van genuchten 1980 2 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h c n m where θ and hc are the volumetric moisture content and soil suction head θs and θr are the fully saturated and residual volumetric moisture contents a n and m are fitting parameters of the van genuchten swrc model the fitting work was accomplished by retc software van genuchten et al 1991 2 3 the full scale soil column test setup the full scale soil column test setup is illustrated in fig 2 b three sample selections were separately loaded into three polyvinyl chloride pvc columns length 160 cm and diameter 15 cm to measure primary drainage swrc using the one step outflow method according to fig 2 b the testing platform consists of two logging systems the accumulative outflow and soil moisture content profile logging systems the accumulative outflow logging system was made up of three ohaus ranger 3000 r31p30 bench scales for weighing the accumulative overflow from the constant head tanks this scale has a maximum capacity of 30 kg with a precision of 1 kg the weight of the overflow tank was automatically measured every 30 s by a self developed computer program the moisture content profile logging system was composed of three spatial time domain reflectometry spatial tdr flat ribbon cable frc sensors with a length of 150 cm and a width of 6 cm there were two in outputs of signal on two sensor terminals which were packed with black epoxy in a length of 5 cm for waterproofing the six terminals from three sensors were connected to the six channels on a campbell scientific sdm x50 multiplexer by coaxial cables of the same length of 300 cm the multiplexer was then connected to a campbell scientific tdr 100 and cr 1000 datalogger as tdr pulse generator receiver and automatic data collector a cr basic program was custom designed to automatically generate and receive tdr pulses from six multiplexer channels with this tdr logging system the spatial and temporal resolutions of the moisture content profile could achieve 1 cm and 1 min separately a detailed illustration of applying the spatial tdr technique particularly on tdr inversion analysis could be found in appendix a for any interest in soil moisture profile measurement the technical challenges in applying this technique for the full scale soil column tests could be found in the work of yan et al 2022a the soil column test was prepared in the following steps fig 2 b shows that the frc sensor was pre located into the column centre before the specimen fabrication a gravel filter designed based on published standards giroud 2010 was then filled down to the column bottom to fix one sensor end the soil specimen was fabricated above the gravel filter by tamping outside the column and compacting on top the water table was consistently controlled above the specimen top to ensure a fully saturated condition the tap water in the geomechanics laboratory of uq was used to fabricate full scale soil specimens the soil water temperature was kept at 25 c continuously verified by a thermometer throughout the tests as the 150 cm column provided the soil suction range of 15 kpa there should not be any issue of nucleation as well the soil sample was oven dried at 200 c for 48 h followed by mechanical crushes to eliminate segregations before filling the column adequate compactions ensured no distortion of sensor geometry and firm contact between the frc sensor and ambient soil finally the specimen was successfully fabricated as a homogeneous soil profile inside each opaque pvc column based on experiences from previous soil column tests adopting the transparent acrylic column allowing for density control by compaction in multilayers yan et al 2017 yan et al 2021a yan et al 2022a this compacting procedure could control the standard deviation of porosity under 2 the densities control for three soil columns is presented in table 2 the one step outflow soil column test was operated as follows in the beginning the groundwater table was set above the specimen top and the bottom output was connected to a constant head tank whose overflow was collected by an overflow tank measured by the bench scale then the cling wrap was used to cover the column top and other opening areas to minimise evaporation also small holes were pinned on cling wrap to apply atmospheric pressure since the one step drainage started the final equilibrium could be identified with no overflow and tdr waveform variations usually this final equilibrium condition could be achieved in a week for those uniform sandy samples see outflow logging in fig a5 in appendix a in addition as the cling wrap covers all open areas this short testing period could efficiently prevent potential evaporation see steady mean moisture logging for each soil column in fig a5 in appendix a finally the authentic primary drainage swrc the moisture content profile at the final equilibrium stage could be indirectly determined from the latest tdr waveform using the spatial tdr technique 3 result and discussion 3 1 the full scale soil column tests the final soil moisture content profiles for three soil columns are plotted in fig 3 a the soil moisture profiles above the blue highlighted phreatic line are the static primary drainage soil water retention curve swrc those swrcs clearly manifest the dependence of swrc on grain size distribution gsd soil density porosity and fine content silt and clay particles 0 075 mm for instance the swrc of medium sand in fig 3 a has the highest air entry value aev residual moisture content θr and most gradual variation of swrc slope because finer pore sizes could be generated by fitting the higher fine content 2 3 into coarse particles and a better graded pore size distribution could be generated with the higher uniformity coefficient 2 39 amongst those three selections in addition compared to the swrc of medium sand the swrcs of uniform coarse and fine sand have smaller aevs θr and steeper swrc slopes with the fine content approaching almost 0 mean grain size increasing and uniformity coefficient 1 5 moreover it should be noted that the significant fluctuations of moisture contents in the residual content zone nearby the top end and slightly abnormal close to the bottom end are due to the boundary effect of the spatial tdr technique yan et al 2021a yan et al 2022a the waterproof of sensor terminals by filling black epoxy suddenly changed the impedance continuities on both ends later involved in tdr measurement and inversion analysis yan et al 2021a yan et al 2022a it is an inevitable boundary effect embedded in the current sensor design manufacturing and mathematical inversion analysis this might occur in finer sandy soil it can be overcome by applying more extended sensors long enough to be much over the suction range of residual water content for instance as fig 3 a shows such boundary effects as long as the residual water content is achieved for the elevation over 95 cm the unreliable moisture content above 125 cm could be eliminated from the measuring focus 3 2 the standard hanging column tests fig 3 b shows the static primary drainage swrcs measured by the hanging column method for three selected samples this standard method can provide the soil moisture content and suction head in several discrete data points where the van genuchten fitting model in equation 2 was therefore fitted by retc van genuchten et al 1991 the similar dependence of swrcs on mean grain size soil grade uniformity and fine content from fig 3 a can also be found in fig 3 b however compared to fig 3 a the swrcs of coarse and medium sand in fig 3 a present much sharper swrc slopes and smaller aevs based on criticism in measuring swrc of coarse grain soil using the standard hanging column tests from previous studies dane et al 1992 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 schroth et al 1996 tokunaga et al 2002 those differences could raise concerns about the scale effect and local heterogeneity issue in the hanging column test regarding specimen thickness and suction moisture determination therefore the differences of swrcs measured by both methods need to be illustrated in detail for further discussions on physical reasons and inappropriate assumptions 3 3 the comparison between two methods fig 4 a c shows the comparisons between static primary swrcs measured using standard and full scale soil column tests for coarse medium and fine sand the fitting parameters of van genuchten for both testing methods are given in table 3 the fitting performance is good due to the root square r2 0 97 as for the coarse sand in fig 4 a it is clear to observe that the standard method compared to the full scale soil column test determines the swrc in a sharper swrc slope indicating a sharper wetting front in soil moisture profile this could also be quantitatively confirmed from van genuchten fitting parameters n for coarse sand in table 3 the higher value of n generates the sharper swrc slope in fig 4 a moreover for each soil suction head the corresponding moisture is underestimated in addition the fitting parameters a 1 aev for both methods are similar the aev given by the standard method 12 cm is 1 cm smaller than that measured by the full scale soil column test 13 cm which is smaller than the spatial resolution of the spatial tdr technique note that differences in aev 2 cm could be constrained by the aforementioned spatial resolution of 1 cm as for medium and fine sand the differences in swrc slopes given by the two methods are alleviated according to table 3 although the n values for the full scale test 50 60 are much higher than the n values for the standard test 6 10 the much lower m values 0 066 0 069 for the full scale test led to slightly sharper swrc slopes compared to the higher m values 0 47 0 63 for the standard test see fig 4 b and c in contrast the different aevs between the two methods are pretty obvious with the fitting parameter a 1 aev the aevs determined by the standard method are a few centimetres 2 cm smaller than the aevs measured by the full scale soil column test those distinctions highlighted here are due to the so called scale effect in the swrc measured using the hanging column method the scale effect challenges the representativeness of soil specimen loaded in the hanging column as a genuine and effective soil representative elementary volume rev being tested regarding specimen thickness soil suction and moisture content determination and correlation 3 4 discussion and illustration based on previous studies bottero et al 2011 dane et al 1992 jalbert and dane 2001 kang et al 2014 perfect et al 2004 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 tokunaga et al 2002 the possible reasons for scale effects could be categorised into three main aspects incorrectly assigning soil suction to a coarse soil rev miscorrelating the bulk moisture content with such a soil suction and soil moisture underestimation caused by a combination of local heterogeneity and atmospheric pressure on rev top as illustrated in fig 5 the specimen was prepared with a sampling o ring in a thickness of a few centimetres for a coarser soil the larger pores could be formed on top of the specimen surface which allows a lower aev and reduction of the initial and following bulk moisture contents as the atmospheric pressure directly was applied on the top boundary in contrast the upper boundary of an authentic rev as a point wise segment in the soil column was directly connected to an upper layer specifically the pressure gradient between the top and bottom of the specimen in the hanging column is the pressure difference between suction applied on ceramic disk and atmospheric pressure while the suction gradient for a point wise rev in soil column can approach the ideal case as infinitely small due to such an inevitable local heterogeneity on the top boundary the larger pressure gradient applied on the specimen in the standard test is not exactly identical to the suction gradient on the point wised rev in the soil profile and further results in the underestimation of bulk moisture contents and aev in addition the slope of swrc can also be sharpened due to such underestimations see fig 4 a with an underestimated aev and overestimated capillary specific storage slope of swrc both thicknesses of fully saturated capillary fringe and capillary fingers in the vadose zone could not be precisely modelled using the richards equation furthermore according to fig 4 a c it is also clear to see that with the sample becomes finer and better graded such a pressure gradient and local heterogeneous effects less influence the swrcs measured by the standard test as the results from both methods mutually overlap better in fig 4 b and c on the other hand despite the bulk moisture contents being underestimated the soil suction assigned to the specimen is also not the representative soil suction but the backpressure applied on the ceramic disk the soil suction assigned is also shifted downward with the variation of specimen thickness it further underestimates the actual soil suction for each bulk moisture content including aev a combining effect also smooths the swrcs around the aev by correlating the backpressures with potentially undervalued moisture contents also it slightly levels up the moisture contents above the saturated capillary fringe shown in fig 4 b and c indicating more gradual slopes of swrcs this finding is similar to the smoothing effect defined by sakaki and illangasekare 2007 in such a case the aev and capillary specific storage of the vadose zone slope of swrc will be both underestimated leading to inaccurate predictions by the richards model as well in order to resolve the scale effects several previous contributions already recommended the application of point wise moisture and suction measurement inside a hanging column test instead of conventional determination for both variables liu and dane 1995 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 others also applied the suction averaging method for correction and comparison bottero et al 2011 dane et al 1992 schroth et al 1996 tokunaga et al 2002 and inversion analysis of the richards model on accumulative outflow data to back calculate swrc cropper et al 2011 peters and durner 2006 simunek et al 2013 nevertheless only a few studies have measured the final moisture content profile using multiple point wise tdr sensors in those studies there are fewer findings of disagreement between soil column and standard tests chapuis et al 2007 lins et al 2009 this work implemented the one step outflow drainage test using the spatial tdr technique it indirectly measured the soil moisture content profile at the final stage through tdr inversion analysis the research findings unveil the scale effect in swrc tested by the standard method for poorly graded sand also the results certainly agree with the smoothing effects investigated in several previous studies using point wise tdr and neutron radiography kang et al 2014 sakaki and illangasekare 2007 4 concluding remarks this work investigated the scale effects in soil water retention curve swrc of coarse grained soil by comparing primary swrcs measured by the standard hanging column method and full scale soil column test compared to other full scale column tests that adopted point wise sensors in prior studies this work applied the spatial time domain reflectometry spatial tdr technique to measure the final soil moisture profile after a one step outflow was accomplished the authentic primary drainage curves could be identified as the final soil moisture profiles based on unsaturated soil theory the experimental outcomes show that the primary drainage curves determined by the standard method differ from the authentic primary drainage curves for coarse sand the standard method underestimates the aev and moisture content for each soil suction head resulting in a steeper swrc slope a sharper wetting front but only agrees on residual moisture content for medium and fine sand such discrepancies are diminished whereas the aev is still slightly underestimated by the standard method and moisture contents along the vadose zone are slightly overestimated leading to a more gradual swrc slope a more gradual wetting front based on former and current works reporting those issues the reasons for observing such disagreements are theoretically illustrated in the following points 1 the local heterogeneity large pore throats on the top surface of coarse grained soil cannot self sustain water under atmospheric pressure without connecting to a potential upper layer like a continuous soil profile the bulk moisture of a soil specimen will be underestimated due to this moisture loss which is manifested as a sharper swrc with a lower air entry value aev 2 as the soil suction determined by the standard method is in fact the backpressure applied on the ceramic disk the soil suction measurement accuracy is highly sensitive to the thickness of a soil specimen with a thicker specimen of coarse soils that complies with the representative elementary volume rev concept the backpressure applied might differ from the actual soil suction 3 correlating the backpressure with the underestimated bulk moisture content can further deviate the measured curve from the actual swrc which is demonstrated as smoothing the curve around an underestimated aev and slightly overestimated swrc slope moreover the challenges and limitations of carrying out the full scale soil column tests have to be noted first to ensure the homogeneity of a soil column the dry density along the soil profile should be carefully controlled to achieve a mean porosity with a standard deviation of 1 2 failing to control the dry density close to the maximum dry density may cause volume change during drainage second the spatial tdr technique can only accurately measure soil moisture profiles for coarse particles e g gravel sand glass beads etc without high fine content e g silt and clay 10 more fine content could challenge the assumptions of frequency independent electrical parameters along the spatial tdr sensor also higher clay content may lead to drying induced volume shrinkage the shrunk soil specimen will jeopardise the intimate contact between the sensor and ambient soil further causing the underestimation of soil moisture there is a wish that further developing the frequency domain reflectometry fdr with the fdr inversion technique can provide an alternative technique to measure the soil moisture profile for a soil sample having high fine content nonetheless since the scale effects often occur for coarser soil the point wise measurement should be much more reliable for finer soil hence soil moisture profile detection seems not urgent for such samples in conclusion the full scale soil column test can be applied to avoid scale effects despite demanding high costs and massive labour efforts besides a shorter soil column incorporating point wise suction and moisture sensors in prior studies could also be a fast alternative solution credit authorship contribution

anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments appendix a applying spatial time domain reflectometry a1 time domain reflectometry the time domain reflectometry tdr technique has been applied to monitor unsaturated soil moisture content and density bhuyan et al 2017 topp et al 1980 saturated soil porosity and permeability bittner et al 2019 scheuermann 2012 the success of quantitative water content estimation in porous media by tdr techniques is caused by the dipolar character of the water molecules resulting in a high permittivity in comparison to other phases such as solid particles or gas inclusions an illustration of tdr measurement and waveform analysis is shown in fig a1 conventional tdr sensors for soil applications consist of a one port waveguide made of several rods the probe is connected to a tdr device via a coaxial cable the tdr device consists of a tdr pulse generator for sending tdr pulse and an oscilloscope for recording the reflection returned with the pulse transmitted through the coaxial cable and probe surrounded by soil the impedance mismatch caused by variation of surrounding material can be reflected from the beginning to the end of a tdr probe this reflection in time scale is received into oscilloscope as a tdr trace or waveform the dual tangent method huisman et al 2002 can then be applied to the tdr waveform to determine the first and second inflection points highlighting the impedance variation from the beginning to the end of the tdr probe the flight time between two inflection points is identified as the travel time δ t along with the tdr probe an apparent permittivity εapp can be computed from the travel time with the following equation a1 ε app 1 4 c δ t l probe 2 where c is the speed of the light and lprobe is the length of the probe for most soils the relative permittivity εr is a frequency dependent complex number with the imaginary part reflecting dielectric loss which can arise from electrical conduction or different polarisation processes bore et al 2016 in general moist soils present complex permittivity values depending on frequency dispersion but tdr measurements result in a single bulk permittivity or apparent permittivity εapp value that corresponds to a particular but unknown effective frequency called feff several studies have investigated these effective frequencies in past years robinson et al 2005 although the influencing parameters are not well understood it is well accepted that soil with moderate dispersion e g without clays presents an effective frequency around 1 ghz εapp εr feff 1 ghz the soil moisture content can be then computed from the measured apparent permittivity with different methods the most popular method by far is the use of the universal topp s equation calibration topp et al 1980 which is a third order polynomial form a2 θ 5 3 10 2 2 92 10 2 ε app 5 5 10 4 ε app 2 4 3 10 6 ε app 3 where θ and εapp are soil volumetric moisture content and apparent permittivity despite its broad use in soil science it is well known that topp s equation fails to describe the θ εapp relationship for clayey soils bore et al 2018 in order to account for soil structure theoretical mixture rules dobson et al 1985 were introduced to compute the θ εapp relationship and were later extended by introducing phenomenological materials equations bore et al 2018 although this approach has shown promising results it is still confronted with theoretical challenges in this context specific material calibration is generally preferred but requires an important of amount work in the laboratory a2 soil moisture apparent permittivity calibration in order to avoid manipulating a large amount of material to perform the specific calibration the complex permittivity of the three selected soils was measured for different water content and density with the combination of a vector network analyzer vna and open ended oe probe in fig a2 this method is prevalent due to its simplicity it can be shown that the frequency dependant complex permittivity can be linked to the measured scattering function with a simple bilinear relationship wagner et al 2013 a3 ε r ω c 1 ω s 11 ω c 2 ω c 3 ω s 11 ω where s11 ω is the measured scattering function reflection only c1 ω c2 ω c3 ω are the frequency dependent calibration functions an in house oe probe was built based on an n type connector and embedded in a cylindrical sample holder mishra et al 2018 bore et al 2021 see fig a2 a and b before measurements an open short load osl calibration was performed the probe was then calibrated by measuring three perfectly known dielectric materials deionised water methanol and air the theoretical values for the complex permittivity of the two fluids were found in the literature kaatze 2007 the complete details of the procedure can be sourced from the work of wagner et al 2013 the specific calibrations for three samples are shown in fig a3 a c according to fig a3 b and c topp s equation seems to be relatively reliable for the finer group including the medium and fine sand with a slight bias of 1 3 volumetric moisture content however fig a3 a shows the coarse sand having different fitting parameters in the third order polynomial equation therefore if the vna tests were not carried out the inaccuracy caused by directly applying topp s equation would be over 3 volumetric moisture content thus the vna test is highly recommended to be implemented for a more precise tdr measurement a3 spatial tdr sensor design and validation the soil moisture group smg at the karlsruhe institute of technology kit germany improved the conventional tdr to the spatial tdr technique in order to measure soil moisture content distribution for a soil profile using only one sensor instead of multiple sensors point wisely the probe type tdr sensor was modified to become the flat ribbon cable frc sensor made of polyethene in which three copper wires are packed as shown in fig a4 b both terminals of the sensor body are configured to a coaxial cable see fig a4 a and later covered by a black epoxy package for waterproofing see fig a4 b fig a4 c illustrates the capacitance model of the frc sensor cross section in fig a4 b the capacitance model of the sensor cross section already specifies the capacitances c1 c 2 and c3 as well as the soil permittivity εr the capacitances were calibrated in previous works schlaeger 2005 and the soil permittivity is calculated by a4 c ε r ε r c 3 c 2 ε r c 3 c 2 c 1 where c1 3 4 pf m c 2 323 pf m and c3 14 8 pf m c is the total capacitance for the coating material and ambient soil εr is the corresponding relative permittivity then the soil permittivity profile surrounding the frc sensor can be calculated from the total capacitance profile using equation a4 also the spatial tdr sensor can be used to measure the mean soil moisture content of a soil profile after the travel time δ t is determined by the dual tangent method the total capacitance of the entire soil profile can be given by a5 c ε r 1 l 0 δ t 2 l probe 2 where c and εr are separately the total capacitance and relative permittivity for a soil profile l0 is the sensor inductance l0 756 nh m δ t is the travel time given by the dual tangent method on a tdr waveform lprobe is the sensor length with conventional tdr waveform analysis and equations a4 and a5 the mean soil moisture content variation could be continually detected for each soil column under transient draining conditions and later validated by the outflow logging the specific calibrations provided by the vna tests also have potential errors resulting from any human operation on soil density and moisture control the outflow logging data can be used as a backup method to validate those calibrations on the one hand the accumulative outflow is the water drained out of each soil column therefore the mean moisture content for each column can be inversely calculated from the volume of accumulative discharge on the other hand the spatial tdr technique can be downgraded to the conventional tdr technique hence the mean moisture content for each column can also be detected using a traditional tdr analysis the moisture contents given by both methods are mutually compared for the three samples in fig a5 a c according to the good agreements shown in fig a5 it is able to confirm the apparent permittivity volumetric moisture content calibrations by vna tests as reliable and robust specific calibrations a4 tdr inversion analysis and performance in order to extract the capacitance profile from a pair of tdr waveforms collected from two sensor terminals two way tdr tracing an infinite small section of sensor electrical circuit was conceptually modelled in fig a6 a and the two way tdr tracing is illustrated in fig a6 b where r and l are the resistivity r 0 and inductance l l0 756 nh m c and g are unknown capacitance and conductance profiles in need of numerical solutions v is the voltage plotted in the form of the reflection coefficient in tdr waveform huebner et al 2005 as the reflection coefficient is the ratio between reflecting and exciting voltages v v0 for this conceptual model the electrical parameter settings with an assumption for lower frequency 104 hz can be found in previous developments in detail scheuermann et al 2009 huebner et al 2005 based on the electrical model shown in fig a6 the frc sensor can be mathematically simulated by the telegraph equations schlaeger 2005 schlaeger 2005 transformed two telegraph governing equations into single partial differential equations pde in second order as a6 lc x 2 t 2 l g x t 1 l l x x 2 x 2 v i x t 0 where x is the sensor length t is the time c x and g x are capacitance and conductance profiles vi x is the voltage profile that can be transformed into tdr waveforms i 1 2 indicate the first and second tdr tracing from both terminals the c and g profiles are inputs for the forward modelling so the outcomes in tdr waveforms can be numerically solved from equation a6 using a finite difference scheme schlaeger 2005 as the tdr waveforms can be measured using tdr devices and the c and g profiles are two unknown inputs an optimisation algorithm was subsequentially developed by schlaeger 2005 to determine the c and g profiles inversely the cost function of tdr waveform inversion analysis is a7 j c g i 1 2 0 2 t v i s x i t c g v i m x i t 2 d t where j is the cost function of c and g profiles t is the travel time δ t between x1 and x2 vi s and vi m are the simulated and measured voltage profiles i indicates the first and second tdr tracing the optimisation method has been detailed by schlaeger 2005 the comparison between the measured and simulated tdr waveforms individually highlighted in green and blue is shown in fig a7 to demonstrate the performance of tdr inversion analysis applied to the tdr waveforms at the final equilibrium stage fig a7 a c shows acceptable agreements between the measured and simulated tdr waveforms therefore it is able to confirm the reliability of capacitance profiles inversely determined by the optimisation algorithm developed by schlaeger 2005 the capacitance profiles reconstructed by the inversion analysis can be subsequentially transferred into the permittivity profile using equation a4 eventually the soil volumetric moisture content distribution can be determined from the permittivity profile using specific calibrations in fig a3 a c to better illustrate the aforementioned process the tdr inversion analysis is schematically sketched in fig a8 
2981,terrestrial evapotranspiration et is a critical process in water energy and carbon cycles but challenging to estimate several gridded terrestrial et products have been developed for regional or global applications based on different algorithms and forcing inputs and with different temporal spatial resolutions and accuracy this study systematically investigates the consistency and uncertainty of eight et products over china for the period from 2003 to 2014 temporal and spatial pairwise correlation analysis indicates that the et products are largely consistent with each other among which the et estimates from gleam and eb et presenting highest spatial consistency with each other r2 0 91 compared to the ground based observations from the flux network the centered root mean squared deviation rmsd for each of the eight products is found lower than 30 mm month according to which cr and pmlv2 outperform the others the et products however show considerable difference in the estimated mean annual et averaged over china from 378 mm a to 528 mm a uncertainty assessment based on the extended collocation method ecm suggests the uncertainties in et estimates are more evident in the arid region than in the humid region it also indicates that model averaging like that in generating the glass et product could substantially reduce the uncertainties the findings of this research could facilitate the application of the et products to assess water balance dynamics over china while considering their uncertainties keywords terrestrial evapotranspiration remote sensing consistency and uncertainty china data availability the data used in this research are publicly available accessing links to the origional datasets are presented in table 1 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et is an essential variable interconnecting the water energy and carbon budgets of the land surface jung et al 2010 wang and dickinson 2012 it comprises evaporation from soil water or canopy surfaces and transpiration through plant stomata burman and pochop 1994 liu et al 2022 on a global scale 48 of the surface net radiation is consumed via evapotranspiration peixoto 1995 as a primary component of the global water cycle over 60 of terrestrial precipitation returns to the atmosphere in the form of et oki and kanae 2006 the returning ratio can be as high as 90 in arid regions novák 2012 extreme hydrometeorological events such as droughts and heatwaves are closely related to et processes piao et al 2019 in the context of global warming and intensifying human activities it is with increasing importance to better measure or estimate et at a regional global scale pan et al 2020 conventionally et could be measured via lysimeter eddy covariance large aperture scintillometer and the bowen ratio method which however are limited to provide et measurements at point and local scales wang and dickinson 2012 large scale et estimates usually depend on remote sensing anderson et al 2011 mu et al 2011 senay et al 2013 hydrological modeling or land surface modeling li et al 2012 long et al 2014 and machine learning algorithms as well xu et al 2019 to date due to the increasing availability of the satellite based earth observations a number of regional and global gridded et products with different spatial temporal resolutions have been developed and iteratively improved however large uncertainty still exists in quantifying the magnitude of regional or global terrestrial et and its spatial and temporal patterns liu et al 2008 miralles et al 2016 mueller et al 2011 tian et al 2010 these uncertainties could be because of model structure deficiencies reliability of input e g surface meteorological forcing soil and vegetation related parameters model parameterization and scaling issues jia et al 2012 xia et al 2015 it is therefore critical to evaluate the accessible gridded et products prior to using them in investigating changes in water energy and carbon cycles and in water resources management as reported in some recent researches liu et al 2016 long et al 2014 mueller et al 2013 mueller et al 2011 trambauer et al 2014 vinukollu et al 2011 wartenburger et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a the gridded et products can be evaluated by comparing to the ground based measurements from eddy covariance instruments at a point scale jung et al 2010 martens et al 2017 mu et al 2011 senay et al 2013 wilson et al 2002 xia et al 2015 xu et al 2017 which however is not widely available to assess the et products over a regional scale statistical methods like triple collocation tc proposed by stoffelen 1998 have been used to quantify the uncertainty of the datasets without the need of prior knowledge scipal et al 2008 tavella and premoli 1994 the extended collocation method ecm later developed by gruber et al 2016 facilitated the application of the collocation approach for assessing uncertainties for more than three datasets the tc or ecm method has been successfully used to quantify uncertainties of gridded datasets about precipitation awange et al 2016 wu et al 2019 soil moisture crow et al 2015 miralles et al 2010 scipal et al 2008 grace ferreira et al 2016 and evapotranspiration khan et al 2018 long et al 2007 xu et al 2019 at a regional scale for the gridded et estimates over china only part of the currently available products has been evaluated by comparing to the flux observation at a point scale or the output from water balance model at a catchment scale bai and liu 2018 chen et al 2014 michel et al 2016 in this research we aim to assess systematically the consistency and uncertainty of a larger set of gridded et products which include eight et products gleam eb et glass clsm noah cr pmlv2 hyp et developed by different researchers using different algorithms and forcing inputs a systematic framework is set up for the assessment which consists of comparing the et estimates against the ground based observations spatial and temporal intercomparison and grid scale uncertainty quantification using the ecm the assessment is conducted at different temporal scales over a wide region the china domain with various hydroclimatic conditions and substantial differences in evapotranspiration process the findings of this research are expected to facilitate the application of the et products to assess water balance dynamics while considering the uncertainties 2 data 2 1 gridded terrestrial evapotranspiration products in this study eight gridded terrestrial evapotranspiration products derived based on different algorithm are considered the sources algorithm temporal and spatial resolutions of these products are summarized in table 1 the primary remotely sensed data used in generating the products are also listed in table 1 among the eight products the daily et product hyp et was recently developed by aerospace information research institute of chinese academy of sciences using the generalized nonlinear complementary relationship gcr model brutsaert 2015 with climate forcings from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd yang and he 2019 the climate input and model used is same to that in generating cr product ma et al 2019 but with different parameterization scheme and remotely sensed data it should be noted that different from the other seven products the glass et yao et al 2014 is a merging product generated by bayesian model averaging over outputs from five models since the eight products are of different temporal and spatial resolutions they are resampled to 0 25 by 0 25 resolution and aggregated to monthly scale for the period from 2003 to 2014 2 2 evapotranspiration from flux networks evapotranspiration measured via eddy covariance ec from 10 observation sites is used to assess the grided et products the 10 sites are within the chinaflux network and the data are downloaded from fluxnet2015 dataset pastorello et al 2020 locations of the 10 sites are shown in figure s1 in supplementary they cover different ecosystem types across china including mixed forest grassland evergreen broadleaf forest evergreen needleleaf forests and shrubland data quality check is implemented to remove the outliers and the energy imbalance of the dataset is corrected according to the bowen ratio 3 methods 3 1 intercomparison of the et products intercomparison of the eight grided et products is conducted to investigate their consistency both in space and in time for spatial consistency the coefficient of determination r2 is calculated for each paired dataset as 1 r 2 a b c o v a b s a s b 2 where cov a b is the covariance of a specific et metrics from two datasets a and b s a and s b are the spatial standard deviations of a and b the et metrics considered in this study include the long term mean annual et and long term mean monthly et for each calendar month at each grid the coefficient of variation c v of mean annual et is calculated to represent the consistency among et products which is defined as 2 c vi s i x i 100 where s i and x i is the standard deviation and mean of the eight et estimates at the i grid the smaller the c v value the higher the consistency is the et estimates for temporal consistency the r2 of monthly et averaging over china for each paired products are calculated in addition the consistency in the long term trend of the estimated annual et averaging over china is compared the trend is detected by using the mann kendall mk test kendall 1955 mann 1945 which is a rank based nonparametric method widely applied in hydroclimatic studies guo et al 2020 sayemuzzaman and jha 2014 3 2 uncertainty quantification using extended collocation method the traditional triple collocation tc proposed by stoffelen 1998 is used to assess the uncertainty of any three datasets by cross validating without knowing true value and output the root mean squared deviation rmsd for each dataset for datasets with more than three sources gruber et al 2016 later proposed an extended collocation method ecm referring to zwieback et al 2012 the ecm analysis estimates error cross correlations by generalizing the tc method to an arbitrary number of n datasets and relax the assumption of zero error cross correlation for certain dataset combinations while maintaining the assumption of orthogonal errors for all data sets gruber et al 2016 the principle equations in ecm for estimating rmsd of each dataset can be summarized as σ i 2 β i 2 σ θ 2 σ ε i 2 i σ ij β i β j σ θ 2 σ ε i ε j i j w h e r e σ ε i ε j 0 3 σ ij σ ik

relationships with the unknown true value θ ε is the zero mean random noise σ i 2 is the variance of i dataset i e square of rmsd while σ ij is the covariance between the i and j eq 3 can be written in a matrix form 4 y σ i 2 σ ij σ ij σ ik σ jk σ ik σ jl σ kl a 1010 0101 1000 0100 x β i 2 σ θ 2 β i β j σ θ 2 σ ε i 2 σ ε i ε j where y a x the actual dimensions of the three matrix depend on the number of dataset and on the number of dataset pairs which are a priori assumed to have correlated errors gruber et al 2016 the unknow vector x can be estimated by solving the linear equations x a t a 1 a t y the equations can be solved by the least squared estimation to ensure the system is soluble a t a has to have full rank for more details about the ecm refer to gruber et al 2016 scipal et al 2008 for the application of the ecm in this study we assume three pairwise products are with cross correlated errors which are clsm and noah both are from land surface model glass and gleam both use p t equation cr and hyp et both base on gcr model and the same forcing data by solving eq 4 the estimated rmsd is used to quantify the uncertainty of the products while rmsd mean is emploied as an indicator to quantify the relative uncertainty of the products in this study 4 results and discussions 4 1 spatial consistency of the gridded et products over china fig 1 shows the mean annual et for the period 2003 2014 for each of the eight products overall the eight products consistently show a southeast to northwest decreasing trend in the mean annual et over china the highest annual et in the southmost china could be above 1400 mm a while the lowest et in the northwest china is below 50 mm a fig 1i shows the variability c v of the estimated mean annual evapotranspiration among the eight products for each grid over china it shows the region with higher mean annual evapotranspiration tends to have lower variability the variability of mean annual et among the eight et products is found to be the highest in the northwest region dry region of china the pairwise spatial consistency of the estimated annual et from the eight products is assessed according to the coefficient of determination r2 which is calculated based on annual et for all grids across china and shown in the lower triangle in fig 2 in most cases of the pairwise comparison 71 r2 is above 0 8 indicating significant spatial consistency between the products the highest spatial consistency of the estimated mean annual et is found between gleam and eb et r2 0 91 followed by consistency between glass and gleam r2 0 90 in general gleam shows higher r2 and more comparable with the other seven products while pmlv2 shows relatively lower r2 particularly pmlv2 tends to have higher mean annual et fig 3 further shows the pairwise spatial consistency of mean evapotranspiration for each calendar month similar to that for the annual evapotranspiration the highest spatial consistency for the monthly evapotranspiration is found between gleam and glass between gleam and eb et and between cr and hyp et among all products the spatial consistency of pmlv2 against other products is relatively lower spatial consistency among products is found higher in august to november the highest in october but the lowest in in march 4 2 temporal consistency of et averaged over china the upper triangle in fig 2 shows the temporary consistency among the eight products for the monthly evapotranspiration averaged over china from 2003 to 2014 the r2 between the pairwise products is found to be above 0 9 in most cases except for the correlations of eb et against clsm and noah as further shown in fig 4 a the monthly ets averaged over china from all products consistently peak in july and reaches its lowest in december or january the highest temporary consistency is that between glass and gleam r2 0 99 the monthly et time series derived from glass and gleam are highly comparable with other products while the monthly et from eb et is with lower consistency with the other products for the estimated monthly et fig 4a clearly shows that the differences among the eight products are higher in summer jja and winter djf for the summer season with high evapotranspiration the et estimates from pmlv2 is larger than the other products while that from gleam is the lowest the difference between pmlv2 and gleam could reach up to 20 mm month in july for the winter season the et estimates from clsm 18 5 mm month is much higher than the others while that from cr 4 6 mm month is the lowest the results indicate that the estimated national average et for the summer and the winter seasons are with higher uncertainties the national average et for the period 2003 2014 shows noticeable differences at annual scale among products fig 4b the long term mean annual et averaged over china derived from the eight products ranges from 378 mm a from eb et to 528 mm a from pmlv2 annual et derived from clsm and noah shows higher interannual variability than that from the other products while eb et has the lowest interannual variability fig 4b also shows the trends of the annual et from each product where the trends are represented by the sen s slope in the mann kendall analysis wilson et al 2002 wu et al 2019 though the trends are not all statistically significant it can be seen that the trends vary greatly among products where glass cr and eb et show decreasing trends while other products show increasing trends in the national average et it is noticed that annual et derived from cr shows the highest decreasing rate 1 78 mm a in the period 2003 2014 which is contrast to that from hyp et 0 20 mm a although both cr and hyp et are based on the same et model i e the generalized complementary relationship and same climate inputs i e cmfd this could be because of the differences in the remotely sensed data and parameterization schemes used in two products the temporal inconsistency among the products suggests considerable uncertainties exist in the estimated et due to the algorithms and forcing data used it is therefore critical to assess the accuracy and quantify the uncertainty for each of the products prior to their practical applications 4 3 accuracy of gridded et products assessed against observations the accuracy of the gridded et product is assessed by comparing against the monthly observations of 10 sites in the chinaflux network see section 2 2 three performance metrics are calculated at monthly scale for each product and at each site the metrics are collectively shown in the taylor diagram taylor 2001 which include the correlation coefficient the centered root mean squared deviation rmsd and the difference in standard deviation fig 5 it shows that the gridded et products are generally in good agreement with the observations where the correlation coefficients are all above 0 7 and centered rmsds are less than 30 mm month the standard deviation of the monthly mean et from the eight products however varies in a wide range and could underestimate overestimate that based on the flux tower observations among the eight products the et estimates from cr and pmlv2 are more comparable to the observations than that from the other products the correlation coefficients between et from cr and from observation could be higher than 0 99 in sites a e and i while that for pmlv2 could reach to 0 98 in sites b and f this could be because that both cr and pmlv2 used the observations from the same sites to parameterize and validate their models while et of glass gleam and eb et was validated by different sites on the other end the et estimates from clsm and eb et show lower agreement with observation it is noticed that the et products perform differently at

the et products with relative higher rmsd are clsm 8 7 mm month and noah 8 4 mm month spatially all gridded et products show higher rmsd in the southwest china where the mean annual evapotranspiration

consistent with each other but with noticeable differences in the interannual variability the estimated mean annual et averaged over china from the eight products range from 378 mm a to 528 mm a indicating considerable uncertainties in the et products among the eight products et estimates from cr and pmlv2 are found in better agreement with observations from flux towers as a product merging multiple et estimates based on different algorithms glass shows to have the lowest uncertainties in et estimates across china it is noticed that all the eight gridded et products show greater uncertainties in the southwest china in terms of absolute error where terrestrial topography is complex and the climate inputs to the models could be of higher uncertainty greater uncertainties in terms of relative error however are found in the northwest china where evapotranspiration is lower than the other regions due to a drier climate and with sparse ground based meteorological observations for the practical application of the et products it would be therefore valuable to use the mean or median of the et ensembles as a robust estimation while use the range of the et

2981,terrestrial evapotranspiration et is a critical process in water energy and carbon cycles but challenging to estimate several gridded terrestrial et products have been developed for regional or global applications based on different algorithms and forcing inputs and with different temporal spatial resolutions and accuracy this study systematically investigates the consistency and uncertainty of eight et products over china for the period from 2003 to 2014 temporal and spatial pairwise correlation analysis indicates that the et products are largely consistent with each other among which the et estimates from gleam and eb et presenting highest spatial consistency with each other r2 0 91 compared to the ground based observations from the flux network the centered root mean squared deviation rmsd for each of the eight products is found lower than 30 mm month according to which cr and pmlv2 outperform the others the et products however show considerable difference in the estimated mean annual et averaged over china from 378 mm a to 528 mm a uncertainty assessment based on the extended collocation method ecm suggests the uncertainties in et estimates are more evident in the arid region than in the humid region it also indicates that model averaging like that in generating the glass et product could substantially reduce the uncertainties the findings of this research could facilitate the application of the et products to assess water balance dynamics over china while considering their uncertainties keywords terrestrial evapotranspiration remote sensing consistency and uncertainty china data availability the data used in this research are publicly available accessing links to the origional datasets are presented in table 1 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et is an essential variable interconnecting the water energy and carbon budgets of the land surface jung et al 2010 wang and dickinson 2012 it comprises evaporation from soil water or canopy surfaces and transpiration through plant stomata burman and pochop 1994 liu et al 2022 on a global scale 48 of the surface net radiation is consumed via evapotranspiration peixoto 1995 as a primary component of the global water cycle over 60 of terrestrial precipitation returns to the atmosphere in the form of et oki and kanae 2006 the returning ratio can be as high as 90 in arid regions novák 2012 extreme hydrometeorological events such as droughts and heatwaves are closely related to et processes piao et al 2019 in the context of global warming and intensifying human activities it is with increasing importance to better measure or estimate et at a regional global scale pan et al 2020 conventionally et could be measured via lysimeter eddy covariance large aperture scintillometer and the bowen ratio method which however are limited to provide et measurements at point and local scales wang and dickinson 2012 large scale et estimates usually depend on remote sensing anderson et al 2011 mu et al 2011 senay et al 2013 hydrological modeling or land surface modeling li et al 2012 long et al 2014 and machine learning algorithms as well xu et al 2019 to date due to the increasing availability of the satellite based earth observations a number of regional and global gridded et products with different spatial temporal resolutions have been developed and iteratively improved however large uncertainty still exists in quantifying the magnitude of regional or global terrestrial et and its spatial and temporal patterns liu et al 2008 miralles et al 2016 mueller et al 2011 tian et al 2010 these uncertainties could be because of model structure deficiencies reliability of input e g surface meteorological forcing soil and vegetation related parameters model parameterization and scaling issues jia et al 2012 xia et al 2015 it is therefore critical to evaluate the accessible gridded et products prior to using them in investigating changes in water energy and carbon cycles and in water resources management as reported in some recent researches liu et al 2016 long et al 2014 mueller et al 2013 mueller et al 2011 trambauer et al 2014 vinukollu et al 2011 wartenburger et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a the gridded et products can be evaluated by comparing to the ground based measurements from eddy covariance instruments at a point scale jung et al 2010 martens et al 2017 mu et al 2011 senay et al 2013 wilson et al 2002 xia et al 2015 xu et al 2017 which however is not widely available to assess the et products over a regional scale statistical methods like triple collocation tc proposed by stoffelen 1998 have been used to quantify the uncertainty of the datasets without the need of prior knowledge scipal et al 2008 tavella and premoli 1994 the extended collocation method ecm later developed by gruber et al 2016 facilitated the application of the collocation approach for assessing uncertainties for more than three datasets the tc or ecm method has been successfully used to quantify uncertainties of gridded datasets about precipitation awange et al 2016 wu et al 2019 soil moisture crow et al 2015 miralles et al 2010 scipal et al 2008 grace ferreira et al 2016 and evapotranspiration khan et al 2018 long et al 2007 xu et al 2019 at a regional scale for the gridded et estimates over china only part of the currently available products has been evaluated by comparing to the flux observation at a point scale or the output from water balance model at a catchment scale bai and liu 2018 chen et al 2014 michel et al 2016 in this research we aim to assess systematically the consistency and uncertainty of a larger set of gridded et products which include eight et products gleam eb et glass clsm noah cr pmlv2 hyp et developed by different researchers using different algorithms and forcing inputs a systematic framework is set up for the assessment which consists of comparing the et estimates against the ground based observations spatial and temporal intercomparison and grid scale uncertainty quantification using the ecm the assessment is conducted at different temporal scales over a wide region the china domain with various hydroclimatic conditions and substantial differences in evapotranspiration process the findings of this research are expected to facilitate the application of the et products to assess water balance dynamics while considering the uncertainties 2 data 2 1 gridded terrestrial evapotranspiration products in this study eight gridded terrestrial evapotranspiration products derived based on different algorithm are considered the sources algorithm temporal and spatial resolutions of these products are summarized in table 1 the primary remotely sensed data used in generating the products are also listed in table 1 among the eight products the daily et product hyp et was recently developed by aerospace information research institute of chinese academy of sciences using the generalized nonlinear complementary relationship gcr model brutsaert 2015 with climate forcings from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd yang and he 2019 the climate input and model used is same to that in generating cr product ma et al 2019 but with different parameterization scheme and remotely sensed data it should be noted that different from the other seven products the glass et yao et al 2014 is a merging product generated by bayesian model averaging over outputs from five models since the eight products are of different temporal and spatial resolutions they are resampled to 0 25 by 0 25 resolution and aggregated to monthly scale for the period from 2003 to 2014 2 2 evapotranspiration from flux networks evapotranspiration measured via eddy covariance ec from 10 observation sites is used to assess the grided et products the 10 sites are within the chinaflux network and the data are downloaded from fluxnet2015 dataset pastorello et al 2020 locations of the 10 sites are shown in figure s1 in supplementary they cover different ecosystem types across china including mixed forest grassland evergreen broadleaf forest evergreen needleleaf forests and shrubland data quality check is implemented to remove the outliers and the energy imbalance of the dataset is corrected according to the bowen ratio 3 methods 3 1 intercomparison of the et products intercomparison of the eight grided et products is conducted to investigate their consistency both in space and in time for spatial consistency the coefficient of determination r2 is calculated for each paired dataset as 1 r 2 a b c o v a b s a s b 2 where cov a b is the covariance of a specific et metrics from two datasets a and b s a and s b are the spatial standard deviations of a and b the et metrics considered in this study include the long term mean annual et and long term mean monthly et for each calendar month at each grid the coefficient of variation c v of mean annual et is calculated to represent the consistency among et products which is defined as 2 c vi s i x i 100 where s i and x i is the standard deviation and mean of the eight et estimates at the i grid the smaller the c v value the higher the consistency is the et estimates for temporal consistency the r2 of monthly et averaging over china for each paired products are calculated in addition the consistency in the long term trend of the estimated annual et averaging over china is compared the trend is detected by using the mann kendall mk test kendall 1955 mann 1945 which is a rank based nonparametric method widely applied in hydroclimatic studies guo et al 2020 sayemuzzaman and jha 2014 3 2 uncertainty quantification using extended collocation method the traditional triple collocation tc proposed by stoffelen 1998 is used to assess the uncertainty of any three datasets by cross validating without knowing true value and output the root mean squared deviation rmsd for each dataset for datasets with more than three sources gruber et al 2016 later proposed an extended collocation method ecm referring to zwieback et al 2012 the ecm analysis estimates error cross correlations by generalizing the tc method to an arbitrary number of n datasets and relax the assumption of zero error cross correlation for certain dataset combinations while maintaining the assumption of orthogonal errors for all data sets gruber et al 2016 the principle equations in ecm for estimating rmsd of each dataset can be summarized as σ i 2 β i 2 σ θ 2 σ ε i 2 i σ ij β i β j σ θ 2 σ ε i ε j i j w h e r e σ ε i ε j 0 3 σ ij σ ik σ jk β i 2 σ θ 2 i j k w h e r e σ ε i ε j σ ε i ε k σ ε j ε k 0 σ ik σ jl σ kl β i β j σ θ 2 i j k l w h e r e σ ε i ε j 0 σ ε i ε j σ ε i ε k σ ε j ε k 0 where i j k l are datasets that have linear relationships with the unknown true value θ ε is the zero mean random noise σ i 2 is the variance of i dataset i e square of rmsd while σ ij is the covariance between the i and j eq 3 can be written in a matrix form 4 y σ i 2 σ ij σ ij σ ik σ jk σ ik σ jl σ kl a 1010 0101 1000 0100 x β i 2 σ θ 2 β i β j σ θ 2 σ ε i 2 σ ε i ε j where y a x the actual dimensions of the three matrix depend on the number of dataset and on the number of dataset pairs which are a priori assumed to have correlated errors gruber et al 2016 the unknow vector x can be estimated by solving the linear equations x a t a 1 a t y the equations can be solved by the least squared estimation to ensure the system is soluble a t a has to have full rank for more details about the ecm refer to gruber et al 2016 scipal et al 2008 for the application of the ecm in this study we assume three pairwise products are with cross correlated errors which are clsm and noah both are from land surface model glass and gleam both use p t equation cr and hyp et both base on gcr model and the same forcing data by solving eq 4 the estimated rmsd is used to quantify the uncertainty of the products while rmsd mean is emploied as an indicator to quantify the relative uncertainty of the products in this study 4 results and discussions 4 1 spatial consistency of the gridded et products over china fig 1 shows the mean annual et for the period 2003 2014 for each of the eight products overall the eight products consistently show a southeast to northwest decreasing trend in the mean annual et over china the highest annual et in the southmost china could be above 1400 mm a while the lowest et in the northwest china is below 50 mm a fig 1i shows the variability c v of the estimated mean annual evapotranspiration among the eight products for each grid over china it shows the region with higher mean annual evapotranspiration tends to have lower variability the variability of mean annual et among the eight et products is found to be the highest in the northwest region dry region of china the pairwise spatial consistency of the estimated annual et from the eight products is assessed according to the coefficient of determination r2 which is calculated based on annual et for all grids across china and shown in the lower triangle in fig 2 in most cases of the pairwise comparison 71 r2 is above 0 8 indicating significant spatial consistency between the products the highest spatial consistency of the estimated mean annual et is found between gleam and eb et r2 0 91 followed by consistency between glass and gleam r2 0 90 in general gleam shows higher r2 and more comparable with the other seven products while pmlv2 shows relatively lower r2 particularly pmlv2 tends to have higher mean annual et fig 3 further shows the pairwise spatial consistency of mean evapotranspiration for each calendar month similar to that for the annual evapotranspiration the highest spatial consistency for the monthly evapotranspiration is found between gleam and glass between gleam and eb et and between cr and hyp et among all products the spatial consistency of pmlv2 against other products is relatively lower spatial consistency among products is found higher in august to november the highest in october but the lowest in in march 4 2 temporal consistency of et averaged over china the upper triangle in fig 2 shows the temporary consistency among the eight products for the monthly evapotranspiration averaged over china from 2003 to 2014 the r2 between the pairwise products is found to be above 0 9 in most cases except for the correlations of eb et against clsm and noah as further shown in fig 4 a the monthly ets averaged over china from all products consistently peak in july and reaches its lowest in december or january the highest temporary consistency is that between glass and gleam r2 0 99 the monthly et time series derived from glass and gleam are highly comparable with other products while the monthly et from eb et is with lower consistency with the other products for the estimated monthly et fig 4a clearly shows that the differences among the eight products are higher in summer jja and winter djf for the summer season with high evapotranspiration the et estimates from pmlv2 is larger than the other products while that from gleam is the lowest the difference between pmlv2 and gleam could reach up to 20 mm month in july for the winter season the et estimates from clsm 18 5 mm month is much higher than the others while that from cr 4 6 mm month is the lowest the results indicate that the estimated national average et for the summer and the winter seasons are with higher uncertainties the national average et for the period 2003 2014 shows noticeable differences at annual scale among products fig 4b the long term mean annual et averaged over china derived from the eight products ranges from 378 mm a from eb et to 528 mm a from pmlv2 annual et derived from clsm and noah shows higher interannual variability than that from the other products while eb et has the lowest interannual variability fig 4b also shows the trends of the annual et from each product where the trends are represented by the sen s slope in the mann kendall analysis wilson et al 2002 wu et al 2019 though the trends are not all statistically significant it can be seen that the trends vary greatly among products where glass cr and eb et show decreasing trends while other products show increasing trends in the national average et it is noticed that annual et derived from cr shows the highest decreasing rate 1 78 mm a in the period 2003 2014 which is contrast to that from hyp et 0 20 mm a although both cr and hyp et are based on the same et model i e the generalized complementary relationship and same climate inputs i e cmfd this could be because of the differences in the remotely sensed data and parameterization schemes used in two products the temporal inconsistency among the products suggests considerable uncertainties exist in the estimated et due to the algorithms and forcing data used it is therefore critical to assess the accuracy and quantify the uncertainty for each of the products prior to their practical applications 4 3 accuracy of gridded et products assessed against observations the accuracy of the gridded et product is assessed by comparing against the monthly observations of 10 sites in the chinaflux network see section 2 2 three performance metrics are calculated at monthly scale for each product and at each site the metrics are collectively shown in the taylor diagram taylor 2001 which include the correlation coefficient the centered root mean squared deviation rmsd and the difference in standard deviation fig 5 it shows that the gridded et products are generally in good agreement with the observations where the correlation coefficients are all above 0 7 and centered rmsds are less than 30 mm month the standard deviation of the monthly mean et from the eight products however varies in a wide range and could underestimate overestimate that based on the flux tower observations among the eight products the et estimates from cr and pmlv2 are more comparable to the observations than that from the other products the correlation coefficients between et from cr and from observation could be higher than 0 99 in sites a e and i while that for pmlv2 could reach to 0 98 in sites b and f this could be because that both cr and pmlv2 used the observations from the same sites to parameterize and validate their models while et of glass gleam and eb et was validated by different sites on the other end the et estimates from clsm and eb et show lower agreement with observation it is noticed that the et products perform differently at observation sites with different land cover types for instance the noah product performs better in mixed forests and broadleaf forests a and h but worse in shrublands i however the performance of the gridded et products is not clearly dependent on the land cover types as an example for sites covered by grassland the et estimates from gleam are better than the other at site f with centered rmsd of 7 8 mm month but worse at sites e and g 4 4 uncertainties of the gridded et estimates across china based on the extended collocation method ecm the uncertainties of monthly et estimates from each

2982,coastal land reclamation can modify the original hydrological settings that control water salinity distribution for low permeability coastal lands reclaimed for agricultural use there is an urgent need to understand the salinity distribution and evolution mechanism for a sustainable exploitation in this study electrical resistivity tomography ert measurements at different temporal and spatial scales are combined with water stable isotope and hydrochemical analyses to investigate the distribution and evolution rules of underground salinity in a coastal reclamation zone of eastern china the results show that the phreatic aquifer is dominated by highly saline water due to the flooding of seawater before reclamation after being isolated from marine conditions water salinity in the near surface zone becomes highly variable caused by dilution effect of rainwater and salt accumulation effect driven by evaporation due to the low permeability muddy flat geohydrological settings and intense evaporation natural groundwater desalination is extremely slow and only temporarily occurs in the near surface zone after long term reclamation for agricultural use the leaching effect of freshwater input from not only precipitation but also crop farming dominates and accelerates the desalination of the upper phreatic aquifer leading to a desalting rate of 1 6 2 4 yr and an obvious downward migration of saline groundwater deeper confined aquifers are dominated by brackish or even fresh groundwater which is minimally contaminated by upper saline water findings of this study provide a representative example of the salinity distribution and evolution characteristics in coastal agricultural lands reclaimed from low permeability intertidal muddy flats keywords reclamation groundwater salinity low permeability electrical resistivity tomography stable isotope 1 introduction the increasing demand for land resources under global rapid socio economic development has been a key challenge in the coastal zone which hosts approximately 40 of the world s growing population martínez et al 2007 coastal land reclamation is an effective strategy in creating and extending lands and has been implemented worldwide sengupta et al 2018 sousa et al 2020 apart from urbanization and industrialization agriculture is also a key driver for coastal land reclamation kitazume 2022 yang et al 2021 to mitigate the pressure on food supply many coastal wetlands or intertidal flats have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes han et al 2014 ma et al 2014 however the high salinity of soil water and groundwater is the major factor that limits agricultural development in coastal reclamation areas yin et al 2016 salinity distribution in coastal stratum is mainly affected by freshwater seawater interactions which are controlled by specific geological settings such as aquifer permeability and geomorphology as well as hydrological conditions such as land ocean hydraulic gradients robinson et al 2018 coastal land reclamation can alter original hydraulic settings and geomorphology by changing the position and shape of the land ocean interface and consequently results in a modification of freshwater saltwater interactions guo and jiao 2007 previous studies have focused on the flow dynamics and solute transport of permeable groundwater systems affected by coastal reclamation for urbanization sheng et al 2022 yao et al 2019 for those systems with lower permeability however salinity distribution and evolution of in aquifers after land reclamation remain unclear since these low permeability reclamation areas are often developed for agricultural use xu et al 2022 understanding of underground salinity distributions and relevant evolution mechanisms under reclamation conditions is essential for their effective and sustainable development since the shallow soil condition is critical for the agricultural usage of the reclaimed area many studies have focused on the temporal change of the salt and chemical components of shallow soil water under reclamation conditions domínguez et al 2001 iost et al 2007 ma et al 2015 as well as its relationship with long term cultivation cui et al 2012 and different land use types meng et al 2013 under natural conditions salinity distribution in shallow soil is affected by precipitation evaporation water table topography and seawater intrusion cetin and kirda 2003 ravindran et al 2007 yu et al 2014 when isolated from seawater inundation the salinity of soil water in the reclaimed area will be reduced due to natural rainwater leaching and anthropogenic drainage management iost et al 2007 these studies shed light on how soil water salinity changes under reclamation conditions focusing on shallow soil systems however better agricultural management in coastal reclaimed areas need an entire knowledge of the large scale distribution and evolution of underground salinity which is related with the origin mixing and interactions of different water systems ge et al 2017 although some studies have been conducted focusing on large scale hydrological process and salinization or desalinization processes in some coastal areas han and currell 2018 lenahan and bristow 2010 salem et al 2016 few have considered the impacts of land reclamation it is an important research question how groundwater salinity distributes and evolves after coastal land reclamation especially for those areas reclaimed from intertidal mudflats with low permeability settings in this study a representative reclamation area on the coast of the southern yellow sea was selected as a case in situ multi scale electrical resistivity tomography measurements as well as water stable isotope and hydrochemical analyses were performed covering different reclamation districts the objectives of this study are to 1 survey the distributions of groundwater salinity under different reclamation ages in the study site 2 describe the major hydrological processes that affects salinity variations and 3 preliminarily reveal the salinity evolution rules in low permeability tidal flat plains reclaimed for agricultural use 2

southern yellow sea more than 90 of which is mudflat du et al 2019 to meet the land demand for agricultural development many large scale reclamation activities have been implemented in the central jiangsu coast during recent decades xu et al 2022 for example since 2009 the largest sand shoal in the central jiangsu coast the tiaozini sand shoal has been featured in a large scale reclamation project of the same name covering a 22773 ha area the selected study area includes a young tiaozini reclamation district reclaimed for nearly 5 years prior to this study hereafter referred to as yrd

groundwater is mainly stored in the silty sand aquifers which are separated by several silty clay aquitards fig 2 the phreatic aquifer is contained within holocene silty sand deposits with a thickness of 25 m the permeability coefficient of the silty sand aquifers is smaller than 6 10 6 m s and four major confined aquifers i iv are situated from the bottom of the phreatic aquifer up to a depth of about 440 m groundwater in the phreatic aquifer of this area is mostly saline because of the presence of relict seawater li et al 2022 while deeper aquifers host abundant fresh groundwater zhan et al 2021 although groundwater has long been a vital resource it remains unclear as to how water and salt both transport and evolve within the stratum after being reclaimed from the local marine conditions 2 2 two dimensional electrical resistivity tomography imaging electrical resistivity tomography hereafter ert is a useful tool to determine the salinity distribution in coastal areas based on the resistivity difference between saline water and freshwater eissa et al 2016 normally the electrical conductivity of the stratum is affected by groundwater salinity soil property and saturation archie 1942 in this study however the effects of soil property and saturation are neglectable because of the relatively homogenous sedimentary environment and the very shallow groundwater table 1 m therefore spatial and temporal variations of stratum resistivity are effective for mapping the distribution of saline groundwater in this coastal area this method has been widely used for coastal aquifers coastal deltaic deposits and inland saline environments fu et al 2020 kazakis et al 2016 mcinnis et al 2013 in this study two dimensional 2 d ert measurements were carried out in two reclamation districts to explore groundwater salinity distributions and changes under multiple spatial and temporal scales the first site is located in a block of the yrd fig 1b where ert measurements were conducted repeatedly on december 15 2016 and may 21 and november 1 2017 through comparisons between three different measuring times the short term seasonal salinity changes were revealed in addition for every measurement two profiles a a and b b in fig 1 with different electrode spacings 2 and 10 m and measuring depths 25 and 120 m were included to illustrate the salinity distribution at different spatial scales because different reclamation districts are formed under similar sedimentary conditions and have similar hydrogeological characteristics it is feasible to illustrate the long term groundwater salinity evolution by comparing the results from the different districts to this end the sancang reclamation district which is dominated by cultivated land was chosen to represent the situation in the ord in november 2017 an ert profile c c in fig 1 with 10 m electrode spacing was conducted in a farmland of this older reclaimed zone after the rice harvest field measurements for these 2 d resistivity profiles were carried out using an agi supersting r8 ip 8 channel earth resistivity meter with an inbuilt processor for 64 multi electrodes for each measurement 64 steel electrodes were arranged along a line with constant electrode spacing to achieve the required investigation depth maximum 120 m the wenner array configuration was used to achieve a better vertical resolution before each measurement the system was required to pass the receiver test and contact resistance test inversion of the data was done with the earthimager2d version 2 4 4 software package topography was not included in the inversion of ert datasets because of the extreme flat ground condition to quantitatively estimate the salinity changes under different scales the salinity change ratio percentage proposed by fu et al 2020 was adopted which can be defined as δ s ρ t 1 1 0233 ρ t 0 1 0233 ρ t 0 1 0233 100 where ρ t 1 and ρ t 0 is the resistivity measured at time t1 and t0 respectively 2 3 water isotope and hydrochemistry analysis stable isotopes and hydrochemistry methods were applied in conjunction with the ert technique to further reveal the processes that affect groundwater salinity evolution for this in november 2017 sampling of different water bodies was conducted in the study area as follows surface water samples were collected in the study area including nearshore seawater s1 and s2 rivers sw4 sw6 and ponds sw1 sw3 in the yrd shallow porewater samples were collected from three sampling wells gw1 gw2 and gw3 made with pvc polyvinyl chloride pipes for each well three porewater samples were extracted with syringes from the tubes connected to the screens on the sampling well at depths of 1 5 2 5 and 3 5 m respectively unsaturated soil samples in the yrd were collected from three soil profiles sp1 sp3 by taking sequential soil cores at 10 cm intervals from the surface to a depth of 60 cm the soil profiles were located at x 30 58 and 84 m on ert line a a see fig 3 c respectively and are representative of the different soil salinity conditions in the ord shallow groundwater samples were widely collected from domestic wells of residents with depths varying between 6 and 17 m gw4 gw15 because of the restriction on deep groundwater extraction deeper groundwater was only available from a few larger companies or farms four deep groundwater samples gw16 gw19 were collected with depths ranging from 200 to 600 m all water samples were sealed in 100 ml clean plastic bottles and kept refrigerated before analysis samples were sent to the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering hohai university for pre treatment and analysis water samples were filtered by 0 22 µm cellulose disposable millipore filters for stable isotope and hydrochemical analysis water in the soil samples was extracted for isotopic analysis using the cryogenic vacuum distillation method zhan et al 2019 a mass spectrometer mat253 was used to analyze the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic rates of all samples the isotopic data were reported in standard δ notation as parts per thousand relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow with an analytical precision of 2 and 0 1 for δ2h and δ18o respectively isotopic data of precipitation were from the nearest gnip global network of isotopes in precipitation site in nanjing jiangsu https nucleus iaea org wiser salinity of the water samples was measured in situ using a calibrated handheld multiparameter meter ysi professional plus usa moisture content of soil samples was measured using the oven drying method 105 c 48 h twenty grams of the dried soil was then mixed with 100 ml of deionized water blended periodically for 48 h and then the salinity of the supernatant solution was measured to calculate the porewater salinity in the soil analyses of cations ca2 mg2 na k and anions cl so4 2 no3 were carried out for water samples using atomic absorption spectrometry and liquid phase ionic chromatography respectively the content of hco3 was analyzed using acid based titration with methyl orange as an indicator the total dissolved solids tds was then calculated as the sum of these cations and anions 3 results 3 1 resistivity distribution 3 1 1 small scale fig 3 shows the resistivity imaging results of profile a a in the yrd at a small spatiotemporal scale as shown in fig 3 the underground resistivity distribution pattern can be generally illustrated by three major vertical layers the near surface layer depth 5 m had relatively higher resistivity values and larger spatial variations within this depth the averages and standard deviations of resistivity were 0 98 0 16 0 95 0 11 and 0 87 0 10 ω m in december 2016 may 2017 and november 2017 respectively in the middle layer from 5 m to 15 m below the surface the resistivity averages and standard deviations are 0 87 0 07 0 88 0 06 and 0 87 0 07 ω m respectively the lowest resistivity was observed in this layer indicating the major position of saline groundwater in the phreatic aquifer for the lower layer with depth from 15 to 25 m the resistivity gradually increased with averages and standard deviations of 1 07 0 04 1 04 0 05 and 1 05 0 05 ω m respectively there was a relatively high resistivity area in the central part of a a profile which was most likely related to a small pond and its outflow creek observed at the ground surface fig 1b 3 1 2 large scale fig 4 shows the underground resistivity distribution with a length of 630 m and depth approaching 120 m in the yrd profile b b the averaged resistivity of the entire phreatic layer 0 25 m was 1 30 0 64 and 1 27 0 62 ω m in december 2016 and november 2017 respectively fig 4a b in the ord profile c c however the phreatic layer s resistivity and had increased to 1 64 1 41 ω m and become more variable fig 4c after being reclaimed for further 15 years the lowest resistivity peak had moved from 10 m downward to approximating 20 m with a migrating speed of 0 67 m yr for both yrd and ord a layer characterized by a larger resistivity gradient could be clearly seen at the depth from 25 to 50 m for the deeper zone the resistivity decreased significantly with depth the highest resistivity was found around 80 m 3 2 salinity change ratio for the small scale profile a a in the yrd the salinity change ratio percentages of two periods december 2016 to may 2017 and may 2017 to november 2017 were calculated and shown in fig 5 a and fig 5b respectively there were two clear interfaces in the salinity change ratio profile one was at the depth around 10 m above which the groundwater salinity changed significantly the other was at approximately 2 5 m below the surface which was a boundary of different salinity change patterns above 2 5 m the salinity change ratio was mostly positive and highly variable 14 7 15 1 and 4 8 11 9 for two periods from 2 5 m to 10 m the salinity change ratio was the opposite in two periods 6 9 4 8 and 9 5 5 8 large scale salinity change ratio was also calculated using the results from two reclamation districts b b to cc to illustrate salinity changes over nearly 15 years fig 5c for the entire phreatic layer depth 25 m salinity change ratio varied from 84 1 to 166 0 with an average of 5 7 53 4 the depth around 10 m became the boundary of the negative 23 6 36 0 and positive 51 9 42 6 salinity change ratios the main confined layer underneath 50 100 m generally had a negative salinity change ratio 18 8 20 0 although positive ratios also widely existed in this layer 3 3 isotopic and hydrochemical composition 3 3 1 surface water as listed in table 1 surface water in the study area was characterized by isotopic compositions with large ranges δ2h 52 0 to 9 2 mean standard deviation sd 31 4 16 1 δ18o 7 28 to 0 10 mean sd 4 17 2 39 the δ2h and δ18o values of the two nearshore seawater samples were 15 1 and 2 11 s1 and 16 6 and 2 58 s2 respectively the three inland river samples sw4 sw5 and sw6 were more depleted in heavier isotopes with isotopic values similar to those of the annual precipitation δ2h 51 4 δ18o 7 97 however one pond water sample sw2 δ2h 9 2 δ18o 0 10 in the yrd was even more enriched in heavier isotopes than the nearshore seawater nearshore seawater samples had an average tds of 32 058 mg l salinity 29 1 ppt with a chemical type of cl na other surface water samples were characterized by tds ranging from 1562 to 16 844 mg l mean sd 6032 5114 mg l and salinity ranging from 1 4 to 15 3 mean sd 4 9 4 9 the pond water mean tds 9176 mg l salinity 8 3 ppt had much higher ion concentrations than the river water mean tds 2887 mg l salinity 1 6 ppt most ponds and rivers were characterized by the cl na or cl hco3 na types 3 3 2 groundwater the isotopic compositions of nine shallow porewater samples collected from the observation wells in the yrd ranged from 12 7 to 8 2 mean sd 10 3 1 6 and 2 32 to 0 08 mean sd 1 12 0 73 for δ2h and δ18o respectively for each sampling well isotopic values and salinity generally presented an increasing trend with depth all porewater samples had the chemical type of cl na with a tds range of 32 450 37 585 mg l mean sd 35 114 1822 mg l and a salinity range of 29 6 33 8 ppt mean sd 31 7 1 8 ppt the δ2h and δ18o values of shallow groundwater collected from the domestic wells in the ord ranged from 53 3 to 37 7 mean sd 46 0 3 6 and 7 68 to 5 19 mean sd 6 63 0 68 respectively the tds of the shallow groundwater ranged from 871 to 3161 mg l with an average of 1383 625 mg l the salinity of shallow groundwater ranged from 0 5 to 2 8 ppt with an average of 1 0 0 7 ppt the major chemical types were cl na hco3 na and hco3 mg although four deep groundwater samples were collected from depths ranging from 280 to 600 m their isotopic compositions had only minor variations δ2h 54 0 to 51 7 mean sd 52 8 0 9 δ18o 7 01 to 6 60 mean sd 6 85 0 16 the average tds and salinity of deep groundwater samples were 1004 mg l and 0 7 ppt respectively indicating the deep groundwater s freshwater source and minimal contamination by saline water 3 3 3 unsaturated soil water the moisture content salinity and δ18o of the unsaturated soil water in the yrd ranged between 26 0 and 37 1 10 6 ppt and 42 7 ppt 6 40 and 3 18 with averages of 31 5 3 3 22 7 7 8 ppt and 1 73 2 26 respectively the results of all samples are listed in table 2 sp1 which was drilled from a low resistivity zone had the lowest water content and the highest water salinity and isotopic values sp3 however had the lowest salinity and isotopic values indicating a different water and salinity situation in the high resistivity zone vertical variations are shown in fig 6 water content shows an increasing trend from the surface to the depth around 15 cm sp3 or 25 cm sp1 and sp2 porewater salinity was the highest within the depth of 10 cm except for sp2 which was located at a small dried up creek connected to the pond sw2 fig 1b generally an increasing trend of isotopic values with depth can be found especially for sp2 and sp3 4 discussions 4 1 temporal and spatial distribution of water salinity in the reclamation area as indicated by the large scale ert results fig 4 the phreatic aquifer depth 25 m is mostly characterized by resistivity of smaller than 2 ω m which is the general level of seawater kazakis et al 2016 before reclamation the study area consisted of intertidal flats which were affected by seawater flooding and the shallow aquifer was mainly filled by seawater particularly in the more recently reclaimed areas the larger resistivity gradient from 25 to 50 m corresponds to the silty clay layer as shown in the geological profile fig 2 and functions as an aquiclude which restrains the mixing between aquifers mao et al 2020 this layer also confines the groundwater in the deeper zone which has decreasing salinity with depth the resistivity level of the confined aquifer ⅰ indicates that this aquifer is mostly characterized by brackish water kazakis et al 2016 deep groundwater samples collected from 280 to 600 m deep wells gw16 gw19 all have salinity smaller than 1 ppt verifying the existence of fresh groundwater in deeper aquifers in the study area water salinity of the phreatic layer is spatially variable as indicated by the small scale ert results fig 3 in particular in the near surface zone with depth 5 m water salinity has obvious horizontal and vertical variations forming an interval distribution of low and high salinity plumes although the near surface relatively higher resistivity indicates lower soil water salinity porewater samples gw1 1 to gw3 3 extracted from the shallow saturated zone can still reach a salinity of 33 8 ppt which is higher than local seawater in addition the three unsaturated soil profiles also present obvious spatial variations of soil water content and salinity these phenomena suggest that soil water salinity in the near surface area is highly heterogeneous which may be related to the complex mixing between fresh rainwater and saline groundwater as well as evaporation will be discussed later clear seasonal differences in the upper phreatic zone above 10 m can be observed from three small scale measurements of profile a a in december 2016 may 2017 and november 2017 in this section referred to as 1st 2nd and 3rd measurements respectively in the yrd the resistivity in this zone was the highest during the 1st measurement while the groundwater level was the shallowest 0 32 m which was most likely a result of the extreme rainfall events in 2016 annual rainfall 1864 mm 79 higher than the long term mean of 1042 mm the abundant rainwater in 2016 had probably infiltrated to as deep as 2 5 m during the 1st measurement and caused a lower salinity within this depth until the 2nd measurement the near surface low salinity had expanded and formed some low salinity plumes deeper than 5 m fig 3b while some high salinity areas had also appeared near the surface the salinity change ratio between the 1st and 2nd measurements fig 5a clearly indicates the downward movement of fresh rainwater and the recovery of near surface high salinity from the 2nd to the 3rd measurement the widely distributed positive salinity change ratios fig 5b indicate that the shallow salinity had greatly recovered and increased to a relatively high level the vertical distribution of salinity change ratio values of the phreatic aquifer fig 5a b suggests that salinity change mostly occurs from the surface to a depth of around 10 m from 10 to 25 m below the surface however little short term salinity change is observed indicating that this layer has not been contaminated by near surface processes after 5 yr reclamation the long term evolution trend of groundwater salinity can be seen by comparing results in the yrd and ord with different reclamation ages after further 15 yr reclamation the shallow variable salinity distribution had expanded to the entire phreatic layer fig 4c groundwater salinity of the upper phreatic aquifer 0 10 m had decreased by 23 6 36 0 with an annual decrease rate of 1 6 2 4 yr fig 5c with the desalination of the upper phreatic aquifer some villages in the ord can utilize fresh or slight brackish groundwater salinity 3 ppt from domestic wells with a depth of 10 m for the lower part 10 25 m however groundwater salinity had increased by 51 9 42 6 with an annual increase rate of 3 5 2 8 yr this indicates a long term downward migration trend of the salt in the phreatic aquifer under reclamation conditions for the confined aquifer i deeper than 50 m groundwater salinity had also decreased by 18 8 20 0 after 15 years with an annual desalination rate of 1 3 1 3 yr 4 2 hydrological processes in the reclamation area water isotopic and chemical composition provides information on the interactions of different water bodies as well as associated physical and chemical processes under the conditions of reclamation as shown in the plot of δ2h versus δ18o fig 7 water samples collected from rivers and ponds are scattered along the mixing line between precipitation and seawater indicating their different contamination degrees from the saltwater the rivers are scattered close to the precipitation end member and are below the mixing line indicating that the sampled river water originates from local rainwater and that the rivers have experienced evaporation although the tide range can reach up to nearly 4 m these rivers are only minimally affected by saltwater intrusion due to the operation of flood gates zhu et al 2017 for the three samples collected from the ponds in the yrd however sw1 and sw3 show obvious mixing between freshwater and seawater while sw2 contains more seawater and has experienced strong evaporation formed by surface runoff and near surface quick flow during rainfall events these ponds are mixed by rainwater and shallow saline groundwater with different mixing rates shallow porewater points are scattered close to the seawater points forming a line δ2h 2 1δ18o 8 4 r2 0 5 with a smaller slope than that of the local meteoric water line lmwl and the mixing line indicating intense evaporation that the porewater has experienced there is an obvious increasing trend of δ2h and δ18o values with sampling depth moreover the shallow porewater points are scattered closer to the lmwl whereas the deeper porewater is more enriched in heavier isotopes than the seawater these isotopic phenomena together with previous ert results further suggest that rainwater infiltration and evaporation are the two major processes controlling the water salinity of the near surface groundwater in the yrd the unsaturated soil water however has significant isotopic ranges and its points are mostly scattered below the mixing line also indicating the complex processes of rainwater saltwater mixing and evaporation these results prove that the near surface area depth 5 m in the yrd is an active zone of interactive precipitation and evaporation the near surface large horizontal resistivity variations in the yrd as shown in fig 3a indicate that the infiltration of precipitation is characterized by a great heterogeneity which may be related to the near surface flow driven by microtopography for example an obvious outflow creek connected to the pond sw2 is located between 50 and 60 m of the a a survey line fig 1b resulting in a deeper infiltration depth and lower salinity in that section fig 3b the decreasing resistivity and sd values with depth suggest a vertical decreasing effect of precipitation because of the shallow groundwater level and the low soil permeability it would be difficult for rainfall to infiltrate deeper into the shallow aquifer li et al 2022 meanwhile the infiltration of fresh rainwater can also be restricted due to its smaller density than the saltwater underneath eeman et al 2011 after 5 yr reclamation the main influence depth of rainwater infiltration is only about 5 m under extremely abundant rainwater conditions such as 2016 with 1864 mm the rainwater gradually infiltrates deeper and causes a decrease of shallow groundwater salinity in the following year fig 3b and fig 5a in addition to precipitation evaporation is another major factor controlling water and salinity distribution in the near surface zone of the yrd our previous study has shown that the soil water salinity in the unsaturated zone of the reclamation area can reach as high as 90 which is relevant to the intense evaporation process zhan et al 2021 according to the unsaturated soil results in this study the decrease of water content and the increase of soil water salinity mainly happens in the upper 30 cm suggesting the shallow effect of evaporation and salt accumulation however the shallow groundwater depth 1 m makes it possible for quick upward water recharge and maintains a higher evaporation rate the relatively large potential evaporation can in turn accelerate the upward movement of shallow groundwater geng and boufadel 2015 which acts as a persistent salt source for the shallow zone through seasonal monitoring yan et al 2015 also found that the groundwater salinity increased as the groundwater level decreased due to intense evaporation as a result in contrast to the dilution of rainwater infiltration evaporation can be considered as the primary process causing the accumulation of salt in the near surface zone for example the increasing trend of water salinity above 2 5 m from december 2016 to may 2017 fig 5a is a consequence of intense evaporation and salt accumulation due to the long term concentration effect of evaporation shallow porewater becomes more saline than seawater in the ord area that has been reclaimed for decades shallow groundwater collected from domestic pumping wells depths from 6 to 17 m is more depleted in heavier isotopes scattering closer to the end member of local weighted mean precipitation the fitted line of shallow groundwater is δ2h 5 1δ18o 12 4 r2 0 88 the isotopic and chemical results of the shallow groundwater indicate that the upper phreatic aquifer has been dominated by the recharge from rainwater two brackish shallow groundwater samples gw7 and gw9 are of the na cl type and have higher isotopic values therefore it can be inferred that the phreatic aquifer in the study area maintained a great amount of seawater from the inundation period which was then gradually replaced by freshwater from rainfall forming shallow fresh or brackish groundwater over decades in the upper zone the piper plot of all water samples is shown in fig 8 and suggests an obvious desalination trend from the seawater component to the terrestrial freshwater component the chemical type of groundwater evolves from na cl shallow porewater brackish groundwater to hco3 na and hco3 mg fresh groundwater the plot of δ18o versus cl also reveals the desalination process caused by freshwater leaching after land reclamation as well as the near surface salt accumulation due to evaporation fig 8b li et al 2017 have suggested that in addition to these physical processes silicate weathering and ion exchange reactions are also important chemical processes changing the composition of groundwater in the jiangsu coastal plain the deep groundwater samples deeper than confined aquifer iii collected in this study have smaller isotopic values and better water quality suggesting that the deep aquifers are little affected by the brackish aquifers above for the deep confined aquifers under natural conditions the groundwater is thought to be almost static shi et al 2015 however historical hydrogeological data also indicate that the groundwater levels of deeper confined aquifers near this study area are higher than the shallow aquifers ma et al 2022 this may cause the upward discharge of deep groundwater at locations where the aquitard is relatively thin 4 3 water and salt transport mechanism affected by land reclamation the jiangsu coast is characterized by multiple aquifers that have undergone frequent transgression regression processes during the pliocene and holocene groundwater in the phreatic aquifer is evolved from the paleo saltwater of the most recent holocene transgression han and currell 2022 after the latest marine regression rainwater diluting or intense evaporation under the changing climates as well as surface water recharge from the evolving river systems kept modifying phreatic groundwater salinity on millennial timescales li et al 2017 using borehole data previous studies suggested that the phreatic aquifer of the jiangsu coast is desalinating but still contains a considerable proportion of paleo saltwater li et al 2022 2017 which corresponds to the widely distributed low resistivity layer in our ert profiles apart from the desalination process controlled by geological events land reclamation alters the transport of water and salt in coastal aquifers at year decade scales when isolated from the marine environment by land reclamation the coastal phreatic aquifer enters a new process of water and salt evolution fig 9 during different reclamation periods with different land utilization stages groundwater salinity is affected by variable natural and anthropogenic factors for the young reclamation area that has been little developed a combination of the opposite effects by precipitation and evaporation controls shallow groundwater salinity distribution after rainwater reaches the ground surface it infiltrates and mixes with saline porewater and reduces the near surface salinity because of the low permeability shallow groundwater level and flat topography the movement of groundwater and solute is mainly controlled by diffusion li et al 2022 and thus the downward desalination effect of precipitation develops slowly according to our results the desalination depth affected by rainwater infiltration and mixing is only 5 m in the yrd in contrast to the effect of precipitation evaporation accelerates the upward movement of saline shallow groundwater causes salt to accumulate in the surface soil and finally increases the near surface water salinity the desalination effect of rainwater infiltration may be dominant at places with lower elevations or covered by salt tolerant plants zhan et al 2021 although some reclamation areas may experience near surface soil amelioration by methods such as subsurface drainage xin et al 2016 or have been used as aquaculture ponds xu et al 2022 they are not focused in this study for well developed older reclamation districts it was estimated in this study that the upper phreatic layer had a desalting rate of 1 6 2 4 yr and a saltwater downward migrating speed of 0 67 m yr although such desalting speed is much smaller in relative to sandy systems it is much higher than that under natural conditions without reclamation li et al 2022 after long term reclamation the desalination process of shallow groundwater is further affected by human activities such as crop farming which is very common in our study area yin et al 2016 the older reclamation district chosen for the resistivity test was planted with rice and wheat in summer and winter respectively on one hand crop farming which greatly increases vegetation coverage will accelerate the desalination of shallow groundwater by improving freshwater infiltration and reducing soil evaporation zhan et al 2021 on the other hand farmlands in the ord receive abundant freshwater input from irrigation water which has been proved to be another important factor leading to the desalination of phreatic groundwater shi et al 2015 abundant freshwater infiltrates and restrains the saline aquifer in a deeper area driving the downward migration of the saline groundwater therefore it can be concluded that human activities such as crop farming is a key factor that accelerates desalination of groundwater system after land reclamation in coastal reclamation areas the conflict between freshwater resource scarcity and sustainable agricultural development always remains a great challenge han and currell 2022 as such local confined aquifers which were found to have better water quality have been greatly exploited since the 1980s together with the quick expansion and development of reclaimed areas shi et al 2015 however exploitation of confined groundwater along the jiangsu coast has been greatly limited by the government since 2000 to better preserve the deep groundwater resources and avoid environmental issues such as land subsidence zhu et al 2015 deep confined aquifers in this area were formed during the transgression regression processes in the late pliocene and were thought to be recharged by freshwater under colder climatic conditions before the holocene with estimated groundwater age 10 ka li et al 2017 mao et al 2020 the widely distributed negative salinity change ratio within the depth range of the confined aquifer ⅰ suggests that it also has a desalination trend over decades the desalination observed in confined aquifer ⅰmay be related with the horizontal groundwater seaward discharge or vertical exchange within deeper aquifers as observed in other coastal sites han and currell 2022 yuan et al 2013 however further studies on the interactions of different aquifers as well as submarine groundwater discharge are needed for a better knowledge of salinity evolution in local confined aquifers 5 conclusions in this study multi scale spatiotemporal ert surveys were carried out in coastal reclamation areas of the jiangsu coast and combined with water stable isotope and hydrochemical analyses to determine characteristics of the salinity distribution and evolution mechanism of reclaimed areas findings indicate that in the young reclaimed area the shallow phreatic aquifer above 25 m depth is mainly characterized by relict seawater from the inundation period before reclamation after human reclamation shallow phreatic groundwater salinity becomes temporally and spatially highly variable due to complex processes including rainwater infiltration freshwater saline water mixing as well as evaporation rainwater infiltration process only occurs in a very shallow zone and is extremely slow because of the low permeability of the host deposition shallow groundwater level and flat topography the desalination effect of natural rainwater is greatly restricted by saline groundwater upward movement and salt accumulation driven by soil water evaporation in the long term groundwater of the upper phreatic aquifer 0 10 m presents an obvious desalination trend with a salinity decreasing rate of 1 6 2 4 yr the highly saline groundwater still widely exists in older reclamation districts that have been reclaimed for decades however with the downward expansion of the upper low salinity shallow groundwater the old time marine salt gradually migrates to the lower part of the phreatic aquifer such desalination in the phreatic aquifer has been accelerated by freshwater infiltration and leaching from both natural precipitation and agricultural activities such as crop farming deeper confined aquifers contain a large amount of brackish or even fresh groundwater the observed confined aquifer ⅰ is minimally contaminated by saline water and presents a desalination rate of 1 3 1 3 yr as a global land expansion strategy coastal land reclamation is mostly implemented on the existing naturally formed land surface sengupta et al 2018 many intertidal flats or coastal wetlands formed by the deposition of low permeability sediments have been reclaimed for agriculture development which is similar to the situation of our study area this case study of the jiangsu coast provides common insight into the salinity distribution and evolution characteristics in those reclaimed low permeability areas for agricultural purpose it should be pointed out that the effect of planting and irrigation activities on salinity evolution is only preliminarily discussed in this study understanding to what extent can these activities affect groundwater salinity however needs further investigation meanwhile the salinity evolution mechanism in deeper aquifers also warrants further investigation credit authorship contribution statement lucheng zhan conceptualization methodology investigation visualization writing original draft writing

2982,coastal land reclamation can modify the original hydrological settings that control water salinity distribution for low permeability coastal lands reclaimed for agricultural use there is an urgent need to understand the salinity distribution and evolution mechanism for a sustainable exploitation in this study electrical resistivity tomography ert measurements at different temporal and spatial scales are combined with water stable isotope and hydrochemical analyses to investigate the distribution and evolution rules of underground salinity in a coastal reclamation zone of eastern china the results show that the phreatic aquifer is dominated by highly saline water due to the flooding of seawater before reclamation after being isolated from marine conditions water salinity in the near surface zone becomes highly variable caused by dilution effect of rainwater and salt accumulation effect driven by evaporation due to the low permeability muddy flat geohydrological settings and intense evaporation natural groundwater desalination is extremely slow and only temporarily occurs in the near surface zone after long term reclamation for agricultural use the leaching effect of freshwater input from not only precipitation but also crop farming dominates and accelerates the desalination of the upper phreatic aquifer leading to a desalting rate of 1 6 2 4 yr and an obvious downward migration of saline groundwater deeper confined aquifers are dominated by brackish or even fresh groundwater which is minimally contaminated by upper saline water findings of this study provide a representative example of the salinity distribution and evolution characteristics in coastal agricultural lands reclaimed from low permeability intertidal muddy flats keywords reclamation

and has been implemented worldwide sengupta et al 2018 sousa et al 2020 apart from urbanization and industrialization agriculture is also a key driver for coastal land reclamation kitazume 2022 yang et al 2021 to mitigate the pressure on food supply many coastal wetlands or intertidal flats have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes han et al 2014 ma et al 2014 however the high salinity of soil water and groundwater is the major factor that limits agricultural development in coastal reclamation areas yin et al 2016 salinity distribution in coastal stratum is mainly affected by freshwater seawater interactions which are controlled by specific geological settings such as aquifer permeability and geomorphology as well as hydrological conditions such as land ocean hydraulic gradients robinson et al 2018 coastal land reclamation can alter original hydraulic settings and geomorphology by changing the position and shape of the land ocean interface and consequently results in a modification of freshwater saltwater interactions guo and jiao 2007 previous studies have focused on the flow dynamics and solute transport of permeable groundwater systems affected by coastal reclamation for urbanization sheng et al 2022 yao et al 2019 for those systems with lower permeability however salinity distribution and evolution of in aquifers after land reclamation remain unclear since these low permeability reclamation areas are often developed for agricultural use xu et al 2022 understanding of underground salinity distributions and relevant evolution mechanisms under reclamation conditions is essential for their effective and sustainable development since the shallow soil condition is critical for the agricultural usage of the reclaimed area many studies have focused on the temporal change of the salt and chemical components of shallow soil water under reclamation conditions domínguez et al 2001 iost et al 2007 ma et al 2015 as well as its relationship with long term cultivation cui et al 2012 and different land use types meng et al 2013 under natural conditions salinity distribution in shallow soil is affected by precipitation evaporation water table topography and seawater intrusion cetin and kirda 2003 ravindran et al 2007 yu et al 2014 when isolated from seawater inundation the salinity of soil water in the reclaimed area will be reduced due to natural rainwater leaching and anthropogenic drainage management iost et al 2007 these studies shed light on how soil water salinity changes under reclamation conditions focusing on shallow soil systems however better agricultural management in coastal reclaimed areas need an entire knowledge of the large scale distribution and evolution of underground salinity which is related with the origin mixing and interactions of different water systems ge et al 2017 although some studies have been conducted focusing on large scale hydrological process and salinization or desalinization processes in some coastal areas han and currell 2018 lenahan and bristow 2010 salem et al 2016 few have considered the impacts of land reclamation it is an important research question how groundwater salinity distributes and evolves after coastal land reclamation especially for those areas reclaimed from intertidal mudflats with low permeability settings in this study a representative reclamation area on the coast of the southern yellow sea was selected as a case in situ multi scale electrical resistivity tomography measurements as well as water stable isotope and hydrochemical analyses were performed covering different reclamation districts the objectives of this study are to 1 survey the distributions of groundwater salinity under different reclamation ages in the study site 2 describe the major hydrological processes that affects salinity variations and 3 preliminarily reveal the salinity evolution rules in low permeability tidal flat plains reclaimed for agricultural use 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site as china s second largest provincial economy jiangsu province has a total coastline hereafter the jiangsu coast length of 954 km along the western edge of the southern yellow sea more than 90 of which is mudflat du et al 2019 to meet the land demand for agricultural development many large scale reclamation activities have been implemented in the central jiangsu coast during recent decades xu et al 2022 for example since 2009 the largest sand shoal in the central jiangsu coast the tiaozini sand shoal has been featured in a large scale reclamation project of the same name covering a 22773 ha area the selected study area includes a young tiaozini reclamation district reclaimed for nearly 5 years prior to this study hereafter referred to as yrd and extends across some of the older reclamation districts reclaimed for decades hereafter referred to as ord located kilometers away from the coastline fig 1 the yrd is dominated by little exploited flat wastelands with some scattered salt tolerant plants such as spartina alterniflora and suaeda salsa in the ord the dominate land use type is well exploited cultivated land for rice and wheat farming which receives additional water input by irrigation yin et al 2016 formed by sedimentation the topography is extremely flat with slope ranging from 0 1 1000 to 1 1000 du et al 2019 it is located within a subtropical monsoon climatic region the average annual temperature is 14 6 c with the hottest and coldest months being july and january respectively the average relative humidity is about 80 and the average annual precipitation and evaporation are 1042 and 1417 mm respectively meng et al 2013 most precipitation is concentrated between june and september affected by at least three marine transgressions and regressions from the pleistocene to recent the study area consists of thick quaternary sediments with multiple interlayers of marine and continental deposits li et al 2001 groundwater is mainly stored in the silty sand aquifers which are separated by several silty clay aquitards fig 2 the phreatic aquifer is contained within holocene silty sand deposits with a thickness of 25 m the permeability coefficient of the silty sand aquifers is smaller than 6 10 6 m s and four major confined aquifers i iv are situated from the bottom of the phreatic aquifer up to a depth of about 440 m groundwater in the phreatic aquifer of this area is mostly saline because of the presence of relict seawater li et al 2022 while deeper aquifers host abundant fresh groundwater zhan et al 2021 although groundwater has long been a vital resource it remains unclear as to how water and salt both transport and evolve within the stratum after being reclaimed from the local marine conditions 2 2 two dimensional electrical resistivity tomography imaging electrical resistivity tomography hereafter ert is a useful tool to determine the salinity distribution in coastal areas based on the resistivity difference between saline water and freshwater eissa et al 2016 normally the electrical conductivity of the stratum is affected by groundwater salinity soil property and saturation archie 1942 in this study however the effects of soil property and saturation are neglectable because of the relatively homogenous sedimentary environment and the very shallow groundwater table 1 m therefore spatial and temporal variations of stratum resistivity are effective for mapping the distribution of saline groundwater in this coastal area this method has been widely used for coastal aquifers coastal deltaic deposits and inland saline environments fu et al 2020 kazakis et al 2016 mcinnis et al 2013 in this study two dimensional 2 d ert measurements were carried out in two reclamation districts to explore groundwater salinity distributions and changes under multiple spatial and temporal scales the first site is located in a block of the yrd fig 1b where ert measurements were conducted repeatedly on december 15 2016 and may 21 and november 1 2017 through comparisons between three different measuring times the short term seasonal salinity changes were revealed in addition for every measurement two profiles a a and b b in fig 1 with different electrode spacings 2 and 10 m and measuring depths 25 and 120 m were included to illustrate the salinity distribution at different spatial scales because different reclamation districts are formed under similar sedimentary conditions and have similar hydrogeological characteristics it is feasible to illustrate the long term groundwater salinity evolution by comparing the results from the different districts to this end the sancang reclamation district which is dominated by cultivated land was chosen to represent the situation in the ord in november 2017 an ert profile c c in fig 1 with 10 m electrode spacing was conducted in a farmland of this older reclaimed zone after the rice harvest field measurements for these 2 d resistivity profiles were carried out using an agi supersting r8 ip 8 channel earth resistivity meter with an inbuilt processor for 64 multi electrodes for each measurement 64 steel electrodes were arranged along a line with constant electrode spacing to achieve the required investigation depth maximum 120 m the wenner array configuration was used to achieve a better vertical resolution before each measurement the system was required to pass the receiver test and contact resistance test inversion of the data was done with the earthimager2d version 2 4 4 software package topography was not included in the inversion of ert datasets because of the extreme flat ground condition to quantitatively estimate the salinity changes under different scales the salinity change ratio percentage proposed by fu et al 2020 was adopted which can be defined as δ s ρ t 1 1 0233 ρ t 0 1 0233 ρ t 0 1 0233 100 where ρ t 1 and ρ t 0 is the resistivity measured at time t1 and t0 respectively 2 3 water isotope and hydrochemistry analysis stable isotopes and hydrochemistry methods were applied in conjunction with the ert technique to further reveal the processes that affect groundwater salinity evolution for this in november 2017 sampling of different water bodies was conducted in the study area as follows surface water samples were collected in the study area including nearshore seawater s1 and s2 rivers sw4 sw6 and ponds sw1 sw3 in the yrd shallow porewater samples were collected from three sampling wells gw1 gw2 and gw3 made with pvc polyvinyl chloride pipes for each well three porewater samples were extracted with syringes from the tubes connected to the screens on the sampling well at depths of 1 5 2 5 and 3 5 m respectively unsaturated soil samples in the yrd were collected from three soil profiles sp1 sp3 by taking sequential soil cores at 10 cm intervals from the surface to a depth of 60 cm the soil profiles were located at x 30 58 and 84 m on ert line a a see fig 3 c respectively and are representative of the different soil salinity conditions in the ord shallow groundwater samples were widely collected from domestic wells of residents with depths varying between 6 and 17 m gw4 gw15 because of the restriction on deep groundwater extraction deeper groundwater was only available from a few larger companies or farms four deep groundwater samples gw16 gw19 were collected with depths ranging from 200 to 600 m all water samples were sealed in 100 ml clean plastic bottles and kept refrigerated before analysis samples were sent to the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering hohai university for pre treatment and analysis water samples were filtered by 0 22 µm cellulose disposable millipore filters for stable isotope and hydrochemical analysis water in the soil samples was extracted for isotopic analysis using the cryogenic vacuum distillation method zhan et al 2019 a mass spectrometer mat253 was used to analyze the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic rates of all samples the isotopic data were reported in standard δ notation as parts per thousand relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow with an analytical precision of 2 and 0 1 for δ2h and δ18o respectively isotopic data of precipitation were from the nearest gnip global network of isotopes in precipitation site in nanjing jiangsu https nucleus iaea org wiser salinity of the water samples was measured in situ using a calibrated handheld multiparameter meter ysi professional plus usa moisture content of soil samples was measured using the oven drying method 105 c 48 h twenty grams of the dried soil was then mixed with 100 ml of deionized water blended periodically for 48 h and then the salinity of the supernatant solution was measured to calculate the porewater salinity in the soil analyses of cations ca2 mg2 na k and anions cl so4 2 no3 were carried out for water samples using atomic absorption spectrometry and liquid phase ionic chromatography respectively the content of hco3 was analyzed using acid based titration with methyl orange as an indicator the total dissolved solids tds was then calculated as the sum of these cations and anions 3 results 3 1 resistivity distribution 3 1 1 small scale fig 3 shows the resistivity imaging results of profile a a in the yrd at a small spatiotemporal scale as shown in fig 3 the underground resistivity distribution pattern can be generally illustrated by three major vertical layers the near surface layer depth 5 m had relatively higher resistivity values and larger spatial variations within this depth the averages and standard deviations of resistivity were 0 98 0 16 0 95 0 11 and 0 87 0 10 ω m in december 2016 may 2017 and november 2017 respectively in the middle layer from 5 m to 15 m below the surface the resistivity averages and standard deviations are 0 87 0 07 0 88 0 06 and 0 87 0 07 ω m respectively the lowest resistivity was observed in this layer indicating the major position of saline groundwater in the phreatic aquifer for the lower layer with depth from 15 to 25 m the resistivity gradually increased with averages and standard deviations of 1 07 0 04 1 04 0 05 and 1 05 0 05 ω m respectively there was a relatively high resistivity area in the central part of a a profile which was most likely related to a small pond and its outflow creek observed at the ground surface fig 1b 3 1 2 large scale fig 4 shows the underground resistivity distribution with a length of 630 m and depth approaching 120 m in the yrd profile b b the averaged resistivity of the entire phreatic layer 0 25 m was 1 30 0 64 and 1 27 0 62 ω m in december 2016 and november 2017 respectively fig 4a b in the ord profile c c however the phreatic layer s resistivity and had increased to 1 64 1 41 ω m and become more variable fig 4c after being reclaimed for further 15 years the lowest resistivity peak had moved from 10 m downward to approximating 20 m with a migrating speed of 0 67 m yr for both yrd and ord a layer characterized by a larger resistivity gradient could be clearly seen at the depth from 25 to 50 m for the deeper zone the resistivity decreased significantly with depth the highest resistivity was found around 80 m 3 2 salinity change ratio for the small scale profile a a in the yrd the salinity change ratio percentages of two periods december 2016 to may 2017 and may 2017 to november 2017 were calculated and shown in fig 5 a and fig 5b respectively there were two clear interfaces in the salinity change ratio profile one was at the depth around 10 m above which the groundwater salinity changed significantly the other was at approximately 2 5 m below the surface which was a boundary of different salinity change patterns above 2 5 m the salinity change ratio was mostly positive and highly variable 14 7 15 1 and 4 8 11 9 for two periods from 2 5 m to 10 m the salinity change ratio was the opposite in two periods 6 9 4 8 and 9 5 5 8 large scale salinity change ratio was also calculated using the results from two reclamation districts b b to cc to illustrate salinity changes over nearly 15 years fig 5c for the entire phreatic layer depth 25 m salinity change ratio varied from 84 1 to 166 0 with an average of 5 7 53 4 the depth around 10 m became the boundary of the negative 23 6 36 0 and positive 51 9 42 6 salinity change ratios the main confined layer underneath 50 100 m generally had a negative salinity change ratio 18 8 20 0 although positive ratios also widely existed in this layer 3 3 isotopic and hydrochemical composition 3 3 1 surface water as listed in table 1 surface water in the study area was characterized by isotopic compositions with large ranges δ2h 52 0 to 9 2 mean standard deviation sd 31 4 16 1 δ18o 7 28 to 0 10 mean sd 4 17 2 39 the δ2h and δ18o values of the two nearshore seawater samples were 15 1 and 2 11 s1 and 16 6 and 2 58 s2 respectively the three inland river samples sw4 sw5 and sw6 were more depleted in heavier isotopes with isotopic values similar to those of the annual precipitation δ2h 51 4 δ18o 7 97 however one pond water sample sw2 δ2h 9 2 δ18o 0 10 in the yrd was even more enriched in heavier isotopes than the nearshore seawater nearshore seawater samples had an average tds of 32 058 mg l salinity 29 1 ppt with a chemical type of cl na other surface water samples were characterized by tds ranging from 1562 to 16 844 mg l mean sd 6032 5114 mg l and salinity ranging from 1 4 to 15 3 mean sd 4 9 4 9 the pond water mean tds 9176 mg l salinity 8 3 ppt had much higher ion concentrations than the river water mean tds 2887 mg l salinity 1 6 ppt most ponds and rivers were characterized by the cl na or cl hco3 na types 3 3 2 groundwater the isotopic compositions of nine shallow porewater samples collected from the observation wells in the yrd ranged from 12 7 to 8 2 mean sd 10 3 1 6 and 2 32 to 0 08 mean sd 1 12 0 73 for δ2h and δ18o respectively for each sampling well isotopic values and salinity generally presented an increasing trend with depth all porewater samples had the chemical type of cl na with a tds range of 32 450 37 585 mg l mean sd 35 114 1822 mg l and a salinity range of 29 6 33 8 ppt mean sd 31 7 1 8 ppt the δ2h and δ18o values of shallow groundwater collected from the domestic wells in the ord ranged from 53 3 to 37 7 mean sd 46 0 3 6 and 7 68 to 5 19 mean sd 6 63 0 68 respectively the tds of the shallow groundwater ranged from 871 to 3161 mg l with an average of 1383 625 mg l the salinity of shallow groundwater ranged from 0 5 to 2 8 ppt with an average of 1 0 0 7 ppt the major chemical types were cl na hco3 na and hco3 mg although four deep groundwater samples were collected from depths ranging from 280 to 600 m their isotopic compositions had only minor variations δ2h 54 0 to 51 7 mean sd 52 8 0 9 δ18o 7 01 to 6 60 mean sd 6 85 0 16 the average tds and salinity of deep groundwater samples were 1004 mg l and 0 7 ppt respectively indicating the deep groundwater s freshwater source and minimal contamination by saline water 3 3 3 unsaturated soil water the moisture content salinity and δ18o of the unsaturated soil water in the yrd ranged between 26 0 and 37 1 10 6 ppt and 42 7 ppt 6 40 and 3 18 with averages of 31 5 3 3 22 7 7 8 ppt and 1 73 2 26 respectively the results of all samples are listed in table 2 sp1 which was drilled from a low resistivity zone had the lowest water content and the highest water salinity and isotopic values sp3 however had the lowest salinity and isotopic values indicating a different water and salinity situation in the high resistivity zone vertical variations are shown in fig 6 water content shows an increasing trend from the surface to the depth around 15 cm sp3 or 25 cm sp1 and sp2 porewater salinity was the highest within the depth of 10 cm except for sp2 which was located at a small dried up creek connected to the pond sw2 fig 1b generally an increasing trend of isotopic values with depth can be found especially for sp2 and sp3 4 discussions 4 1 temporal and spatial distribution of water salinity in the reclamation area as indicated by the large scale ert results fig 4 the phreatic aquifer depth 25 m is mostly characterized by resistivity of smaller than 2 ω m which is the general level of seawater kazakis et al 2016 before reclamation the study area consisted of intertidal flats which were affected by seawater flooding and the shallow aquifer was mainly filled by seawater particularly in the more recently reclaimed areas the larger resistivity gradient from 25 to 50 m corresponds to the silty clay layer as shown in the geological profile fig 2 and functions as an aquiclude which restrains the mixing between aquifers mao et al 2020 this layer also confines the groundwater in the deeper zone which has decreasing salinity with depth the resistivity level of the confined aquifer ⅰ indicates that this aquifer is mostly characterized by brackish water kazakis et al 2016 deep groundwater samples collected from 280 to 600 m deep wells gw16 gw19 all have salinity smaller than 1 ppt verifying the existence of fresh groundwater in deeper aquifers in the study area water salinity of the phreatic layer is spatially variable as indicated by the small scale ert results fig 3 in particular in the near surface zone with depth 5 m water salinity has obvious horizontal and vertical variations forming an interval distribution of low and high salinity plumes although the near surface relatively higher resistivity indicates lower soil water salinity porewater samples gw1 1 to gw3 3 extracted from the shallow saturated zone can still reach a salinity of 33 8 ppt which is higher than local seawater in addition the three unsaturated soil profiles also present obvious spatial variations of soil water content and salinity these phenomena suggest that soil water salinity in the near surface area is highly heterogeneous which may be related to the complex mixing between fresh rainwater and saline groundwater as well as evaporation will be discussed later clear seasonal differences in the upper phreatic zone above 10 m can be observed from three small scale measurements of profile a a in december 2016 may 2017 and november 2017 in this section referred to as 1st 2nd and 3rd measurements respectively in the yrd the resistivity in this zone was the highest during the 1st measurement while the groundwater level was the shallowest 0 32 m which was most likely a result of the extreme rainfall events in 2016 annual rainfall 1864 mm 79 higher than the long term mean of 1042 mm the abundant rainwater in 2016 had probably infiltrated to as deep as 2 5 m during the 1st measurement and caused a lower salinity within this depth until the 2nd measurement the near surface low salinity had expanded and formed some low salinity plumes deeper than 5 m fig 3b while some high salinity areas had also appeared near the surface the salinity change ratio between the 1st and 2nd measurements fig 5a clearly indicates the downward movement of fresh rainwater and the recovery of near surface high salinity from the 2nd to the 3rd measurement the widely distributed positive salinity change ratios fig 5b indicate that the shallow salinity had greatly recovered and increased to a relatively high level the vertical distribution of salinity change ratio values of the phreatic aquifer fig 5a b suggests that salinity change mostly occurs from the surface to a depth of around 10 m from 10 to 25 m below the surface however little short term salinity change is observed indicating that this layer has not been contaminated by near surface processes after 5 yr reclamation the long term evolution trend of groundwater salinity can be seen by comparing results in the yrd and ord with different reclamation ages after further 15 yr reclamation the shallow variable salinity distribution had expanded to the entire phreatic layer fig 4c groundwater salinity of the upper phreatic aquifer 0 10 m had decreased by 23 6 36 0 with an annual decrease rate of 1 6 2 4 yr fig 5c with the desalination of the upper phreatic aquifer some villages in the ord can utilize fresh or slight brackish groundwater salinity 3 ppt from domestic wells with a depth of 10 m for the lower part 10 25 m however groundwater salinity had increased by 51 9 42 6 with an annual increase rate of 3 5 2 8 yr this indicates a long term downward migration trend of the salt in the phreatic aquifer under reclamation conditions for the confined aquifer i deeper than 50 m groundwater salinity had also decreased by 18 8 20 0 after 15 years with an annual desalination rate of 1 3 1 3 yr 4 2 hydrological processes in the reclamation area water isotopic and chemical composition provides information on the interactions of different water bodies as well as associated physical and chemical processes under the conditions of reclamation as shown in the plot of δ2h versus δ18o fig 7 water samples collected from rivers and ponds are scattered along the mixing line between precipitation and seawater indicating their different contamination degrees from the saltwater the rivers are scattered close to the precipitation end member and are below the mixing line indicating that the sampled river water originates from local rainwater and that the rivers have experienced evaporation although the tide range can reach up to nearly 4 m these rivers are only minimally affected by saltwater intrusion due to the operation of flood gates zhu et al 2017 for the three samples collected from the ponds in the yrd however sw1 and sw3 show obvious mixing between freshwater and seawater while sw2 contains more seawater and has experienced strong evaporation formed by surface runoff and near surface quick flow during rainfall events these ponds are mixed by rainwater and shallow saline groundwater with different mixing rates shallow porewater points are scattered close to the seawater points forming a line δ2h 2 1δ18o 8 4 r2 0 5 with a smaller slope than that of the local meteoric water line lmwl and the mixing line indicating intense evaporation that the porewater has experienced there is an obvious increasing trend of δ2h and δ18o values with sampling depth moreover the shallow porewater points are scattered closer to the lmwl whereas the deeper porewater is more enriched in heavier isotopes than the seawater these isotopic phenomena together with previous ert results further suggest that rainwater infiltration and evaporation are the two major processes controlling the water salinity of the near surface groundwater in the yrd the unsaturated soil water however has significant isotopic ranges and its points are mostly scattered below the mixing line also indicating the complex processes of rainwater saltwater mixing and evaporation these results prove that the near surface area depth 5 m in the yrd is an active zone of interactive precipitation and evaporation the near surface large horizontal resistivity variations in the yrd as shown in fig 3a indicate that the infiltration of precipitation is characterized by a great heterogeneity which may be related to the near surface flow driven by microtopography for example an obvious outflow creek connected to the pond sw2 is located between 50 and 60 m of the a a survey line fig 1b resulting in a deeper infiltration depth and lower salinity in that section fig 3b the decreasing resistivity and sd values with depth suggest a vertical decreasing effect of precipitation because of the shallow groundwater level and the low soil permeability it would be difficult for rainfall to infiltrate deeper into the shallow aquifer li et al 2022 meanwhile the infiltration of fresh rainwater can also be restricted due to its smaller density than the saltwater underneath eeman et al 2011 after 5 yr reclamation the main influence depth of rainwater infiltration is only about 5 m under extremely abundant rainwater conditions such as 2016 with 1864 mm the rainwater gradually infiltrates deeper and causes a decrease of shallow groundwater salinity in the following year fig 3b and fig 5a in addition to precipitation evaporation is another major factor controlling water and salinity distribution in the near surface zone of the yrd our previous study has shown that the soil water salinity in the unsaturated zone of the reclamation area can reach as high as 90 which is relevant to the intense evaporation process zhan et al 2021 according to the unsaturated soil results in this study the decrease of water content and the increase of soil water salinity mainly happens in the upper 30 cm suggesting the shallow effect of evaporation and salt accumulation however the shallow groundwater depth 1 m makes it possible for quick upward water recharge and maintains a higher evaporation rate the relatively large potential evaporation can in turn accelerate the upward movement of shallow groundwater geng and boufadel 2015 which acts as a persistent salt source for the shallow zone through seasonal monitoring yan et al 2015 also found that the groundwater salinity increased as the groundwater level decreased due to intense evaporation as a result in contrast to the dilution of rainwater infiltration evaporation can be considered as the primary process causing the accumulation of salt in the near surface zone for example the increasing trend of water salinity above 2 5 m from december 2016 to may 2017 fig 5a is a consequence of intense evaporation and salt accumulation due to the long term concentration effect of evaporation shallow porewater becomes more saline than seawater in the ord area that has been reclaimed for decades shallow groundwater collected from domestic pumping wells depths from 6 to 17 m is more depleted in heavier isotopes scattering closer to the end member of local weighted mean precipitation the fitted line of shallow groundwater is δ2h 5 1δ18o 12 4 r2 0 88 the isotopic and chemical results of the shallow groundwater indicate that the upper phreatic aquifer has been dominated by the recharge from rainwater two brackish shallow groundwater samples gw7 and gw9 are of the na cl type and have higher isotopic values therefore it can be inferred that the phreatic aquifer in the study area maintained a great amount of seawater from the inundation period which was then gradually replaced by freshwater from rainfall forming shallow fresh or brackish groundwater over decades in the upper zone the piper plot of all water samples is shown in fig 8 and suggests an obvious desalination trend from the seawater component to the terrestrial freshwater component the chemical type of groundwater evolves from na cl shallow porewater brackish groundwater to hco3 na and hco3 mg fresh groundwater the plot of δ18o versus cl also reveals the desalination process caused by freshwater leaching after land reclamation as well as the near surface salt accumulation due to evaporation fig 8b li et al 2017 have suggested that in addition to these physical processes silicate weathering and ion exchange reactions are also important chemical processes changing the composition of groundwater in the jiangsu coastal plain the deep groundwater samples deeper than confined aquifer iii collected in this study have smaller isotopic values and better water quality suggesting that the deep aquifers are little affected by the brackish aquifers above for the deep confined aquifers under natural conditions the groundwater is thought to be almost static shi et al 2015 however historical hydrogeological data also indicate that the groundwater levels of deeper confined aquifers near this study area are higher than the shallow aquifers ma et al 2022 this may cause the upward discharge of deep groundwater at locations where the aquitard is relatively thin 4 3 water and salt transport mechanism affected by land reclamation the jiangsu coast is characterized by multiple aquifers that have undergone frequent transgression regression processes during the pliocene and holocene groundwater in the phreatic aquifer is evolved from the paleo saltwater of the most recent holocene transgression han and currell 2022 after the latest marine regression rainwater diluting or intense evaporation under the changing climates as well as surface water recharge from the evolving river systems kept modifying phreatic groundwater salinity on millennial timescales li et al 2017 using borehole data previous studies suggested that the phreatic aquifer of the jiangsu coast is desalinating but still contains a considerable proportion of paleo saltwater li et al 2022 2017 which corresponds to the widely distributed low resistivity layer in our ert profiles apart from the desalination process controlled by geological events land reclamation alters the transport of water and salt in coastal aquifers at year decade scales when isolated from the marine environment by land reclamation the coastal phreatic aquifer enters a new process of water and salt evolution fig 9 during different reclamation periods with different land utilization stages groundwater salinity is affected by variable natural and anthropogenic factors for the young reclamation area that has been little developed a combination of the opposite effects by precipitation and evaporation controls shallow groundwater salinity distribution after rainwater reaches the ground surface it infiltrates and mixes with saline porewater and reduces the near surface salinity because of the low permeability shallow groundwater level and flat topography the movement of groundwater and solute is mainly controlled by diffusion li et al 2022 and thus the downward desalination effect of precipitation develops slowly according to our results the desalination depth affected by rainwater infiltration and mixing is only 5 m in the yrd in contrast to the effect of precipitation evaporation accelerates the upward movement of saline shallow groundwater causes salt to accumulate in the surface soil and finally increases the near surface water salinity the desalination effect of rainwater infiltration may be dominant at places with lower elevations or covered by salt tolerant plants zhan et al 2021 although some reclamation areas may experience near surface soil amelioration by methods such as subsurface drainage xin et al 2016 or have been used as aquaculture ponds xu et al 2022 they are not focused in this study for well developed older reclamation districts it was estimated in this study that the upper phreatic layer had a desalting rate of 1 6 2 4 yr and a saltwater downward migrating speed of 0 67 m yr although such desalting speed is much smaller in relative to sandy systems it is much higher than that under natural conditions without reclamation li et al 2022 after long term reclamation the desalination process of shallow groundwater is further affected by human activities such as crop farming which is very common in our study area yin et al 2016 the older reclamation district chosen for the resistivity test was planted with rice and wheat in summer and winter respectively on one hand crop farming which greatly increases vegetation coverage will accelerate the desalination of shallow groundwater by improving freshwater infiltration and reducing soil evaporation zhan et al 2021 on the other hand farmlands in the ord receive abundant freshwater input from irrigation water which has been proved to be another important factor leading to the desalination of phreatic groundwater shi et al 2015 abundant freshwater infiltrates and restrains the saline aquifer in a deeper area driving the downward migration of the saline groundwater therefore it can be concluded that human activities such as crop farming is a key factor that accelerates desalination of groundwater system after land reclamation in coastal reclamation areas the conflict between freshwater resource scarcity and sustainable agricultural development always remains a great challenge han and currell 2022 as such local confined aquifers which were found to have better water quality have been greatly exploited since the 1980s together with the quick expansion and development of reclaimed areas shi et al 2015 however exploitation of confined groundwater along the jiangsu coast has been greatly limited by the government since 2000 to better preserve the deep groundwater resources and avoid environmental issues such as land subsidence zhu et al 2015 deep confined aquifers in this area were formed during the transgression regression processes in the late pliocene and were thought to be recharged by freshwater under colder climatic conditions before the holocene with estimated groundwater age 10 ka li et al 2017 mao et al 2020 the widely distributed negative salinity change ratio within the depth range of the confined aquifer ⅰ suggests that it also has a desalination trend over decades the desalination observed in confined aquifer ⅰmay be related with the horizontal groundwater seaward discharge or vertical exchange within deeper aquifers as observed in other coastal sites han and currell 2022 yuan et al 2013 however further studies on the interactions of different aquifers as well as submarine groundwater discharge are needed for a better knowledge of salinity evolution in local confined aquifers 5 conclusions in this study multi scale spatiotemporal ert surveys were carried out in coastal reclamation areas of the jiangsu coast and combined with water stable isotope and hydrochemical analyses to determine characteristics of the salinity distribution and evolution mechanism of reclaimed areas findings indicate that in the young reclaimed area the shallow phreatic aquifer above 25 m depth is mainly characterized by relict seawater from the inundation period before reclamation after human reclamation shallow phreatic groundwater salinity becomes temporally and spatially highly variable due to complex processes including rainwater infiltration freshwater saline water mixing as well as evaporation rainwater infiltration process only occurs in a very shallow zone and is extremely slow because of the low permeability of the host deposition shallow groundwater level and flat topography the desalination effect of natural rainwater is greatly restricted by saline groundwater upward movement and salt accumulation driven by soil water evaporation in the long term groundwater of the upper phreatic aquifer 0 10 m presents an obvious desalination trend with a salinity decreasing rate of 1 6 2 4 yr the highly saline groundwater still widely exists in older reclamation districts that have been reclaimed for decades however with the downward expansion of the upper low salinity shallow groundwater the old time marine salt gradually migrates to the lower part of the phreatic aquifer such desalination in the phreatic aquifer has been accelerated by freshwater infiltration and leaching from both natural precipitation and agricultural activities such as crop farming deeper confined aquifers contain a large amount of brackish or even fresh groundwater the observed confined aquifer ⅰ is minimally contaminated by saline water and presents a desalination rate of 1 3 1 3 yr as a global land expansion strategy coastal land reclamation is mostly implemented on the existing naturally formed land surface sengupta et al 2018 many intertidal flats or coastal wetlands formed by the deposition of low permeability sediments have been reclaimed for agriculture development which is similar to the situation of our study area this case study of the jiangsu coast provides common insight into the salinity distribution and evolution characteristics in those reclaimed low permeability areas for agricultural purpose it should be pointed out that the effect of planting and irrigation activities on salinity evolution is only preliminarily discussed in this study understanding to what extent can these activities affect groundwater salinity however needs further investigation meanwhile the salinity evolution mechanism in deeper aquifers also warrants further investigation credit authorship contribution statement lucheng zhan conceptualization methodology investigation visualization writing original draft writing

2983,the mouth bar is a common morphological unit in the river delta system its formation and evolution impose an impact on the material exchange between the estuary and ocean here we used an advanced wave current coupled modeling system in an idealized estuary with a prototype of the modaomen estuary china to study the effects of the mouth bar on salt intrusion and the associated salt transport the model results indicate that the mouth bar has a substantial effect on weakening the salt intrusion under the action of river discharge and tides leading to a decrease in the salt intrusion length of 15 23 when a down estuary wind and a landward propagating offshore wave were included in the model the mouth bar can decrease the salt intrusion length up to 21 the hydraulic control at the mouth bar in a state of partially blocked with lee jump can enhance landward salt transport through tidal pumping these findings indicate that the mouth bar has an important control on the salt transport and provides implications for salt intrusion mitigation and sand resource management keywords mouth bar salt intrusion coawst modeling system waves data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the mouth bar is an important morphological unit in a river delta system it forms when a sediment laden flow drains into a basin in which the flow s velocity and momentum are relatively low and the frictional effect in the receiving basin is strong wright 1977 falcini and jerolmack 2010 falcini et al 2014 fagherazzi et al 2015 many dynamical factors work together to affect the formation and evolution of the mouth bar including river flow tides and waves nardin and fagherazzi 2012 leonardi et al 2013 anthony 2015 fagherazzi et al 2015 leuven et al 2016 gao et al 2018 the conceptual model of the formation and evolution of the mouth bar proposed by edmonds and slingerland 2007 identified the stages of its development initial sediment deposition progradation and aggradation of the bar until progradation ceases then channel formation and bifurcation the development of the mouth bar affects the navigability of channels the water and material exchange between the estuary and ocean and the ecological safety of the estuarine system salt transport is an important component in the material exchanges between the estuary and ocean saline water from the ocean side intrudes into the estuary through several physical processes such as estuarine circulation and tidal pumping maccready and geyer 2010 salt intrusion determines the length of the estuary the strength of the estuarine circulation and the capacity of material transport in the estuary it has been observed to aggravate in many estuaries around the world due to climate change and human interventions e g delaware estuary chant et al 2018 hudson river estuary ralston and geyer 2019 and pearl river estuary hong et al 2020 the salt intrusion is affected by many factors including external forcings river discharge tides winds and waves and internal bathymetry many studies have addressed the controls of estuarine bathymetry on the salt intrusion like how the existence of shoals and channel affects the salt dynamics in the delaware bay usa aristizábal and chant 2013 and how the convergence of the estuary s width and depth affect salt intrusion kuijper and van rijn 2011 however little research has focused on the impacts of the mouth bar on salt intrusion in estuaries the mouth bar at the entrance of an estuary may work as a sill in a fjord system which exerts hydraulic control on the exchange flow between the estuary and ocean farmer and armi 1986 however the mouth bar is generally shallow even emergent to the water surface like the mouth bar in misa river estuary italy baldoni et al 2021 the ratio of the maximum height h m of the mouth bar to the unperturbed lower layer thickness of the ambient flow h 2 h a h m h 2 is generally close to or larger than unity as a result the flow across the sill is partially blocked and may bifurcate into the side distributary channels baines 1995 in this way the flow over the mouth bar may or may not experience a hydraulic jump for example there occurred no hydraulic jump at the mattituck sill in the long island sound usa whitney et al 2014 nevertheless the mouth bar imposes a resistance on the flow as it induces strong bottom stress due to its shallowness and generates enhanced mixing and energy dissipation when compared to that without a mouth bar moreover the mouth bar imposes a depth limit for the surface wave height when the wave propagates landward from offshore and induces more wave breaking and wave energy loss therefore the existence of the mouth bar would change the current wave height and water mixing and affect the salt transport between the estuary and ocean however to our knowledge this effect remains rarely explored here we took the modaomen estuary china as a prototype to study the effects of a mouth bar on the salt intrusion in a partially mixed estuary there exists a large mouth bar at the modaomen estuary s entrance which has been undergoing continuous evolution he et al 2018 tan et al 2019 the salt intrusion in the estuary has become more serious in recent decades which impaired the freshwater withdrawal by the water treatment plants along the estuary and threatened the freshwater supply to the people around the estuary the salt intrusion dynamics have been extensively studied in the past e g gong and shen 2011 payo payo et al 2022 among which the effects of the mouth bar have not received attention though the prototype site of this study is the modaomen estuary we still chose to conduct our study in a broader context in that we designed idealized bathymetry and geometry to represent a typical estuary with a mouth bar here we utilize the widely used community modeling system coawst coupled ocean atmospheric wave sediment transport in an idealized estuary which mimics the modaomen estuary to investigate the effects of the mouth bar on the salt intrusion in a partially mixed estuary we adopted this strategy based on two considerations 1 an idealized estuary simplifies the real situation and makes us more focused on the essential physics in fact the modaomen estuary has a very complex geometry and bathymetry it is connected to many other river branches along its course and has a meandering channel that experiences several bifurcations these characteristics make the study based on the real estuary unnecessarily complicated 2 an idealized estuary is more representative than a specific one and thus is more inclusive for example the geometry of this idealized estuary can represent other estuaries with different combinations of convergent and straight segments like the delaware river estuary hudson river estuary thames river estuary conwy estuary etc as such this study is of broader relevance to the mouth bar s effects on salt intrusion rather than a case study the aims of this study are to 1 investigate the changes in salt intrusion by the presence of the mouth bar under different hydrological conditions such as under the forcings of river flow tides wind and waves 2 examine the changes in the state of the estuary by the presence of the mouth bar such as the salinity stratification estuarine circulation and the salt transport flux 3 reveal the physics of such changes induced by the mouth bar it should be noted that we did not aim to explore the whole parameter space for the effect of the mouth bar such as the geometry and extent of the mouth bar different combinations of river discharge tides winds and waves we chose typical hydrodynamic conditions representing the situations in the modaomen estuary and examined the salt intrusion with and without the presence of the mouth bar in the following we first present the numerical setup and data analysis methods section 2 results section 3 include analyses of the numerical outputs such as the changes in salt intrusion and salt transport flux under different hydrological scenarios section 4 is a discussion about the effect of the hydraulic processes around the mouth bar and the implications and limitations of this study we draw conclusions in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 a brief introduction to the modaomen estuary the modaomen estuary with a simplified version was chosen as a prototype site for this study the modaomen estuary is located in the pearl river delta china and is characterized as a microtidal regime with alternating spring and neap tides the tidal range is approximately 1 m during neap tides and 2 5 m during spring tides it is the main conduit for the river flow from the pearl river to debouch into the coastal ocean gong and shen 2011 the river discharge into the estuary has a distinct seasonal variation with a mean flow of 11000 m3 s during wet seasons may to september and approximately 3500 m3 s during dry seasons november to february as salt intrusion is more of a concern in the dry season we chose the corresponding hydrological situations for our investigation during the dry season the downestuary wind northerly prevails with a wind speed of 6 m s whereas the waves are mostly swells from offshore with a mean wave height of approximately 1 2 m jia et al 2014 for more details about the estuary the readers can refer to gong and shen 2011 and payo payo et al 2022 the mouth bar at the modaomen estuary is an important morphological feature and has experienced evolution processes of seaward progradation and aggradation he et al 2018 tan et al 2019 some proposals had been put forward to remove this mouth bar as it impedes navigation and enhances the flood risk during flood seasons moreover as the mouth bar is mostly composed of well sorted sand the extraction of this mineral resource is increasingly demanded by the flourishing construction market the removal of the mouth bar raised the concerns of salt intrusion aggravation in the estuary and a more severe threat to the freshwater supply 2 2 model configuration the coawst modeling system was used in this idealized modeling study warner et al 2010 this system consists of a model coupling toolkit to exchange data fields between an ocean model regional ocean modeling system roms an atmosphere model advanced research weather research and forecasting model wrf a wave model simulating waves nearshore model swan and a sediment model community sediment transport model cstm the atmospheric and sediment models were not activated here roms is a free surface hydrostatic primitive equation ocean model that uses stretched terrain following vertical coordinates and orthogonal curvilinear horizontal coordinates on an arakawa c grid haidvogel et al 2000 the model domain was designed as an estuary shelf system fig 1 in the coordinate system x represents the cross estuary direction and is positive toward the right y represents the along channel direction and is positive toward the land area and z is directed upward the origin of the system is in the middle of the estuary mouth the estuary is comprised of two parts in the lower part the estuary features a convergent geometry from the estuary mouth to 10 km upstream with a width convergent length scale of 10 km the width at the estuary mouth is also set to be 10 km upstream of this lower part the estuary is almost straight and 140 km long with a width convergent length scale of 500 km the water depth was specified to decrease linearly from the estuary mouth to the head in the lateral direction each cross section has a channel and two side shoals with the lateral profile of water depth as a gaussian distribution the maximum water depth in the estuary is 15 m and a minimum water depth of 2 m is used the bathymetry in the estuary was specified as 1 h x y h min h max h min y l 0 1 x b h max h min 1 y l e c f 4 x 2 b 2 where h max 15 m and h min 2 0 m are the maximum and minimum water depths at the estuary mouth respectively and c f is the tidal flat parameter and set as 4 as used by wei et al 2016 the above configuration was used to approximately mimic the geometry and bathymetry of the modaomen estuary though many details were not represented in this idealized bathymetry e g multiple meandering and alternating channels and several sand bars inside the estuary were not included in the model configuration to investigate the effect of the mouth bar we designed another model bathymetry to represent the mouth bar in the lower part of the estuary the mouth bar is approximately ellipse shaped in the horizontal and has a top in the middle of the ellipse with a water depth of 2 m the water depth increases from the top to the periphery of the ellipse with an exponential form that resembles a gaussian distribution the bathymetries with and without the mouth bar are shown in fig 1 to overcome the difficulty of specifying boundary conditions at the estuary mouth we added a continental shelf in the model domain fig 1 the shelf is 50 km wide and 200 km long the water depth of the shelf is uniform in the alongshore direction except near the estuary mouth and increases linearly from the coast to offshore with a slope of 1 10 4 the model grid has 444 441 cells with a cross channel spatial resolution of 40 m and an along channel resolution of 200 m inside the estuary the horizontal resolution decreases on the shelf and becomes 2 km at the offshore upstream and downstream ocean boundaries 21 vertical s grid layers were specified with higher resolutions near the surface and bottom and the coefficients of θs θb and hc for the s coordinate were set to 2 5 3 0 and 5 0 respectively we calculated the vertical mixing using the k ε submodel of the generic length scale turbulence closure scheme umlauf and burchard 2003 warner et al 2005 in our model simulations we configured model scenarios without and with waves in scenarios with wave effects the wave dissipation due to wave breaking and surface streaming is included in the surface boundary conditions for turbulent kinetic energy the wave dissipation is calculated via the method established by thornton and guza 1983 to consider the wave dissipation induced mixing in the water column the horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity are calculated using the smagorinsky scheme smagorinsky 1963 in model scenarios disregarding wave effects the bottom friction is calculated according to the log layer assumption near the bottom with a bottom roughness length of 1 mm this setting results in a mean bottom drag coefficient of 0 005 with waves the wave current bottom boundary layer dynamics were activated via the method developed by madsen 1994 in the roms model the open ocean boundary condition for the barotropic component consists of a chapman flather boundary condition for the sea surface elevation and depth averaged flow chapman 1985 flather 1976 the open boundary conditions for the temperature salinity and baroclinic current are the orlanski type radiation condition orlanski 1976 the swan model was run and coupled to the same grid as the roms model the wave model is driven by the specified wave at the offshore boundary and modulated by water level and current fields from the roms model the roms and swan models exchange information at an interval of 30 min to introduce the wave current interactions wcis the exchanged information comprises the significant wave height surface peak wave period mean wave direction and length wave energy dissipation percentage of breaking waves from swan to roms and water level and current from roms to swan the wave vortex force is activated to calculate the wave induced momentum flux using the method proposed by mcwilliams et al 2004 which was later implemented in coawst by kumar et al 2012 to examine the effects of the mouth bar on salt dynamics we ran several numerical experiments the settings for different cases are listed in table 1 case 01 was specified with a river discharge of 3 500 m3 s at the estuary head this river discharge is the mean value of the modaomen estuary in the dry season gong and shen 2011 two tidal constituents of m 2 and s 2 were specified at the offshore open boundary with the tidal periods being 12 42 and 12 h respectively the amplitudes of these two constituents were set to 0 75 and 0 25 m the specification of m 2 and s 2 tides were to examine the spring neap variations at the estuary head the inflowing river water was set to zero salinity and a temperature of 22 c identical to the background temperature setting throughout the entire domain the incoming salinity at the offshore boundary was set to 34 psu in case 01 we ran with the bathymetry without the mouth bar whereas for case 02 the mouth bar was included in the model bathymetry in case 11 we specified a constant downestuary northerly wind of 6 m s apart from the river flow and tides for the bathymetry without the mouth bar the 6 m s northerly wind is a typical wind condition in the modaomen estuary in the dry season for case 12 the same forcings were set as in case 11 but we included the mouth bar in the model bathymetry in case 21 in addition to the external forcings in case 11 we added wave effects in the model by specifying a constant swell wave at the offshore boundary south wave with h s of 2 5 m t p of 6 5 s and turning on the wind induced wave by the downestuary wind this condition is representative of the situation outside the modaomen estuary in the dry season this scenario represents a highly favorable condition for salt intrusion which occurs frequently in the estuary under the external forcing conditions described above we ran the model without case 21 and with case 22 the mouth bar respectively to further examine the dependence of the mouth bar s effects on the variations of river discharge we ran other model cases with higher river discharge 5500 m3 s and lower discharge 1500 m3 s with the same tidal forcing wind and waves as in case 21 in all the cases the initial conditions were set by specifying the water elevation and current as zero and a constant temperature of 22 c we set an initial salinity condition of uniform 34 psu in the continental shelf and linearly decreasing from the estuary mouth of 34 psu to zero with a distance of 140 km in the lateral and vertical directions the initial salinity was set as uniform all the model simulations were run for 60 days owing to the relatively high river discharge the salt dynamics inside the estuary adjust quickly and nearly reach a quasi equilibrium situation within 10 days in the following we used the results on day 36 and day 43 to represent the situations during neap and spring tides respectively 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 decomposition of salt transport flux for a cross section to examine the salt transport we decomposed the current salinity and salt transport flux into different components as proposed by lerczak et al 2006 2 a 0 0 w 1 0 h η d σ d y 3 f s v s d a 0 w 1 0 h η v s d σ d y 4 v 0 1 a 0 v y σ t d a 1 a 0 0 w 1 0 h η v d σ d y 5 v e y σ h η h v v 0 6 v t y σ t v v e y σ v 0 where the overbar denotes tidally averaged and v is the longitudinal current the salinity is decomposed in a similar way the above averaging is physically a thickness weighted averaging as explained in klingbeil et al 2017 the tidally averaged salt transport is then expressed as f s 0 w 1 0 h η v s d σ d y 0 w 1 0 h η v 0 v e v t s 0 s e s t d σ d y 0 w 1 0 h η v 0 s 0 v e s e v t s t d σ d y 7 q 0 s 0 advective f e steady s h e a r f t tidal o s c i l l a t o r y where the advective denotes the salt transport by the river discharge and the tidally averaged stokes flow the steady shear depicts that by the estuarine circulation and salinity stratification and the tidal oscillatory represents the correlation between the tidally varying current and salinity 2 3 2 calculation of the composite froude number the composite froude number f r is a commonly used nondimensional number to describe the status of the flow i e supercritical or subcritical valle levinson et al 2001 here we adopted a method to distinguish a single layer and two layer state of the water column and calculate the corresponding f r we set that when the stratification number s p is less than 0 01 where s p is defined as the ratio of the bottom surface salinity difference to the vertically averaged salinity the water column is classified as a single layer otherwise it is defined as a two layer state for the single layer state the f r was estimated as 8 f r u 2 g h 9 g g ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 where u is the depth averaged current g is the gravity acceleration g is the reduced gravity acceleration h is the total water depth ρ 0 is the background density and ρ is the water density here ρ ρ 0 1 β s in which β is the saline contraction coefficient and s is the salinity for the two layer state we first defined the vertical layer with the largest vertical salinity gradient as the pycnocline and calculated the averaged current and salinity above and below the pycnocline the upper layer and lower layer respectively the f r was then obtained as 10 f r u 1 2 g h 1 u 2 2 g h 2 11 g g ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 0 in which u 1 u 2 are the velocity of the upper and lower layers respectively and h 1 h 2 are the thickness for the upper and lower layers whereas ρ 1 ρ 2 are the densities of the upper and lower layers respectively 3 results 3 1 salt intrusion change under the forcings of river flow and tides we first present the variation of tidal amplitude at the estuary mouth without a mouth bar fig 2 a the tidal amplitude fluctuates with a period of approximately15 days between spring and neap tides with amplitudes of 1 7 and 0 86 m respectively the period shown here is caused by the beating of m 2 and s 2 tides i e the spring neap cycle 14 8 days along with the variation of tidal amplitude the salt intrusion length shows a consistent fluctuation fig 2b here we distinguish the bottom and surface salt intrusion the bottom surface salt intrusion length is defined as the distance of the 1 psu isohaline at the bottom surface along the deep channel from the estuary mouth the strongest bottom intrusion 41 km occurs during neap tides and the strongest surface intrusion 31 km occurs two days later after neap tides the weakest bottom intrusion 28 km happens during spring tides whereas the weakest surface intrusion 20 km lags spring tides by 2 days this pattern of salinity variation with spring and neap tides clearly shows that the estuary is in a partially stratified state maccready and geyer 2010 and the range of the bottom intrusion length is consistent with the results in gong and shen 2011 which has been verified by observation data the existence of the mouth bar restrains the salt intrusion in the whole simulation period it decreases the bottom and surface salt intrusions by 15 and 20 in the neap tides respectively with a bottom surface intrusion length of 34 5 24 5 km and the bottom and surface salt intrusions by 23 and 35 in the spring tides with an intrusion length of 23 km and 20 km respectively it is noted that the mouth bar has a great effect on reducing salt intrusion especially during the spring tides that is the mouth bar has a greater effect on reducing the salt intrusion when the tidal forcing is stronger we examined the changes in tidal amplitude along the estuary during the neap and spring tides in the neap tide the mouth bar decreases the tidal amplitude in the whole estuary fig 3 a with a magnitude ranging from 0 01 to 0 12 m representing a reduction percentage ranging from 2 to 12 the greatest decrease occurs at a distance of 30 km from the estuary mouth during the spring tide fig 3b the mouth bar decreases the tidal amplitude along the estuary with a magnitude ranging from 0 01 to 0 3 m a relative reduction from 3 to 18 in the spring tide the greatest change occurs at the mouth bar area overall the existence of the mouth bar decreases the tidal strength more significantly in the spring tide than in the neap tide this seems contrary to its effect on reducing the salt intrusion as presented above because a greater decrease in tidal amplitude means a larger decrease in tidal mixing and thus the mouth bar should be less effective in reducing salt intrusion during the spring tide it has been well known that for a partially mixed estuary a weaker tidal mixing corresponds to a stronger salt intrusion and vice versa bowen and geyer 2003 we will further explore the mechanisms behind such a phenomenon the distributions of salinity and residual flow along the longitudinal transect of the middle channel further demonstrate the variations of salt intrusion between neap and spring tides and the changes induced by the mouth bar fig 4 without the mouth bar the bottom surface salt intrusion length is about 41 23 km during the neap tide fig 4a the bottom salt intrusion decreases to 28 km whereas the surface salt intrusion slightly decreases to 22 5 km in the spring tide fig 4b under the presence of the mouth bar during the neap tide fig 4c the salinity structure on top of the mouth bar shows a strongly mixed situation and landward of the mouth bar the water becomes much freshened when compared with that without the mouth bar the bottom surface salt intrusion recedes to 33 15 km it is seen that during the neap tide the region landward of the mouth bar features an overturning circulation and the lower salinity water at the upper layers is mixed downward at the inner slope of the mouth bar in the meantime there develops upslope current at the lower part of the inner slope which upwells higher salinity water from the bottom to upper layers seaward the mouth bar a similar phenomenon is observed during the spring tide fig 4d with the mouth bar the bottom surface salt intrusion decreases to 23 17 km the water on top of the mouth bar shows a well mixed condition the region landward of the mouth bar exhibits a uni directionally seaward flow with stronger upwelling occurring at the inner slope of the mouth bar we then examined the lateral distributions of the longitudinal residual flow and salinity and the lateral circulation at three chosen cross sections one at the estuary mouth another one just landward of the mouth bar a distance of 8 km from the estuary mouth and a further upstream one in the middle reach of the estuary a distance of 15 km from the estuary mouth for the cross section at the estuary mouth during the neap tide fig 5 a a typical two layer estuarine circulation is developed with a surface seaward flow and a bottom landward flow the lateral circulation shows a pattern with weak downwelling in the middle of the channel and upwelling along the side slopes this pattern is analogous to a typical lateral circulation in a straight estuary hetland and geyer 2004 this lateral circulation acts to redistribute salinity and homogenize the salinity distribution at the cross section resulting in a more mixed situation the salinity stratification is well developed with a bottom surface salinity difference larger than 25psu with the mouth bar the cross section is divided into a middle bar and two side channels fig 5c the structure of the longitudinal estuarine circulation shows that the seaward flow occupies most of the cross section especially in the side channels the surface water overlying the mouth bar shows a weak landward flow this landward flow may be induced by the tidal stokes drift li and o donnel 1997 two strong rotating cells are formed in the side channels a clockwise one at the right channel and an anticlockwise one at the left channel this lateral circulation directs the relatively lower salinity water on the top of the mouth bar to the side channels and thus stratifies the water column there though with the enhancement of stratification by the lateral circulation the salinity distribution in the cross section shows that the vertical stratification is greatly reduced with a bottom surface salinity difference of less than 22 5 psu this suggests that the weakening of the longitudinal straining by the mouth bar which lessens the stratification may dominate over the lateral straining which strengthens the stratification during the spring tide fig 5b similar longitudinal estuarine circulation is formed in the cross section with the bottom landward flow and surface seaward flow being both weakened the lateral circulation shows a dominant upwelling over most of the cross section which mixes the water in the cross section the stratification is weak with a bottom surface salinity difference of 15 psu under the presence of the mouth bar fig 5d the residual flow on the top of the mouth bar is weakly seaward and a uni directionally seaward flow is well developed at the side channels there also form two rotational cells in the two side channels the salinity stratification is much lower than that during the neap tide with a bottom surface salinity difference of only 5 psu overall the mouth bar decreases the estuarine circulation and salinity stratification at the cross section of the estuary mouth for the cross section at the landward side of the mouth bar without the mouth bar in the neap tide fig 6 a the estuarine circulation is mildly developed with a weak landward flow in the bottom the vertical stratification is strong with a bottom surface salinity difference of 27 psu under the presence of the mouth bar fig 6c the estuarine circulation is more developed with both the surface seaward flow and bottom landward flow being enhanced in the meantime the lateral circulation becomes stronger the salinity stratification keeps strong with a bottom surface salinity difference of 24 psu in the spring tide without the mouth bar fig 6b the cross section is dominated by seaward flow except for some weak landward flows at the side shoals the salinity stratification is weak with a bottom surface salinity difference of 12 5 psu under the presence of the mouth bar fig 6d the two layer estuarine circulation is well developed with the bottom landward flow reaching 0 3 m s simultaneously the lateral flow is strengthened and the salinity stratification is increased with a bottom surface salinity difference of 17 5 psu the mouth bar increases the estuarine circulation and stratification at the landward side of the mouth bar these changes are consistent with the change in tidal amplitude as the mouth bar decreases the tidal strength at this location fig 3 for the cross section in the middle reach of the estuary fig 7 during the neap tide the mouth bar increases the surface seaward flow but decreases the bottom landward flow changes the downwelling to upwelling in the middle of the channel and decreases the salinity stratification from a bottom surface salinity difference of 25 psu to 21 5 psu fig 7c vs 7a in the spring tide the mouth bar decreases the seaward flow at the surface and reduces the salinity stratification from a bottom surface salinity difference of 13 psu to 3 psu this decrease in stratification is dramatic and is due to the weakened salt intrusion overall the river mouth decreases the estuarine circulation and salinity stratification at the cross section in the middle reach of the estuary from the above results we can conclude that the mouth bar decreases the estuarine circulation and stratification at the estuary mouth increase them at the landward side of the mouth bar and decrease them again further upstream these changes are caused by the changes in tidal mixing and salt intrusion and will impact salt transport as shown below 3 2 salt transport flux changes under the forcings of river flow and tides we investigated the salt transport flux to illustrate the mechanisms for the changes in salt intrusion induced by the presence of the mouth bar the results are shown in fig 8 during the neap tide fig 8a the net flux is landward under both scenarios without and with the mouth bar showing a salt importation under the weak tidal mixing condition without the mouth bar the steady shear dominates over the tidal oscillatory in the estuary in the lower convergent part of the estuary the steady shear decreases continuously whereas the tidal oscillatory increases consistently once into the straight upper part the steady shear increases slightly and reaches a maximum at 15 km from the estuary mouth after that it decreases all the way the tidal oscillatory decreases quickly when entering into the upper straight part and attains a local minimum at 15 km from the estuary mouth it changes slightly further upstream at the salt intrusion front the tidal oscillatory becomes dominant over the steady shear under the presence of the mouth bar the tidal oscillatory increases dramatically at the estuary mouth accompanied by a great decrease in the steady shear there the steady shear decreases firstly and then increases considerably at the mouth bar region whereas the tidal oscillatory decreases sharply and even becomes seaward in the region between 5 and 10 km from the estuary mouth this transit of the tidal oscillatory from landward to seaward is remarkable which will be investigated later we note that the maximum steady shear and the minimum tidal oscillatory occur just at the landward limit of the mouth bar where a significant decrease in tidal amplitude occurs fig 3 this increase in the steady shear is consistent with the increases in estuarine circulation and stratification at the landward side of the mouth bar which has been described above after the mouth bar the steady shear decreases exponentially whereas the tidal oscillatory changes from seaward into landward and increases to a local maximum at 20 km from the estuary mouth at the salt intrusion front the tidal oscillatory dominates over the steady shear the advective flux is seaward for both the cases without and with the mouth bar with the mouth bar the seaward advective flux is reduced in magnitude mostly due to the decreased salinity as the salt intrusion is mostly induced by the landward salt transport which is the summation of the steady shear and the tidal oscillatory we present the changes in the total landward salt flux induced by the mouth bar in fig 8c it is seen that during the neap tide the mouth bar decreases the landward salt flux along the estuary until the salt intrusion limit during the spring tide fig 8b different situations occur for the spatial variations of the different components the net flux is mostly seaward except at the estuary mouth showing an overall export of salt during the strong tidal mixing without the mouth bar the tidal oscillatory is larger than the steady shear in the whole estuary except near the estuary mouth less than 5 km from the estuary mouth this contrast is conspicuous in the upper straight part of the estuary under the presence of the mouth bar the tidal oscillatory increases greatly at the estuary mouth and then drops sharply in the mouth bar region 5 10 k m but keeps a landward direction on the contrary the steady shear decreases to nearly zero at the estuary mouth and then increases greatly and reaches a maximum at the landward limit of the mouth bar when entering into the upper straight part the steady shear is taken over by the tidal oscillatory the seaward advective flux is also found to decrease in magnitude under the presence of the mouth bar the changes in the total landward salt flux in the spring tide fig 8d also show that the mouth bar decreases the landward salt flux along the estuary from the above analysis we stress that during the neap tide the steady shear is the dominant landward salt transport component whereas during the spring tide the tidal oscillatory becomes the leading order component during both the spring and neap tides the mouth bar reduces the landward salt transport at the estuary mouth by decreasing the steady shear considerably though the tidal oscillatory is increased at the estuary mouth this increase cannot offset the decrease in the steady shear this decrease in landward salt flux at the estuary mouth determines the salt content variation inside the estuary during the neap tide the decrease in tidal amplitude and mixing by the mouth bar generates a weakened mixing inside the estuary and enhances the estuarine circulation and stratification to some extent thus offsetting the decrease in landward salt flux at the estuary mouth however during the spring tide along with the decrease in landward salt flux at the estuary mouth the decrease in tidal amplitude and mixing by the mouth bar reduces the tidal oscillatory inside the estuary thus augmenting the decrease in landward salt transport this can be seen in fig 8c and 8d in which during the neap tide the total landward salt flux decreases slowly in the estuary whereas it decreases more quickly in the estuary during the spring tide we assume that this difference in the changing pattern of the landward salt flux can explain why the mouth bar reduces the salt intrusion more in the spring tide than in the neap tide as we have presented the changes in estuarine circulation and salinity stratification at the three cross sections above which determine the changes in the steady shear in the chosen cross sections here we show the changes in the correlations between the tidal variations of current and salinity at these cross sections we examined the changes in amplitudes of current salinity and the phase difference between these two variables in the three chosen cross sections as the change patterns are similar for the neap and spring tides we selected the situation in the neap tide as an example we conducted a harmonic analysis for the 25 hour data for the salinity and longitudinal current and obtain the phase shift relative to a reference time i e the high tide time as it is the phase difference between the current and salinity that is of interest an arbitrary choice of a reference time does not affect our analysis the results are shown in fig 9 for the cross section at the estuary mouth the fluctuation magnitudes of the longitudinal current fig 9a show that the mouth bar increases the magnitude of the tidal current particularly in the side channels this is expected as the presence of the mouth bar decreases the cross section s area and makes the tidal flow more concentrated resulting in a stronger tidal current for the fluctuation of the tidal salinity fig 9d it shows that the mouth bar increases the magnitude of the salinity variation in a tidal cycle this is consistent with the increase in the tidal current as the horizontal salinity gradient does not show an obvious change and the advection of the salinity gradient by a stronger tidal current would induce a greater salinity change for the phase relationship between the current and salinity fig 9g it is less than quadrature in the upper and middle parts of the section and larger than quadrature at the side shoals when there is no mouth bar under the presence of the mouth bar the phase difference is mostly less than quadrature showing that the variations of current and salinity are more in phase with the increases in fluctuating magnitudes of tidal current salinity and decreased phase difference between them the tidal oscillatory is greatly enhanced fig 9j for the cross section at the landward limit of the mouth bar the tidal current experiences a slight increase in the upper part of the cross section due to the decrease of the cross sectional area but endures a decrease at the bottom due to the blocking by the mouth bar fig 9b it shows that the magnitude of the tidal salinity variation is decreased in the upper part of the cross section but is increased in the middle and lower parts of the cross section fig 9e for the phase relationship between the current and salinity fig 9h it is less than quadrature when there is no mouth bar but changes into a pattern with an in phase relationship at the surface of the channel and an out of phase relationship in the middle and lower parts of the cross section this change is very distinct indicating that higher salinity occurs at the ebb and lower salinity occurs at the flood we deduced that at ebb tide the high salinity water in the middle and lower parts of the cross section is blocked by the mouth bar and is retained there at flood tide the surface water with relatively lower salinity is dumped into the middle and bottom layers freshening the water there in this way the current and salinity in the middle and lower parts of the cross section exhibit an out of phase relationship the change in the phase relationship results in a negative tidal oscillatory at the cross section which has been shown in fig 8a for the cross section at the middle reach of the estuary the tidal current is slightly increased in the upper part but decreased near the bottom of the cross section fig 9c the magnitude of the salinity fluctuation is decreased in the upper part but increased near the bottom fig 9f the phase relationship between the current and salinity is less than quadrature in the channel but larger than quadrature at the side shoals when there is no mouth bar it becomes more in phase under the presence of the mouth bar fig 9i as a result the tidal oscillatory is decreased in most of the cross section under the presence of the mouth bar fig 9i which is mostly due to the decrease in the magnitude of salinity tidal variation from the above analysis we can see that the existence of the mouth bar decreases the tidal strength inside the estuary and increases the stratification and estuarine circulation and therefore the steady shear component at the landward side of the mouth bar further upstream with the decrease of salt intrusion the estuarine circulation and salinity stratification are both decreased resulting in a decrease in the steady shear however it increases the tidal fluctuations of current and salinity at the estuary mouth and increases the tidal oscillatory transport there it decreases or even reverses the tidal oscillatory at the landward limit of the mouth bar further upstream the mouth bar decreases the tidal variations of current and salinity and the tidal oscillatory these changes work together to cause a smaller reduction in salt intrusion during the neap tide but an aggravated reduction during the spring tide 3 3 salt intrusion and salt transport changes under the combined actions of river flow tides and wind as the wind force can change the estuarine circulation and salinity stratification in estuaries scully et al 2005 it thus can alter the salt intrusion a moderate downestuary wind can enhance the estuarine circulation and stratification by the wind straining which overwhelms the wind mixing thus promoting the salt intrusion chen and sanford 2009 we specified a moderate downestuary wind northerly wind of 6 m s here to examine the effect of the mouth bar under the combined actions of river discharge tides and wind the results are shown in fig 10 a when the downestuary wind was applied in the model the salt intrusion length is increased when there is no mouth bar compared with the case without wind this is consistent with the previous studies scully et al 2005 chen and sanford 2009 the maximum bottom surface salt intrusion in the neap tides becomes 43 34 km larger than the value in case 01 41 31 km the minimum bottom surface salt intrusion during the spring tide becomes 30 21 km rather than 28 20 km in case 01 under the presence of the mouth bar the bottom surface salt intrusion during the neap tide is 37 28 km a relative decrease of 14 21 during the spring tide the bottom surface salt intrusion is 25 16 km a relative decrease of 17 24 compared to that without the mouth bar this shows that with the downestuary wind the effect of the mouth bar on reducing the salt intrusion is still considerable but a little less than that without wind we examined the changes in the salt transport flux by the mouth bar and noted that the change patterns are very similar to those in case 01 and case 02 not shown we thus deduced that the relatively smaller impact of the mouth bar in this external forcing scenario can be due to the relatively larger salt intrusion length in case 11 that is a larger denominator induces a relatively smaller change 3 4 salt intrusion and salt transport changes under the previous forcings and waves we investigated the effects of the mouth baron salt dynamics when a landward propagating wave from the offshore boundary was added to the model simulations in this scenario the wind generated local wind sea is also activated this combination of the external forcings is the most favorable scenario for salt intrusion when waves were taken into consideration the salt intrusion becomes more severe fig 10b without the mouth bar the bottom surface salt intrusion length is 46 37 km during the neap tide compared to a value of 43 34 km in case 11 showing an increase in the salt intrusion the bottom surface intrusion length becomes 34 24 km during the spring tide compared to a value of 30 21 km in case 11 under the presence of the mouth bar the bottom surface salt intrusion length during the neap tide becomes 38 29 km representing a relative reduction of 17 22 the bottom surface intrusion length becomes 27 18 km during the spring tide showing a relative reduction of 21 25 these results indicate that under the combined actions of river flow tides wind and waves the mouth bar has a greater effect on decreasing salt intrusion it is also seen that with the wave effects the mouth bar has a similar effect on reducing the salt intrusion during the neap and spring tides to illustrate the physics causing such changes we present the changes in hydrodynamics firstly fig 11 the variation of the wave height h s along the longitudinal transect in the estuary are shown in fig 11a and 11d the wave propagates from the offshore to the estuary with a continuous reduction of wave height from 2 5 m at the offshore boundary to approximately 0 8 m at the estuary mouth the wave penetrates the estuary in a short distance the h s larger than 0 1 m is located below 25 km from the estuary mouth during the neap tide fig 11a and below 20 km during the spring tide fig 11d under the presence of the mouth bar the wave height decreases quickly near the estuary mouth fig 11a and 11d during the neap tide the wave height is 0 55 m at the estuary mouth and decreases to 0 04 m within 20 km from the estuary mouth during the spring tide the wave height is again 0 55 m at the estuary mouth but decreases more quickly when propagating into the estuary the wave height becomes less than 0 02 m at a distance of 20 km from the estuary mouth it is seen that the mouth bar has a greater impact on reducing the wave height during the spring tide we were not certain whether this greater decrease in wave height at the estuary mouth during the spring tide is owing to the more enhanced bottom friction or due to the stronger ebb current and the associated wave breaking by the wave current interaction in the spring tide anyway during the spring tide the mouth bar has a relatively stronger effect in dissipating the wave energy along with the change in wave height the estuarine circulation in the estuary is also changed in fig 11 we also present the changes in surface and bottom residual flows induced by the mouth bar during the neap tide the surface seaward flow is decreased by the mouth bar along the estuary and is even reversed from the seaward flow into landward flow near the estuary mouth fig 11b this landward surface flow is caused by the enhanced wave setup and surface streaming on the top of the mouth bar for the bottom flow fig 11c without the mouth bar it is landward at the estuary mouth and decreases in the lower convergent part of the estuary after entering the upper straight part the landward bottom flow increases in the middle reach of the estuary and changes into seaward flow when going further upstream where it is dominated by the river flow under the presence of the mouth bar the bottom flow changes into seaward flow near the summit of the mouth bar at the landward side of the mouth bar the bottom flow changes from seaward to landward and attains a maximum at the junction between the lower convergent part and the upper straight part it quickly changes into seaward when going upstream this shows that the mouth bar increases the landward flow just landward of the mouth bar but decreases greatly the landward flow in the middle and upper reaches of the estuary during the spring tide the mouth bar decreases the seaward surface flow in the estuary especially at the summit of the mouth bar fig 11e the bottom flow is almost seaward without the mouth bar and the mouth bar decreases the bottom seaward flow along the estuary fig 11f in general the mouth bar decreases the surface seaward flow and the bottom landward flow and thus decreases the estuarine circulation we further examined the changes in residual water level bottom stress and vertical mixing induced by the mouth bar fig 12 during both the neap and spring tides the mouth bar elevates the residual water level along the estuary this effect is most conspicuous at the lower convergent part of the estuary during the spring tide fig 12b for the bottom stress during the neap tide fig 12c when there is no mouth bar it increases in the lower convergent part of the estuary and then declines to the middle reach followed by an increase in the upper reach under the presence of the mouth bar the bottom stress increases remarkably in the mouth bar area after the summit of the mouth bar it decreases sharply followed by a slow increase during the spring tide fig 12d the bottom stress endures a similar change by the mouth bar overall the mouth bar increases the bottom stress at the seaward side of the mouth bar summit and decreases the bottom stress at the landward side of the mouth bar summit for the eddy diffusivity during the neap tide fig 12e the mouth bar decreases the bottom diffusivity and increases the diffusivity in the surface and middle layers just landward of the mouth bar and increases the diffusivity in the middle reach of the estuary during the spring tide fig 12f the mouth bar decreases the diffusivity just landward of the mouth bar but increases the diffusivity further upstream the increases in diffusivity in the surface and middle layers just landward of the mouth bar may be associated with the hydraulic processes around the mouth bar which will be explored in the discussion part the changes in salt transport flux components are shown in fig 13 compared with that without the wave effects fig 8 the tidal oscillatory transport is increased in the lower convergent part this can be expected as the landward propagating wave enhances the flood current and weakens the ebb current thus enhancing the velocity asymmetry between flood and ebb and consequently increasing the tidal oscillatory this increased landward transport results in an enhancement of the salt intrusion during the neap tide fig 13a when there is no mouth bar the steady shear is dominant over the tidal oscillatory in the whole estuary except near the salt intrusion front as in case 01 the steady shear decreases in the lower convergent part from the estuary mouth in the upper straight part it firstly increases and then continues to decline further upstream on the other hand the tidal oscillatory increases in the lower convergent part from the estuary mouth and declines slightly when entering into the upper straight part under the presence of the mouth bar the steady shear is greatly decreased at the estuary mouth followed by an increase in the mouth bar region it decreases when entering the upper straight part of the estuary for the tidal oscillatory it is greatly increased at the estuary mouth and then declined at the mouth bar region at the landward limit of the mouth bar it changes into seaward but with a much smaller magnitude compared to that occurs in case 02 the total landward salt transport flux fig 13c endures a similar change to that between case 01 and 02 during the spring tide fig 13b the tidal oscillatory dominates over the steady shear under both scenarios without and with the mouth bar different from the scenario without wave effects the steady shear increases moderately and the tidal oscillatory decreases slightly at the landward limit of the mouth bar indicating the effect of the wave on enhancing the tidal oscillatory transport however in the upper straight part of the estuary the presence of the mouth bar increases the steady shear transport but decreases the tidal oscillatory moderately this is confirmed by the change in the total landward salt flux by the mouth bar fig 13d under the presence of the mouth bar the total landward salt transport is decreased slightly overall under the combined actions of river flow tides wind and waves the mouth bar increases the wave energy dissipation by increasing bottom friction and promoting wave breaking in the mouth bar region decreases the landward flow by weakening the bottom streaming and the stokes drift and decreases the mixing just landward of the mouth bar but increases the mixing further upstream these effects lead to a reduction of the steady shear and an increase in the tidal oscillatory in the lower convergent part of the estuary in the upper straight part of the estuary the presence of the mouth bar decreases the estuarine circulation wave height and mixing the mouth bar thus decreases both the steady shear and the tidal oscillatory clearly the mouth bar decreases the total landward salt transport considerably and reduces the salt intrusion to a greater extent to confirm the changes in salt transport flux we present an example of the changes in estuarine circulation and stratification induced by the mouth bar which determine the steady shear transport we chose the cross section in the middle reach of the estuary as indicated above the results are shown in fig 14 during the neap tide fig 14a and 14c the mouth bar decreases the surface seaward flow and bottom landward flow and decreases the salinity stratification from a bottom surface salinity difference of 25 psu to 18 psu these changes result in a decreased steady shear transport as shown in fig 13a during the spring tide fig 14b and 14d the mouth bar decreases the uni directionally seaward flow especially in the middle and bottom layers of the cross section this decrease in bottom seaward flow is consistent with the decrease in water level gradient by the mouth bar fig 12b in the meantime it decreases the salinity stratification from a bottom surface salinity difference of 10 psu to 5 psu however the decrease in seaward flow dominates over the decrease in stratification and results in an increase in the steady shear fig 13b the above results confirm that the mouth bar decreases the steady shear in the middle reach of the estuary during the neap tide but increases the steady shear during the spring tide for other cross sections not shown the changes in estuarine circulation and salinity stratification are all consistent with the changes in the steady shear shown in fig 0 13 overall under the combined actions of river flow tides wind and waves the presence of the mouth bar greatly suppresses the salt intrusion to a reduction of more than 20 the reduction of the salt intrusion is mostly caused by the decrease in the steady shear during the neap tide and by the decrease in the tidal oscillatory transport during the spring tide 4 discussion 4 1 the possible effects of hydraulic processes as we did not focus on the processes of hydraulic control at the mouth bar in this study we did not use a non hydrostatic model such as mitgcm and very high resolution to investigate the details of the hydraulics that occur at the mouth bar the roms model we utilized in this study is a hydrostatic one and cannot resolve the detailed hydraulic jump processes however it has been shown that the roms model can approximately grasp the macro scale effect of the non hydrostatic processes hsu et al 2013a hsu et al 2013b and can be used to study the macro scale processes in our model configuration the horizontal resolution is 40 200 m and the vertical resolution is between 0 05 and 2 m with higher resolution near the surface and bottom this resolution would not be able to reproduce the hydraulic processes at the mouth bar however the model does reveal some effects of the hydraulic control and provides some clues for future research here we present intratidal hydrodynamic processes near the mouth bar during the spring tide under the conditions without and with waves in figs 15 and 16 when there is no wind and wave at the peak ebb fig 15a the froude number f r at the top of the mouth bar is greater than 1 showing a supercritical condition the f r becomes less than 1 just seaward of the summit of the mouth bar and then changes into greater than 1 at the seaward mild slope at the turning point where the mild slope transits into a steep slope the flow experiences a transition from supercritical to subcritical and results in a lowering of the isohalines there landward of the summit of the mouth bar the f r is greater than 1 and shows a bulging of the isohaline there at the ebb slack fig 15b the ebb flow is largely blocked by the mouth bar seaward of the summit of the mouth bar a two layer flow develops the f r is generally less than 1 showing a subcritical condition at the seaward turning point from the mild slope to a steep slope the subcritical flow changes into a supercritical one and the isohalines are uplifted at the peak flood fig 15c the f r seaward of the summit of the mouth bar is greater than 1 and transits into less than 1 landward of the summit of the mouth bar indicating a hydraulic jump occurrence further upstream the flow changes from subcritical to supercritical and the isohalines are uplifted at the flood slack fig 15d from the estuary mouth to the summit of the mouth bar the flow changes from subcritical to supercritical and after the summit of the mouth bar the flow endures a transition from supercritical to subcritical indicating a hydraulic jump lee waves are observed to develop at the landward side of the mouth bar and cause the isohalines to move up and down with the wind and waves the stratification is decreased and the f r is increased suggesting a stronger hydraulic control at the mouth bar fig 16 at the peak ebb fig 16a the flow landward of the summit of the mouth bar is supercritical and changes into subcritical near the summit of the mouth bar the f r becomes greater than 1 at the seaward mild slope and experience a jump at the turning point at the ebb slack fig 16b the ebb flow is completely blocked and the f r is less than 1 for the flow around the mouth bar showing a subcritical condition at the flood peak fig 16c the flow is supercritical seaward of the summit of the mouth bar and changes into subcritical just before the summit then becomes supercritical at the summit of the mouth bar followed by a hydraulic jump landward of the mouth bar at the flood slack fig 16d the flow changes from supercritical to subcritical landward of the mouth bar and an internal lee wave is shown to propagate landward from the above results we could classify the hydraulic control at the mouth bar as partially blocked with lee jump based on baines 1995 we noticed that a lee internal wave occurs during the flooding period this lee wave propagates from just landward of the mouth bar to further upstream of the estuary this internal wave increases the vertical mixing in the surface and middle layers landward of the mouth bar fig 12e and 12f oscillates the isohaline vertically and enhances the tidal oscillatory salt transport geyer and nepf 1996 this enhanced tidal oscillatory can be observed in fig 8b and 13b in which a local peak appears at the location of 10 km from the estuary mouth under the presence of the mouth bar owing to the hydrostatic nature of the model we adopted and relatively poor grid resolution this study does not completely resolve the hydraulic control processes around the mouth bar however the macroscale effects of the hydraulic processes can be seen in the above results the details warrant further exploration by using a non hydrostatic fine resolution model 4 2 dependence of the mouth bar s effect on the river discharge in the above simulations we specified a constant river discharge of 3500 m3 s which is the mean value in the modaomen estuary during the dry season as the river discharge usually fluctuates around this mean value we set another two river discharges which are 5500 and 1500 m3 s to represent the high and low flow conditions as the salt intrusion is most severe under the combined forcings of river discharge tide wind and waves we ran the model under this scenario with high and low flow conditions see table 1 under the high flow the bottom surface salt intrusion length is 41 26 km in the neap tides and 32 17 km in the spring tides the salt intrusion pattern keeps unchanged with greater intrusion during neap tides and weaker intrusion during spring tides compare to those in case 21 the salt intrusion length is clearly shortened showing the high river flow suppresses the salt intrusion under the presence of the mouth bar the bottom surface intrusion length decreases to 32 18 km during the neap tides representing a relative reduction of 22 30 in the neap tide during the spring tide the bottom surface intrusion length decreases to 21 10 km a relative reduction of 34 41 this result indicates that under the high flow condition the mouth bar significantly decreases the salt intrusion reaching a percentage of as much as nearly 40 under the low flow the estuary changes into a state of well mixed the salt intrusion pattern is changed with the strongest intrusion occurring near the spring tide and the weakest intrusion occurring near the neap tide this shows the dominance of the tidal oscillatory in driving the landward salt transport the largest bottom surface salt intrusion length is 53 48 km in the spring tides and 42 36 km in the neap tides compare to those in case 21 the salt intrusion length is greatly increased under the presence of the mouth bar the largest bottom surface intrusion length decreases to 47 42 km during the spring tides representing a relative reduction of 11 13 in the spring tides during the neap tide the bottom surface intrusion length decreases to 38 31 km a relative reduction of 12 14 this result indicates that under the low flow condition the mouth bar has a weakened effect on decreasing the salt intrusion the above results indicate the mouth bar s effects on decreasing the salt intrusion are dependent on the river flow conditions the higher the river flow the greater effect of the mouth bar 5 implications and limitations using the idealized model configuration which mimics the modaomen estuary in the pearl river delta china this study investigates the effect of a mouth bar on the salt intrusion in the estuary the results indicate that the mouth bar decreases the salt intrusion under the typical conditions of river discharge and tides by 15 to 23 when wind and waves were taken into consideration the mouth bar can greatly dissipate the tidal and wave energy and impede the salt intrusion with the largest reduction of 25 the reduction percentage can reach as high as 40 when the river discharge is high these results show that the effect of the mouth bar on weakening the salt intrusion is substantial along with the coastal protection by the mouth bar in enhancing wave energy dissipation and wave height reduction inside the estuary the existence of the mouth bar is thus of fundamental importance cautions should be taken when planning to remove the mouth bar for resource management this study considers idealized geometry and typical hydrological conditions in real estuaries like the modaomen estuary the bathymetry is more complex including several sand bars alternating and meandering channels reversed bed slopes in several sections of the estuary and multiple freshwater sources and sinks along the estuary in the meantime the river discharge tides winds and waves are changing all the time and have different timescales of variabilities payo payo et al 2022 these complexities make the real situation much more complicated than this study though we did not aim to reproduce all the variabilities as mentioned above to fully understand the hydraulic control of the mouth bar a non hydrostatic model and more refined resolution are needed this study can be considered a preliminary step to the full understanding of the mouth bar s effects in real situations the river mouth itself undergoes continuous evolution under the actions of all the external forcings the geometry and bathymetry of the mouth bar are thus not fixed as assumed in this study the feedback between the mouth bar and the external forcings is another topic but beyond this study s scope 6 summary and conclusions in this study we focused on the effect of the mouth bar on salt transport and salt intrusion in an idealized estuary which has a prototype of the modaomen estuary pearl river delta china we used the coawst modeling system to conduct simulations by configuring an idealized estuary with and without a mouth bar the estuary has a lower highly convergent part and an upper straight part the mouth bar is situated at the lower part and is switched on and off in different model simulations we considered different hydrodynamic conditions the first scenario only considered the river flow and tides in which the river flow was specified to be the mean river discharge in the modaomen estuary in the winter dry season and the tides are composed of two tidal constituents m 2 and s 2 to represent the spring neap tidal variations in the second scenario we further included a down estuary wind to examine the effect of wind on salt intrusion in the last scenario we took the wave effects into consideration by specifying an offshore swell wave that propagates landward and simultaneously activating the process of wind wave generation in the model we compared the salt intrusions and salt transport fluxes between those without and with the presence of the mouth bar under different hydrodynamic conditions we noted that under the river flow and tides only the mouth bar decreases the bottom surface salt intrusion considerably with a reduction of 14 20 and 23 0 in the neap and spring tides respectively the existence of the mouth bar bifurcates the estuary mouth into two side channels and increases the tidal variations of longitudinal current and salinity in the lower convergent part of the estuary thus increasing the tidal oscillatory transport and decreasing the steady shear transport landward of the mouth bar the tidal amplitude is decreased by the mouth bar due to stronger friction and more energy dissipation this reduced tidal strength favors the development of salinity stratification and estuarine circulation thus resulting in an enhanced steady shear in the middle reach of the estuary further upstream into the upper reach where river flow dominates the tidal oscillatory becomes predominant and the reduction of the tidal amplitude by the mouth bar leads to a decrease in tidal oscillatory there in the neap tide the reduction of tidal strength at the landward side of the mouth bar increases the steady shear partly offsetting the decrease in salt influx at the estuary mouth and generates a relatively weaker effect 15 on reducing the salt intrusion by the mouth bar in the spring tide the reduction of the tidal strength by the mouth bar decreases the tidal oscillatory augmenting the decrease in salt influx at the estuary mouth and results in a stronger effect 23 on reducing the salt intrusion under the moderate downestuary wind the salt intrusion length in the estuary is increased and the mouth bar has a similar effect on reducing the salt intrusion compared to that without the wind when the wave effects were included in the model the mouth bar exerts a great role in reducing salt intrusion the existence of the mouth bar can drive a reduction of salt intrusion by 20 the mouth bar enhances the wave energy dissipation in the mouth bar region and reduces the wave height along the estuary it decreases the estuarine circulation and increases the mixing in the surface and middle layers just landward of the mouth bar but decreases the mixing further upstream again the mouth bar decreases the steady shear but increases the tidal oscillatory near the estuary mouth but increases the steady shear and decreases the tidal oscillatory landward of the mouth bar further upstream the mouth bar decreases both the steady shear and tidal oscillatory we also examined the dependence of the mouth bar s effects on the river flow it shows that the mouth bar has a greater effect under the higher flow condition on decreasing the salt intrusion though with limited capability to resolve the hydraulic processes around the mouth bar the model does show some phenomenon of lee wave generation and propagation which increases the vertical oscillation of the pycnocline and tidal oscillatory transport this study is of relevance for

2983,the mouth bar is a common morphological unit in the river delta system its formation and evolution impose an impact on the material exchange between the estuary and ocean here we used an advanced wave current coupled modeling system in an idealized estuary with a prototype of the modaomen estuary china to study the effects of the mouth bar on salt intrusion and the associated salt transport the model results indicate that the mouth bar has a substantial effect on weakening the salt intrusion under the action of river discharge and tides leading to a decrease in the salt intrusion length of 15 23 when a down estuary wind and a landward propagating offshore wave were included in the model the mouth bar can decrease the salt intrusion length up to 21 the hydraulic control at the mouth bar in a state of partially blocked with lee jump can enhance landward salt transport through tidal pumping these findings indicate that the mouth bar has an important control on the salt transport and provides implications for salt intrusion mitigation and sand resource management keywords mouth bar salt intrusion coawst modeling system waves data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the mouth bar is an important morphological unit in a river delta system it forms when a sediment laden flow drains into a basin in which the flow s velocity and momentum are relatively low and the frictional effect in the receiving basin is strong wright 1977 falcini and jerolmack 2010 falcini et al 2014 fagherazzi et al 2015 many dynamical factors work together to affect the formation and evolution of the mouth bar including river flow tides and waves nardin and fagherazzi 2012 leonardi et al 2013 anthony 2015 fagherazzi et al 2015 leuven et al 2016 gao et al 2018 the conceptual model of the formation and evolution of the mouth bar proposed by edmonds and slingerland 2007 identified the stages of its development initial sediment deposition progradation and aggradation of the bar until progradation ceases then channel formation and bifurcation the development of the mouth bar affects the navigability of channels the water and material exchange between the estuary and ocean and the ecological safety of the estuarine system salt transport is an important component in the material exchanges between the estuary and ocean saline water from the ocean side intrudes into the estuary through several physical processes such as estuarine circulation and tidal pumping maccready and geyer 2010 salt intrusion determines the length of the estuary the strength of the estuarine circulation and the capacity of material transport in the estuary it has been observed to aggravate in many estuaries around the world due to climate change and human interventions e g delaware estuary chant et al 2018 hudson river estuary ralston and geyer 2019 and pearl river estuary hong et al 2020 the salt intrusion is affected by many factors including external forcings river discharge tides winds and waves and internal bathymetry many studies have addressed the controls of estuarine bathymetry on the salt intrusion like how the existence of shoals and channel affects the salt dynamics in the delaware bay usa aristizábal and chant 2013 and how the convergence of the estuary s width and depth affect salt intrusion kuijper and van rijn 2011 however little research has focused on the impacts of the mouth bar on salt intrusion in estuaries the mouth bar at the entrance of an estuary may work as a sill in a fjord system which exerts hydraulic control on the exchange flow between the estuary and ocean farmer and armi 1986 however the mouth bar is generally shallow even emergent to the water surface like the mouth bar in misa river estuary italy baldoni et al 2021 the ratio of the maximum height h m of the mouth bar to the unperturbed lower layer thickness of the ambient flow h 2 h a h m h 2 is generally close to or larger than unity as a result the flow across the sill is partially blocked and may bifurcate into the side distributary channels baines 1995 in this way the flow over the mouth bar may or may not experience a hydraulic jump for example there occurred no hydraulic jump at the mattituck sill in the long island sound usa whitney et al 2014 nevertheless the mouth bar imposes a resistance on the flow as it induces strong bottom stress due to its shallowness and generates enhanced mixing and energy dissipation when compared to that without a mouth bar moreover the mouth bar imposes a depth limit for the surface wave height when the wave propagates landward from offshore and induces more wave breaking and wave energy loss therefore the existence of the mouth bar would change the current wave height and water mixing and affect the salt transport between the estuary and ocean however to our knowledge this effect remains rarely explored here we took the modaomen estuary china as a prototype to study the effects of a mouth bar on the salt intrusion in a partially mixed estuary there exists a large mouth bar at the modaomen estuary s entrance which has been undergoing continuous evolution he et al 2018 tan et al 2019 the salt intrusion in the estuary has become more serious in recent decades which impaired the freshwater withdrawal by the water treatment plants along the estuary and threatened the freshwater supply to the people around the estuary the salt intrusion dynamics have been extensively studied in the past e g gong and shen 2011 payo payo et al 2022 among which the effects of the mouth bar have not received attention though the prototype site of this study is the modaomen estuary we still chose to conduct our study in a broader context in that we designed idealized bathymetry and geometry to represent a typical estuary with a mouth bar here we utilize the widely used community modeling system coawst coupled ocean atmospheric wave sediment transport in an idealized estuary which mimics the modaomen estuary to investigate the effects of the mouth bar on the salt intrusion in a partially mixed estuary we adopted this strategy based on two considerations 1 an idealized estuary simplifies the real situation and makes us more focused on the essential physics in fact the modaomen estuary has a very complex geometry and bathymetry it is connected to many other river branches along its course and has a meandering channel that experiences several bifurcations these characteristics make the study based on the real estuary unnecessarily complicated 2 an idealized estuary is more representative than a specific one and thus is more inclusive for example the geometry of this idealized estuary can represent other estuaries with different combinations of convergent and straight segments like the delaware river estuary hudson river estuary thames river estuary conwy estuary etc as such this study is of broader relevance to the mouth bar s effects on salt intrusion rather than a case study the aims of this study are to 1 investigate the changes in salt intrusion by the presence of the mouth bar under different hydrological conditions such as under the forcings of river flow tides wind and waves 2 examine the changes in the state of the estuary by the presence of the mouth bar such as the salinity stratification estuarine circulation and the salt transport flux 3 reveal the physics of such changes induced by the mouth bar it should be noted that we did not aim to explore the whole parameter space for the effect of the mouth bar such as the geometry and extent of the mouth bar different combinations of river discharge tides winds and waves we chose typical hydrodynamic conditions representing the situations in the modaomen estuary and examined the salt intrusion with and without the presence of the mouth bar in the following we first present the numerical setup and data analysis methods section 2 results section 3 include analyses of the numerical outputs such as the changes in salt intrusion and salt transport flux under different hydrological scenarios section 4 is a discussion about the effect of the hydraulic processes around the mouth bar and the implications and limitations of this study we draw conclusions in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 a brief introduction to the modaomen estuary the modaomen estuary with a simplified version was chosen as a prototype site for this study the modaomen estuary is located in the pearl river delta china and is characterized as a microtidal regime with alternating spring and neap tides the tidal range is approximately 1 m during neap tides and 2 5 m during spring tides it is the main conduit for the river flow from the pearl river to debouch into the coastal ocean gong and shen 2011 the river discharge into the estuary has a distinct seasonal variation with a mean flow of 11000 m3 s during wet seasons may to september and approximately 3500 m3 s during dry seasons november to february as salt intrusion is more of a concern in the dry season we chose the corresponding hydrological situations for our investigation during the dry season the downestuary wind northerly prevails with a wind speed of 6 m s whereas the waves are mostly swells from offshore with a mean wave height of approximately 1 2 m jia et al 2014 for more details about the estuary the readers can refer to gong and shen 2011 and payo payo et al 2022 the mouth bar at the modaomen estuary is an important morphological feature and has experienced evolution processes of seaward progradation and aggradation he et al 2018 tan et al 2019 some proposals had been put forward to remove this mouth bar as it impedes navigation and enhances the flood risk during flood seasons moreover as the mouth bar is mostly composed of well sorted sand the extraction of this mineral resource is increasingly demanded by the flourishing construction market the removal of the mouth bar raised the concerns of salt intrusion aggravation in the estuary and a more severe threat to the freshwater supply 2 2 model configuration the coawst modeling system was used in this idealized modeling study warner et al 2010 this system consists of a model coupling toolkit to exchange data fields between an ocean model regional ocean modeling system roms an atmosphere model advanced research weather research and forecasting model wrf a wave model simulating waves nearshore model swan and a sediment model community sediment transport model cstm the atmospheric and sediment models were not activated here roms is a free surface hydrostatic primitive equation ocean model that uses stretched terrain following vertical coordinates and orthogonal curvilinear horizontal coordinates on an arakawa c grid haidvogel et al 2000 the model domain was designed as an estuary shelf system fig 1 in the coordinate system x represents the cross estuary direction and is positive toward the right y represents the along channel direction and is positive toward the land area and z is directed upward the origin of the system is in the middle of the estuary mouth the estuary is comprised of two parts in the lower part the estuary features a convergent geometry from the estuary mouth to 10 km upstream with a width convergent length scale of 10 km the width at the estuary mouth is also set to be 10 km upstream of this lower part the estuary is almost straight and 140 km long with a width convergent length scale of 500 km the water depth was specified to decrease linearly from the estuary mouth to the head in the lateral direction each cross section has a channel and two side shoals with the lateral profile of water depth as a gaussian distribution the maximum water depth in the estuary is 15 m and a minimum water depth of 2 m is used the bathymetry in the estuary was specified as 1 h x y h min h max h min y l 0 1 x b h max h min 1 y l e c f 4 x 2 b 2 where h max 15 m and h min 2 0 m are the maximum and minimum water depths at the estuary mouth respectively and c f is the tidal flat parameter and set as 4 as used by wei et al 2016 the above configuration was used to approximately mimic the geometry and bathymetry of the modaomen estuary though many details were not represented in this idealized bathymetry e g multiple meandering and alternating channels and several sand bars inside the estuary were not included in the model configuration to investigate the effect of the mouth bar we designed another model bathymetry to represent the mouth bar in the lower part of the estuary the mouth bar is approximately ellipse shaped in the horizontal and has a top in the middle of the ellipse with a water depth of 2 m the water depth increases from the top to the periphery of the ellipse with an exponential form that resembles a gaussian distribution the bathymetries with and without the mouth bar are shown in fig 1 to overcome the difficulty of specifying boundary conditions at the estuary mouth we added a continental shelf in the model domain fig 1 the shelf is 50 km wide and 200 km long the water depth of the shelf is uniform in the alongshore direction except near the estuary mouth and increases linearly from the coast to offshore with a slope of 1 10 4 the model grid has 444 441 cells with a cross channel spatial resolution of 40 m and an along channel resolution of 200 m inside the estuary the horizontal resolution decreases on the shelf and becomes 2 km at the offshore upstream and downstream ocean boundaries 21 vertical s grid layers were specified with higher resolutions near the surface and bottom and the coefficients of θs θb and hc for the s coordinate were set to 2 5 3 0 and 5 0 respectively we calculated the vertical mixing using the k ε submodel of the generic length scale turbulence closure scheme umlauf and burchard 2003 warner et al 2005 in our model simulations we configured model scenarios without and with waves in scenarios with wave effects the wave dissipation due to wave breaking and surface streaming is included in the surface boundary conditions for turbulent kinetic energy the wave dissipation is calculated via the method established by thornton and guza 1983 to consider the wave dissipation induced mixing in the water column the horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity are calculated using the smagorinsky scheme smagorinsky 1963 in model scenarios disregarding wave effects the bottom friction is calculated according to the log layer assumption near the bottom with a bottom roughness length of 1 mm this setting results in a mean bottom drag coefficient of 0 005 with waves the wave current bottom boundary layer dynamics were activated via the method developed by madsen 1994 in the roms model the open ocean boundary condition for the barotropic component consists of a chapman flather boundary condition for the sea surface elevation and depth averaged flow chapman 1985 flather 1976 the open boundary conditions for the temperature salinity and baroclinic current are the orlanski type radiation condition orlanski 1976 the swan model was run and coupled to the same grid as the roms model the wave model is driven by the specified wave at the offshore boundary and modulated by water level and current fields from the roms model the roms and swan models exchange information at an interval of 30 min to introduce the wave current interactions wcis the exchanged information comprises the significant wave height surface peak wave period mean wave direction and length wave energy dissipation percentage of breaking waves from swan to roms and water level and current from roms to swan the wave vortex force is activated to calculate the wave induced momentum flux using the method proposed by mcwilliams et al 2004 which was later implemented in coawst by kumar et al 2012 to examine the effects of the mouth bar on salt dynamics we ran several numerical experiments the settings for different cases are listed in table 1 case 01 was specified with a river discharge of 3 500 m3 s at the estuary head this river discharge is the mean value of the modaomen estuary in the dry season gong and shen 2011 two tidal constituents of m 2 and s 2 were specified at the offshore open boundary with the tidal periods being 12 42 and 12 h respectively the amplitudes of these two constituents were set to 0 75 and 0 25 m the specification of m 2 and s 2 tides were to examine the spring neap variations at the estuary head the inflowing river water was set to zero salinity and a temperature of 22 c identical to the background temperature setting throughout the entire domain the incoming salinity at the offshore boundary was set to 34 psu in case 01 we ran with the bathymetry without the mouth bar whereas for case 02 the mouth bar was included in the model bathymetry in case 11 we specified a constant downestuary northerly wind of 6 m s apart from the river flow and tides for the bathymetry without the mouth bar the 6 m s northerly wind is a typical wind condition in the modaomen estuary in the dry season for case 12 the same forcings were set as in case 11 but we included the mouth bar in the model bathymetry in case 21 in addition to the external forcings in case 11 we added wave effects in the model by specifying a constant swell wave at the offshore boundary south wave with h s of 2 5 m t p of 6 5 s and turning on the wind induced wave by the downestuary wind this condition is representative of the situation outside the modaomen estuary in the dry season this scenario represents a highly favorable condition for salt intrusion which occurs frequently in the estuary under the external forcing conditions described above we ran the model without case 21 and with case 22 the mouth bar respectively to further examine the dependence of the mouth bar s effects on the variations of river discharge we ran other model cases with higher river discharge 5500 m3 s and lower discharge 1500 m3 s with the same tidal forcing wind and waves as in case 21 in all the cases the initial conditions were set by specifying the water elevation and current as zero and a constant temperature of 22 c we set an initial salinity condition of uniform 34 psu in the continental shelf and linearly decreasing from the estuary mouth of 34 psu to zero with a distance of 140 km in the lateral and vertical directions the initial salinity was set as uniform all the model simulations were run for 60 days owing to the relatively high river discharge the salt dynamics inside the estuary adjust quickly and nearly reach a quasi equilibrium situation within 10 days in the following we used the results on day 36 and day 43 to represent the situations during neap and spring tides respectively 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 decomposition of salt transport flux for a cross section to examine the salt transport we decomposed the current salinity and salt transport flux into different components as proposed by lerczak et al 2006 2 a 0 0 w 1 0 h η d σ d y 3 f s v s d a 0 w 1 0 h η v s d σ d y 4 v 0 1 a 0 v y σ t d a 1 a 0 0 w 1 0 h η v d σ d y 5 v e y σ h η h v v 0 6 v t y σ t v v e y σ v 0 where the overbar denotes tidally averaged and v is the longitudinal current the salinity is decomposed in a similar way the above averaging is physically a thickness weighted averaging as explained in klingbeil et al 2017 the tidally averaged salt transport is then expressed as f s 0 w 1 0 h η v s d σ d y 0 w 1 0 h η v 0 v e v t s 0 s e s t d σ d y 0 w 1 0 h η v 0 s 0 v e s e v t s t d σ d y 7 q 0 s 0 advective f e steady s h e a r f t tidal o s c i l l a t o r y where the advective denotes the salt transport by the river discharge and the tidally averaged stokes flow the steady shear depicts that by the estuarine circulation and salinity stratification and the tidal oscillatory represents the correlation between the tidally varying current and salinity 2 3 2 calculation of the composite froude number the composite froude number f r is a commonly used nondimensional number to describe the status of the flow i e supercritical or subcritical valle levinson et al 2001 here we adopted a method to distinguish a single layer and two layer state of the water column and calculate the corresponding f r we set that when the stratification number s p is less than 0 01 where s p is defined as the ratio of the bottom surface salinity difference to the vertically averaged salinity the water column is classified as a single layer otherwise it is defined as a two layer state for the single layer state the f r was estimated as 8 f r u 2 g h 9 g g ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 where u is the depth averaged current g is the gravity acceleration g is the reduced gravity acceleration h is the total water depth ρ 0 is the background density and ρ is the water density here ρ ρ 0 1 β s in which β is the saline contraction coefficient and s is the salinity for the two layer state we first defined the vertical layer with the largest vertical salinity gradient as the pycnocline and calculated the averaged current and salinity above and below the pycnocline the upper layer and lower layer respectively the f r was then obtained as 10 f r u 1 2 g h 1 u 2 2 g h 2 11 g g ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 0 in which u 1 u 2 are the velocity of the upper and lower layers respectively and h 1 h 2 are the thickness for the upper and lower layers whereas ρ 1 ρ 2 are the densities of the upper and lower layers respectively 3 results 3 1 salt intrusion change under the forcings of river flow and tides we first present the variation of tidal amplitude at the estuary mouth without a mouth bar fig 2 a the tidal amplitude fluctuates with a period of approximately15 days between spring and neap tides with amplitudes of 1 7 and 0 86 m respectively the period shown here is caused by the beating of m 2 and s 2 tides i e the spring neap cycle 14 8 days along with the variation of tidal amplitude the salt intrusion length shows a consistent fluctuation fig 2b here we distinguish the bottom and surface salt intrusion the bottom surface salt intrusion length is defined as the distance of the 1 psu isohaline at the bottom surface along the deep channel from the estuary mouth the strongest bottom intrusion 41 km occurs during neap tides and the strongest surface intrusion 31 km occurs two days later after neap tides the weakest bottom intrusion 28 km happens during spring tides whereas the weakest surface intrusion 20 km lags spring tides by 2 days this pattern of salinity variation with spring and neap tides clearly shows that the estuary is in a partially stratified state maccready and geyer 2010 and the range of the bottom intrusion length is consistent with the results in gong and shen 2011 which has been verified by observation data the existence of the mouth bar restrains the salt intrusion in the whole simulation period it decreases the bottom and surface salt intrusions by 15 and 20 in the neap tides respectively with a bottom surface intrusion length of 34 5 24 5 km and the bottom and surface salt intrusions by 23 and 35 in the spring tides with an intrusion length of 23 km and 20 km respectively it is noted that the mouth bar has a great effect on reducing salt intrusion especially during the spring tides that is the mouth bar has a greater effect on reducing the salt intrusion when the tidal forcing is stronger we examined the changes in tidal amplitude along the estuary during the neap and spring tides in the neap tide the mouth bar decreases the tidal amplitude in the whole estuary fig 3 a with a magnitude ranging from 0 01 to 0 12 m representing a reduction percentage ranging from 2 to 12 the greatest decrease occurs at a distance of 30 km from the estuary mouth during the spring tide fig 3b the mouth bar decreases the tidal amplitude along the estuary with a magnitude ranging from 0 01 to 0 3 m a relative reduction from 3 to 18 in the spring tide the greatest change occurs at the mouth bar area overall the existence of the mouth bar decreases the tidal strength more significantly in the spring tide than in the neap tide this seems contrary to its effect on reducing the salt intrusion as presented above because a greater decrease in tidal amplitude means a larger decrease in tidal mixing and thus the mouth bar should be less effective in reducing salt intrusion during the spring tide it has been well known that for a partially mixed estuary a weaker tidal mixing corresponds to a stronger salt intrusion and vice versa bowen and geyer 2003 we will further explore the mechanisms behind such a phenomenon the distributions of salinity and residual flow along the longitudinal transect of the middle channel further demonstrate the variations of salt intrusion between neap and spring tides and the changes induced by the mouth bar fig 4 without the mouth bar the bottom surface salt intrusion length is about 41 23 km during the neap tide fig 4a the bottom salt intrusion decreases to 28 km whereas the surface salt intrusion slightly decreases to 22 5 km in the spring tide fig 4b under the presence of the mouth bar during the neap tide fig 4c the salinity structure on top of the mouth bar shows a strongly mixed situation and landward of the mouth bar the water becomes much freshened when compared with that without the mouth bar the bottom surface salt intrusion recedes to 33 15 km it is seen that during the neap tide the region landward of the mouth bar features an overturning circulation and the lower salinity water at the upper layers is mixed downward at the inner slope of the mouth bar in the meantime there develops upslope current at the lower part of the inner slope which upwells higher salinity water from the bottom to upper layers seaward the mouth bar a similar phenomenon is observed during the spring tide fig 4d with the mouth bar the bottom surface salt intrusion decreases to 23 17 km the water on top of the mouth bar shows a well mixed condition the region landward of the mouth bar exhibits a uni directionally seaward flow with stronger upwelling occurring at the inner slope of the mouth bar we then examined the lateral distributions of the longitudinal residual flow and salinity and the lateral circulation at three chosen cross sections one at the estuary mouth another one just landward of the mouth bar a distance of 8 km from the estuary mouth and a further upstream one in the middle reach of the estuary a distance of 15 km from the estuary mouth for the cross section at the estuary mouth during the neap tide fig 5 a a typical two layer estuarine circulation is developed with a surface seaward flow and a bottom landward flow the lateral circulation shows a pattern with weak downwelling in the middle of the channel and upwelling along the side slopes this pattern is analogous to a typical lateral circulation in a straight estuary hetland and geyer 2004 this lateral circulation acts to redistribute salinity and homogenize the salinity distribution at the cross section resulting in a more mixed situation the salinity stratification is well developed with a bottom surface salinity difference larger than 25psu with the mouth bar the cross section is divided into a middle bar and two side channels fig 5c the structure of the longitudinal estuarine circulation shows that the seaward flow occupies most of the cross section especially in the side channels the surface water overlying the mouth bar shows a weak landward flow this landward flow may be induced by the tidal stokes drift li and o donnel 1997 two strong rotating cells are formed in the side channels a clockwise one at the right channel and an anticlockwise one at the left channel this lateral circulation directs the relatively lower salinity water on the top of the mouth bar to the side channels and thus stratifies the water column there though with the enhancement of stratification by the lateral circulation the salinity distribution in the cross section shows that the vertical stratification is greatly reduced with a bottom surface salinity difference of less than 22 5 psu this suggests that the weakening of the longitudinal straining by the mouth bar which lessens the stratification may dominate over the lateral straining which strengthens the stratification during the spring tide fig 5b similar longitudinal estuarine circulation is formed in the cross section with the bottom landward flow and surface seaward flow being both weakened the lateral circulation shows a dominant upwelling over most of the cross section which mixes the water in the cross section the stratification is weak with a bottom surface salinity difference of 15 psu under the presence of the mouth bar fig 5d the residual flow on the top of the mouth bar is weakly seaward and a uni directionally seaward flow is well developed at the side channels there also form two rotational cells in the two side channels the salinity stratification is much lower than that during the neap tide with a bottom surface salinity difference of only 5 psu overall the mouth bar decreases the estuarine circulation and salinity stratification at the cross section of the estuary mouth for the cross section at the landward side of the mouth bar without the mouth bar in the neap tide fig 6 a the estuarine circulation is mildly developed with a weak landward flow in the bottom the vertical stratification is strong with a bottom surface salinity difference of 27 psu under the presence of the mouth bar fig 6c the estuarine circulation is more developed with both the surface seaward flow and bottom landward flow being enhanced in the meantime the lateral circulation becomes stronger the salinity stratification keeps strong with a bottom surface salinity difference of 24 psu in the spring tide without the mouth bar fig 6b the cross section is dominated by seaward flow except for some weak landward flows at the side shoals the salinity stratification is weak with a bottom surface salinity difference of 12 5 psu under the presence of the mouth bar fig 6d the two layer estuarine circulation is well developed with the bottom landward flow reaching 0 3 m s simultaneously the lateral flow is strengthened and the salinity stratification is increased with a bottom surface salinity difference of 17 5 psu the mouth bar increases the estuarine circulation and stratification at the landward side of the mouth bar these changes are consistent with the change in tidal amplitude as the mouth bar decreases the tidal strength at this location fig 3 for the cross section in the middle reach of the estuary fig 7 during the neap tide the mouth bar increases the surface seaward flow but decreases the bottom landward flow changes the downwelling to upwelling in the middle of the channel and decreases the salinity stratification from a bottom surface salinity difference of 25 psu to 21 5 psu fig 7c vs 7a in the spring tide the mouth bar decreases the seaward flow at the surface and reduces the salinity stratification from a bottom surface salinity difference of 13 psu to 3 psu this decrease in stratification is dramatic and is due to the weakened salt intrusion overall the river mouth decreases the estuarine circulation and salinity stratification at the cross section in the middle reach of the estuary from the above results we can conclude that the mouth bar decreases the estuarine circulation and stratification at the estuary mouth increase them at the landward side of the mouth bar and decrease them again further upstream these changes are caused by the changes in tidal mixing and salt intrusion and will impact salt transport as shown below 3 2 salt transport flux changes under the forcings of river flow and tides we investigated the salt transport flux to illustrate the mechanisms for the changes in salt intrusion induced by the presence of the mouth bar the results are shown in fig 8 during the neap tide fig 8a the net flux is landward under both scenarios without and with the mouth bar showing a salt importation under the weak tidal mixing condition without the mouth bar the steady shear dominates over the tidal oscillatory in the estuary in the lower convergent part of the estuary the steady shear decreases continuously whereas the tidal oscillatory increases consistently once into the straight upper part the steady shear increases slightly and reaches a maximum at 15 km from the estuary mouth after that it decreases all the way the tidal oscillatory decreases quickly when entering into the upper straight part and attains a local minimum at 15 km from the estuary mouth it changes slightly further upstream at the salt intrusion front the tidal oscillatory becomes dominant over the steady shear under the presence of the mouth bar the tidal oscillatory increases dramatically at the estuary mouth accompanied by a great decrease in the steady shear there the steady shear decreases firstly and then increases considerably at the mouth bar region whereas the tidal oscillatory decreases sharply and even becomes seaward in the region between 5 and 10 km from the estuary mouth this transit of the tidal oscillatory from landward to seaward is remarkable which will be investigated later we note that the maximum steady shear and the minimum tidal oscillatory occur just at the landward limit of the mouth bar where a significant decrease in tidal amplitude occurs fig 3 this increase in the steady shear is consistent with the increases in estuarine circulation and stratification at the landward side of the mouth bar which has been described above after the mouth bar the steady shear decreases exponentially whereas the tidal oscillatory changes from seaward into landward and increases to a local maximum at 20 km from the estuary mouth at the salt intrusion front the tidal oscillatory dominates over the steady shear the advective flux is seaward for both the cases without and with the mouth bar with the mouth bar the seaward advective flux is reduced in magnitude mostly due to the decreased salinity as the salt intrusion is mostly induced by the landward salt transport which is the summation of the steady shear and the tidal oscillatory we present the changes in the total landward salt flux induced by the mouth bar in fig 8c it is seen that during the neap tide the mouth bar decreases the landward salt flux along the estuary until the salt intrusion limit during the spring tide fig 8b different situations occur for the spatial variations of the different components the net flux is mostly seaward except at the estuary mouth showing an overall export of salt during the strong tidal mixing without the mouth bar the tidal oscillatory is larger than the steady shear in the whole estuary except near the estuary mouth less than 5 km from the estuary mouth this contrast is conspicuous in the upper straight part of the estuary under the presence of the mouth bar the tidal oscillatory increases greatly at the estuary mouth and then drops sharply in the mouth bar region 5 10 k m but keeps a landward direction on the contrary the steady shear decreases to nearly zero at the estuary mouth and then increases greatly and reaches a maximum at the landward limit of the mouth bar when entering into the upper straight part the steady shear is taken over by the tidal oscillatory the seaward advective flux is also found to decrease in magnitude under the presence of the mouth bar the changes in the total landward salt flux in the spring tide fig 8d also show that the mouth bar decreases the landward salt flux along the estuary from the above analysis we stress that during the neap tide the steady shear is the dominant landward salt transport component whereas during the spring tide the tidal oscillatory becomes the leading order component during both the spring and neap tides the mouth bar reduces the landward salt transport at the estuary mouth by decreasing the steady shear considerably though the tidal oscillatory is increased at the estuary mouth this increase cannot offset the decrease in the steady shear this decrease in landward salt flux at the estuary mouth determines the salt content variation inside the estuary during the neap tide the decrease in tidal amplitude and mixing by the mouth bar generates a weakened mixing inside the estuary and enhances the estuarine circulation and stratification to some extent thus offsetting the decrease in landward salt flux at the estuary mouth however during the spring tide along with the decrease in landward salt flux at the estuary mouth the decrease in tidal amplitude and mixing by the mouth bar reduces the tidal oscillatory inside the estuary thus augmenting the decrease in landward salt transport this can be seen in fig 8c and 8d in which during the neap tide the total landward salt flux decreases slowly in the estuary whereas it decreases more quickly in the estuary during the spring tide we assume that this difference in the changing pattern of the landward salt flux can explain why the mouth bar reduces the salt intrusion more in the spring tide than in the neap tide as we have presented the changes in estuarine circulation and salinity stratification at the three cross sections above which determine the changes in the steady shear in the chosen cross sections here we show the changes in the correlations between the tidal variations of current and salinity at these cross sections we examined the changes in amplitudes of current salinity and the phase difference between these two variables in the three chosen cross sections as the change patterns are similar for the neap and spring tides we selected the situation in the neap tide as an example we conducted a harmonic analysis for the 25 hour data for the salinity and longitudinal current and obtain the phase shift relative to a reference time i e the high tide time as it is the phase difference between the current and salinity that is of interest an arbitrary choice of a reference time does not affect our analysis the results are shown in fig 9 for the cross section at the estuary mouth the fluctuation magnitudes of the longitudinal current fig 9a show that the mouth bar increases the magnitude of the tidal current particularly in the side channels this is expected as the presence of the mouth bar decreases the cross section s area and makes the tidal flow more concentrated resulting in a stronger tidal current for the fluctuation of the tidal salinity fig 9d it shows that the mouth bar increases the magnitude of the salinity variation in a tidal cycle this is consistent with the increase in the tidal current as the horizontal salinity gradient does not show an obvious change and the advection of the salinity gradient by a stronger tidal current would induce a greater salinity change for the phase relationship between the current and salinity fig 9g it is less than quadrature in the upper and middle parts of the section and larger than quadrature at the side shoals when there is no mouth bar under the presence of the mouth bar the phase difference is mostly less than quadrature showing that the variations of current and salinity are more in phase with the increases in fluctuating magnitudes of tidal current salinity and decreased phase difference between them the tidal oscillatory is greatly enhanced fig 9j for the cross section at the landward limit of the mouth bar the tidal current experiences a slight increase in the upper part of the cross section due to the decrease of the cross sectional area but endures a decrease at the bottom due to the blocking by the mouth bar fig 9b it shows that the magnitude of the tidal salinity variation is decreased in the upper part of the cross section but is increased in the middle and lower parts of the cross section fig 9e for the phase relationship between the current and salinity fig 9h it is less than quadrature when there is no mouth bar but changes into a pattern with an in phase relationship at the surface of the channel and an out of phase relationship in the middle and lower parts of the cross section this change is very distinct indicating that higher salinity occurs at the ebb and lower salinity occurs at the flood we deduced that at ebb tide the high salinity water in the middle and lower parts of the cross section is blocked by the mouth bar and is retained there at flood tide the surface water with relatively lower salinity is dumped into the middle and bottom layers freshening the water there in this way the current and salinity in the middle and lower parts of the cross section exhibit an out of phase relationship the change in the phase relationship results in a negative tidal oscillatory at the cross section which has been shown in fig 8a for the cross section at the middle reach of the estuary the tidal current is slightly increased in the upper part but decreased near the bottom of the cross section fig 9c the magnitude of the salinity fluctuation is decreased in the upper part but increased near the bottom fig 9f the phase relationship between the current and salinity is less than quadrature in the channel but larger than quadrature at the side shoals when there is no mouth bar it becomes more in phase under the presence of the mouth bar fig 9i as a result the tidal oscillatory is decreased in most of the cross section under the presence of the mouth bar fig 9i which is mostly due to the decrease in the magnitude of salinity tidal variation from the above analysis we can see that the existence of the mouth bar decreases the tidal strength inside the estuary and increases the stratification and estuarine circulation and therefore the steady shear component at the landward side of the mouth bar further upstream with the decrease of salt intrusion the estuarine circulation and salinity stratification are both decreased resulting in a decrease in the steady shear however it increases the tidal fluctuations of current and salinity at the estuary mouth and increases the tidal oscillatory transport there it decreases or even reverses the tidal oscillatory at the landward limit of the mouth bar further upstream the mouth bar decreases the tidal variations of current and salinity and the tidal oscillatory these changes work together to cause a smaller reduction in salt intrusion during the neap tide but an aggravated reduction during the spring tide 3 3 salt intrusion and salt transport changes under the combined actions of river flow tides and wind as the wind force can change the estuarine circulation and salinity stratification in estuaries scully et al 2005 it thus can alter the salt intrusion a moderate downestuary wind can enhance the estuarine circulation and stratification by the wind straining which overwhelms the wind mixing thus promoting the salt intrusion chen and sanford 2009 we specified a moderate downestuary wind northerly wind of 6 m s here to examine the effect of the mouth bar under the combined actions of river discharge tides and wind the results are shown in fig 10 a when the downestuary wind was applied in the model the salt intrusion length is increased when there is no mouth bar compared with the case without wind this is consistent with the previous studies scully et al 2005 chen and sanford 2009 the maximum bottom surface salt intrusion in the neap tides becomes 43 34 km larger than the value in case 01 41 31 km the minimum bottom surface salt intrusion during the spring tide becomes 30 21 km rather than 28 20 km in case 01 under the presence of the mouth bar the bottom surface salt intrusion during the neap tide is 37 28 km a relative decrease of 14 21 during the spring tide the bottom surface salt intrusion is 25 16 km a relative decrease of 17 24 compared to that without the mouth bar this shows that with the downestuary wind the effect of the mouth bar on reducing the salt intrusion is still considerable but a little less than that without wind we examined the changes in the salt transport flux by the mouth bar and noted that the change patterns are very similar to those in case 01 and case 02 not shown we thus deduced that the relatively smaller impact of the mouth bar in this external forcing scenario can be due to the relatively larger salt intrusion length in case 11 that is a larger denominator induces a relatively smaller change 3 4 salt intrusion and salt transport changes under the previous forcings and waves we investigated the effects of the mouth baron salt dynamics when a landward propagating wave from the offshore boundary was added to the model simulations in this scenario the wind generated local wind sea is also activated this combination of the external forcings is the most favorable scenario for salt intrusion when waves were taken into consideration the salt intrusion becomes more severe fig 10b without the mouth bar the bottom surface salt intrusion length is 46 37 km during the neap tide compared to a value of 43 34 km in case 11 showing an increase in the salt intrusion the bottom surface intrusion length becomes 34 24 km during the spring tide compared to a value of 30 21 km in case 11 under the presence of the mouth bar the bottom surface salt intrusion length during the neap tide becomes 38 29 km representing a relative reduction of 17 22 the bottom surface intrusion length becomes 27 18 km during the spring tide showing a relative reduction of 21 25 these results indicate that under the combined actions of river flow tides wind and waves the mouth bar has a greater effect on decreasing salt intrusion it is also seen that with the wave effects the mouth bar has a similar effect on reducing the salt intrusion during the neap and spring tides to illustrate the physics causing such changes we present the changes in hydrodynamics firstly fig 11 the variation of the wave height h s along the longitudinal transect in the estuary are shown in fig 11a and 11d the wave propagates from the offshore to the estuary with a continuous reduction of wave height from 2 5 m at the offshore boundary to approximately 0 8 m at the estuary mouth the wave penetrates the estuary in a short distance the h s larger than 0 1 m is located below 25 km from the estuary mouth during the neap tide fig 11a and below 20 km during the spring tide fig 11d under the presence of the mouth bar the wave height decreases quickly near the estuary mouth fig 11a and 11d during the neap tide the wave height is 0 55 m at the estuary mouth and decreases to 0 04 m within 20 km from the estuary mouth during the spring tide the wave height is again 0 55 m at the estuary mouth but decreases more quickly when propagating into the estuary the wave height becomes less than 0 02 m at a distance of 20 km from the estuary mouth it is seen that the mouth bar has a greater impact on reducing the wave height during the spring tide we were not certain whether this greater decrease in wave height at the estuary mouth during the spring tide is owing to the more enhanced bottom friction or due to the stronger ebb current and the associated wave breaking by the wave current interaction in the spring tide anyway during the spring tide the mouth bar has a relatively stronger effect in dissipating the wave energy along with the change in wave height the estuarine circulation in the estuary is also changed in fig 11 we also present the changes in surface and bottom residual flows induced by the mouth bar during the neap tide the surface seaward flow is decreased by the mouth bar along the estuary and is even reversed from the seaward flow into landward flow near the estuary mouth fig 11b this landward surface flow is caused by the enhanced wave setup and surface streaming on the top of the mouth bar for the bottom flow fig 11c without the mouth bar it is landward at the estuary mouth and decreases in the lower convergent part of the estuary after entering the upper straight part the landward bottom flow increases in the middle reach of the estuary and changes into seaward flow when going further upstream where it is dominated by the river flow under the presence of the mouth bar the bottom flow changes into seaward flow near the summit of the mouth bar at the landward side of the mouth bar the bottom flow changes from seaward to landward and attains a maximum at the junction between the lower convergent part and the upper straight part it quickly changes into seaward when going upstream this shows that the mouth bar increases the landward flow just landward of the mouth bar but decreases greatly the landward flow in the middle and upper reaches of the estuary during the spring tide the mouth bar decreases the seaward surface flow in the estuary especially at the summit of the mouth bar fig 11e the bottom flow is almost seaward without the mouth bar and the mouth bar decreases the bottom seaward flow along the estuary fig 11f in general the mouth bar decreases the surface seaward flow and the bottom landward flow and thus decreases the estuarine circulation we further examined the changes in residual water level bottom stress and vertical mixing induced by the mouth bar fig 12 during both the neap and spring tides the mouth bar elevates the residual water level along the estuary this effect is most conspicuous at the lower convergent part of the estuary during the spring tide fig 12b for the bottom stress during the neap tide fig 12c when there is no mouth bar it increases in the lower convergent part of the estuary and then declines to the middle reach followed by an increase in the upper reach under the presence of the mouth bar the bottom stress increases remarkably in the mouth bar area after the summit of the mouth bar it decreases sharply followed by a slow increase during the spring tide fig 12d the bottom stress endures a similar change by the mouth bar overall the mouth bar increases the bottom stress at the seaward side of the mouth bar summit and decreases the bottom stress at the landward side of the mouth bar summit for the eddy diffusivity during the neap tide fig 12e the mouth bar decreases the bottom diffusivity and increases the diffusivity in the surface and middle layers just landward of the mouth bar and increases the diffusivity in the middle reach of the estuary during the spring tide fig 12f the mouth bar decreases the diffusivity just landward of the mouth bar but increases the diffusivity further upstream the increases in diffusivity in the surface and middle layers just landward of the mouth bar may be associated with the hydraulic processes around the mouth bar which will be explored in the discussion part the changes in salt transport flux components are shown in fig 13 compared with that without the wave effects fig 8 the tidal oscillatory transport is increased in the lower convergent part this can be expected as the landward propagating wave enhances the flood current and weakens the ebb current thus enhancing the velocity asymmetry between flood and ebb and consequently increasing the tidal oscillatory this increased landward transport results in an enhancement of the salt intrusion during the neap tide fig 13a when there is no mouth bar the steady shear is dominant over the tidal oscillatory in the whole estuary except near the salt intrusion front as in case 01 the steady shear decreases in the lower convergent part from the estuary mouth in the upper straight part it firstly increases and then continues to decline further upstream on the other hand the tidal oscillatory increases in the lower convergent part from the estuary mouth and declines slightly when entering into the upper straight part under the presence of the mouth bar the steady shear is greatly decreased at the estuary mouth followed by an increase in the mouth bar region it decreases when entering the upper straight part of the estuary for the tidal oscillatory it is greatly increased at the estuary mouth and then declined at the mouth bar region at the landward limit of the mouth bar it changes into seaward but with a much smaller magnitude compared to that occurs in case 02 the total landward salt transport flux fig 13c endures a similar change to that between case 01 and 02 during the spring tide fig 13b the tidal oscillatory dominates over the steady shear under both scenarios without and with the mouth bar different from the scenario without wave effects the steady shear increases moderately and the tidal oscillatory decreases slightly at the landward limit of the mouth bar indicating the effect of the wave on enhancing the tidal oscillatory transport however in the upper straight part of the estuary the presence of the mouth bar increases the steady shear transport but decreases the tidal oscillatory moderately this is confirmed by the change in the total landward salt flux by the mouth bar fig 13d under the presence of the mouth bar the total landward salt transport is decreased slightly overall under the combined actions of river flow tides wind and waves the mouth bar increases the wave energy dissipation by increasing bottom friction and promoting wave breaking in the mouth bar region decreases the landward flow by weakening the bottom streaming and the stokes drift and decreases the mixing just landward of the mouth bar but increases the mixing further upstream these effects lead to a reduction of the steady shear and an increase in the tidal oscillatory in the lower convergent part of the estuary in the upper straight part of the estuary the presence of the mouth bar decreases the estuarine circulation wave height and mixing the mouth bar thus decreases both the steady shear and the tidal oscillatory clearly the mouth bar decreases the total landward salt transport considerably and reduces the salt intrusion to a greater extent to confirm the changes in salt transport flux we present an example of the changes in estuarine circulation and stratification induced by the mouth bar which determine the steady shear transport we chose the cross section in the middle reach of the estuary as indicated above the results are shown in fig 14 during the neap tide fig 14a and 14c the mouth bar decreases the surface seaward flow and bottom landward flow and decreases the salinity stratification from a bottom surface salinity difference of 25 psu to 18 psu these changes result in a decreased steady shear transport as shown in fig 13a during the spring tide fig 14b and 14d the mouth bar decreases the uni directionally seaward flow especially in the middle and bottom layers of the cross section this decrease in bottom seaward flow is consistent with the decrease in water level gradient by the mouth bar fig 12b in the meantime it decreases the salinity stratification from a bottom surface salinity difference of 10 psu to 5 psu however the decrease in seaward flow dominates over the decrease in stratification and results in an increase in the steady shear fig 13b the above results confirm that the mouth bar decreases the steady shear in the middle reach of the estuary during the neap tide but increases the steady shear during the spring tide for other cross sections not shown the changes in estuarine circulation and salinity stratification are all consistent with the changes in the steady shear shown in fig 0 13 overall under the combined actions of river flow tides wind and waves the presence of the mouth bar greatly suppresses the salt intrusion to a reduction of more than 20 the reduction of the salt intrusion is mostly caused by the decrease in the steady shear during the neap tide and by the decrease in the tidal oscillatory transport during the spring tide 4 discussion 4 1 the possible effects of hydraulic processes as we did not focus on the processes of hydraulic control at the mouth bar in this study we did not use a non hydrostatic model such as mitgcm and very high resolution to investigate the details of the hydraulics that occur at the mouth bar the roms model we utilized in this study is a hydrostatic one and cannot resolve the detailed hydraulic jump processes however it has been shown that the roms model can approximately grasp the macro scale effect of the non hydrostatic processes hsu et al 2013a hsu et al 2013b and can be used to study the macro scale processes in our model configuration the horizontal resolution is 40 200 m and the vertical resolution is between 0 05 and 2 m with higher resolution near the surface and bottom this resolution would not be able to reproduce the hydraulic processes at the mouth bar however the model does reveal some effects of the hydraulic control and provides some clues for future research here we present intratidal hydrodynamic processes near the mouth bar during the spring tide under the conditions without and with waves in figs 15 and 16 when there is no wind and wave at the peak ebb fig 15a the froude number f r at the top of the mouth bar is greater than 1 showing a supercritical condition the f r becomes less than 1 just seaward of the summit of the mouth bar and then changes into greater than 1 at the seaward mild slope at the turning point where the mild slope transits into a steep slope the flow experiences a transition from supercritical to subcritical and results in a lowering of the isohalines there landward of the summit of the mouth bar the f r is greater than 1 and shows a bulging of the isohaline there at the ebb slack fig 15b the ebb flow is largely blocked by the mouth bar seaward of the summit of the mouth bar a two layer flow develops the f r is generally less than 1 showing a subcritical condition at the seaward turning point from the mild slope to a steep slope the subcritical flow changes into a supercritical one and the isohalines are uplifted at the peak flood fig 15c the f r seaward of the summit of the mouth bar is greater than 1 and transits into less than 1 landward of the summit of the mouth bar indicating a hydraulic jump occurrence further upstream the flow changes from subcritical to supercritical and the isohalines are uplifted at the flood slack fig 15d from the estuary mouth to the summit of the mouth bar the flow changes from subcritical to supercritical and after the summit of the mouth bar the flow endures a transition from supercritical to subcritical indicating a hydraulic jump lee waves are observed to develop at the landward side of the mouth bar and cause the isohalines to move up and down with the wind and waves the stratification is decreased and the f r is increased suggesting a stronger hydraulic control at the mouth bar fig 16 at the peak ebb fig 16a the flow landward of the summit of the mouth bar is supercritical and changes into subcritical near the summit of the mouth bar the f r becomes greater than 1 at the seaward mild slope and experience a jump at the turning point at the ebb slack fig 16b the ebb flow is completely blocked and the f r is less than 1 for the flow around the mouth bar showing a subcritical condition at the flood peak fig 16c the flow is supercritical seaward of the summit of the mouth bar and changes into subcritical just before the summit then becomes supercritical at the summit of the mouth bar followed by a hydraulic jump landward of the mouth bar at the flood slack fig 16d the flow changes from supercritical to subcritical landward of the mouth bar and an internal lee wave is shown to propagate landward from the above results we could classify the hydraulic control at the mouth bar as partially blocked with lee jump based on baines 1995 we noticed that a lee internal wave occurs during the flooding period this lee wave propagates from just landward of the mouth bar to further upstream of the estuary this internal wave increases the vertical mixing in the surface and middle layers landward of the mouth bar fig 12e and 12f oscillates the isohaline vertically and enhances the tidal oscillatory salt transport geyer and nepf 1996 this enhanced tidal oscillatory can be observed in fig 8b and 13b in which a local peak appears at the location of 10 km from the estuary mouth under the presence of the mouth bar owing to the hydrostatic nature of the model we adopted and relatively poor grid resolution this study does not completely resolve the hydraulic control processes around the mouth bar however the macroscale effects of the hydraulic processes can be seen in the above results the details warrant further exploration by using a non hydrostatic fine resolution model 4 2 dependence of the mouth bar s effect on the river discharge in the above simulations we specified a constant river discharge of 3500 m3 s which is the mean value in the modaomen estuary during the dry season as the river discharge usually fluctuates around this mean value we set another two river discharges which are 5500 and 1500 m3 s to represent the high and low flow conditions as the salt intrusion is most severe under the combined forcings of river discharge tide wind and waves we ran the model under this scenario with high and low flow conditions see table 1 under the high flow the bottom surface salt intrusion length is 41 26 km in the neap tides and 32 17 km in the spring tides the salt intrusion pattern keeps unchanged with greater intrusion during neap tides and weaker intrusion during spring tides compare to those in case 21 the salt intrusion length is clearly shortened showing the high river flow suppresses the salt intrusion under the presence of the mouth bar the bottom surface intrusion length decreases to 32 18 km during the neap tides representing a relative reduction of 22 30 in the neap tide during the spring tide the bottom surface intrusion length decreases to 21 10 km a relative reduction of 34 41 this result indicates that under the high flow condition the mouth bar significantly decreases the salt intrusion reaching a percentage of as much as nearly 40 under the low flow the estuary changes into a state of well mixed the salt intrusion pattern is changed with the strongest intrusion occurring near the spring tide and the weakest intrusion occurring near the neap tide this shows the dominance of the tidal oscillatory in driving the landward salt transport the largest bottom surface salt intrusion length is 53 48 km in the spring tides and 42 36 km in the neap tides compare to those in case 21 the salt intrusion length is greatly increased under the presence of the mouth bar the largest bottom surface intrusion length decreases to 47 42 km during the spring tides representing a relative reduction of 11 13 in the spring tides during the neap tide the bottom surface intrusion length decreases to 38 31 km a relative reduction of 12 14 this result indicates that under the low flow condition the mouth bar has a weakened effect on decreasing the salt intrusion the above results indicate the mouth bar s effects on decreasing the salt intrusion are dependent on the river flow conditions the higher the river flow the greater effect of the mouth bar 5 implications and limitations using the idealized model configuration which mimics the modaomen estuary in the pearl river delta china this study investigates the effect of a mouth bar on the salt intrusion in the estuary the results indicate that the mouth bar decreases the salt intrusion under the typical conditions of river discharge and tides by 15 to 23 when wind and waves were taken into consideration the mouth bar can greatly dissipate the tidal and wave energy and impede the salt intrusion with the largest reduction of 25 the reduction percentage can reach as high as 40 when the river discharge is high these results show that the effect of the mouth bar on weakening the salt intrusion is substantial along with the coastal protection by the mouth bar in enhancing wave energy dissipation and wave height reduction inside the estuary the existence of the mouth bar is thus of fundamental importance cautions should be taken when planning to remove the mouth bar for resource management this study considers idealized geometry and typical hydrological conditions in real estuaries like the modaomen estuary the bathymetry is more complex including several sand bars alternating and meandering channels reversed bed slopes in several sections of the estuary and multiple freshwater sources and sinks along the estuary in the meantime the river discharge tides winds and waves are changing all the time and have different timescales of variabilities payo payo et al 2022 these complexities make the real situation much more complicated than this study though we did not aim to reproduce all the variabilities as mentioned above to fully understand the hydraulic control of the mouth bar a non hydrostatic model and more refined resolution are needed this study can be considered a preliminary step to the full understanding of the mouth bar s effects in real situations the river mouth itself undergoes continuous evolution under the actions of all the external forcings the geometry and bathymetry of the mouth bar are thus not fixed as assumed in this study the feedback between the mouth bar and the external forcings is another topic but beyond this study s scope 6 summary and conclusions in this study we focused on the effect of the mouth bar on salt transport and salt intrusion in an idealized estuary which has a prototype of the modaomen estuary pearl river delta china we used the coawst modeling system to conduct simulations by configuring an idealized estuary with and without a mouth bar the estuary has a lower highly convergent part and an upper straight part the mouth bar is situated at the lower part and is switched on and off in different model simulations we considered different hydrodynamic conditions the first scenario only considered the river flow and tides in which the river flow was specified to be the mean river discharge in the modaomen estuary in the winter dry season and the tides are composed of two tidal constituents m 2 and s 2 to represent the spring neap tidal variations in the second scenario we further included a down estuary wind to examine the effect of wind on salt intrusion in the last scenario we took the wave effects into consideration by specifying an offshore swell wave that propagates landward and simultaneously activating the process of wind wave generation in the model we compared the salt intrusions and salt transport fluxes between those without and with the presence of the mouth bar under different hydrodynamic conditions we noted that under the river flow and tides only the mouth bar decreases the bottom surface salt intrusion considerably with a reduction of 14 20 and 23 0 in the neap and spring tides respectively the existence of the mouth bar bifurcates the estuary mouth into two side channels and increases the tidal variations of longitudinal current and salinity in the lower convergent part of the estuary thus increasing the tidal oscillatory transport and decreasing the steady shear transport landward of the mouth bar the tidal amplitude is decreased by the mouth bar due to stronger friction and more energy dissipation this reduced tidal strength favors the development of salinity stratification and estuarine circulation thus resulting in an enhanced steady shear in the middle reach of the estuary further upstream into the upper reach where river flow dominates the tidal oscillatory becomes predominant and the reduction of the tidal amplitude by the mouth bar leads to a decrease in tidal oscillatory there in the neap tide the reduction of tidal strength at the landward side of the mouth bar increases the steady shear partly offsetting the decrease in salt influx at the estuary mouth and generates a relatively weaker effect 15 on reducing the salt intrusion by the mouth bar in the spring tide the reduction of the tidal strength by the mouth bar decreases the tidal oscillatory augmenting the decrease in salt influx at the estuary mouth and results in a stronger effect 23 on reducing the salt intrusion under the moderate downestuary wind the salt intrusion length in the estuary is increased and the mouth bar has a similar effect on reducing the salt intrusion compared to that without the wind when the wave effects were included in the model the mouth bar exerts a great role in reducing salt intrusion the existence of the mouth bar can drive a reduction of salt intrusion by 20 the mouth bar enhances the wave energy dissipation in the mouth bar region and reduces the wave height along the estuary it decreases the estuarine circulation and increases the mixing in the surface and middle layers just landward of the mouth bar but decreases the mixing further upstream again the mouth bar decreases the steady shear but increases the tidal oscillatory near the estuary mouth but increases the steady shear and decreases the tidal oscillatory landward of the mouth bar further upstream the mouth bar decreases both the steady shear and tidal oscillatory we also examined the dependence of the mouth bar s effects on the river flow it shows that the mouth bar has a greater effect under the higher flow condition on decreasing the salt intrusion though with limited capability to resolve the hydraulic processes around the mouth bar the model does show some phenomenon of lee wave generation and propagation which increases the vertical oscillation of the pycnocline and tidal oscillatory transport this study is of relevance for

2984,terrestrial water storage tws in the endorheic tibetan plateau etp increased from 2002 to 2012 but decreased in 2012 2016 this study used gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data and global land data assimilation system gldas data to analyse tws changes in the etp in 2012 from increasing to decreasing the results showed that these tws changes could be divided into two stages from april 2002 to august 2012 tws increased at a rate of 4 43 gt yr from the grace mascons and 1 11 gt yr from the grace sh whereas after september 2012 it declined at a rate of 5 62 gt yr from the grace mascons and 6 99 gt yr from the grace sh the increase in lake water storage lws 7 98 gt yr was higher than the loss of other components from 2002 to 2012 therefore the lws gradually dominated the increase in tws however the soil moisture storage sms decreased more significantly 5 27 gt yr than the increase in lws 1 gt yr during 2012 2016 accounting for 66 of the decrease in tws in the etp from a water balance perspective the relationship between precipitation p and evapotranspiration determined the region s changes in tws it was found that 90 of the decrease in tws in the etp during 2012 2016 was attributed to an increase in potential evapotranspiration pet whereas 7 was attributed to a decrease in p thus climate change p and pet accounted for 97 of the tws reduction during 2012 2016 furthermore 3 of the decrease in tws in the region was attributed to land surface changes keywords terrestrial water storage variation water storage component water balance equation climate change

southern watersheds is due to the combined effects of increasing temperature decreasing precipitation p and increasing r chen et al 2017 deng et al 2018 han et al 2019 han et al 2021 jacob et al 2012 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2013 tws increased in sanjiangyuan of the tibetan plateau where increasing soil moisture was the primary driving factor meng et al 2019 whereas surface water storage decreased in this region liu et al 2020 tws exhibited an overall decreasing trend 2 4 mm a in the south eastern part of the tibetan plateau particularly in the salween basin zhu et al 2020 however the tws increased in the etp and the increase in lws was the main factor contributing to the increase in water storage components li et al 2022 song et al 2013 zhang et al 2017a whereas the increase in p was the main factor contributing to hydrological circulation processes deng et al 2018 therefore the twsv in the tibetan plateau in terms of temperature rise is as follows i significant differences in

2012 deng et al 2018 exhibiting a change from increasing to decreasing and the trend continued to strengthen which indicated changes in the hydrological circulation process in the region the change in tws is dependent on the relationship between p and evapotranspiration et according to the water balance equation δ s p et in the etp previous studies focused on the spatial and temporal changes in tws in the etp however the inversion of the change in tws from increasing to decreasing in the etp has not received adequate attention the characterisation of each component of tws in the etp and their

2014 july 2014 december 2014 june 2015 october 2015 november 2015 april 2016 september 2016 october 2016 and february 2017 the missing values of twsa were filled using the multiyear mean of a missing month and the twsa of its nearest month long et al 2015 2 2 3 gldas data the components of tws in the gldas model included soil moisture snow water equivalent swe and plant canopy water https disc sci gsfc nasa gov hydrology the depth of soil moisture of the gldas noah and vic model was 0 200 cm and 0 289 cm respectively which is more applicable to the tibetan plateau bi et al 2016 xu et al 2018 therefore we used the gldas noah and vic model to estimate soil moisture storage in the etp furthermore the swe occupies an essential water storage component in the etp whereas the vegetation canopy water in the study area constituted a small proportion 2 2 4 lake water storage data lake water storage lws is an essential component of tws in the etp water level and volume are vital parameters for estimating lws the surface level of a lake can be obtained based on surface monitoring using satellite altimetry crétaux et al 2011 there are 871 lakes larger than 1 km2 and 126 lakes larger than 50 km2 in this study area yang et al 2017 yao et al 2018 the water storage of 126 lakes 50 km2 accounts for more than two thirds of the water storage capacity of all lakes in the etp the hydrolare project https www legos obs mip fr soa hydrologie hydroweb provides lake level data of typical global lakes and reservoirs among which 24 lakes in the etp fig 1 were monitored from 2000 to 2014 moreover the lws changes from 2002 to 2015 were analysed based on the water storage of lakes 50 km2 yang et al 2017 yao et al 2018 and the relative rate of change in lws between 2002 2012 and 2012 2015 was compared 2 2 5 snow depth data in this study snow depth data from 2002 to 2017 were obtained from the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center https data tpdc ac cn zh hans data df40346a 0202 4ed2 bb07 b65dfcda9368 of the chinese snow depth long time series dataset 1979 2020 this dataset was obtained by inverting the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer 1979 1987 special sensor microwave imager 1987 2007 and special sensor microwave imager sounder 2008 2020 daily passive microwave brightness temperature data ease grid processed from the national snow and ice data center furthermore using cross calibrated brightness temperatures from different sensors improved the brightness temperature data in terms of temporal consistency che et al 2008 dai et al 2015 dai et al 2017 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 tws calculations the grace satellite based method uses the time varying gravity field of the earth monitored by the grace satellite and equivalently converts it to the mass change of the earth s surface by solving the time varying gravity field model and then dividing it by the density of water to obtain the change in tws tapley et al 2004 the grace monthly mass data results for the tws calculation are mainly based on the sh approach and mass concentration blocks m method from different processing centres the monthly grid tws anomaly twsa data of csr sh jpl sh and gfz sh in the etp were obtained from the grace sh solutions this solution was the standard method for the first decade of grace observations in this study a solution with appropriate corrections i e de correction filter de stripe ellipsoidal correction degree 2 order 0 c20 degree 1 and glacial isostatic adjustment gia was applied an empirical de striping filter was applied to minimise the effect of correlated errors from n s stripes swenson and wahr 2006 the coefficients of c20 were replaced by satellite laser ranging slr loomis et al 2019 because the native values had a larger uncertainty than the slr values the degree 1 coefficients geocentre were estimated using the method of sun et al 2016 the ice 6g d model was used to remove gia peltier et al 2018 finally a 300 km wide gaussian filter was applied to the data landerer and swenson 2012 with a maximum degree order n of 60 the baseline anomalies were from january 2005 to december 2010 the monthly grid twsa data of csr m jpl m and gsfc m in the etp were obtained from the grace m solutions this solution has better s n ratios than conventional spherical harmonic solutions wiese et al 2016 meanwhile a priori constraints in space and time were used to estimate global monthly gravity fields in terms of equal area 3 3 spherical cap mass concentration functions to minimise the effect of measurement errors solutions with all the appropriate corrections were also applied ellipsoidal correction c20 degree1 and gia the base period of the anomaly was from january 2004 to december 2009 table 2 provides detailed information on the six sets of tws products we also calculated the ensemble mean of the three grace sh datasets tws sh and three grace m datasets tws m therefore in this study we used eight grace tws datasets four grace sh datasets csr sh jpl sh gfz sh and tws sh and four grace m datasets csr m jpl m gsfc m and tws m 2 3 2 climate elasticity model climate elasticity coefficients are widely used to analyse the influence of climate factors on hydrological systems chen et al 2013 li et al 2007 li et al 2020 xu et al 2014 zheng et al 2009 from the water balance perspective the water balance equation at the catchment scale is s p et r s is the water storage because there is no r outflow r 0 in the etp the water balance equation can be abbreviated as δ s p et meanwhile catchment characteristics are also important factors that affect the hydrological cycle yang et al 2007 therefore tws in the etp can be modelled as a function of climatic variables and catchment characteristics as follows 1 s f p p e t v where p precipitation and pet potential evapotranspiration represent dominant climate factors on the hydrological cycle and v is a factor that represents the integrated effects of catchment characteristics i e land use and land cover change on the hydrological cycle therefore changes in tws in the etp due to changing climate and catchment characteristics can be approximated as follows 2 δ s s p δ p s p e t δ p e t s v δ v where δ s δ p δ p e t and δ v are the changes in tws p pet and catchment characteristics respectively assuming that the land surface factors are independent of climate factors zheng et al 2009 s p δ p s p e t δ p e t is the change in tws due to climate change and s v δ v is the change in tws due to changes in catchment characteristics i e land use and land cover change here we used the method of climate elasticity to estimate the effect of climate change on tws in the etp the climate elasticity of tws is defined by the proportional change in s divided by the proportional change in a climatic variable such as p or pet x and is expressed as follows 3 ε ds s dx x where ε is the climate elasticity coefficient x denotes a climate variable p and pet and s is the tws in this study the climate elasticity coefficient estimated by the nonparametric estimator method is defined by zheng et al 2009 and is expressed as follows 4 ε x x s x i x s i s x i x 2 r x s c s c x where r x s is the correlation coefficient of x and s i is the study period 2003 2016 in this study and c s and c x are the coefficients of variation of x and s respectively the physical meaning of the climate elasticity coefficient ε is that a 1 change in the independent variables will contribute to ε in tws changes ε p and ε pet are the elasticities of tws of p and pet respectively therefore we can separate the effects of climate change and land surface changes on tws in the etp 2 3 3 component attributions of tws changes the composition of tws in the etp included lws glaciers and swe soil moisture storage groundwater and vegetation canopy water in this region the proportion of vegetation canopy water in the tws is small because vegetation is sparse thus the vegetation canopy water was neglected moreover permafrost is widespread in the endorheic zone similar to a water barrier therefore the amount of groundwater was considered to be constant in this study combined with previous studies meng et al 2019 song et al 2013 the variation of tws wtws in the instream zone can be represented as the sum of the variation of four components namely soil moisture storage wsms swe wswe glacier wglacier and lws wlws as follows 5 δ w tws δ w sms δ w lws δ w swe δ w glacier where δ wtws is the change in tws km3 yr and δ w sms δ w lws δ w swe and δ w glacier are the changes in sms wsms lws wlws swe wswe and glacial wglacier respectively therefore the contribution of each component to the change in tws can be calculated by the following equation 6 ρ δ w variables δ w tws 100 where ρ is the contribution of each component δ w sms δ w lws δ w swe and δ w glacier to the twsv δ w tws 2 3 4 trend analysis the mann kendall m k nonparametric trend test is commonly used to assess the significance of trends of meteorological and hydrological time series data gocic and trajkovic 2013 hamed and rao 1998 hirsch and slack 1984 we applied the m k nonparametric method in this study to detect trends of tws temperature p et pet soil moisture and snow depth in the etp furthermore the rate of a trend was estimated using sen s 1968 nonparametric trend estimator 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial variations of tws the changes in tws of eight grace based tws datasets of the etp from april 2002 to june 2017 showed significant phase characteristics fig 2 a including two stages namely increasing and decreasing a tipping point about occurred in august 2012 when the tws changed from increasing to decreasing fig 2a from april 2002 to august 2012 tws changes exhibited a significant increasing trend with a mean rate of increase of 0 23 0 16 gt month meanwhile tws changes showed a decreasing trend from september 2012 to june 2017 with a mean rate of decrease of 0 54 0 13 gt month the results in table 3 show that the increasing trend of tws obtained by the grace m method 0 37 gt month was faster than that obtained by the grace sh method 0 09 gt month during april 2002 august 2012 especially the jpl m data showing a rate of increase of 0 53 gt month however the decreasing trend of tws obtained from the grace sh method 0 58 gt month was faster than that obtained using the grace m method 0 47 gt month during september 2012 june 2017 especially the csr sh data showed a rate of decrease of 0 76 gt month the intra annual variation of twsa in the etp matched the intra annual variation of net precipitation p et fig 2b in march april the net precipitation reached the maximum negative anomaly level and the corresponding twsa reached the maximum negative anomaly level moreover the net precipitation in july august reached the maximum positive anomaly level and the corresponding twsa also reached the maximum positive anomaly level fig 2b shows a lag of approximately 2 3 months in the response of the twsa to the net precipitation variation meanwhile the correspondence between the twsa and net precipitation obtained by the grace sh method was better than that obtained by the grace m method fig 2c and d shows that the seasonal variation of tws m and tws sh changed from increasing to decreasing since 2012 the seasonal variation of tws exhibited a negative anomaly in winter and spring i e a decrease and a positive anomaly in summer and autumn i e an increase the multi year monthly average tws variation also showed a similar change fig s1 with a negative anomaly in january may and a positive anomaly in june december which was closely related to the variation of precipitation deng et al 2017 the ensemble mean of tws m fig 3 a1 and tws sh fig 3b1 showed an inversion of the tws change from increasing to decreasing the spatial variation of tws m and tws sh in the etp around 2012 was significant fig 3a2 and b2 shows that the tws m and tws sh in most regions increased from april 2002 to august 2012 particularly in the north eastern region 0 3 cm month and passed the significance test at the 0 01 level p 0 01 during this period tws in the southern regions decreased by 0 02 cm month to 0 04 cm month however the increase in tws m and tws sh did not continue instead both decreased after september 2012 from september 2012 to may 2017 the changes in tws showed a decrease fig 3a3 and b3 of a rate of less than 0 2 cm month p 0 01 and even 0 3 cm month in some regions only the north eastern and north western regions showed an increasing trend of tws however the increasing trend was low and did not pass the significance test at the 0 01 level p 0 01 the change in tws in the etp reversed in 2012 from increasing to decreasing this indicated that the temperature rise in the tibetan plateau affected the regional hydrological system in this context the following two aspects must be considered 1 the characteristics of changes in each tws component during the process of tws conversion from increasing to decreasing and 2 the climatic driving factors and their contribution rate to tws conversion from increasing to decreasing in the etp from the perspective of water balance 3 2 changes in tws components in the etp 3 2 1 lake water storage lake water storage lws is the main component of tws in the etp in the past three decades the area and water level of most lakes in the etp have shown an increasing trend mainly because of the increase in glacier and snow meltwater and precipitation thereby resulting in more inflow glacier and snow meltwater and rainfall runoff than outflow mainly lake surface evaporation we obtained water level data for 24 typical lakes in the etp with an observation period of approximately the first decade of the 21st century table 4 the results showed that most of the lakes 21 of the 24 showed an increase in water level and all passed the significance test at the 0 05 level p 0 05 the fastest rates of increase in lake water levels were observed in dogen co 0 66 m yr p 0 01 and ziling lake 0 67 m yr p 0 01 moreover three lakes showed a decreasing trend of water level table 4 but did not pass the significance test at the 0 05 level p 0 05 namely gozha co 0 03 m yr orba co 0 01 m yr and uru co 0 01 m yr the increase in lake level reflects an increasing trend of lws from 2002 to 2015 an increasing trend 6 4 gt yr was observed in 126 lakes with an area larger than 50 km2 in the etp lws increased by 88 gt in 2012 relative to that in 2002 in 2015 lws increased by 75 gt relative to that in 2002 which implied that the increase in lws slowed during 2012 2015 this result is consistent with those of previous studies zhang et al 2017a showed that the rate of increase in water storage in lakes 1 km2 was 9 53 gt y during 2002 2010 whereas the rate of increase in lws was only 0 99 gt yr since 2011 therefore the slight increase in lws beginning in 2011 was an important factor for changing the tws from increasing to decreasing in 2012 in the etp 3 2 2 soil moisture storage in this study we used the average soil moisture of gldas noah and gldas vic as the soil moisture storage sms of the etp and then compared the differences in soil moisture between 2002 2012 and 2012 2017 the results indicated that the soil moisture after 2012 was lower than that before in most regions of the etp the same results were also found in the era5 soil water in the etp from 2002 to 2016 fig s2 the differences in soil moisture of gldas noah between 2012 2016 and 2002 2012 exceeded 20 mm fig 4 a whereas that in the gldas vic model exceeded 40 mm fig 4b the rates of decrease in soil moisture of gldas noah and gldas vic were 3 51 mm yr p 0 01 and 7 22 mm yr p 0 01 respectively meanwhile soil temperature warming was significant exceeding 0 2 c yr p 0 01 fig 4c and d the soil temperature anomaly shifted from negative to positive in 2006 and the soil moisture anomaly correspondingly shifted from positive to negative in 2006 soil moisture increased slightly during 2002 2006 whereas it rapidly decreased after 2006 fig 4c and d therefore the increase in soil temperature under regional warming is an important reason for the decrease in soil moisture in the etp the soil moisture in the etp during 2002 2012 was 517 58 mm whereas it was only 477 10 mm in 2012 2016 thereby showing a decrease of 40 mm table 5 the soil moisture decreased in the etp from 2002 to 2012 at a rate of 4 67 mm yr p 0 01 whereas it decreased at a rate of 7 42 mm yr p 0 05 from 2012 to 2016 3 2 3 glaciers and swe glaciers and swe are the main components of solid water reserves in the tibetan plateau glaciers and snow ablation are important water resources for lake expansion in the etp since 2000 the snowfall rate snow p has decreased in the etp thereby indicating that the proportion of snowfall in p has decreased fig 5 a shows a 10 decrease in snowfall from 72 in 2000 2004 to 62 in 2008 2017 meanwhile the swe showed a decrease from 2002 to 2017 at a rate of 1 21 mm yr p 0 05 moreover the rate of decrease in swe was 2 3 mm yr p 0 01 from 2002 to 2012 whereas it was 1 74 mm yr insignificant at p greater than 0 05 from 2012 to 2017 fig 5c also shows a decrease in snow depth from 2002 to 2017 0 2 mm yr p 0 05 the glacier retreat rate in the etp is slower than that in the himalayan region yao et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b there is no direct hydrological connection between the endorheic basin and the outside and the melting of glaciers and snow is only a change of state from solid to liquid the water from which flows into the soil and lakes thereby replenishing the soil water and lake water therefore from the perspective of the gravity satellite observation principle and the hydrological cycle melting glaciers and snow in the etp will not directly cause changes in the total regional water storage the amount of water lost from glaciers and snow ablation due to evaporation will negatively impact the regional water storage therefore from the perspective of tws components the change in the increase or decrease in tws in the etp is essentially determined by the relationship between sms and lws table 6 from 2002 to 2012 the rate of increase in tws was 2 81 gt yr of which the rate of increase in lws was 7 98 gt yr the rate of decrease in sms was 3 41 gt yr and the rate of decrease in glacier and swe was approximately 1 76 gt yr thus the increase in lws in this period offset the decrease in other water storage components and thus the tws in the whole region showed an increasing trend from 2012 to 2016 the rate of decrease in tws was 6 48 gt yr of which the rate of increase in lws was 0 99 gt yr the rate of decrease in sms was 5 33 gt yr and the rate of decrease in glacier and swe was approximately 2 14 gt yr therefore the decrease in sms during this period offset the slight increase in lws and thus the tws in the whole region decreased this indicated that the shift from an increase to a decrease in tws in this region in 2012 was due to the shift from a rapid increase to a weak increase or a weak decrease in the lws components and the continuous decrease in sms 3 3 quantitative impacts of climate change on tws changes in the etp the variation of tws in the etp is closely related to the relationship between p and et et is the depletion term for the water balance in the region figure s3 shows that et is water limited in the etp and the annual pet is approximately 100 mm greater than the annual p in this region although the annual p is insufficient to meet the pet of etp there are many lakes with larger water storage capacity zhang et al 2017b the lake surface is a free water surface and with an increase in pet lake surface et will also increase from 2003 to 2016 tws was positively correlated with p r 0 27 and negatively correlated with pet r 0 47 in the etp using equation 4 and table 7 we determined the p elasticity of tws was 7 94 whereas the pet elasticity of tws was 39 83 this indicated that p positively affected tws change whereas pet change was negatively affected this also indicated that tws changes in the etp were more sensitive to the response of pet the increase in pet under regional warming will increase lake et which will reduce tws based on the inversion of the tws change in 2012 in the etp the study period was divided into two phases before and after 2012 tws changes exhibited a significant trend of 8 94 mm yr p 0 01 since 2012 the regional mean p in table 8 showed an overall decrease during 2013 2016 compared with that during 2003 2012 whereas the regional mean pet increased during 2013 2016 compared with that during 2003 2012 furthermore the p and pet elasticity coefficients of tws change were 7 94 and 39 83 respectively therefore compared with that during 2003 2012 the average p during 2013 2016 decreased by 2 3 mm 0 84 accounting for 6 67 0 61 mm yr of the decrease in tws 9 12 mm yr during 2003 2016 in the etp the pet increased by approximately 8 5 mm 2 26 accounting for 90 02 8 21 mm yr of the decrease in tws during 2012 2016 thus the comprehensive impacts of both p and pet totalled a 8 82 mm yr decrease in tws during 2012 2016 which accounted for 96 69 of tws reduction land surface change i e vegetation change was estimated to have resulted in a 0 30 mm yr decrease in tws accounting for 3 31 of the tws change therefore the results indicated that climate change plays a more important role than land surface change in the change in tws in the etp the decomposition of tws in the etp based on the empirical orthogonal function eof method showed that the cumulative variance demonstrated by the first and second modes was greater than 85 fig 6 a the first mode eof 1 reflected the change in tws components fig 6b which was closely related to the change in lws r 0 97 p 0 01 whereas the second mode eof 2 reflected the loss term of tws which had a correlation coefficient of 0 78 p 0 01 with pet fig 6c et represents the loss term of tws in this region and pet indicates the evaporation capacity therefore the duration of this inversion depends on the relationship between p and pet 4 discussion temperature and precipitation have increased in the tibetan plateau under global warming since the mid 20th century there is spatial variation of temperature in the tibetan plateau the heating rate in the northern parts is faster than that in other regions of the tibetan plateau guo and wang 2012 moreover the heating rate increases with elevation pepin et al 2015 pepin et al 2019 mainly because of glaciers and snow ablation thereby causing a decrease in surface albedo over the last half century p changes on the qinghai tibet plateau included two aspects namely an increase in p 1 4 mm yr deng et al 2017 and a shift in p from snowfall to rainfall fig 5a significant temperature warming and increased p in the tibetan plateau have exacerbated the uncertainty of the processes in the regional hydrological cycle yao et al 2019a b the glaciers on the tibetan plateau are sensitive to temperature rise and are undergoing an overall retreat in the last 50 years glacier changes on the tibetan plateau have occurred in negative mass balance yao et al 2019a b and have continued to decline particularly since the 1990s the glacial area on the tibetan plateau decreased 0 24 0 03 m yr from 2003 to 2009 and the meltwater volume was approximately 14 86 11 8 gt yr neckel et al 2014 the total glacial area in the etp was 7039 km2 accounting for 7 4 of the entire glacial area of the tibetan plateau and the retreat rate of the glacial area was within 0 3 yr wang et al 2019 the retreat rate after 2000 was faster than that before 2000 wang et al 2019 xiong et al 2019 furthermore the rate of glacial area retreat and mass balance loss decreased from the south eastern part to the etp wang et al 2019 snow cover changes have shown that the onset of snowmelt occurs earlier xiong et al 2019 and snow cover periods and snow depths have decreased on the tibetan plateau che et al 2019 in particular after 2000 the snow cover duration was significantly shorter 2 d yr and the snow depth decreased approximately 0 2 cm yr to 0 1 cm yr che et al 2019 perennial permafrost on the tibetan plateau undergoes degradation cheng et al 2019 zhang 2012 thereby significantly affecting the regional climate and hydrological and ecological processes zhao et al 2019 however owing to the extreme scarcity of meteorological observation stations in the tibetan plateau the assessment of permafrost changes in the tibetan plateau is uncertain glaciers and snow ablation reduce the surface albedo which increases the absorption of solar radiation and accelerates the temperature rise in the etp thereby affecting hydrological processes and water resource changes deng et al 2019 the lake water volume change stage resulted in a distinct stage in the change in tws from 1970 to 2018 the lake area across the tibetan plateau increased to 5 0 104 km2 an increase of 25 4 the number of lakes larger than 1 km2 was 1424 in 2018 zhang et al 2019a b which was the main form of liquid water reserves in the region the number of lakes with areas larger than 1 km2 in the endorheic zone was 748 in 2014 reaching an area of 3 3 104 km2 thereby representing an increase of 28 from that in the 1960s wan et al 2016 most of the lakes 80 on the tibetan plateau have expanded zhu et al 2019 with phased characteristics exhibiting a faster increase from 2001 to 2010 and a slower increase from 2011 to 2016 this is consistent with the changes in tws in the etp for example in selincuo lake lake no 24 in fig 1 the average annual rate of increase was 0 38 m yr during 1979 2017 and 0 67 0 093 m yr during 2000 2012 and the lake area increased by 43 3 guo et al 2019 changes in lake area and water volume are closely related to meteorological factors temperature p and pet yang et al 2017a b the increase in p since 2000 is an important reason for the increase in lws zhu et al 2019 furthermore the decrease in p and increase in pet after 2010 led to a slight increase in the lws in the region thereby resulting in a change in the tws in the etp from increasing to decreasing in 2012 the continuous reduction of sms under global warming is an important reason for the change in tws from increasing to decreasing in the etp owing to permafrost degradation in the etp the role of sms changes in tws has been increasing the perennial temperature of the tibetan plateau is below 0 c the soil moisture freezes to form ground ice which is a perennial permafrost zone with an area of 106 104 km2 it is an integral part of the tws in the tibetan plateau zhao et al 2010 the rate of temperature rise in the permafrost layer was faster than that in the surface layer for example the average rate of increase in the ground temperature at 6 m at 10 monitoring sites along the qinghai tibet highway was approximately 0 39 c decade wu and zhang 2008 whereas the average rate of temperature increase at 10 m was approximately 0 15 c decade zhao et al 2019 permafrost degradation causes an increase in the active layer ding et al 2019 guo and wang 2012 and meltwater of approximately 8 gt yr zhao et al 2019 thereby accounting for 12 of the increase in lws zhang et al 2017b permafrost degradation with increased soil moisture infiltration reduces surface sms zhao et al 2019 which is consistent with the results of this study a large part of the uncertainty arises from data uncertainty the lack of observation sites is the main limiting factor for the accurate analysis of the water storage change characteristics in the etp the application of cru era gpcc and other grid data is often inaccurate and compared with the previous data set the cn05 dataset based on the station data has been improved in this study however there is a certain gap in this data remote sensing data are an excellent supplement to the lack of ground observation sites in this region particularly the high resolution remote sensing images in recent years which provide data for the study of soil moisture glaciers snow and lakes on the tibetan plateau however remote sensing data lack ground observation data for the assessment of uncertainty there is considerable uncertainty in the soil moisture data for the etp the thickness of the soil aquifer increased as the active layer of permafrost deepened which increased the uncertainty of the soil moisture simulation dataset therefore increasing surface observations and fusing multi source data could reduce uncertainty and improve accuracy tws in the etp has decreased since 2012 however the duration of this trend and whether it is a temporary or permanent decrease remain unclear therefore the next step of our research should combine further observations and data from multiple sources for a more comprehensive study 5 conclusions in this study detailed analyses of the component changes and driving factors of the changes in the tws trend in the etp in 2012 were conducted based on the grace based tws and climate data the main conclusions are as follows tws in the etp exhibited an increasing trend 0 23 0 16 gt month from april 2002 to august 2012 whereas it showed a decreasing trend 0 54 0 13 gt month from september 2012 to june 2017 moreover the seasonality of tws changes in the etp was closely related to the seasonal distribution of net precipitation when less p occurred during winter and spring tws showed a negative anomaly tws decreased during summer and autumn with increased p tws exhibited a positive anomaly tws increased both sms and lws changes influenced the characteristics of tws changes in the region during 2002 2012 the rate of increase in tws was 2 81 gt yr of which the increase in lws was 7 98 gt yr decrease in sms was 3 32 gt yr and decrease in glacier and swe was approximately 1 85 gt yr thus the increase in lws during this period offset the decrease in other water storage components which led to an increase in the tws of the entire region during 2012 2016 the rate of decrease in tws was 6 48 gt yr of which lws slightly increased by 0 99 gt yr sms decreased by 5 27 gt yr and glacier and swe decreased by approximately 2 20 gt yr from a water balance perspective the increase in pet was the main factor driving the change in tws from an increase to a decrease in 2012 the elasticity coefficients of p and pet were 7 94 and 39 83 respectively this indicated that p had a positive effect on tws whereas pet had negative effects compared with that during 2003 2012 the annual average p decreased by 2 3 mm 0 84 during 2012 2016 which contributed to a

2984,terrestrial water storage tws in the endorheic tibetan plateau etp increased from 2002 to 2012 but decreased in 2012 2016 this study used gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data and global land data assimilation system gldas data to analyse tws changes in the etp in 2012 from increasing to decreasing the results showed that these tws changes could be divided into two stages from april 2002 to august 2012 tws increased at a rate of 4 43 gt yr from the grace mascons and 1 11 gt yr from the grace sh whereas after september 2012 it declined at a rate of 5 62 gt yr from the grace mascons and 6 99 gt yr from the grace sh the increase in lake water storage lws 7 98 gt yr was higher than the loss of other components from 2002 to 2012 therefore the lws gradually dominated the increase in tws however the soil moisture storage sms decreased more significantly 5 27 gt yr than the increase in lws 1 gt yr during 2012 2016 accounting for 66 of the decrease in tws in the etp from a water balance perspective the relationship between precipitation p and evapotranspiration determined the region s changes in tws it was found that 90 of the decrease in tws in the etp during 2012 2016 was attributed to an increase in potential evapotranspiration pet whereas 7 was attributed to a decrease in p thus climate change p and pet accounted for 97 of the tws reduction during 2012 2016 furthermore 3 of the decrease in tws in the region was attributed to land surface changes keywords terrestrial water storage variation water storage component water balance equation climate change endorheic tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as the water tower of asia the tibetan plateau has both solid water reserves i e glaciers and snow and liquid water reserves i e lake water storage it is the source of many large rivers in asia immerzeel et al 2010 over the past 50 years the heating rate of the tibetan plateau was approximately 0 30 0 40 c decade which is higher than the global average heating rate 0 17 c decade over the same period chen et al 2015 in the context of temperature rise the changes in these water resources will lead to significant challenges for ecological stability and socioeconomic development of the pan third pole region yao et al 2017 this heating trend will continue in the future guo et al 2016 you et al 2019 thus the hydrological system in the tibetan plateau is undergoing significant changes characterised by water imbalance as revealed by glacier retreat snowpack reduction permafrost degradation and lake expansion ding et al 2019 yao et al 2019a b terrestrial water storage tws as a comprehensive indicator for quantitatively estimating the dynamic changes in regional water balance whose components include glacier snow groundwater soil moisture river and lake water and vegetation canopy water syed et al 2008 due to global warming glacier retreat snowmelt permafrost degradation and lake expansion have had a significant impact on tws variation twsv in the tibetan plateau wang et al 2018 the assessment of the twsv based on traditional hydrological methods has large uncertainty because of the gap in regional hydrometeorological observations kang et al 2020 particularly in the endorheic tibetan plateau etp the development and advancement of remote sensing monitoring technology over the last 20 years particularly the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite in march 2002 and the second generation satellite grace follow on in may 2018 have helped to monitor the changes in tws by providing all weather continuous stable and high spatial and temporal resolution data hu et al 2021 long et al 2014 long et al 2017 pokhrel et al 2021 sun et al 2017 sun et al 2020a b zhang et al 2019a b the grace gravity satellite has been widely used to analyse the characteristics of the twsv in the tibetan plateau and surrounding regions han et al 2019 long et al 2016 lv et al 2019 matsuo and heki 2010 meng et al 2019 sun et al 2020a b xiang et al 2016 xie et al 2019 the changes in tws in the tibetan plateau have evident spatial differences the decrease in tws in the southern watersheds is due to the combined effects of increasing temperature decreasing precipitation p and increasing r chen et al 2017 deng et al 2018 han et al 2019 han et al 2021 jacob et al 2012 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2013 tws increased in sanjiangyuan of the tibetan plateau where increasing soil moisture was the primary driving factor meng et al 2019 whereas surface water storage decreased in this region liu et al 2020 tws exhibited an overall decreasing trend 2 4 mm a in the south eastern part of the tibetan plateau particularly in the salween basin zhu et al 2020 however the tws increased in the etp and the increase in lws was the main factor contributing to the increase in water storage components li et al 2022 song et al 2013 zhang et al 2017a whereas the increase in p was the main factor contributing to hydrological circulation processes deng et al 2018 therefore the twsv in the tibetan plateau in terms of temperature rise is as follows i significant differences in composition with an increase in lws li et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 and a decrease in solid water storage mainly in glacier retreat huss and hock 2018 yao et al 2012 and ii spatial differentiation with a decrease in tws in the southern exdorheic region and an increase in tws in the northern endorheic region deng et al 2018 guo et al 2016 meng et al 2019 the increase in tws in the etp was reversed in 2012 deng et al 2018 exhibiting a change from increasing to decreasing and the trend continued to strengthen which indicated changes in the hydrological circulation process in the region the change in tws is dependent on the relationship between p and evapotranspiration et according to the water balance equation δ s p et in the etp previous studies focused on the spatial and temporal changes in tws in the etp however the inversion of the change in tws from increasing to decreasing in the etp has not received adequate attention the characterisation of each component of tws in the etp and their driving factors remain unclear therefore in this study we used grace the global land data assimilation system gldas and climate datasets to interpret the component changes and the factors driving the change in twsv from increasing to decreasing in the etp in 2012 section 2 describes the study area datasets and methods section 3 focuses on the component changes and the factors driving the change in tws in the etp broader implications of these findings are discussed in section 4 and section 5 presents our conclusions 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the etp lies in the core area of the tibetan plateau which is primarily defined as 29 67 38 63 n 78 66 93 66 e fig 1 it is surrounded by large mountains including the kailas range kunlun mountains karakoram mountains tanggula mountains and renqing tanggula mountains the average elevation of the etp is approximately 4900 m with an area of approximately 71 104 km2 fig 1 glaciers are widespread in the region with a glacial area of 7836 10 km2 and a total glacier reserve of 777 48 km3 which belongs to continental type glaciers wang et al 2019 the etp contains many lakes accounting for 55 of the total lakes in the entire tibetan plateau zhu et al 2019 these lakes are an essential component of tws 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 climate data temperature data were obtained from the china national meteorological information center cnmic https data

validation and error analysis this study extracted monthly temperature data from 2002 to 2017 from the cn05 dataset precipitation p data were provided by the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep dataset https www gloh2o org mswep which is a global precipitation product with a daily 0 1 resolution available from 1979 the product is unique because it merges gauge satellite and reanalysis data to obtain the highest quality precipitation estimates at every location beck et al 2019 this study collected monthly p data from 2002 to 2017 from the mswep dataset

https www gleam eu gleam v3 5 has been widely used to analyse et changes martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 therefore we chose version 3 5a from january 2002 to december 2017 which is based on satellite and reanalysis data era5 net radiation and air temperature 2 2 2 grace data in this study grace monthly data were released by four different processing centres namely the center for space research at texas state university csr geoforschungs zentrum potsdam gfz jet propulsion laboratory jpl and nasa goddard space flight center gsfc we collected six sets of grace monthly mass data for april 2002 june 2017 table 1 namely three from the standard spherical harmonic sh approach csr sh jpl sh and gfz sh and three from the mass concentration blocks mascons m method i e csr m jpl m and gsfc m the data sets comprised data from 183 months with 20 missing values june 2002 july 2002 july 2003 january 2011 june 2011 may 2012 october 2012 march 2013 august 2013 september 2013 february 2014 july 2014 december 2014 june 2015 october 2015 november 2015 april 2016 september 2016 october 2016 and february 2017 the missing values of twsa were filled using the multiyear mean of a missing month and the twsa of its nearest month long et al 2015 2 2 3 gldas data the components of tws in the gldas model included soil moisture snow water equivalent swe and plant canopy water https disc sci gsfc nasa gov hydrology the depth of soil moisture of the gldas noah and vic model was 0 200 cm and 0 289 cm respectively which is more applicable to the tibetan plateau bi et al 2016 xu et al 2018 therefore we used the gldas noah and vic model to estimate soil moisture storage in the etp furthermore the swe occupies an essential water storage component in the etp whereas the vegetation canopy water in the study area constituted a small proportion 2 2 4 lake water storage data lake water storage lws is an essential component of tws in the etp water level and volume are vital parameters for estimating lws the surface level of a lake can be obtained based on surface monitoring using satellite altimetry crétaux et al 2011 there are 871 lakes larger than 1 km2 and 126 lakes larger than 50 km2 in this study area yang et al 2017 yao et al 2018 the water storage of 126 lakes 50 km2 accounts for more than two thirds of the water storage capacity of all lakes in the etp the hydrolare project https www legos obs mip fr soa hydrologie hydroweb provides lake level data of typical global lakes and reservoirs among which 24 lakes in the etp fig 1 were monitored from 2000 to 2014 moreover the lws changes from 2002 to 2015 were analysed based on the water storage of lakes 50 km2 yang et al 2017 yao et al 2018 and the relative rate of change in lws between 2002 2012 and 2012 2015 was compared 2 2 5 snow depth data in this study snow depth data from 2002 to 2017 were obtained from the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center https data tpdc ac cn zh hans

special sensor microwave imager 1987 2007 and special sensor microwave imager sounder 2008 2020 daily passive microwave brightness temperature data ease grid processed from the national snow and ice data center furthermore using cross calibrated brightness temperatures from different sensors improved the brightness temperature data in terms of temporal consistency che et al 2008 dai et al 2015 dai et al 2017 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 tws calculations the grace satellite based method uses the time varying gravity field of the earth monitored by the grace satellite and equivalently converts it to the mass change of the earth s surface by solving the time varying gravity field model and then dividing it by the density of water to obtain the change in tws tapley et al 2004 the grace monthly mass data results for the tws calculation are mainly based on the sh approach and mass concentration blocks m method from different processing centres the monthly grid tws anomaly twsa data of csr sh jpl sh and gfz sh in the etp were obtained from the grace sh solutions this solution was the standard method for the first decade of grace observations in this study a solution with appropriate corrections i e de correction filter de stripe ellipsoidal correction degree 2 order 0 c20 degree 1 and glacial isostatic adjustment gia was applied an empirical de striping filter was applied to minimise the effect of correlated errors from n s stripes swenson and wahr 2006 the coefficients of c20 were replaced by satellite laser ranging slr loomis et al 2019 because the native values had a larger uncertainty than the slr values the degree 1 coefficients geocentre were estimated using the method of sun et al 2016 the ice 6g d model was used to remove gia peltier et al 2018 finally a 300 km wide gaussian filter was applied to the data landerer and swenson 2012 with a maximum degree order n of 60 the baseline anomalies were from january 2005 to december 2010 the monthly grid twsa data of csr m jpl m and gsfc m in the etp were obtained from the grace m solutions this solution has better s n ratios than conventional spherical harmonic solutions wiese et al 2016 meanwhile a priori constraints in space and time were used to estimate global monthly gravity fields in terms of equal area 3 3 spherical cap mass concentration functions to minimise the effect of measurement errors solutions with all the appropriate corrections were also applied ellipsoidal correction c20 degree1 and gia the base period of the anomaly was from january 2004 to december 2009 table 2 provides detailed information on the six sets of tws products we also calculated the ensemble mean of the three grace sh datasets tws sh and three grace m datasets tws m therefore in this study we used eight grace tws datasets four grace sh datasets csr sh jpl sh gfz sh and tws sh and four grace m datasets csr m jpl m gsfc m and tws m 2 3 2 climate elasticity model climate elasticity coefficients are widely used to analyse the influence of climate factors on hydrological systems chen et al 2013 li et al 2007 li et al 2020 xu et al 2014 zheng et al 2009 from the water balance perspective the water balance equation at the catchment scale is s p et r s is the water storage because there is no r outflow r 0 in the etp the water balance equation can be abbreviated as δ s p et meanwhile catchment characteristics are also important factors that affect the hydrological cycle yang et al 2007 therefore tws in the etp can be modelled as a function of climatic variables and catchment characteristics as follows 1 s f p p e t v where p precipitation and pet potential evapotranspiration represent dominant climate factors on the hydrological cycle and v is a factor that represents the integrated effects of catchment characteristics i e land use and land cover change on the hydrological cycle therefore changes in tws in the etp due to changing climate and catchment characteristics can be approximated as follows 2 δ s s p δ p s p e t δ p e t s v δ v where δ s δ p δ p e t and δ v are the changes in tws p pet and catchment characteristics respectively assuming that the land surface factors are independent of climate factors zheng et al 2009 s p δ p s p e t δ p e t is the change in tws due to climate change and s v δ v is the change in tws due to changes in catchment characteristics i e land use and land cover change here we used the method of climate elasticity to estimate the effect of climate change on tws in the etp the climate elasticity of tws is defined by the proportional change in s divided by the proportional change in a climatic variable such as p or pet x and is expressed as follows 3 ε ds s dx x where ε is the climate elasticity coefficient x denotes a climate variable p and pet and s is the tws in this study the climate elasticity coefficient estimated by the nonparametric estimator method is defined by zheng et al 2009 and is expressed as follows 4 ε x x s x i x s i s x i x 2 r x s c s c x where r x s is the correlation coefficient of x and s i is the study period 2003 2016 in this study and c s and c x are the coefficients of variation of x and s respectively the physical meaning of the climate elasticity coefficient ε is that a 1 change in the independent variables will contribute to ε in tws changes ε p and ε pet are the elasticities of tws of p and pet respectively therefore we can separate the effects of climate change and land surface changes on tws in the etp 2 3 3 component attributions of tws changes the composition of tws in the etp included lws glaciers and swe soil moisture storage groundwater and vegetation canopy water in this region the proportion of vegetation canopy water in the tws is small because vegetation is sparse thus the vegetation canopy water was neglected moreover permafrost is widespread in the endorheic zone similar to a water barrier therefore the amount of groundwater was considered to be constant in this study combined with previous studies meng et al 2019 song et al 2013 the variation of tws wtws in the instream zone can be represented as the sum of the variation of four components namely soil moisture storage wsms swe wswe glacier wglacier and lws wlws as follows 5 δ w tws δ w sms δ w lws δ w swe δ w glacier where δ wtws is the change in tws km3 yr and δ w sms δ w lws δ w swe and δ w glacier are the changes in sms wsms lws wlws swe wswe and glacial wglacier respectively therefore the contribution of each component to the change in tws can be calculated by the following equation 6 ρ δ w variables δ w tws 100 where ρ is the contribution of each component δ w sms δ w lws δ w swe and δ w glacier to the twsv δ w tws 2 3 4 trend analysis the mann kendall m k nonparametric trend test is commonly used to assess the significance of trends of meteorological and hydrological time series data gocic and trajkovic 2013 hamed and rao 1998 hirsch and slack 1984 we applied the m k nonparametric method in this study to detect trends of tws temperature p et pet soil moisture and snow depth in the etp furthermore the rate of a trend was estimated using sen s 1968 nonparametric trend estimator 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial variations of tws the changes in tws of eight grace based tws datasets of the etp from april 2002 to june 2017 showed significant phase characteristics fig 2 a including two stages namely increasing and decreasing a tipping point about occurred in august 2012 when the tws changed from increasing to decreasing fig 2a from april 2002 to august 2012 tws changes exhibited a significant increasing trend with a mean rate of increase of 0 23 0 16 gt month meanwhile tws changes showed a decreasing trend from september 2012 to june 2017 with a mean rate of decrease of 0 54 0 13 gt month the results in table 3 show that the increasing trend of tws obtained by the grace m method 0 37 gt month was faster than that obtained by the grace sh method 0 09 gt month during april 2002 august 2012 especially the jpl m data showing a rate of increase of 0 53 gt month however the decreasing trend of tws obtained from the grace sh method 0 58 gt month was faster than that obtained using the grace m method 0 47 gt month during september 2012 june 2017 especially the csr sh data showed a rate of decrease of 0 76 gt month the intra annual variation of twsa in the etp matched the intra annual variation of net precipitation p et fig 2b in march april the net precipitation reached the maximum negative anomaly level and the corresponding twsa reached the maximum negative anomaly level moreover the net precipitation in july august reached the maximum positive anomaly level and the corresponding twsa also reached the maximum positive anomaly level fig 2b shows a lag of approximately 2 3 months in the response of the twsa to the net precipitation variation meanwhile the correspondence between the twsa and net precipitation obtained by the grace sh method was better than that obtained by the grace m method fig 2c and d shows that the seasonal variation of tws m and tws sh changed from increasing to decreasing since 2012 the seasonal variation of tws exhibited a negative anomaly in winter and spring i e a decrease and a positive anomaly in summer and autumn i e an increase the multi year monthly average tws variation also showed a similar change fig s1 with a negative anomaly in january may and a positive anomaly in june december which was closely related to the variation of precipitation deng et al 2017 the ensemble mean of tws m fig 3 a1 and tws sh fig 3b1 showed an inversion of the tws change from increasing to decreasing the spatial variation of tws m and tws sh in the etp around 2012 was significant fig 3a2 and b2 shows that the tws m and tws sh in most regions increased from april 2002 to august 2012 particularly in the north eastern region 0 3 cm month and passed the significance test at the 0 01 level p 0 01 during this period tws in the southern regions decreased by 0 02 cm month to 0 04 cm month however the increase in tws m and tws sh did not continue instead both decreased after september 2012 from september 2012 to may 2017 the changes in tws showed a decrease fig 3a3 and b3 of a rate of less than 0 2 cm month p 0 01 and even 0 3 cm month in some regions only the north eastern and north western regions showed an increasing trend of tws however the increasing trend was low and did not pass the significance test at the 0 01 level p 0 01 the change in tws in the etp reversed in 2012 from increasing to decreasing this indicated that the temperature rise in the tibetan plateau affected the regional hydrological system in this context the following two aspects must be considered 1 the characteristics of changes in each tws component during the process of tws conversion from increasing to decreasing and 2 the climatic driving factors and their contribution rate to tws conversion from increasing to decreasing in the etp from the perspective of water balance 3 2 changes in tws components in the etp 3 2 1 lake water storage lake water storage lws is the main component of tws in the etp in the past three decades the area and water level of most lakes in the etp have shown an increasing trend mainly because of the increase in glacier and snow meltwater and precipitation thereby resulting in more inflow glacier and snow meltwater and rainfall runoff than outflow mainly lake surface evaporation we obtained water level data for 24 typical lakes in the etp with an observation period of approximately the first decade of the 21st century table 4 the results showed that most of the lakes 21 of the 24 showed an increase in water level and all passed the significance test at the 0 05 level p 0 05 the fastest rates of increase in lake water levels were observed in dogen co 0 66 m yr p 0 01 and ziling lake 0 67 m yr p 0 01 moreover three lakes showed a decreasing trend of water level table 4 but did not pass the significance test at the 0 05 level p 0 05 namely gozha co 0 03 m yr orba co 0 01 m yr and uru co 0 01 m yr the increase in lake level reflects an increasing trend of lws from 2002 to 2015 an increasing trend 6 4 gt yr was observed in 126 lakes with an area larger than 50 km2 in the etp lws increased by 88 gt in 2012 relative to that in 2002 in 2015 lws increased by 75 gt relative to that in 2002 which implied that the increase in lws slowed during 2012 2015 this result is consistent with those of previous studies zhang et al 2017a showed that the rate of increase in water storage in lakes 1 km2 was 9 53 gt y during 2002 2010 whereas the rate of increase in lws was only 0 99 gt yr since 2011 therefore the slight increase in lws beginning in 2011 was an important factor for changing the tws from increasing to decreasing in 2012 in the etp 3 2 2 soil moisture storage in this study we used the average soil moisture of gldas noah and gldas vic as the soil moisture storage sms of the etp and then compared the differences in soil moisture between 2002 2012 and 2012 2017 the results indicated that the soil moisture after 2012 was lower than that before in most regions of the etp the same results were also found in the era5 soil water in the etp from 2002 to 2016 fig s2 the differences in soil moisture of gldas noah between 2012 2016 and 2002 2012 exceeded 20 mm fig 4 a whereas that in the gldas vic model exceeded 40 mm fig 4b the rates of decrease in soil moisture of gldas noah and gldas vic were 3 51 mm yr p 0 01 and 7 22 mm yr p 0 01 respectively meanwhile soil temperature warming was significant exceeding 0 2 c yr p 0 01 fig 4c and d the soil temperature anomaly shifted from negative to positive in 2006 and the soil moisture anomaly correspondingly shifted from positive to negative in 2006 soil moisture increased slightly during 2002 2006 whereas it rapidly decreased after 2006 fig 4c and d therefore the increase in soil temperature under regional warming is an important reason for the decrease in soil moisture in the etp the soil moisture in the etp during 2002 2012 was 517 58 mm whereas it was only 477 10 mm in 2012 2016 thereby showing a decrease of 40 mm table 5 the soil moisture decreased in the etp from 2002 to 2012 at a rate of 4 67 mm yr p 0 01 whereas it decreased at a rate of 7 42 mm yr p 0 05 from 2012 to 2016 3 2 3 glaciers and swe glaciers and swe are the main components of solid water reserves in the tibetan plateau glaciers and snow ablation are important water resources for lake expansion in the etp since 2000 the snowfall rate snow p has decreased in the etp thereby indicating that the proportion of snowfall in p has decreased fig 5 a shows a 10 decrease in snowfall from 72 in 2000 2004 to 62 in 2008 2017 meanwhile the swe showed a decrease from 2002 to 2017 at a rate of 1 21 mm yr p 0 05 moreover the rate of decrease in swe was 2 3 mm yr p 0 01 from 2002 to 2012 whereas it was 1 74 mm yr insignificant at p greater than 0 05 from 2012 to 2017 fig 5c also shows a decrease in snow depth from 2002 to 2017 0 2 mm yr p 0 05 the glacier retreat rate in the etp is slower than that in the himalayan region yao et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b there is no direct hydrological connection between the endorheic basin and the outside and the melting of glaciers and snow is only a change of state from solid to liquid the water from which flows into the soil and lakes thereby replenishing the soil water and lake water therefore from the perspective of the gravity satellite observation principle and the hydrological cycle melting glaciers and snow in the etp will not directly cause changes in the total regional water storage the amount of water lost from glaciers and snow ablation due to evaporation will negatively impact the regional water storage therefore from the perspective of tws components the change in the increase or decrease in tws in the etp is essentially determined by the relationship between sms and lws table 6 from 2002 to 2012 the rate of increase in tws was 2 81 gt yr of which the rate of increase in lws was 7 98 gt yr the rate of decrease in sms was 3 41 gt yr and the rate of decrease in glacier and swe was approximately 1 76 gt yr thus the increase in lws in this period offset the decrease in other water storage components and thus the tws in the whole region showed an increasing trend from 2012 to 2016 the rate of decrease in tws was 6 48 gt yr of which the rate of increase in lws was 0 99 gt yr the rate of decrease in sms was 5 33 gt yr and the rate of decrease in glacier and swe was approximately 2 14 gt yr therefore the decrease in sms during this period offset the slight increase in lws and thus the tws in the whole region decreased this indicated that the shift from an increase to a decrease in tws in this region in 2012 was due to the shift from a rapid increase to a weak increase or a weak decrease in the lws components and the continuous decrease in sms 3 3 quantitative impacts of climate change on tws changes in the etp the variation of tws in the etp is closely related to the relationship between p and et et is the depletion term for the water balance in the region figure s3 shows that et is water limited in the etp and the annual pet is approximately 100 mm greater than the annual p in this region although the annual p is insufficient to meet the pet of etp there are many lakes with larger water storage capacity zhang et al 2017b the lake surface is a free water surface and with an increase in pet lake surface et will also increase from 2003 to 2016 tws was positively correlated with p r 0 27 and negatively correlated with pet r 0 47 in the etp using equation 4 and table 7 we determined the p elasticity of tws was 7 94 whereas the pet elasticity of tws was 39 83 this indicated that p positively affected tws change whereas pet change was negatively affected this also indicated that tws changes in the etp were more sensitive to the response of pet the increase in pet under regional warming will increase lake et which will reduce tws based on the inversion of the tws change in 2012 in the etp the study period was divided into two phases before and after 2012 tws changes exhibited a significant trend of 8 94 mm yr p 0 01 since 2012 the regional mean p in table 8 showed an overall decrease during 2013 2016 compared with that during 2003 2012 whereas the regional mean pet increased during 2013 2016 compared with that during 2003 2012 furthermore the p and pet elasticity coefficients of tws change were 7 94 and 39 83 respectively therefore compared with that during 2003 2012 the average p during 2013 2016 decreased by 2 3 mm 0 84 accounting for 6 67 0 61 mm yr of the decrease in tws 9 12 mm yr during 2003 2016 in the etp the pet increased by approximately 8 5 mm 2 26 accounting for 90 02 8 21 mm yr of the decrease in tws during 2012 2016 thus the comprehensive impacts of both p and pet totalled a 8 82 mm yr decrease in tws during 2012 2016 which accounted for 96 69 of tws reduction land surface change i e vegetation change was estimated to have resulted in a 0 30 mm yr decrease in tws accounting for 3 31 of the tws change therefore the results indicated that climate change plays a more important role than land surface change in the change in tws in the etp the decomposition of tws in the etp based on the empirical orthogonal function eof method showed that the cumulative variance demonstrated by the first and second modes was greater than 85 fig 6 a the first mode eof 1 reflected the change in tws components fig 6b which was closely related to the change in lws r 0 97 p 0 01 whereas the second mode eof 2 reflected the loss term of tws which had a correlation coefficient of 0 78 p 0 01 with pet fig 6c et represents the loss term of tws in this region and pet indicates the evaporation capacity therefore the duration of this inversion depends on the relationship between p and pet 4 discussion temperature and precipitation have increased in the tibetan plateau under global warming since the mid 20th century there is spatial variation of temperature in the tibetan plateau the heating rate in the northern parts is faster than that in other regions of the tibetan plateau guo and wang 2012 moreover the heating rate increases with elevation pepin et al 2015 pepin et al 2019 mainly because of glaciers and snow ablation thereby causing a decrease in surface albedo over the last half century p changes on the qinghai tibet plateau included two aspects namely an increase in p 1 4 mm yr deng et al 2017 and a shift in p from snowfall to rainfall fig 5a significant temperature warming and increased p in the tibetan plateau have exacerbated the uncertainty of the processes in the regional hydrological cycle yao et al 2019a b the glaciers on the tibetan plateau are sensitive to temperature rise and are undergoing an overall retreat in the last 50 years glacier changes on the tibetan plateau have occurred in negative mass balance yao et al 2019a b and have continued to decline particularly since the 1990s the glacial area on the tibetan plateau decreased 0 24 0 03 m yr from 2003 to 2009 and the meltwater volume was approximately 14 86 11 8 gt yr neckel et al 2014 the total glacial area in the etp was 7039 km2 accounting for 7 4 of the entire glacial area of the tibetan plateau and the retreat rate of the glacial area was within 0 3 yr wang et al 2019 the retreat rate after 2000 was faster than that before 2000 wang et al 2019 xiong et al 2019 furthermore the rate of glacial area retreat and mass balance loss decreased from the south eastern part to the etp wang et al 2019 snow cover changes have shown that the onset of snowmelt occurs earlier xiong et al 2019 and snow cover periods and snow depths have decreased on the tibetan plateau che et al 2019 in particular after 2000 the snow cover duration was significantly shorter 2 d yr and the snow depth decreased approximately 0 2 cm yr to 0 1 cm yr che et al 2019 perennial permafrost on the tibetan plateau undergoes degradation cheng et al 2019 zhang 2012 thereby significantly affecting the regional climate and hydrological and ecological processes zhao et al 2019 however owing to the extreme scarcity of meteorological observation stations in the tibetan plateau the assessment of permafrost changes in the tibetan plateau is uncertain glaciers and snow ablation reduce the surface albedo which increases the absorption of solar radiation and accelerates the temperature rise in the etp thereby affecting hydrological processes and water resource changes deng et al 2019 the lake water volume change stage resulted in a distinct stage in the change in tws from 1970 to 2018 the lake area across the tibetan plateau increased to 5 0 104 km2 an increase of 25 4 the number of lakes larger than 1 km2 was 1424 in 2018 zhang et al 2019a b which was the main form of liquid water reserves in the region the number of lakes with areas larger than 1 km2 in the endorheic zone was 748 in 2014 reaching an area of 3 3 104 km2 thereby representing an increase of 28 from that in the 1960s wan et al 2016 most of the lakes 80 on the tibetan plateau have expanded zhu et al 2019 with phased characteristics exhibiting a faster increase from 2001 to 2010 and a slower increase from 2011 to 2016 this is consistent with the changes in tws in the etp for example in selincuo lake lake no 24 in fig 1 the average annual rate of increase was 0 38 m yr during 1979 2017 and 0 67 0 093 m yr during 2000 2012 and the lake area increased by 43 3 guo et al 2019 changes in lake area and water volume are closely related to meteorological factors temperature p and pet yang et al 2017a b the increase in p since 2000 is an important reason for the increase in lws zhu et al 2019 furthermore the decrease in p and increase in pet after 2010 led to a slight increase in the lws in the region thereby resulting in a change in the tws in the etp from increasing to decreasing in 2012 the continuous reduction of sms under global warming is an important reason for the change in tws from increasing to decreasing in the etp owing to permafrost degradation in the etp the role of sms changes in tws has been increasing the perennial temperature of the tibetan plateau is below 0 c the soil moisture freezes to form ground ice which is a perennial permafrost zone with an area of 106 104 km2 it is an integral part of the tws in the tibetan plateau zhao et al 2010 the rate of temperature rise in the permafrost layer was faster than that in the surface layer for example the average rate of increase in the ground temperature at 6 m at 10 monitoring sites along the qinghai tibet highway was approximately 0 39 c decade wu and zhang 2008 whereas the average rate of temperature increase at 10 m was approximately 0 15 c decade zhao et al 2019 permafrost degradation causes an increase in the active layer ding et al 2019 guo and wang 2012 and meltwater of approximately 8 gt yr zhao et al 2019 thereby accounting for 12 of the increase in lws zhang et al 2017b permafrost degradation with increased soil moisture infiltration reduces surface sms zhao et al 2019 which is consistent with the results of this study a large part of the uncertainty arises from data uncertainty the lack of observation sites is the main limiting factor for the accurate analysis of the water storage change characteristics in the etp the application of cru era gpcc and other grid data is often inaccurate and compared with the previous data set the cn05 dataset based on the station data has been improved in this study however there is a certain gap in this data remote sensing data are an excellent supplement to the lack of ground observation sites in this region particularly the high resolution remote sensing images in recent years which provide data for the study of soil moisture glaciers snow and lakes on the tibetan plateau however remote sensing data lack ground observation data for the assessment of uncertainty there is considerable uncertainty in the soil moisture data for the etp the thickness of the soil aquifer increased as the active layer of permafrost deepened which increased the uncertainty of the soil moisture simulation dataset therefore increasing surface observations and fusing multi source data could reduce uncertainty and improve accuracy tws in the etp has decreased since 2012 however the duration of this trend and whether it is a temporary or permanent decrease remain unclear therefore the next step of our research should combine further observations and data from multiple sources for a more comprehensive study 5 conclusions in this study detailed analyses of the component changes and driving factors of the changes in the tws trend in the etp in 2012 were conducted based on the grace based tws and climate data the main conclusions are as follows tws in the etp exhibited an increasing trend 0 23 0 16 gt month from april 2002 to august 2012 whereas it showed a decreasing trend 0 54 0 13 gt month from september 2012 to june 2017 moreover the seasonality of tws changes in the etp was closely related to the seasonal distribution of net precipitation when less p occurred during winter and spring tws showed a negative anomaly tws decreased during summer and autumn with increased p tws exhibited a positive anomaly tws increased both sms and lws changes influenced the characteristics of tws changes in the region during 2002 2012 the rate of increase in tws was 2 81 gt yr of which the increase in lws was 7 98 gt yr decrease in sms was 3 32 gt yr and decrease in glacier and swe was approximately 1 85 gt yr thus the increase in lws during this period offset the decrease in other water storage components which led to an increase in the tws of the entire region during 2012 2016 the rate of decrease in tws was 6 48 gt yr of which lws slightly increased by 0 99 gt yr sms decreased by 5 27 gt yr and glacier and swe decreased by approximately 2 20 gt yr from a water balance perspective the increase in pet was the main factor driving the change in tws from an increase to a decrease in 2012 the elasticity coefficients of p and pet were 7 94 and 39 83 respectively this indicated that p had a positive effect on tws whereas pet had negative effects compared with that during 2003 2012 the annual average p decreased by 2 3 mm 0 84 during 2012 2016 which contributed to a 7 change in tws from an increase to a decrease in the etp the pet increased by approximately 8 5 mm 2 26 accounting for 90 of the change in tws from increasing to decreasing the variation of land surface features mainly the vegetation index accounting for 3 of the tws changed from increasing to decreasing credit authorship contribution statement haijun deng conceptualization methodology
