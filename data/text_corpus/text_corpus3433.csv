17165,an australian water utility has developed a legionella high level risk assessment lhlra which provides a semi qualitative assessment of the risk of legionella proliferation and human exposure in engineered water systems using a combination of empirical observation and expert knowledge expanding on this lhlra we propose two iterative bayesian network bn models to reduce uncertainty and allow for a probabilistic representation of the mechanistic interaction of the variables built using data from 25 groundwater treatment plants the risk of legionella exposure in groundwater aeration units was quantified as a function of five critical areas including hydraulic conditions nutrient availability and growth water quality system design and maintenance and location and access first the mechanistic relationship of the variables was conceptually mapped into a fishbone diagram parameterised deterministically using an expert elicited weighted scoring system and translated into bn the sensitivity to findings analysis of the bn indicated that system design was the most influential variable while elemental accumulation thresholds were the least influential variable for legionella exposure the diagnostic inference was used in high and low risk scenarios to demonstrate the capabilities of the bns to examine probable causes for diverse conditions subsequently the causal relationship of legionella growth and human exposure were improved through a conceptual bowtie representation finally an improved model developed the predictors of legionella growth and the risk of human exposure through the interaction of operational water quality monitoring operational parameters and asset conditions the use of bns modelling based on risk estimation and improved functional decision outputs offer a complementary and more transparent alternative approach to quantitative analysis of uncertainties than the current lhlra graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords risk assessment groundwater drinking water water safety plan pathogens 1 introduction 1 1 managing the risk of legionella in water systems managing the public health burden of the presence of legionella pneumophila in air and water handling systems such as faucets showers and cooling towers continues to undergo extensive research yet assessing the risk of this pathogen within urbanised and industrial settings is still challenged by limited ecological and aetiological knowledge and understanding buse et al 2012 the bacterium is benign in the natural environment or when present in biofilms on surfaces including pipes in water systems however sloughing can result in the formation of aerosols which may be inhaled and cause serious infection or death despite rising cases of legionnaires disease as well as increasing frequency of unusual clustered outbreaks macintyre et al 2018 preventive efforts to date have focused mainly on water systems in buildings cline et al 2020 lechevallier 2019 similar concerns on legionella colonisation have been raised in the context of engineered aeration systems commonly used to treat groundwater for potable uses the increased water age and the presence of algal deposits sludge or nutrients make these systems niche habitat for legionella growth rakić and štambuk giljanović 2016 this risk is exacerbated in hot climates where system components such as spray and tray aerators present suitable environments for legionella growth in biofilms with the potential for sloughing aerosolisation and aspiration prussin et al 2017 van heijnsbergen et al 2015 it is estimated that this vector for exposure to legionella is overlooked significantly under recognised and potentially presents a high risk to treatment plant operators and the local communities zappia 2015 currently there are no specific standards for managing health risks associated with the occurrence of legionella pathogens in drinking water treatment processes nhmrc national health and medical research council 2011 u s environmental protection agency 1989 european commission 2018 the traditional hazard identification and risk assessment hidra was employed to assess the risk of legionella this technique sits within the spectrum of the broader microbial risk framework for water utilities as it is able to identify hazards assess likelihoods and consequences fitzgerald et al 2018 who 2016 1 2 current strategy for legionella risk assessment in a major step towards a risk based approach water corporation of western australia wcwa performed a legionella high level risk assessment lhlra that defines the five critical risk areas including hydraulic conditions nutrients availability and growth water quality system design and maintenance and location and access using empirical observation and expert knowledge bradley 2017 the classifications of the states of the shortlisted risk variables were based on industry process control points and regulatory criteria commonly applied to water quality governance i e aesthetic pathogen especially legionella hpc 22 c and 37 c and total coliforms as well as assets conditions australian new zealand standard 2007 australian new zealand standard 2011 nhmrc national health and medical research council 2011 department of commerce code of practice 2010 the shortlisted dependant and interacting variables were assigned weighted scores and the resultant risk levels in each of the areas were determined through ordinary linear combination mackenzie 2014 the lhlra tool requires the user to select from qualitative statements and or to provide quantitative data concerning the relevant factors the assessment converts the qualitative quantitative inputs into numerical values and percentages using simple calculations linkov et al 2009 so far the results have been successfully used to build a knowledge base and to make informed decisions about the conditions of the assets prioritise minor and major capital work plan and determine appropriate mitigative and remedial actions 1 3 limits of lhlra under high uncertainty the current practice using lhlra has systematically assembled weighted and assessed the multiple factors believed to promote the risk of legionella in support of improved decision making however this approach to risk assessment has been historically criticised to be subjective lacking in transparency and reproducibility resulting in risk estimates without quantified uncertainties linkov et al 2009 as such methods that are likely to be more successful at assessing the complex interactions between variables and improve the understanding of legionella risk are being explored cox et al 2005 linkov et al 2009 the introduction of international standard iso 31 000 2009 has expanded the risk management framework provided more robust tools and broadened its applicability across all industries as nzs iso 31000 2009 recently more comprehensive approaches have been employed in the water industry including bowtie diagram fault tree event tree analysis lindhe et al 2012 and bayesian networks bns trinh et al 2017 of the available techniques stochastic approaches to risk modelling are preferred because of their probabilistic nature that accounts for the elements of uncertainties ross and sumner 2002 particularly bns have become increasingly popular for modelling conditions with a high degree of uncertainty and complexity such as in ecological systems and water management bertone et al 2016 moe et al 2020 wijesiri et al 2018 the advanced features of bns have been explored to successfully improve microbial risk modelling of giardia lamblia and cryptosporidium parvum carvajal et al 2015 as well as faecal coliforms and escherichia coli panidhapu et al 2020 hence there is the opportunity to use bns to document and quantify belief system surrounding the mechanistic relation of risk factors that are considered to contribute to the potential exposure to legionella in groundwater aeration units the concept of bns offer an alternative approach for relating the risk of legionella exposure with the critical variables and incorporate parameters of uncertainty and variability besides bns offer a convenient means for performing scenario exploration and inference as well as the prediction of legionella exposure under diverse conditions a bn structure is defined by graphical nodes with the relationship between variables specified using arcs the variables are presented as child nodes which have input connections from other nodes known as parents nodes the strength of relationship between a child and its parent node s is quantified through conditional probability distributions with one probability for each combination of possible states of the parents these probabilities are defined in the conditional probability tables cpts for each child node the cpt of each node captures the associated uncertainty i e the higher the uncertainty the wider the probability distribution the applicability of bns to environmental risk assessment has been considered extensively but the practice is still challenged by various conceptual and practical issues benvenuto et al 2020 common challenges include poor representation of relationship between variables driven by the limited understanding of complex environmental systems and weak or lack of robust model validation due to the absent of large empirical datasets kaikkonen et al 2020 landis 2020 in this study we assessed the capabilities of bns as a quantitative tool to better capture the implications of reasoning along the current management paradigm and to move beyond qualitative risk assessment first we extend and directly map the basic mechanistic understanding of the system regarding causality into a bn the strength and causal relationships between variables were determined through scenario exploration and sensitivity analysis subsequently we invest in improving the existing causal relationship of legionella proliferation and human exposure through a conceptual map using bowtie principles khakzad et al 2013 li et al 2016 next the revised model developed the predictors of legionella growth and the risk of human exposure through the interaction of operational water quality monitoring and asset conditions and the predictive ability was explicitly tested 2 development of the bn models the stepwise approach for developing the bns are summarised in fig 1 detailing the sources of data and techniques employed in the conceptual modelling as well as the subsequent translation into bns operational parameters and water quality data were collected from 25 groundwater treatment plants gwtps in western australia as summarised in table 3 the existing basic mechanistic understanding of the system regarding causality defined in lhlra was considered in the model the relations and interconnections between the variables were primarily set based on expert knowledge table 1 summarises common terminology acronyms and abbreviations 2 1 project scoping and conceptual modelling a tier wise approach to bn modelling was adopted marcot et al 2006 this approach includes 1 creating conceptual diagrams of key factors affecting the outcome of interest 2 mapping the conceptual diagram into the initial alpha level bn model 3 revising the model after expert review testing and calibrating to create the beta level model and 4 updating the structure and conditional probabilities with new validation data to create the final application gamma level model marcot et al 2006 in a first step the processes and dependencies of the variables in the five critically defined risk areas were mapped into a conceptual diagram using a fishbone analysis as outlined in luo et al 2018 in an attempt to convert the lhlra risk assessment into bns that allow for direct comparison of inputs and outputs all relationship between the variables were initially considered as potentially causal an instantiated legionella exposure variable that combines the scores accrued from the five different areas was created the output conceptual map with the basic mechanistic relationship was directly mapped into the first alpha level bn representing input and output variables subsequently the structure of the initial bns was revised through an expert workshop comprising academics microbiologist and water treatment plant operators using bowtie principle the expert review improves the causality pathway defined in basic mechanistic understanding bowtie analyses have been successful as conceptual maps for bns khakzad et al 2013 li et al 2016 in its traditional representation the left hand side includes a list of potential hazards leading through different pathways to a specific top critical event legionella colonisation whilst the right hand side includes the different consequences of such event the improved relationship was based on bowtie principles and conceptually mapped using bowtie analysis software bowtiexp cge risk management solutions 2020 the revised beta level bns model was then built based on the modified causality relationship defined by the new conceptual map 2 2 model parameters discretisation and learning the summative scores in each of the five critically defined areas and the legionella exposure variable was categorised through a uniform distribution into three ranking schemes intervals to represent low medium and high risk levels the low range indicates the contributing factors are present in states that result in a minimal risk the medium level represents the threshold of potential concern and the high range indicates the variables are present in a state that pose an unacceptable risk level brien et al 2017 from operational standpoint the minimum risk required no action from the plant operator medium threshold require the review and close monitoring of operational parameters and the high state represent the point for intermediate management intervention for the legionella exposure variable a low state requires no mitigative action the medium state prompts the review of operational parameters and the high state calls for immediate decontamination as nzs 3666 the description of discretisation style for all the risk factors that translated as input variables for the initial and revised models based on the weighted scores are provided in the supplementary data supplementary materials a table s1 the prior probability distributions for the root nodes in the water quality and nutrient availability and growth variables were defined using historical data sourced from the gwtps while hydraulic conditions system design and location and access were captured from lhlra records and statistical considerations utilised for variables with missing records beaudequin et al 2016 several practical ways in which cpt values can be established in the initial alpha level bns have been outlined marcot et al 2007 the expert elicited scores were set to deterministic value and filled as cpts for the bns a deterministic bn has conditional probability distributions as kronecker or dirac delta functions baldi and rosen zvi 2005 barber 2003 this implies that only one occurrence of a possible combination is represented when the relationships between parents and child variables are arranged in a tabular format in one row per dataset the complete deterministic cpts used in the models are available on request the bnmodels were developed with the software netica 5 18 norsys 2015 2 3 model evaluation and validation the bn models were evaluated through sensitivity scenario analyses and validated through different performance metric including prediction accuracy and cohen kappa coefficient sensitivity analyses were performed on the initial and revised bns to identify the variables that are most influential on the risk of legionella scenario testing was performed on the initial model to understand the triggers of the different risk levels and model behaviour on the revised model the validation option testing the net using cases was employed to grade the bns predictions against the actual outcome norsys 2015 a recent independent dataset from the lhlra assessment of 23 plants was compiled and the observed states of the input variables were tested as net cases in order to evaluate the agreement between predicted and observed outcome performance accuracy as well as error rates were calculated for false positives type i error rejecting a true hypothesis i e failing to correctly identify positive cases and false negatives type ii error failing to reject a false hypothesis i e falsely identifying negative cases as positive othman and al hamadi 2018 in addition performance metrics like cohen s kappa prevalence index and bias effect were computed to assess the symmetry of the validation datasets 3 results and discussions 3 1 conceptual model and input variables the shortlisted variables and the relative contribution of the five different critical areas to the risk of legionella exposure is summarised in table 2 the summative scores from the different risk areas differ significantly while the hydraulic conditions factor had the lowest score accounting for 11 of the total contribution to risk both nutrients availability and growth and location and access also featured small contributions on the other end of the spectrum water quality was identified as a major contributor to risk 35 the fishbone diagram fd illustrating the interactions of input variables and the integrated risk of legionella in the system is presented in fig 2 the systematic integration of different risk areas established a clear structural endpoint variable for an easy bns modelling of uncertainties in the system luo et al 2018 pollino and henderson 2010 subsequently the illustrated potential causal connections establishing functional relationship from the fd were retained as a conceptual map and developed into the initial bns model table 3 summarises water quality data sourced from 25 gwtps utilised for deriving prior probabilities for the nutrients availability and growth and the water quality variables the average temperature was 24 c ranging from 14 to 34 c and representative of hot dry climates legionella counts were a qualitative indication of the presence and absence of the pathogenic bacteria with limits of 10 cfu ml and 10 cfu ml respectively subsequently the graphical representation of causal connectionsamongst variables in the conceptual fd and discretised variables were converted to a bns 3 2 model development and analysis 3 2 1 initial model output the initial output bn model is presented in fig 3 in a labelled bar style with colour coding created to categorise variables into distinct groups in line with good bns practice marcot 2017 the five risk areas orange primary and immediate risk factors tan and endpoint point variable represented as the legionella exposure cyan the model consisted of 42 nodes 43 links and 9461 conditional probabilities of the 42 nodes 33 were inputs variables supplementary materials a figure s1 the prior distributions of parent nodes captured through the bn provided a posterior probability estimate of the risk parameters the bn model in its simplest form without inputs of observed evidence depicts the marginal probability distributions for each state in all the nodes as summarised in table 4 this display is a visual representation of potential causality between the nodes leading to the risk of legionella exposure while the relationships between variables in bn are not necessarily by definition causal the graphical portion has been useful for representing presumably causal understanding carriger and parker 2021 the distribution probabilities across the states tends to exhibit a normality pattern the conditional probabilities tend towards the medium states in the five risk areas as seen with the high probability values the distribution for the end variable legionella exposure tends to be skewed to medium and high risk accounting for over 99 the explicit visualisation of the interactions between variables enabled the exploration of model behaviour and interrogation of the reasoning behind the model output thus providing a more transparent approach as compared to the lhlra this is not the case with most traditional forecasting methods like the lhlra going a step forward by inputting findings into the nodes i e setting evidence the bns can update the prior probabilities in the model to propagate new posterior probabilities based on the structural relationships and the conditional probabilities with this feature we can analyse the effects of different scenarios on the model variables pollino et al 2007 3 2 2 scenario assessment a scenario assessment is a bns feature that helps to clearly understand the characteristics of each variable and its relationship with others in the model one of the advantages of bns is the ability to perform predictive forward and diagnostic backward inferences two diagnostic scenarios were developed to illustrate the capability of the model to examine the probabilities of factors that would result in a high and low risk of legionella exposure by applying a backward diagnostic inference all the way to the top parents the original triggers for risk scenario can be assessed in these scenarios a high state was selected set as hard evidence in the legionella exposure node setting the probability to 100 with the same procedure repeated for the low and the probabilities for all the nodes were examined fig 4 summarises the estimated occurrence probabilities of the worst states of the variables across all the nodes by worst we refer to the probability of delivering the state of a given variable with the most impact on the risk of legionella exposure the five risk areas are all likely to be in the worst state high under the high scenarios it is also obvious that the chance of worst states occurring is greater in the high risk scenario for all the variables except for the hydraulic runtime node for high risk of legionella exposure the five risk areas appeared with dominant probabilities in the worst states nutrient availability and growth 0 72 hydraulic conditions 0 70 water quality 0 68 location and access 0 60 and system design 0 57 while in the low risk scenario only the proximity of other sources of cross contamination has up to 50 chance of being in the worst case these predictions are expected because high risk of legionella exposure is generally the product of worst conditions present in the different individual variables this implies that monitoring nutrient availability hydraulic conditions and water quality will be a reasonable surveillance approach to detect elevated risk in the system fig 4 this agrees with both lhlra and standards for legionella managing in other systems as nzs 3666 4276 these dynamic responses of bns through the demonstration of the interaction of the different variables with observed evidence set them aside from other models while scenario assessment provided system interaction in a very transparent manner the approach is not able to rank the contribution of each of the variables to the overall risk in this modelling software but through sensitivity analysis we can begin to identify which variables in the model have the greatest impact on the model endpoints as well as the order of importance strength and relevance of the inputs in determining the variation in the output 3 2 3 sensitivity analysis an analysis of sensitivity to findings was performed on the endpoint variable legionella exposure in the bn to identify the most important variables in the system the sensitivity analysis ordered quantitatively the degree of variance reduction vr or uncertainty entropy associated with input variables in a specified outcome chen and pollino 2012 pollino and henderson 2010 as shown in fig 5 the system design the potential of the aeration system to release contaminated aerosols is the variable with the most influence 0 225 followed by the location and access the height and duration of exposure as a result access to the aerator environment 0 166 legionella occurrence in the aerosols 0 097 and susceptibility of the systems to windblown contamination 0 073 unsurprisingly the nodes with the greatest impacts are the risk areas this is expected as the risk areas are intermediate i e neither root nor leaf nodes that represent multiple risk factors of the primary root nodes legionella occurrence in aerosol has the most significant impact this could be attributed to the expert weighted score influenced by risk aversion this behaviour in the model demonstrates a reasonable representation of the interactions between input and output variables that aligns with experts understanding of the risk of legionella exposure the complete summary of the sensitivity analysis data is provided in the supplementary materials a table s2 although temperature is expected to have a significant influence on legionella exposure the current analysis showed a minimal impact 0 01 rakić and štambuk giljanović 2016 this suggests possible deficiencies in the relationship between variables adopted as causality from the lhlra to be mostly correlational and resulted in too many cpts 9461 where cpts are higher than the number of samples available particularly with respect to endpoints like legionella exposure for model evaluation the accuracy of how well the model represents the system can be poorly assessed pollino and henderson 2010 in the current adaptation the model has a deep structure with many intermediate 10 and primary 19 nodes which can facilitate more propagation of uncertainties from input to output nodes equally the asymmetric structure of the model can contribute to making distant input nodes with many intervening nodes less sensitive marcot et al 2006 good practice recommends the depth of model the number of layers of nodes be kept relatively shallow four or fewer if possible to create minimal associated cpts that are tractable and understandable when specified by the experts marcot et al 2006 collectively these findings suggest the need for a relatively shallow depth model in the revised beta iteration breaking up multifaceted systems into two or more model networks is recommended as a good approach to increase accuracy and assemble diverse variables in a coherent and systematic environment with moderate depth marcot et al 2006 3 3 revised bn models 3 3 1 modifying the model causal structure the experts driven workshop facilitated a conceptual map describing the potential causes and consequences of legionella colonisation an improvement on the causality relationships from the alpha model the output conceptual map from the bowtie representation is shown in fig 6 the conceptual map reveals the consequences of legionella colonisation to include public health exposure and contamination of water supply the contamination of water supply was not modelled due to the multiple treatment barriers in the water system train that is considered sufficient to inactivate the pathogen the improved diagram provides a simplified and better overview of the mechanistic dependencies in the model allowing for the selection of causally linked influence for the growth and exposure separately getz et al 2018 the output map becomes the foundational framework for the revised bns model to avoid the complexity pitfall from the initial bns model the divide and conquer modelling approach was adopted mcdonald et al 2016 hence the legionella growth and transmission scenarios were modelled into two sub models deconstructing the problem into a more elemental component that can be modelled more easily 3 3 2 legionella growth model fig 7 shows the legionella growth sub model i e a mapping of the left hand side of the conceptual diagram the endpoint of this model is legionella bacteria presence with modified states of detected and not detected cyan coloured the modifications of the target node to the qualitative thresholds were made to represent realistic and more interpretable divisions three of the critically defined risk areas orange coloured are captured in the growth sub model the probability distribution on the legionella bacteria nodes is 78 9 and 21 3 for detected and not detected respectively suggesting the current weighting is skewed towards positive detection the new endpoint variable is an observable and measurable parameter in contrast to the legionella exposure in the initial model this provides the illustration of causal links between legionella bacteria and predictor variables the sensitivity analysis related to this specific growth model revealed water quality 0 205 nutrient availability and growth 0 127 and hydraulic conditions 0 126 as the three variables with the most impact on the detection of legionella fig 8 the quantifiable and observable nature of the output legionella bacteria node allows to evaluate the model performance marcot 2012 3 3 3 performance evaluation of the growth sub model performance validation is a crucial step for evaluating the prediction and success rate of models marcot 2012 the process of model validation assesses the quality of the model prediction under independent conditions using data not previously applied in the bnsconstruction ideally when the data set is large enough the k fold cross validation approach that splits the data into two folds one for training and the other for validation is recommended marcot 2012 constrained by the sparse data considered in this study relative to the complex process and model the total model historical records from the lhlra were utilised in the model learning this validation of the model provides an assessment of the accuracy of bns predictions comparing the state with the highest predicted probability to the observed outcomes as summarised in table 5 for the 23 sites the model incorrectly predicted the status legionella not detected as the more likely option in the three observations of legionella detection type i error true positive rate of 0 but correctly predicted non detected scenarios in 18 out of 20 cases true negative rate of 88 cumulating into a model error rate of 21 these results suggested a highly imbalanced dataset the kappa coefficient was k was negative signifying an apparent lack of agreement between the predicted and observed legionella occurrence outcomes the prevalence index of 0 78 confirmed the existence of prevalence effect as evident in the different proportion of agreements for the detected and not detected classification of legionella occurrence the bias indexes of 0 7 and 0 13 disagreement for the detected and not detected class also confirmed the very asymmetrical dataset the significant prevalence and bias effect in the datasets can reduce the expected prediction to random and subsequently a weak agreement in the outcomes byrt et al 1993 sim and wright 2005 the certainty of the causal relationship and difficulty in species detectability have been listed as the main contributors of model error in environmental modelling mackenzie et al 2003 the current system understanding that translated into the mechanistic models are likely to be correlational and not necessarily causal as revealed in the error rate marcot et al 2006 equally the trivial detection of legionella counts in the sampling reference data can be a limitation to the reliability of the validation complicating the distinction of randomness and the power of the model to make useful prediction for legionella at the current stage of the iteration with no true positives predicted for legionella and the highly imbalanced datasets the model accuracy metric is expected to be a poor performance indicator marcot et al 2006 given the weakness of the model accuracy indicators the sensitivity analysis was used to interpret the ultimate behaviour of the current relationships in the model the sensitivity analysis classification of key influential variables suggested the need for further structural revision before advancing the model towards implementation for example the impact of temperature on legionella exposure was found to be insignificant while expected to be of major influence particularly it will be critical to examine the distinction between relationships that are causal and correlational in future studies therefore the acquisition of more empirical data through more frequent legionella sampling is recommended this will allow further structural learning and training of the model with a larger pool and more diverse input data in manner that increase certainty and prioritise causality relationship 3 3 4 legionella transmission modelling human health exposure to understand the impact of legionella growth the right side of the conceptual map was modelled for the risk of human exposure leading to infection the risk of infection is defined by the legionella bacteria as well as two critically defined risk areas of location and access to the system and system design fig 9 the sub model was evaluated through sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis of the exposure model revealed two most impactful variables as legionella counts as expected 0 958 and frequency of employee access 0 241 this result was expected as infection strongly depends on the concentration in the system pepper and gerba 2018 the difference in the output format of the lhlra and the bn model made it difficult for direct comparison however the two approaches can be interpreted in a complementary manner while both models are built based on expert judgement and intended for prediction purposes only the bns allow for testing of the reliability and accuracy of the belief structure or theory that define the relationships through the sensitivity analysis unlike the growth sub model the endpoint of the transmission modelling legionella exposure is categorical low medium and high and with no measurable and or observable records making validation difficult however the bn probability distributions on legionella exposure provided estimate of the chance of occurrence of the different risk levels despite the trivial count occasionally captured in the monitoring program and no records of legionella outbreak in the gwtps the baseline probability distributions in the refined model showed a skewness towards the high risk scenario with over 50 chance of high risk level yunana et al 2019 3 4 towards better risk assessment despite advances in standard management frameworks managing the risk of legionella colonisation of water systems still presents important challenges as demonstrated in this study using synergies between complementary techniques can advance mechanistic understanding and predictive performance that paves the way towards achieving improved and more comprehensible risk assessment particularly iterative bns modelling demonstrates the capability for a more transparent structured and quantitative approach to assessing the risk of legionella exposure uusitalo et al 2015 to be useful for environmental management model outputs must be aligned with stakeholders objectives hence retention of the bns structure from the causal connections and functional relationships amongst variables from the lhlra while the approach allowed simple model development a number of limitations can be identified firstly the cpts are deterministic providing a single point estimate of individual risk as scored in the lhlra in the deterministic estimate the outputs of the variables are fully determined by the parameter and the initial values which is not a satisfactory representation for complex systems like the risk of legionella exposure generally eliciting expert knowledge deterministically has been criticised as being vague ambiguous and susceptible to inconsistent judgements gregory and keeney 2017 hemming et al 2018 therefore to better model legionella interaction with multiple variables capture uncertainties and inherent variabilities a probabilistic model that provides the distribution of estimated risks and not a single point estimate is recommended chen and pollino 2012 richardson 1996 the probabilistic approach to expert elicitation as outlined in hemming et al 2018 has the capability to improve consistency in defining the strength of relations between variables such as those presented in the lhlra hemming et al 2018 secondly the definitions and classifications of certain variables were appropriate for the lhlra but tend to increase the model complexity when translated into the bns for example the five risk areas adapted from the lhlra are all latent and derived from the interrelations of immediate parameters translating such relations into bns can greatly reduce the classification accuracy explanatory power and the possibility of quantitative validation of the model marcot 2012 however the revised model better refined the endpoint node to focus on the observable and testable variable of legionella presence contrary to the lhlra the bns through the sensitivity analysis scenarios assessments and evaluation of prediction accuracy provided systematic evaluation and complementary insights into the structure and the relative importance of input variables linkov et al 2009 marcot 2012 based on the strength of definition in the bns the results of this study identified the inconsistent impact on the relationship between certain variables for example the bn models indicated the relatively minimal contribution from temperature contrary to expectation suggesting the need for refinement to the current causal structure linkov et al 2009 marcot 2012 the traditional approach to improving inconsistent structure in bns is the multi model ensembles and calibration check to determine the most appropriate version leading to a reasonable result carvajal et al 2015 hence revised beta bn models were constructed and evaluated towards an improved and optimal structure by comparison the initial alpha and revised beta bn models have some clear and significant discrepancies the initial model which is a direct mapping of lhlra appears broad and generic while the revised version through the restructuring of the interdependence provided a more focused and in depth analysis of the risk of growth and exposure separately the sub modelling into growth and exposure successfully deconstructed the problem into more elemental components that allowed for a more systematic evaluation clearly the endpoint variable in the exposure sub model is qualitative and not observable on the other hand legionella growth endpoint is quantitative and observable this allowed for data driven validation using predictive accuracy the predictive accuracy of legionella detection in the growth sub model is an important step employed to advance the credibility and robustness of the model furthermore the revised growth sub model with a refined endpoint of legionella count an observable and testable variable is a step in the direction of developing useful predictor variable from the shortlisted water quality and operational parameters previously bns has been successful in developing predictor variables for c parvum and g lamblia in wastewater management carvajal et al 2015 in a related way as legionella counts corresponding water quality and operational parameters monitoring data become more readily available there is the opportunity to develop predictor variables for legionella asa conceptual alternative to direct measurementof the pathogen these indicators have the potential to be utilised by regulators and water utilities to assess the microbial quality of the water in real time for more informed risk based legionella management bargellini et al 2011 panidhapu et al 2020 völker et al 2016 this will complement the monitoring and maintenance program for improved management of legionella exposure from aeration systems while progress is continuously been made in the application of bns in environmental risk assessments challenges still remain kaikkonen et al 2020 landis 2020 the findings from this study suggest the iterative updating of bn models have the potential to address the challenge of inconsistent and poor representation of interactions between multiple risk variables as demonstrated in this specific application in addition exhausting the many different performance metrics available in bns sensitivity analysis scenario assessment kappa coefficient performance accuracy etc can provide a framework that improve the often missing practice of model validation 4 conclusion given the limited understanding on legionella occurrence in aerator environment and the limitations of traditionally employed risk modelling techniques an improved assessment was proposed in this study where bns were implemented the following main conclusions could be drawn the application of bns facilitated a more structured transparent and quantitatively rigorous assessment of legionella exposure compared to the current lhlra method using bns provided a robust probabilistic method of reasoning under uncertainty and appeared more suitable to represent the complex dependencies of legionella growth and exposure through iterative approach bns characterised the complex mechanisms of legionella exposure and revealed some uncertainties associated with limited data and poor knowledge as captured in the current mechanistic relationships between the variables the development and evaluation of the current bns model provided a valuable insight into the interdependence of the variables and pointed the direction for subsequent refinement to the current considerations of cause effect mechanisms the current model prototype can be used to inform and better communicate the risk of legionella and associated variables within aeration system but further testing especially using data driven approaches is required to improve the behaviour and accuracy of the modelled outcome hence it is so far still recommended to incorporate more frequent legionella monitoring in the water safety plans of water utilities future work will focus on updating the current structure and conditional probabilities with new and larger validation data to create the final application gamma level model through the hybrid of data driven and expert learning approach the gamma model will be explored to strengthen patterns and predictive power of different combinations of explanatory variables contributing to legionella growth further determination of the relationship nature i e causal or correlational can be attempted also further stakeholder engagement will support the refinement of the currently filled cpts in the exposure sub model leading to a more consistent bns that can rely more heavily on expert elicitation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this

17165,an australian water utility has developed a legionella high level risk assessment lhlra which provides a semi qualitative assessment of the risk of legionella proliferation and human exposure in engineered water systems using a combination of empirical observation and expert knowledge expanding on this lhlra we propose two iterative bayesian network bn models to reduce uncertainty and allow for a probabilistic representation of the mechanistic interaction of the variables built using data from 25 groundwater treatment plants the risk of legionella exposure in groundwater aeration units was quantified as a function of five critical areas including hydraulic conditions nutrient availability and growth water quality system design and maintenance and location and access first the mechanistic relationship of the variables was conceptually mapped into a fishbone diagram parameterised deterministically using an expert elicited weighted scoring system and translated into bn the sensitivity to findings analysis of the bn indicated that system design was the most influential variable while elemental accumulation thresholds were the least influential variable for legionella exposure the diagnostic inference was used in high and low risk scenarios to demonstrate the capabilities of the bns to examine probable causes for diverse conditions subsequently the causal relationship of legionella growth and human exposure were improved through a conceptual bowtie representation finally an improved model developed the predictors of legionella growth and the risk of human exposure through the interaction of operational water quality monitoring operational parameters and asset conditions the use of bns modelling based on risk estimation and improved functional decision outputs offer a complementary and more transparent alternative approach to quantitative analysis of uncertainties than the current lhlra graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords risk assessment groundwater drinking water water safety plan pathogens 1 introduction 1 1 managing the risk of legionella in water systems managing the public health burden of the presence of legionella pneumophila in air and water handling systems such as faucets showers and cooling towers continues to undergo extensive research yet assessing the risk of this pathogen within urbanised and industrial settings is still challenged by limited ecological and aetiological knowledge and understanding buse et al 2012 the bacterium is benign in the natural environment or when present in biofilms on surfaces including pipes in water systems however sloughing can result in the formation of aerosols which may be inhaled and cause serious infection or death despite rising cases of legionnaires disease as well as increasing frequency of unusual clustered outbreaks macintyre et al 2018 preventive efforts to date have focused mainly on water systems in buildings cline et al 2020 lechevallier 2019 similar concerns on legionella colonisation have been raised in the context of engineered aeration systems commonly used to treat groundwater for potable uses the increased water age and the presence of algal deposits sludge or nutrients make these systems niche habitat for legionella growth rakić and štambuk giljanović 2016 this risk is exacerbated in hot climates where system components such as spray and tray aerators present suitable environments for legionella growth in biofilms with the potential for sloughing aerosolisation and aspiration prussin et al 2017 van heijnsbergen et al 2015 it is estimated that this vector for exposure to legionella is overlooked significantly under recognised and potentially presents a high risk to treatment plant operators and the local communities zappia 2015 currently there are no specific standards for managing health risks associated with the occurrence of legionella pathogens in drinking water treatment processes nhmrc national health and medical research council 2011 u s environmental protection agency 1989 european commission 2018 the traditional hazard identification and risk assessment hidra was employed to assess the risk of legionella this technique sits within the spectrum of the broader microbial risk framework for water utilities as it is able to identify hazards assess likelihoods and consequences fitzgerald et al 2018 who 2016 1 2 current strategy for legionella risk assessment in a major step towards a risk based approach water corporation of western australia wcwa performed a legionella high level risk assessment lhlra that defines the five critical risk areas including hydraulic conditions nutrients availability and growth water quality system design and maintenance and location and access using empirical observation and expert knowledge bradley 2017 the classifications of the states of the shortlisted risk variables were based on industry process control points and regulatory criteria commonly applied to water quality governance i e aesthetic pathogen especially legionella hpc 22 c and 37 c and total coliforms as well as assets conditions australian new zealand standard 2007 australian new zealand standard 2011 nhmrc national health and medical research council 2011 department of commerce code of practice 2010 the shortlisted dependant and interacting variables were assigned weighted scores and the resultant risk levels in each of the areas were determined through ordinary linear combination mackenzie 2014 the lhlra tool requires the user to select from qualitative statements and or to provide quantitative data concerning the relevant factors the assessment converts the qualitative quantitative inputs into numerical values and percentages using simple calculations linkov et al 2009 so far the results have been successfully used to build a knowledge base and to make informed decisions about the conditions of the assets prioritise minor and major capital work plan and determine appropriate mitigative and remedial actions 1 3 limits of lhlra under high uncertainty the current practice using lhlra has systematically assembled weighted and assessed the multiple factors believed to promote the risk of legionella in support of improved decision making however this approach to risk assessment has been historically criticised to be subjective lacking in transparency and reproducibility resulting in risk estimates without quantified uncertainties linkov et al 2009 as such methods that are likely to be more successful at assessing the complex interactions between variables and improve the understanding of legionella risk are being explored cox et al 2005 linkov et al 2009 the introduction of international standard iso 31 000 2009 has expanded the risk management framework provided more robust tools and broadened its applicability across all industries as nzs iso 31000 2009 recently more comprehensive approaches have been employed in the water industry including bowtie diagram fault tree event tree analysis lindhe et al 2012 and bayesian networks bns trinh et al 2017 of the available techniques stochastic approaches to risk modelling are preferred because of their probabilistic nature that accounts for the elements of uncertainties ross and sumner 2002 particularly bns have become increasingly popular for modelling conditions with a high degree of uncertainty and complexity such as in ecological systems and water management bertone et al 2016 moe et al 2020 wijesiri et al 2018 the advanced features of bns have been explored to successfully improve microbial risk modelling of giardia lamblia and cryptosporidium parvum carvajal et al 2015 as well as faecal coliforms and escherichia coli panidhapu et al 2020 hence there is the opportunity to use bns to document and quantify belief system surrounding the mechanistic relation of risk factors that are considered to contribute to the potential exposure to legionella in groundwater aeration units the concept of bns offer an alternative approach for relating the risk of legionella exposure with the critical variables and incorporate parameters of uncertainty and variability besides bns offer a convenient means for performing scenario exploration and inference as well as the prediction of legionella exposure under diverse conditions a bn structure is defined by graphical nodes with the relationship between variables specified using arcs the variables are presented as child nodes which have input connections from other nodes known as parents nodes the strength of relationship between a child and its parent node s is quantified through conditional probability distributions with one probability for each combination of possible states of the parents these probabilities are defined in the conditional probability tables cpts for each child node the cpt of each node captures the associated uncertainty i e the higher the uncertainty the wider the probability distribution the applicability of bns to environmental risk assessment has been considered extensively but the practice is still challenged by various conceptual and practical issues benvenuto et al 2020 common challenges include poor representation of relationship between variables driven by the limited understanding of complex environmental systems and weak or lack of robust model validation due to the absent of large empirical datasets kaikkonen et al 2020 landis 2020 in this study we assessed the capabilities of bns as a quantitative tool to better capture the implications of reasoning along the current management paradigm and to move beyond qualitative risk assessment first we extend and directly map the basic mechanistic understanding of the system regarding causality into a bn the strength and causal relationships between variables were determined through scenario exploration and sensitivity analysis subsequently we invest in improving the existing causal relationship of legionella proliferation and human exposure through a conceptual map using bowtie principles khakzad et al 2013 li et al 2016 next the revised model developed the predictors of legionella growth and the risk of human exposure through the interaction of operational water quality monitoring and asset conditions and the predictive ability was explicitly tested 2 development of the bn models the stepwise approach for developing the bns are summarised in fig 1 detailing the sources of data and techniques employed in the conceptual modelling as well as the subsequent translation into bns operational parameters and water quality data were collected from 25 groundwater treatment plants gwtps in western australia as summarised in table 3 the existing basic mechanistic understanding of the system regarding causality defined in lhlra was considered in the model the relations and interconnections between the variables were primarily set based on expert knowledge table 1 summarises common terminology acronyms and abbreviations 2 1 project scoping and conceptual modelling a tier wise approach to bn modelling was adopted marcot et al 2006 this approach includes 1 creating conceptual diagrams of key factors affecting the outcome of interest 2 mapping the conceptual diagram into the initial alpha level bn model 3 revising the model after expert review testing and calibrating to create the beta level model and 4 updating the structure and conditional probabilities with new validation data to create the final application gamma level model marcot et al 2006 in a first step the processes and dependencies of the variables in the five critically defined risk areas were mapped into a conceptual diagram using a fishbone analysis as outlined in luo et al 2018 in an attempt to convert the lhlra risk assessment into bns that allow for direct comparison of inputs and outputs all relationship between the variables were initially considered as potentially causal an instantiated legionella exposure variable that combines the scores accrued from the five different areas was created the output conceptual map with the basic mechanistic relationship was directly mapped into the first alpha level bn representing input and output variables subsequently the structure of the initial bns was revised through an expert workshop comprising academics microbiologist and water treatment plant operators using bowtie principle the expert review improves the causality pathway defined in basic mechanistic understanding bowtie analyses have been successful as conceptual maps for bns khakzad et al 2013 li et al 2016 in its traditional representation the left hand side includes a list of potential hazards leading through different pathways to a specific top critical event legionella colonisation whilst the right hand side includes the different consequences of such event the improved relationship was based on bowtie principles and conceptually mapped using bowtie analysis software bowtiexp cge risk management solutions 2020 the revised beta level bns model was then built based on the modified causality relationship defined by the new conceptual map 2 2 model parameters discretisation and learning the summative scores in each of the five critically defined areas and the legionella exposure variable was categorised through a uniform distribution into three ranking schemes intervals to represent low medium and high risk levels the low range indicates the contributing factors are present in states that result in a minimal risk the medium level represents the threshold of potential concern and the high range indicates the variables are present in a state that pose an unacceptable risk level brien et al 2017 from operational standpoint the minimum risk required no action from the plant operator medium threshold require the review and close monitoring of operational parameters and the high state represent the point for intermediate management intervention for the legionella exposure variable a low state requires no mitigative action the medium state prompts the review of operational parameters and the high state calls for immediate decontamination as nzs 3666 the description of discretisation style for all the risk factors that translated as input variables for the initial and revised models based on the weighted scores are provided in the supplementary data supplementary materials a table s1 the prior probability distributions for the root nodes in the water quality and nutrient availability and growth variables were defined using historical data sourced from the gwtps while hydraulic conditions system design and location and access were captured from lhlra records and statistical considerations utilised for variables with missing records beaudequin et al 2016 several practical ways in which cpt values can be established in the initial alpha level bns have been outlined marcot et al 2007 the expert elicited scores were set to deterministic value and filled as cpts for the bns a deterministic bn has conditional probability distributions as kronecker or dirac delta functions baldi and rosen zvi 2005 barber 2003 this implies that only one occurrence of a possible combination is represented when the relationships between parents and child variables are arranged in a tabular format in one row per dataset the complete deterministic cpts used in the models are available on request the bnmodels were developed with the software netica 5 18 norsys 2015 2 3 model evaluation and validation the bn models were evaluated through sensitivity scenario analyses and validated through different performance metric including prediction accuracy and cohen kappa coefficient sensitivity analyses were performed on the initial and revised bns to identify the variables that are most influential on the risk of legionella scenario testing was performed on the initial model to understand the triggers of the different risk levels and model behaviour on the revised model the validation option testing the net using cases was employed to grade the bns predictions against the actual outcome norsys 2015 a recent independent dataset from the lhlra assessment of 23 plants was compiled and the observed states of the input variables were tested as net cases in order to evaluate the agreement between predicted and observed outcome performance accuracy as well as error rates were calculated for false positives type i error rejecting a true hypothesis i e failing to correctly identify positive cases and false negatives type ii error failing to reject a false hypothesis i e falsely identifying negative cases as positive othman and al hamadi 2018 in addition performance metrics like cohen s kappa prevalence index and bias effect were computed to assess the symmetry of the validation datasets 3 results and discussions 3 1 conceptual model and input variables the shortlisted variables and the relative contribution of the five different critical areas to the risk of legionella exposure is summarised in table 2 the summative scores from the different risk areas differ significantly while the hydraulic conditions factor had the lowest score accounting for 11 of the total contribution to risk both nutrients availability and growth and location and access also featured small contributions on the other end of the spectrum water quality was identified as a major contributor to risk 35 the fishbone diagram fd illustrating the interactions of input variables and the integrated risk of legionella in the system is presented in fig 2 the systematic integration of different risk areas established a clear structural endpoint variable for an easy bns modelling of uncertainties in the system luo et al 2018 pollino and henderson 2010 subsequently the illustrated potential causal connections establishing functional relationship from the fd were retained as a conceptual map and developed into the initial bns model table 3 summarises water quality data sourced from 25 gwtps utilised for deriving prior probabilities for the nutrients availability and growth and the water quality variables the average temperature was 24 c ranging from 14 to 34 c and representative of hot dry climates legionella counts were a qualitative indication of the presence and absence of the pathogenic bacteria with limits of 10 cfu ml and 10 cfu ml respectively subsequently the graphical representation of causal connectionsamongst variables in the conceptual fd and discretised variables were converted to a bns 3 2 model development and analysis 3 2 1 initial model output the initial output bn model is presented in fig 3 in a labelled bar style with colour coding created to categorise variables into distinct groups in line with good bns practice marcot 2017 the five risk areas orange primary and immediate risk factors tan and endpoint point variable represented as the legionella exposure cyan the model consisted of 42 nodes 43 links and 9461 conditional probabilities of the 42 nodes 33 were inputs variables supplementary materials a figure s1 the prior distributions of parent nodes captured through the bn provided a posterior probability estimate of the risk parameters the bn model in its simplest form without inputs of observed evidence depicts the marginal probability distributions for each state in all the nodes as summarised in table 4 this display is a visual representation of potential causality between the nodes leading to the risk of legionella exposure while the relationships between variables in bn are not necessarily by definition causal the graphical portion has been useful for representing presumably causal understanding carriger and parker 2021 the distribution probabilities across the states tends to exhibit a normality pattern the conditional probabilities tend towards the medium states in the five risk areas as seen with the high probability values the distribution for the end variable legionella exposure tends to be skewed to medium and high risk accounting for over 99 the explicit visualisation of the interactions between variables enabled the exploration of model behaviour and interrogation of the reasoning behind the model output thus providing a more transparent approach as compared to the lhlra this is not the case with most traditional forecasting methods like the lhlra going a step forward by inputting findings into the nodes i e setting evidence the bns can update the prior probabilities in the model to propagate new posterior probabilities based on the structural relationships and the conditional probabilities with this feature we can analyse the effects of different scenarios on the model variables pollino et al 2007 3 2 2 scenario assessment a scenario assessment is a bns feature that helps to clearly understand the characteristics of each variable and its relationship with others in the model one of the advantages of bns is the ability to perform predictive forward and diagnostic backward inferences two diagnostic scenarios were developed to illustrate the capability of the model to examine the probabilities of factors that would result in a high and low risk of legionella exposure by applying a backward diagnostic inference all the way to the top parents the original triggers for risk scenario can be assessed in these scenarios a high state was selected set as hard evidence in the legionella exposure node setting the probability to 100 with the same procedure repeated for the low and the probabilities for all the nodes were examined fig 4 summarises the estimated occurrence probabilities of the worst states of the variables across all the nodes by worst we refer to the probability of delivering the state of a given variable with the most impact on the risk of legionella exposure the five risk areas are all likely to be in the worst state high under the high scenarios it is also obvious that the chance of worst states occurring is greater in the high risk scenario for all the variables except for the hydraulic runtime node for high risk of legionella exposure the five risk areas appeared with dominant probabilities in the worst states nutrient availability and growth 0 72 hydraulic conditions 0 70 water quality 0 68 location and access 0 60 and system design 0 57 while in the low risk scenario only the proximity of other sources of cross contamination has up to 50 chance of being in the worst case these predictions are expected because high risk of legionella exposure is generally the product of worst conditions present in the different individual variables this implies that monitoring nutrient availability hydraulic conditions and water quality will be a reasonable surveillance approach to detect elevated risk in the system fig 4 this agrees with both lhlra and standards for legionella managing in other systems as nzs 3666 4276 these dynamic responses of bns through the demonstration of the interaction of the different variables with observed evidence set them aside from other models while scenario assessment provided system interaction in a very transparent manner the approach is not able to rank the contribution of each of the variables to the overall risk in this modelling software but through sensitivity analysis we can begin to identify which variables in the model have the greatest impact on the model endpoints as well as the order of importance strength and relevance of the inputs in determining the variation in the output 3 2 3 sensitivity analysis an analysis of sensitivity to findings was performed on the endpoint variable legionella exposure in the bn to identify the most important variables in the system the sensitivity analysis ordered quantitatively the degree of variance reduction vr or uncertainty entropy associated with input variables in a specified outcome chen and pollino 2012 pollino and henderson 2010 as shown in fig 5 the system design the potential of the aeration system to release contaminated aerosols is the variable with the most influence 0 225 followed by the location and access the height and duration of exposure as a result access to the aerator environment 0 166 legionella occurrence in the aerosols 0 097 and susceptibility of the systems to windblown contamination 0 073 unsurprisingly the nodes with the greatest impacts are the risk areas this is expected as the risk areas are intermediate i e neither root nor leaf nodes that represent multiple risk factors of the primary root nodes legionella occurrence in aerosol has the most significant impact this could be attributed to the expert weighted score influenced by risk aversion this behaviour in the model demonstrates a reasonable representation of the interactions between input and output variables that aligns with experts understanding of the risk of legionella exposure the complete summary of the sensitivity analysis data is provided in the supplementary materials a table s2 although temperature is expected to have a significant influence on legionella exposure the current analysis showed a minimal impact 0 01 rakić and štambuk giljanović 2016 this suggests possible deficiencies in the relationship between variables adopted as causality from the lhlra to be mostly correlational and resulted in too many cpts 9461 where cpts are higher than the number of samples available particularly with respect to endpoints like legionella exposure for model evaluation the accuracy of how well the model represents the system can be poorly assessed pollino and henderson 2010 in the current adaptation the model has a deep structure with many intermediate 10 and primary 19 nodes which can facilitate more propagation of uncertainties from input to output nodes equally the asymmetric structure of the model can contribute to making distant input nodes with many intervening nodes less sensitive marcot et al 2006 good practice recommends the depth of model the number of layers of nodes be kept relatively shallow four or fewer if possible to create minimal associated cpts that are tractable and understandable when specified by the experts marcot et al 2006 collectively these findings suggest the need for a relatively shallow depth model in the revised beta iteration breaking up multifaceted systems into two or more model networks is recommended as a good approach to increase accuracy and assemble diverse variables in a coherent and systematic environment with moderate depth marcot et al 2006 3 3 revised bn models 3 3 1 modifying the model causal structure the experts driven workshop facilitated a conceptual map describing the potential causes and consequences of legionella colonisation an improvement on the causality relationships from the alpha model the output conceptual map from the bowtie representation is shown in fig 6 the conceptual map reveals the consequences of legionella colonisation to include public health exposure and contamination of water supply the contamination of water supply was not modelled due to the multiple treatment barriers in the water system train that is considered sufficient to inactivate the pathogen the improved diagram provides a simplified and better overview of the mechanistic dependencies in the model allowing for the selection of causally linked influence for the growth and exposure separately getz et al 2018 the output map becomes the foundational framework for the revised bns model to avoid the complexity pitfall from the initial bns model the divide and conquer modelling approach was adopted mcdonald et al 2016 hence the legionella growth and transmission scenarios were modelled into two sub models deconstructing the problem into a more elemental component that can be modelled more easily 3 3 2 legionella growth model fig 7 shows the legionella growth sub model i e a mapping of the left hand side of the conceptual diagram the endpoint of this model is legionella bacteria presence with modified states of detected and not detected cyan coloured the modifications of the target node to the qualitative thresholds were made to represent realistic and more interpretable divisions three of the critically defined risk areas orange coloured are captured in the growth sub model the probability distribution on the legionella bacteria nodes is 78 9 and 21 3 for detected and not detected respectively suggesting the current weighting is skewed towards positive detection the new endpoint variable is an observable and measurable parameter in contrast to the legionella exposure in the initial model this provides the illustration of causal links between legionella bacteria and predictor variables the sensitivity analysis related to this specific growth model revealed water quality 0 205 nutrient availability and growth 0 127 and hydraulic conditions 0 126 as the three variables with the most impact on the detection of legionella fig 8 the quantifiable and observable nature of the output legionella bacteria node allows to evaluate the model performance marcot 2012 3 3 3 performance evaluation of the growth sub model performance validation is a crucial step for evaluating the prediction and success rate of models marcot 2012 the process of model validation assesses the quality of the model prediction under independent conditions using data not previously applied in the bnsconstruction ideally when the data set is large enough the k fold cross validation approach that splits the data into two folds one for training and the other for validation is recommended marcot 2012 constrained by the sparse data considered in this study relative to the complex process and model the total model historical records from the lhlra were utilised in the model learning this validation of the model provides an assessment of the accuracy of bns predictions comparing the state with the highest predicted probability to the observed outcomes as summarised in table 5 for the 23 sites the model incorrectly predicted the status legionella not detected as the more likely option in the three observations of legionella detection type i error true positive rate of 0 but correctly predicted non detected scenarios in 18 out of 20 cases true negative rate of 88 cumulating into a model error rate of 21 these results suggested a highly imbalanced dataset the kappa coefficient was k was negative signifying an apparent lack of agreement between the predicted and observed legionella occurrence outcomes the prevalence index of 0 78 confirmed the existence of prevalence effect as evident in the different proportion of agreements for the detected and not detected classification of legionella occurrence the bias indexes of 0 7 and 0 13 disagreement for the detected and not detected class also confirmed the very asymmetrical dataset the significant prevalence and bias effect in the datasets can reduce the expected prediction to random and subsequently a weak agreement in the outcomes byrt et al 1993 sim and wright 2005 the certainty of the causal relationship and difficulty in species detectability have been listed as the main contributors of model error in environmental modelling mackenzie et al 2003 the current system understanding that translated into the mechanistic models are likely to be correlational and not necessarily causal as revealed in the error rate marcot et al 2006 equally the trivial detection of legionella counts in the sampling reference data can be a limitation to the reliability of the validation complicating the distinction of randomness and the power of the model to make useful prediction for legionella at the current stage of the iteration with no true positives predicted for legionella and the highly imbalanced datasets the model accuracy metric is expected to be a poor performance indicator marcot et al 2006 given the weakness of the model accuracy indicators the sensitivity analysis was used to interpret the ultimate behaviour of the current relationships in the model the sensitivity analysis classification of key influential variables suggested the need for further structural revision before advancing the model towards implementation for example the impact of temperature on legionella exposure was found to be insignificant while expected to be of major influence particularly it will be critical to examine the distinction between relationships that are causal and correlational in future studies therefore the acquisition of more empirical data through more frequent legionella sampling is recommended this will allow further structural learning and training of the model with a larger pool and more diverse input data in manner that increase certainty and prioritise causality relationship 3 3 4 legionella transmission modelling human health exposure to understand the impact of legionella growth the right side of the conceptual map was modelled for the risk of human exposure leading to infection the risk of infection is defined by the legionella bacteria as well as two critically defined risk areas of location and access to the system and system design fig 9 the sub model was evaluated through sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis of the exposure model revealed two most impactful variables as legionella counts as expected 0 958 and frequency of employee access 0 241 this result was expected as infection strongly depends on the concentration in the system pepper and gerba 2018 the difference in the output format of the lhlra and the bn model made it difficult for direct comparison however the two approaches can be interpreted in a complementary manner while both models are built based on expert judgement and intended for prediction purposes only the bns allow for testing of the reliability and accuracy of the belief structure or theory that define the relationships through the sensitivity analysis unlike the growth sub model the endpoint of the transmission modelling legionella exposure is categorical low medium and high and with no measurable and or observable records making validation difficult however the bn probability distributions on legionella exposure provided estimate of the chance of occurrence of the different risk levels despite the trivial count occasionally captured in the monitoring program and no records of legionella outbreak in the gwtps the baseline probability distributions in the refined model showed a skewness towards the high risk scenario with over 50 chance of high risk level yunana et al 2019 3 4 towards better risk assessment despite advances in standard management frameworks managing the risk of legionella colonisation of water systems still presents important challenges as demonstrated in this study using synergies between complementary techniques can advance mechanistic understanding and predictive performance that paves the way towards achieving improved and more comprehensible risk assessment particularly iterative bns modelling demonstrates the capability for a more transparent structured and quantitative approach to assessing the risk of legionella exposure uusitalo et al 2015 to be useful for environmental management model outputs must be aligned with stakeholders objectives hence retention of the bns structure from the causal connections and functional relationships amongst variables from the lhlra while the approach allowed simple model development a number of limitations can be identified firstly the cpts are deterministic providing a single point estimate of individual risk as scored in the lhlra in the deterministic estimate the outputs of the variables are fully determined by the parameter and the initial values which is not a satisfactory representation for complex systems like the risk of legionella exposure generally eliciting expert knowledge deterministically has been criticised as being vague ambiguous and susceptible to inconsistent judgements gregory and keeney 2017 hemming et al 2018 therefore to better model legionella interaction with multiple variables capture uncertainties and inherent variabilities a probabilistic model that provides the distribution of estimated risks and not a single point estimate is recommended chen and pollino 2012 richardson 1996 the probabilistic approach to expert elicitation as outlined in hemming et al 2018 has the capability to improve consistency in defining the strength of relations between variables such as those presented in the lhlra hemming et al 2018 secondly the definitions and classifications of certain variables were appropriate for the lhlra but tend to increase the model complexity when translated into the bns for example the five risk areas adapted from the lhlra are all latent and derived from the interrelations of immediate parameters translating such relations into bns can greatly reduce the classification accuracy explanatory power and the possibility of quantitative validation of the model marcot 2012 however the revised model better refined the endpoint node to focus on the observable and testable variable of legionella presence contrary to the lhlra the bns through the sensitivity analysis scenarios assessments and evaluation of prediction accuracy provided systematic evaluation and complementary insights into the structure and the relative importance of input variables linkov et al 2009 marcot 2012 based on the strength of definition in the bns the results of this study identified the inconsistent impact on the relationship between certain variables for example the bn models indicated the relatively minimal contribution from temperature contrary to expectation suggesting the need for refinement to the current causal structure linkov et al 2009 marcot 2012 the traditional approach to improving inconsistent structure in bns is the multi model ensembles and calibration check to determine the most appropriate version leading to a reasonable result carvajal et al 2015 hence revised beta bn models were constructed and evaluated towards an improved and optimal structure by comparison the initial alpha and revised beta bn models have some clear and significant discrepancies the initial model which is a direct mapping of lhlra appears broad and generic while the revised version through the restructuring of the interdependence provided a more focused and in depth analysis of the risk of growth and exposure separately the sub modelling into growth and exposure successfully deconstructed the problem into more elemental components that allowed for a more systematic evaluation clearly the endpoint variable in the exposure sub model is qualitative and not observable on the other hand legionella growth endpoint is quantitative and observable this allowed for data driven validation using predictive accuracy the predictive accuracy of legionella detection in the growth sub model is an important step employed to advance the credibility and robustness of the model furthermore the revised growth sub model with a refined endpoint of legionella count an observable and testable variable is a step in the direction of developing useful predictor variable from the shortlisted water quality and operational parameters previously bns has been successful in developing predictor variables for c parvum and g lamblia in wastewater management carvajal et al 2015 in a related way as legionella counts corresponding water quality and operational parameters monitoring data become more readily available there is the opportunity to develop predictor variables for legionella asa conceptual alternative to direct measurementof the pathogen these indicators have the potential to be utilised by regulators and water utilities to assess the microbial quality of the water in real time for more informed risk based legionella management bargellini et al 2011 panidhapu et al 2020 völker et al 2016 this will complement the monitoring and maintenance program for improved management of legionella exposure from aeration systems while progress is continuously been made in the application of bns in environmental risk assessments challenges still remain kaikkonen et al 2020 landis 2020 the findings from this study suggest the iterative updating of bn models have the potential to address the challenge of inconsistent and poor representation of interactions between multiple risk variables as demonstrated in this specific application in addition exhausting the many different performance metrics available in bns sensitivity analysis scenario assessment kappa coefficient performance accuracy etc can provide a framework that improve the often missing practice of model validation 4 conclusion given the limited understanding on legionella occurrence in aerator environment and the limitations of traditionally employed risk modelling techniques an improved assessment was proposed in this study where bns were implemented the following main conclusions could be drawn the application of bns facilitated a more structured transparent and quantitatively rigorous assessment of legionella exposure compared to the current lhlra method using bns provided a robust probabilistic method of reasoning under uncertainty and appeared more suitable to represent the complex dependencies of legionella growth and exposure through iterative approach bns characterised the complex mechanisms of legionella exposure and revealed some uncertainties associated with limited data and poor knowledge as captured in the current mechanistic relationships between the variables the development and evaluation of the current bns model provided a valuable insight into the interdependence of the variables and pointed the direction for subsequent refinement to the current considerations of cause effect mechanisms the current model prototype can be used to inform and better communicate the risk of legionella and associated variables within aeration system but further testing especially using data driven approaches is required to improve the behaviour and accuracy of the modelled outcome hence it is so far still recommended to incorporate more frequent legionella monitoring in the water safety plans of water utilities future work will focus on updating the current structure and conditional probabilities with new and larger validation data to create the final application gamma level model through the hybrid of data driven and expert learning approach the gamma model will be explored to strengthen patterns and predictive power of different combinations of explanatory variables contributing to legionella growth further determination of the relationship nature i e causal or correlational can be attempted also further stakeholder engagement will support the refinement of the currently filled cpts in the exposure sub model leading to a more consistent bns that can rely more heavily on expert elicitation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this

developed by zhou et al 2017 2018 definite volume of pms was added into 1 5 ml buffered abts solution containing 0 5 ml abts 2 mm and 1 ml acetate sodium buffer ph 4 6 with 10 µl iodide 1 mm as

contaminants mn ii with and without complexing ligand at desirable concentrations at proper time intervals reaction solution was sampled and quenched by excess ascorbic acid before analysis with high pressure liquid chromatography hplc and uv detection in parallel another sample was withdrawn for spectrophotometric measurement of persulfates concentration liang et al 2008 zhou et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 preliminary experiments demonstrated that the initiating way adding persulfates immediately into solutions versus 1 hour later had no influence on the reactions control experiments without addition of persulfates or mn ii were also conducted under identical conditions reactions involving mn iii were initiated by adding target contaminants or simultaneously adding persulfates and target contaminants into prepared mn iii solutions acetate sodium 10 mm was used as buffers for ph 5 and borate sodium 10 mm was used as buffers for ph 8 the changes of solution ph were less than 0 2 units during the reactions all the experiments were performed at least in duplicates at 25 c and average data were presented the relative standard deviations were always 10 unless otherwise stated for the identification of the molecular ion mass change during mn ii ligand pms system the resulting solution was analyzed by electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry esi ms control

discussion 3 1 effect of complexing ligands in activating persulfates by mn ii fig 1 comparatively exhibited the effect of ppp edta and nta on np degradation and persulfates decomposition in the mn ii pds and mn ii pms systems at ph 5 it was noted that no degradation of np was observed in control experiments i e persulfates ligand and mn ii ligand conjugations fig s1 as can be seen in fig 1 np was hardly degraded in the mn ii persulfates systems indicating the ineffectiveness of mn ii in activating pds and pms similar findings were reported in previous work where the mn ii persulfates conjugation showed sluggish reactivity toward 2 4 dichlorophenol anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 in the scenario of pds these ligands i e ppp edta and nta negligibly affected the performance of mn ii pds system where np was negligibly degraded without pds decomposition during investigated time scale 5 hours interestingly it was found that these ligands had different effect on mn ii pms system in contrast to negligible degradation of np in the mn ii ppp pms system edta and nta substantially accelerated np degradation np was almost completely degraded within 40 min in the presence of edta and within 15 min in the presence of nta meanwhile substantial pms decomposition was observed suggesting complexation of mn ii ion with edta and nta was effective to activate pms for contaminants degradation similar findings were reported in previous work that pms was more easily activated than pds e g by co ii fe ii and fe iii anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 for instance the rate constant for the reaction of fe ii with pms was reported to be 3 104 m 1s 1 three orders of magnitude higher than that of fe ii with pds 2 101 m 1s 1 these findings indicated a higher reactivity of pms as compared to pds which might be due to their difference in structure asymmetric pms vs symmetric pds in other words the neighboring structures of peroxy group o o might determine the reactivity of pds and pms interestingly the degradation of np in the mn ii edta pms system displayed an autocatalytic two stage oxidation an initial lag stage where the degradation of np was very slow followed by a secondary rapid one the occurrence of autocatalysis indicated that the oxidation products of mn ii edta might play an important role comparatively autocatalysis was not observed in the case of nta see the following section for discussion 3 2 involvement of mn iii complex in previous work the sluggish reactivity of mn ii pms system was ascribed to the generation of caged so 4 and the disproportionation of mn iii in situ formed reactions 1 2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 1 mn ii hso 5 m n iii so 4 2 o h 2 2 mn iii mn ii mn iv it is well known that the spontaneous disproportionation of mn iii results in its unlikely contribution to the reactions unless in the presence of complexing ligands or under extremely acidic conditions davies 1969 klewicki and morgan 1998 thus the presence of ligands was expected to facilitate the formation of stabilized mn iii species e g mn iii edta in the mn ii ligand pms system in order to confirm the involvement of mn iii species uv vis absorption spectra at 200 600 nm were monitored as shown in fig 2 the absorption peak at 270 nm characteristic of mn iii species appeared in the case of edta and nta corroborating the formation of mn iii species in the mn ii edta pms and mn ii nta pms system comparatively mn iii signal was not observed in the mn ii ppp pms system these findings indicated that the conversion of mn ii complex to mn iii upon pms oxidation might be highly related to the nature of complexing ligands mn ii complexation with n containing functional groups might show higher reactivity toward pms than complexation with carboxylate group fig s2 possibly due to the better electron donating capacity of n than o chen et al 2019 in previous work stabilized mn iii species was generally considered as an oxidant for contaminants degradation jiang et al 2012 kostka et al 1995 wang et al 2014 the reactivity of np toward mn iii stabilized by edta and nta was independently investigated however no degradation of np was observed fig s3 indicating that the degradation of np in the mn ii ligand pms system was not due to the direct oxidation of mn iii species 3 3 important role of mn iii species to examine whether mn iii play an important role the effect of mn iii ex situ prepared on the reactions of pms with np was investigated it was found that np was rapidly degraded in the mn iii edta pms and mn iii nta pms system accompanied with pms decomposition fig 3 these finding indicated that a rapid interaction occurred between mn iii complex and pms resulting in the formation of reactive intermediates which contributed to np oxidation in the mn ii edta pms system mn iii edta gradually accumulated to its maximum within 30 min coinciding with the following rapid stage of np degradation and pms decomposition fig s4 given the sluggish reactivity of mn iii edta toward np negligible degradation of np was expected in the initial lag stage consistent with the observed experimental findings comparatively autocatalysis was not observed in the mn ii nta pms system where mn iii species was rapidly generated within 1 min in the mn ii ppp pms system mn iii species was hardly generated hindering the subsequent formation of reactive intermediate and no degradation of np was observed therein therefore it was not difficult to understand the difference of ligands in activating pms by mn ii these findings confirmed that the formation of mn iii species was a critical step in the mn ii ligand pms system 3 4 identification of reactive intermediates above results suggested that degradation of np in the mn ii ligand pms system was attributed to the contribution of reactive intermediate generated from the interaction between pms and mn iii species one electron or two electron transfer might be operative for the reaction of pms and mn iii species leading to the formation of so 4 reaction 3 or mn v species reaction 4 3 mn iii complex pms mn iv so 4 4 mn iii complex pms mn v so 4 2 ethanol scavenging experiments were commonly conducted to investigate the role of so 4 in contaminants oxidation due to its high reactivity toward so 4 however in recent work high valent metal oxo species was demonstrated to be effectively quenched by ethanol as well gao et al 2020 wang et al 2018 therefore the effect of ethanol could not distinguish so 4 versus mn v though a remarkable suppression was observed in the presence of ethanol fig s5 fortunately we recently found that pmso could be used as a mechanistic probe to successfully distinguish the relative contribution of so 4 versus mn v due to their marked difference in product formation gao et al 2019 so 4 oxidized pmso to hydroxylated and or polymeric products while pmso2 was generated from pmso oxidation by mn v species gao et al 2019 wang et al 2018 fig 4 showed the time course profiles of pmso degradation and pmso2 formation in the mn iii complex pms systems accompanied with the rapid degradation of pmso appreciable formation of pmso2 was observed moreover the yield of pmso2 η mole of pmso2 produced per mole of pmso degraded was calculated to be approximately 100 regardless of edta or nta this finding indicated that mn v species but not so 4 was the dominant oxidant further esi ms technique was applied in attempt to provide additional piece of evidence for the involvement of mn v species in ms only mode real time total ion chromatography could be obtained and the appearance of new peak with specific molecular mass might be an indication for the occurrence of manganese species as compared to control sample containing mn ii and edta a new peak with molecular ions of m z 345 was detected in the mn iii edta solution ex prepared under positive esi fig s6 it was suggested to be mn iii edta given the mass number of mn and edta as well as their charge number and the ionization case the same molecular ions of m z 345 was also detected in the case of mn ii pms edta system again supporting the generation of mn iii species therein fig 5 moreover a new peak with the molecular ions of m z 361 appeared under positive esi this o additional product might be an indication for the occurrence of omn v edta based on above findings a novel non radical mechanism was postulated for pms activation by mn ii complex the presence of suitable ligands could facilitate the formation of mn iii upon mn ii oxidation by pms where the stabilization of mn iii species was greatly enhanced against its rapid disproportionation hence marked stabilizing mn iii could participate in reactions undergoing further pms oxidation via two electron transfer with the formation of mn v as the dominant reactive intermediate fig 6 3 5 influencing factors 3 5 1 reagent concentration fig 7 a and b comparatively showed the degradation of np by the mn ii ligand pms system in the presence of different mn ii concentration at a fixed mn ii ligand ratio it was found that the oxidation of np was accelerated with increasing mn ii concentration in the case of nta for instance as mn ii concentration increased from 10 to 60 μm the percentage of np degradation increased from 20 to 100 at 2 min this might be explained by the increasing concentration of mn iii species with the increase in mn ii concentration in the presence of edta the enhancement increased as the mn ii concentration increased from 10 to 20 μm while the enhancement was weakened as mn ii concentration further increased to 60 μm this might be due to that at a fixed mn ii ligand ratio the increase in mn ii concentration resulted in the introduction of large amount of edta which could competitively consume pms and or reactive intermediates as a redundant fig 7c and d compared the degradation of np by the mn ii ligand pms system with different mn ii ligand ratio i e mn ii ligand 1 1 1 25 at a fixed mn ii concentration in the case of nta the degradation of np was slightly affected with the ratio ranging from 1 5 to 1 25 while the accelerating effect of nta was attenuated at the mn ii nta ratio of 1 1 this finding might be an indication that the instability of manganese intermediates at a low mn ii nta ratio while the reactivity of manganese intermediates was negligibly affected with the ratio ranging from 1 5 to 1 25 jiang et al 2012 in contrast in the case of edta the enhancement of np oxidation was attenuated with the decrease in the ratio i e the increase in edta concentration resulting from the consumption of pms and or reactive intermediates by edta fig 7e and f compared the effect of pms concentration on the np degradation in the case of edta increasing pms concentration resulted in the enhancement of np degradation this was not difficult to understand that the increase of oxidant concentration could accelerate the formation of reactive intermediate interestingly the oxidation of np was not affected by pms concentration in the case of nta fig s7 showed the fast formation of almost identical amount of mn iii nta within 1 min regardless the concentration of pms indicating the fast generation of mn iii the negligible effect of pms on the mn ii nta pms system might be another indication for the rapid generation of mn v species from mn iii oxidation and suggested that the reaction of mn v and np might be the limiting step in the mn ii nta pms systems warranting further investigation 3 5 2 solution ph as can be seen in fig s8 np was completely degraded within 100 min in the mn ii edta pms system and within 20 min in the mn ii nta pms system at ph 8 it was found that the activating ability of mn ii complex attenuated as the solution ph increased to 8 for instance np was almost completely degraded at 40 min at ph 5 in the mn ii edta pms system fig 1 while the percentage of np at 40 min degradation decreased to 30 at ph 8 fig s8 this might be resulted from the combined effect of ph on the formation of manganese complex as well as the reactivity of manganese intermediates unfortunately the nature of manganese intermediates especially mn v species in situ formed are far from clear due to the extreme difficulty in their isolation and identification moreover the performance of mn ii edta pms and mn ii nta pms in unbuffered systems was also examined effective abatement of np was also achieved that np was almost completely degraded within 50 min in the case of edta and 15min in the case of nta fig s9 3 5 3 inorganic ions the effect of inorganic ions on the efficiency of mn ii ligand pms system was investigated fig s10 as can be seen the influence of both chloride and bicarbonate on np degradation in the mn ii edta pms and mn ii nta pms systems was insignificant the inhibitory effect induced by chloride and bicarbonate 1 5 mm on np removal was less than 15 this insignificant influence of inorganic ions were also reported in other pms activated systems based on the non radical mechanism e g carbocatalysis duan et al 2018b guan et al 2017 comparatively contamination abatement in advanced oxidation based on free radicals were usually suppressed appreciably in the presence of these inorganic ions yang et al 2019 this observed insignificant influence of chloride and bicarbonate in mn ii ligand pms system further confirm our proposed non radial mechanism involved therein 3 6 comparison with fe ii based system fig 8 comparatively showed the percentage of ba and atz degradation in the mn ii and fe ii based systems as can be seen the addition of edta and nta greatly enhanced the degradation of ba and atz in the mn ii pms system for instance as compared to negligible degradation of atz in the mn ii pms system atz was completely degraded in the mn ii edta pms and mn ii nta pms systems this might be due to that the presence of ligands facilitated the generation of manganese intermediates responsible for the contaminants abasement in contrast fe ii pms and the fe ii ligand pms system showed limited reactivity the percentage of ba and atz degradation decreased from 10 and 30 to almost 0 in the presence of ligands similar finding was reported in previous work where the presence of ligands weakened the ability of fe ii in persulfates activation and this inhibition was explained by the steric hindrance of ligands hindering the interaction between persulfates and fe ii wang et al 2019 the effective abatement of refractory ba and atz in the mn ii ligand pms system suggested that it was a much more effective oxidation technology in water treatment as comped to fe ii based systems further research might be needed to explore the efficiency of this complex system towards various contaminants under various conditions and gain insight into the oxidative characteristic of manganese intermediates in situ formed 4 conclusion in this work the impact of different complexing ligands on the mn ii persulfates system was systematically examined for the first time the following conclusions were obtained which might improve the understanding of pms activation as well as manganese chemistry in environmental application in contrast to mn ii as an inefficient activator for pms mn ii complex chelated by edta and nta exhibited appreciable ability in pms activation while ppp had no influence comparatively these ligands negligibly affect the performance of mn ii pds system showing sluggish reactivity effective abatement of contaminants i e np ba and atz were achieved by the treatment of mn ii ligand pms oxidation technology where the removal efficacy was highly dependent on reagents concentration and solution ph unlike conventional pms activation that generated free radicals as major oxidants manganese intermediates served as the primary reactive intermediates in the mn ii ligand pms system the generation of mn iii species was found to be a critical step for contaminants degradation in the mn ii ligand pms system which was further subjected to pms oxidation leading to the formation of reactive intermediate high valent mn species mn v but not free radicals was demonstrated to be the dominant reactive oxidant by using methyl phenyl sulfide pmso as a chemical probe a non radical mechanism was proposed that stabilized mn iii generated from the oxidation of mn ii complex further oxidized by pms to mn v complex via two electron transfer which serve as the reactive oxidant rather than so 4 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

extinction coefficient of i3 at 352 nm was 25700 m 1 cm 1 2 2 experimental procedures batch experiments were initiated by adding persulfates i e pms or pds into ph adjusted solution containing target contaminants mn ii with and without complexing ligand at desirable concentrations at proper time intervals reaction solution was sampled and quenched by excess ascorbic acid before analysis with high pressure liquid chromatography hplc and uv detection in parallel another sample was withdrawn for spectrophotometric measurement of persulfates concentration liang et al 2008 zhou et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 preliminary experiments demonstrated that the initiating way adding persulfates immediately into solutions versus 1 hour later had no influence on the reactions control experiments without addition of persulfates or mn ii were also conducted under identical conditions reactions involving mn iii were initiated by adding target contaminants or simultaneously adding persulfates and target contaminants into prepared mn iii solutions acetate sodium 10 mm was used as buffers for ph 5 and borate sodium 10 mm was used as buffers for ph 8 the changes of solution ph were less than 0 2 units during the reactions all the experiments were performed at least in duplicates at 25 c and average data were presented the relative standard deviations were always 10 unless otherwise stated for the identification of the molecular ion mass change during mn ii ligand pms system the resulting solution was analyzed by electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry esi ms control experiments for the analysis of solutions containing mn ii and edta as well as mn iii edta were also conducted 2 3 analytical methods the hplc uv analysis was performed on a waters 2695 hplc system

discussion 3 1 effect of complexing ligands in activating persulfates by mn ii fig 1 comparatively exhibited the effect of ppp edta and nta on np degradation and persulfates decomposition in the mn ii pds and mn ii pms systems at ph 5 it was noted that no degradation of np was observed in control experiments i e persulfates ligand and mn ii ligand conjugations fig s1 as can be seen in fig 1 np was hardly degraded in the mn ii persulfates systems indicating the ineffectiveness of mn ii in activating pds and pms similar findings were reported in previous work where the mn ii persulfates conjugation showed sluggish reactivity toward 2 4 dichlorophenol anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 in the scenario of pds these ligands i e ppp edta and nta negligibly affected the performance of mn ii pds system where np was negligibly degraded without pds decomposition during investigated time scale 5 hours interestingly it was found that these ligands had different effect on mn ii pms system in contrast to negligible degradation of np in the mn ii ppp pms system edta and nta substantially accelerated np degradation np was almost completely degraded within 40 min in the presence of edta and within 15 min in the presence of nta meanwhile substantial pms decomposition was observed suggesting complexation of mn ii ion with edta and nta was effective to activate pms for contaminants degradation similar findings were reported in previous work that pms was more easily activated than pds e g by co ii fe ii and fe iii anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 for instance the rate constant for the reaction of fe ii with pms was reported to be 3 104 m 1s 1 three orders of magnitude higher than that of fe ii with pds 2 101 m 1s 1 these findings indicated a higher reactivity of pms as compared to pds which might be due to their difference in structure asymmetric pms vs symmetric pds in other words the neighboring structures of peroxy group o o might determine the reactivity of pds and pms interestingly the degradation of np in the mn ii edta pms system displayed an autocatalytic two stage oxidation an initial lag stage where the degradation of np was very slow followed by a secondary rapid one the occurrence of autocatalysis indicated that the oxidation products of mn ii edta might play an important role comparatively autocatalysis was not observed in the case of nta see the following section for discussion 3 2 involvement of mn iii complex in previous work the sluggish reactivity of mn ii pms system was ascribed to the generation of caged so 4 and the disproportionation of mn iii in situ formed reactions 1 2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 1 mn ii hso 5 m n iii so 4 2 o h 2 2 mn iii mn ii mn iv it is well known that the spontaneous disproportionation of mn iii results in its unlikely contribution to the reactions unless in the presence of complexing ligands or under extremely acidic conditions davies 1969 klewicki and morgan 1998 thus the presence of ligands was expected to facilitate the formation of stabilized mn iii species e g mn iii edta in the mn ii ligand pms system in order to confirm the involvement of mn iii species uv vis absorption spectra at 200 600 nm were monitored as shown in fig 2 the absorption peak at 270 nm characteristic of mn iii species appeared in the case of edta and nta corroborating the formation of mn iii species in the mn ii edta pms and mn ii nta pms system comparatively mn iii signal was not observed in the mn ii ppp pms system these findings indicated that the conversion of mn ii complex to mn iii upon pms oxidation might be highly related to the nature of complexing ligands mn ii complexation with n containing functional groups might show higher reactivity toward pms than complexation with carboxylate group fig s2 possibly due to the better electron donating capacity of n than o chen et al 2019 in previous work stabilized mn iii species was generally considered as an oxidant for contaminants degradation jiang et al 2012 kostka et al 1995 wang et al 2014 the reactivity of np toward mn iii stabilized by edta and nta was independently investigated however no degradation of np was observed fig s3 indicating that the degradation of np in the mn ii ligand pms system was not due to the direct oxidation of mn iii species 3 3 important role of mn iii species to examine whether mn iii play an important role the effect of mn iii ex situ prepared on the reactions of pms with np was investigated it was found that np was rapidly degraded in the mn iii edta pms and mn iii nta pms system accompanied with pms decomposition fig 3 these finding indicated that a rapid interaction occurred between mn iii complex and pms resulting in the formation of reactive intermediates which contributed to np oxidation in the mn ii edta pms system mn iii edta gradually accumulated to its maximum within 30 min coinciding with the following rapid stage of np degradation and pms decomposition fig s4 given the sluggish reactivity of mn iii edta toward np negligible degradation of np was expected in the initial lag stage consistent with the observed experimental findings comparatively autocatalysis was not observed in the mn ii nta pms system where mn iii species was rapidly generated within 1 min in the mn ii ppp pms system mn iii species was hardly generated hindering the subsequent formation of reactive intermediate and no degradation of np was observed therein therefore it was not difficult to understand the difference of ligands in activating pms by mn ii these findings confirmed that the formation of mn iii species was a critical step in the mn ii ligand pms system 3 4 identification of reactive intermediates above results suggested that degradation of np in the mn ii ligand pms system was attributed to the contribution of reactive intermediate generated from the interaction between pms and mn iii species one electron or two electron transfer might be operative for the reaction of pms and mn iii species leading to the formation of so 4 reaction 3 or mn v species reaction 4 3 mn iii complex pms mn iv so 4 4 mn iii complex pms mn v so 4 2 ethanol scavenging experiments were commonly conducted to investigate the role of so 4 in contaminants oxidation due to its high reactivity toward so 4 however in recent work high valent metal oxo species was demonstrated to be effectively quenched by ethanol as well gao et al 2020 wang et al 2018 therefore the effect of ethanol could not distinguish so 4 versus mn v though a remarkable suppression was observed in the presence of ethanol fig s5 fortunately we recently found that pmso could be used as a mechanistic probe to successfully distinguish the relative contribution of so 4 versus mn v due to their marked difference in product formation gao et al 2019 so 4 oxidized pmso to hydroxylated and or polymeric products while pmso2 was generated from pmso oxidation by mn v species gao et al 2019 wang et al 2018 fig 4 showed the time course profiles of pmso degradation and pmso2 formation in the mn iii complex pms systems accompanied with the rapid degradation of pmso appreciable formation of pmso2 was observed moreover the yield of pmso2 η mole of pmso2 produced per mole of pmso degraded was calculated to be approximately 100 regardless of edta or nta this finding indicated that mn v species but not so 4 was the dominant oxidant further esi ms technique was applied in attempt to provide additional piece of evidence for the involvement of mn v species in ms only mode real time total ion chromatography could be obtained and the appearance of new peak with specific molecular mass might be an indication for the occurrence of manganese species as compared to control sample containing mn ii and edta a new peak with molecular ions of m z 345 was detected in the mn iii edta solution ex prepared under positive esi fig s6 it was suggested to be mn iii edta given the mass number of mn and edta as well as their charge number and the ionization case the same molecular ions of m z 345 was also detected in the case of mn ii pms edta system again supporting the generation of mn iii species therein fig 5 moreover a new peak with the molecular ions of m z 361 appeared under positive esi this o additional product might be an indication for the occurrence of omn v edta based on above findings a novel non radical mechanism was postulated for pms activation by mn ii complex the presence of suitable ligands could facilitate the formation of mn iii upon mn ii oxidation by pms where the stabilization of mn iii species was greatly enhanced against its rapid disproportionation hence marked stabilizing mn iii could participate in reactions undergoing further pms oxidation via two electron transfer with the formation of mn v as the dominant reactive intermediate fig 6 3 5 influencing factors 3 5 1 reagent concentration fig 7 a and b comparatively showed the degradation of np by the mn ii ligand pms system in the presence of different mn ii concentration at a fixed mn ii ligand ratio it was found that the oxidation of np was accelerated with increasing mn ii concentration in the case of nta for instance as mn ii concentration increased from 10 to 60 μm the percentage of np degradation increased from 20 to 100 at 2 min this might be explained by the increasing concentration of mn iii species with the increase in mn ii concentration in the presence of edta the enhancement increased as the mn ii concentration increased from 10 to 20 μm while the enhancement was weakened as mn ii concentration further increased to 60 μm this might be due to that at a fixed mn ii ligand ratio the increase in mn ii concentration resulted in the introduction of large amount of edta which could competitively consume pms and or reactive intermediates as a redundant fig 7c and d compared the degradation of np by the mn ii ligand pms system with different mn ii ligand ratio i e mn ii ligand 1 1 1 25 at a fixed mn ii concentration in the case of nta the degradation of np was slightly affected with the ratio ranging from 1 5 to 1 25 while the accelerating effect of nta was attenuated at the mn ii nta ratio of 1 1 this finding might be an indication that the instability of manganese intermediates at a low mn ii nta ratio while the reactivity of manganese intermediates was negligibly affected with the ratio ranging from 1 5 to 1 25 jiang et al 2012 in contrast in the case of edta the enhancement of np oxidation was attenuated with the decrease in the ratio i e the increase in edta concentration resulting from the consumption of pms and or reactive intermediates by edta fig 7e and f compared the effect of pms concentration on the np degradation in the case of edta increasing pms concentration resulted in the enhancement of np degradation this was not difficult to understand that the increase of oxidant concentration could accelerate the formation of reactive intermediate interestingly the oxidation of np was not affected by pms concentration in the case of nta fig s7 showed the fast formation of almost identical amount of mn iii nta within 1 min regardless the concentration of pms indicating the fast generation of mn iii the negligible effect of pms on the mn ii nta pms system might be another indication for the rapid generation of mn v species from mn iii oxidation and suggested that the reaction of mn v and np might be the limiting step in the mn ii nta pms systems warranting further investigation 3 5 2 solution ph as can be seen in fig s8 np was completely degraded within 100 min in the mn ii edta pms system and within 20 min in the mn ii nta pms system at ph 8 it was found that the activating ability of mn ii complex attenuated as the solution ph increased to 8 for instance np was almost completely degraded at 40 min at ph 5 in the mn ii edta pms system fig 1 while the percentage of np at 40 min degradation decreased to 30 at ph 8 fig s8 this might be resulted from the combined effect of ph on the formation of manganese complex as well as the reactivity of manganese intermediates unfortunately the nature of manganese intermediates especially mn v species in situ formed are far from clear due to the extreme difficulty in their isolation and identification moreover the performance of mn ii edta pms and mn ii nta pms in unbuffered systems was also examined effective abatement of np was also achieved that np was almost completely degraded within 50 min in the case of edta and 15min in the case of nta fig s9 3 5 3 inorganic ions the effect of inorganic ions on the efficiency of mn ii ligand pms system was investigated fig s10 as can be seen the influence of both chloride and bicarbonate on np degradation in the mn ii edta pms and mn ii nta pms systems was insignificant the inhibitory effect induced by chloride and bicarbonate 1 5 mm on np removal was less than 15 this insignificant influence of inorganic ions were also reported in other pms activated systems based on the non radical mechanism e g carbocatalysis duan et al 2018b guan et al 2017 comparatively contamination abatement in advanced oxidation based on free radicals were usually suppressed appreciably in the presence of these inorganic ions yang et al 2019 this observed insignificant influence of chloride and bicarbonate in mn ii ligand pms system further confirm our proposed non radial mechanism involved therein 3 6 comparison with fe ii based system fig 8 comparatively showed the percentage of ba and atz degradation in the mn ii and fe ii based systems as can be seen the addition of edta and nta greatly enhanced the degradation of ba and atz in the mn ii pms system for instance as compared to negligible degradation of atz in the mn ii pms system atz was completely degraded in the mn ii edta pms and mn ii nta pms systems this might be due to that the presence of ligands facilitated the generation of manganese intermediates responsible for the contaminants abasement in contrast fe ii pms and the fe ii ligand pms system showed limited reactivity the percentage of ba and atz degradation decreased from 10 and 30 to almost 0 in the presence of ligands similar finding was reported in previous work where the presence of ligands weakened the ability of fe ii in persulfates activation and this inhibition was explained by the steric hindrance of ligands hindering the interaction between persulfates and fe ii wang et al 2019 the effective abatement of refractory ba and atz in the mn ii ligand pms system suggested that it was a much more effective oxidation technology in water treatment as comped to fe ii based systems further research might be needed to explore the efficiency of this complex system towards various contaminants under various conditions and gain insight into the oxidative characteristic of manganese intermediates in situ formed 4 conclusion in this work the impact of different complexing ligands on the mn ii persulfates system was systematically examined for the first time the following conclusions were obtained which might improve the understanding of pms activation as well as manganese chemistry in environmental application in contrast to mn ii as an inefficient activator for pms mn ii complex chelated by edta and nta exhibited appreciable ability in pms activation while ppp had no influence comparatively these ligands negligibly affect the performance of mn ii pds system showing sluggish reactivity effective abatement of contaminants i e np ba and atz were achieved by the treatment of mn ii ligand pms oxidation technology where the removal efficacy was highly dependent on reagents concentration and solution ph unlike conventional pms activation that generated free radicals as major oxidants manganese intermediates served as the primary reactive intermediates in the mn ii ligand pms system the generation of mn iii species was found to be a critical step for contaminants degradation in the mn ii ligand pms system which was further subjected to pms oxidation leading to the formation of reactive intermediate high valent mn species mn v but not free radicals was demonstrated to be the dominant reactive oxidant by using methyl phenyl sulfide pmso as a chemical probe a non radical mechanism was proposed that stabilized mn iii generated from the oxidation of mn ii complex further oxidized by pms to mn v complex via two electron transfer which serve as the reactive oxidant rather than so 4 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

17167,wetlands are among the earth s most efficient ecosystems for carbon sequestration but can also emit potent greenhouse gases ghgs depending on how they are managed global management strategies have sought to maximize carbon drawdown by wetlands by manipulating wetland hydrology to inhibit bacterially mediated emissions however it has recently been hypothesized within wetlands that viruses have the potential to dictate the magnitude and direction of ghg emissions by attacking prokaryotes involved in the carbon cycle here we tested this hypothesis in a whole ecosystem manipulation by hydrologically restoring a degraded wetland rewetting and investigated the changes in ghg emissions prokaryotes viruses and virus host interactions we found that hydrological restoration significantly increased prokaryotic diversity methanogenic methanomicrobia as well as putative iron sulfate cyclers geobacteraceae nitrogen cyclers nitrosomonadaceae and fermentative bacteria koribacteraceae these results provide insights into successional microbial community shifts during rehabilitation additionally in response to watering viral induced prokaryotic mortality declined by 77 resulting in limited carbon released by viral shunt that was significantly correlated with the 2 8 fold reduction in wetland carbon emissions our findings highlight for the first time the potential implications of viral infections in soil prokaryotes on wetland greenhouse gas dynamics and confirm the importance of wetland rehabilitation as a tool to offset carbon emissions keywords carbon cycle environmental watering greenhouse gases rehabilitation viral infection wetland 1 introduction wetlands are broadly acknowledged for their role as major carbon sinks and soil microorganisms underlie several wetland biogeochemical processes important to carbon sequestration including nutrient cycling and carbon decomposition mitsch and gosselink 2007 freshwater wetlands despite occupying less than 10 of the global surface area are known to store up to 33 of the world s soil carbon limpens et al 2008 nahlik and fennessy 2016 long term storage of organic carbon in freshwater wetlands is achieved due to accelerated plant growth and slow microbial decomposition rates promoted by the presence of water that limits oxygen availability and creates suboxic to anoxic conditions bridgham et al 2014 anaerobic conditions however can potentially increase the production of ch4 that has 32 times the global warming potential of co2 neubauer and megonigal 2015 and can potentially offset soil carbon accumulation transforming wetlands into carbon sources bridgham et al 2013 the hydroperiod of a wetland is one of the environmental factors capable of shaping microbial community composition and this is especially true for seasonal wetlands the temporary presence of water drastically affects the microbial ecology and ecosystem biogeochemistry by modifying the redox potential within the soil and the availability of alternative other than oxygen electron acceptors boon et al 2014 along a decreasing energy yield scale labile organic carbon is broken down into co2 and ch4 through numerous reactions that involve diverse prokaryotic functional groups such as denitrifying manganese iron and sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea bridgham et al 2014 in the past decades however rising temperatures decreasing rainfall rates and the conversion to agricultural uses have jeopardized the carbon cycling services of freshwater wetlands davidson 2014 for instance the reduced frequency of wetland s hydroperiod promotes oxygen availability and leads to high microbial respiration rates hirota et al 2005 as a result disturbed wetlands could then release more greenhouse gases than they sequester switching them from carbon sinks to carbon sources whalen 2005 arid and semi arid zones cover more than 33 of the earth s land surface and rain filled wetlands in semi arid regions have been shown to highly contribute to long term carbon sequestration carnell et al 2018 kingsford 1997 nairn and kingsford 2012 however the increased degradation caused by humans can shift these wetlands from ephemeral wetlands to grazing or farmland by reducing natural water flow finlayson et al 2019 in the last two decades governments and institutions internationally have started to recommend either active or passive rehabilitation practices that remove pressures that cause wetland degradation such as grazing agriculture and water diversion ramsar 2016 tanentzap and coomes 2012 wong 2008 rehabilitation practices that actively aim to restore the original wetland hydrology or do this through once off managed events also known as environmental watering have been previously assessed as more effective compared to passive rehabilitation practices i e grazing removal for reducing carbon emissions and or promoting biodiversity more rapidly bossio et al 2006 chandra et al 2020 limpert et al 2020 treby et al 2020 however although rehabilitation practices have had global positive recognition for biodiversity further empirical evidence evaluating the microbial response to hydrological rehabilitation is needed to better understand the effects of short term manipulation on the microbial communities involved in the carbon cycle in addition to the prokaryotic members a wetland soil microbiome also includes fungi and viruses sylvia et al 1998 viruses are the most numerous biological entities on the planet and play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by influencing prokaryotic dynamics and biogeochemical cycling jackson and jackson 2008 weinbauer 2004 temperate viruses are those viruses whose infection does not result in immediate cell death lytic strategy instead the viral genome is integrated into the host genome lysogenic strategy ackermann and dubow 1987 the lytic strategy boosts the expression and activation of auxiliary metabolic genes amgs that are acquired from the host and involved in several functions including carbon nitrogen sulfur and lipid metabolism emerson et al 2018 roux et al 2016 trubl et al 2018 in ecosystems characterized by high proportion of recalcitrant carbon i e rivers and wetlands the carbon released by viral lysis despite accounting for only a small fraction of the total available carbon could make significant contributions to the assimilation and utilization of labile carbon by prokaryotes and therefore represents a major control over the carbon cycle peduzzi 2016 in contrast a lysogenic strategy can confer competitive advantages to the hosts including a change in prokaryote morphology and or superinfection immunity weinbauer 2004 williamson et al 2017 however under unfavorable conditions lysogeny can also negatively affect the host s metabolism by repressing host metabolic process genes and or by reducing the prokaryote s ability to utilize organic matter therefore reducing their growth rate paul 2008 with that in mind it has been hypothesized that there is a direct link between the viral infection rate and the production of greenhouse gases via the prokaryotic decomposition of consumed organic matter bonetti et al 2019 a higher lytic rate might boost carbon recycling resulting in increased carbon emissions while a higher lysogenic rate might drastically reduce organic matter utilization by the prokaryotic host hence reducing greenhouse gas emissions bonetti et al 2019 the aim of this study was 1 to explore the correlation of virus prokaryote interactions to the watering event this is the first study that aims to investigate the potential correlation between viral infection rates and the emissions of greenhouse gases by measuring co2 and ch4 emissions before and after the addition of water and 2 to investigate the shift in prokaryotic community structure triggered by the introduction of water in a whole ecosystem wetland manipulation a key objective of this research was to bring new insights into viral ecology in freshwater ecosystems addressing significant knowledge gaps in the global understanding of the role of viral infections in the carbon cycle additionally we sought to generate practical information to inform wetland management plans by investigating the environmental factors that trigger viral infections with the view that managing viruses in wetlands may provide a potential new strategy for minimizing carbon emissions 2 methods 2 1 site overview and experimental design our study took place in the semi arid noorong area within the murray river catchment riverina region in new south wales nsw south east australia semi arid regions represent the dominant type of bioregion in australia covering up to 70 of australia in nsw the total wetland area encompasses ca 4 320 000 ha and the murray riverina region is one of the catchments with the highest percentage of wetland area relative to total land area kingsford et al 2003 however despite its extent and ecological relevance by hosting more than 50 of nationally important wetlands listed in the diwa directory of important wetlands in australia more than 20 of the murray riverina catchment has been altered as a result of agricultural practices increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall rates kingsford et al 2004 since 2001 the office of environment heritage oeh in nsw has been promoting a rehabilitation plan termed environmental watering whose main goal is through water delivery the restoration of the original hydroperiod of wetlands subject to human disturbances nias et al 2003 this study was conducted on a river red gum wetland on private land 3 ha 35 374296 143 981245 in which grazing has been excluded and that has been part of the environmental watering project since 2005 our experiment consisted of a whole ecosystem manipulation in which environmental water from irrigation channels was added to a dry wetland for three days at 18 ml day 1 for a total of ca 50 ml greenhouse gas measurements and samples for microbial community composition prokaryotic abundance viral abundance and viral production were collected during three phases fig 1 pre watering dry 17 10 2018 day 1 twice when water was filling 1 in the wetland filling 1 at day 3 filling 2at day 5 and when the wetland was full full day 10 however due to cost restrictions only extra greenhouse gas measurements and samples for analysis of microbial community composition were collected during the second filling 2 phase samples for soil carbon and nitrogen analysis were only collected during the dry phase the experimental design consisted of two sites in the wetland with two zones at each site one in the middle of the wetland and one at the edge hereafter referred to as zones for each response variable three replicates were measured or sampled at each zone both zones middle and edge at each site were completely dry at the beginning of the experiment dry only the middle zones were inundated during the filling 1 phase and both zones middle and edge were inundated at the filling 2 and full phase of the experiment table s1 2 2 soil analysis before the introduction of water the soil top 0 5 cm were collected in triplicate from each zone using a 50 mm diameter polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe we followed soil analyses as per carnell et al 2018 in the laboratory soil cores were extruded dried at 60 c and homogenized with an rm 200 electric mortar grinder retsch haan germany a microelemental cn analyzer with callidus v5 1 software eurovector pavia italy was used to analyze the c and n of soil samples soil carbon and nitrogen densities g cm 3 were obtained by multiplying the percentage of organic carbon by the soil bulk density molar c n ratio was obtained by normalizing carbon and nitrogen percentages to the soil dry weights 2 3 greenhouse gas emissions co2 and ch4 measurements were taken using 34 1 l pvc static chambers when the wetland was dry and 27 6 l floating chambers when the wetland was inundated floating chambers were made from white plastic tubs in order to reduce solar radiative heating of chamber air chambers were cautiously inserted into the water surface at about 2 cm depth to avoid surface boundary layer disturbance that can potentially affect measurement accuracy as previously observed in low wind and low wave environments matthews et al 2003 for water depth data at each replicate site see table s1 in addition prior to sampling we confirmed that gas concentration within the chamber was in equilibrium with atmospheric levels a los gatos ultra portable greenhouse gas analyzer ugga was used to measure co2 and ch4 parts per million ppm s for 300 s for each chamber and the emission rates over time were calculated using a standard flux equation ollivier et al 2019a although floating chambers allow to capture both diffusive and ebullitive emissions in this study we focused solely on diffusive emissions therefore emission rates were accepted when the r2 value of the regression line was 0 70 repo et al 2007 to avoid the incorporation of intermittent ebullitive emissions ollivier et al 2019b co2 and ch4 fluxes with negative or slightly positive values 0 1 to 0 1 g co2 m 2 d 1 and 0 001 to 0 001 g ch4 m 2 d 1 were included with r2 values limited by the accuracy of the instrument ugga and did not necessarily reflect the quality of the measurements repo et al 2007 ch4 emissions were converted into co2 equivalents co2 e over a projected 100 year period 32 fold co2 to measure the global warming potential gwp neubauer and megonigal 2015 samples were collected during each phase dry filling 1 filling 2 full with three replicates per zone 2 4 microbial community diversity using a modified 3 ml syringe the top 1 cm of soil was collected at each phase dry filling 1 filling 2 full with three replicates each zone to match the greenhouse gas flux measurements soil samples were stabilized with rna later poulos 2015 and stored at 20 c waiting for further processing genomic dna was extracted using the qiagen dneasy powersoil kit from a range of 0 22 to 0 26 g of the stored sample before sequencing with illumina miseq the v4 variable region of 16s rrna was amplified with the eubacterial primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 walters et al 2016 and purified using zymo clean and concentrate kit 2 5 total prokaryotic abundance for the determination of prokaryotic abundance ca 1 cm3 of surface soil was fixed with glutaraldehyde final concentration 2 and stored at 20 c until processing samples were collected during each phase dry filling 1 full with three replicates per zone samples were processed according to the protocol from danovaro 2010 see supplementary materials for detailed protocol 2 6 viral abundance production and viral induced prokaryotic mortality for the analysis of viral abundance 1 cm3 of surface soil was collected without the addition of any fixative this was because of the recognized loss of viral particles as a result of the use of formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde to preserve the soil samples corinaldesi et al 2012 samples were collected during each phase dry filling 1 full with three replicates per zone samples were processed according to a modified protocol from danovaro et al 2001 see supplementary materials for detailed protocol the analysis of viral production was determined by time course experiment using the dilution approach dell anno et al 2009 approximately 1 cm3 of surface soil was diluted dilution 1 1 vol vol and collected after 1 5 3 6 and 12 h of incubation in the dark at in situ temperature samples were collected during each phase dry filling 1 full with three replicates per zone soil samples were then processed following the same protocol used for viral abundance it was not possible using the standard method of linear regression because the viral abundance does not progress according to a linear trend for this reason the net viral production was calculated as the maximum increment of viral particles per gram dry weight per hour the viral induced prokaryotic mortality vipm was calculated as follows v i p m k p 100 p a where kp prokaryotes killed by viral infection pa prokaryotic abundance kp was calculated as viral production burst size the burst size i e the average number of viruses released by a single prokaryotic cell due to viral infection was assumed to be of 90 virus cell 1 as previously reported for wetlands qin et al 2017 the carbon released by the viral shunt was calculated by converting the number of killed prokaryotes into c content using 20 fg c cell 1 as a conversion factor rastelli et al 2015 2 7 statistical analyses 2 7 1 soil analyses total carbon

zone as fixed factors soil carbon analysis was analyzed using a two way analysis of variance anova with site and zone as fixed factors total carbon emissions were square root transformed for homogeneity and normality before being statistically tested using the statistical program spss version 26 however as five samples showed negative total carbon emissions a positive constant was added to all carbon emission samples before transformation to allow for positive data normalization mcdonald 2009 ollivier et al 2019a post hoc tukey s tests were run when significant differences p 0 05 were encountered linear regression models were performed to investigate the correlation between the carbon released from the viral shunt and total co2 and ch4 equivalent emissions 2 7 2 microbial communities bioinformatic analyses were performed with qiime 2 version 2019 1 bolyen et al 2019 using dada 2 pipeline on raw sequences after being trimmed to between 70 and 230 base pairs forward and between 45 and 210 base pairs reverse the resulting asvs amplicon sequence variants were classified using the silva reference database v132 99 identity criterion 16s 18s ssu small subunit asvs were

s2 water depth was significantly affected by the interaction between site phase and zone p 0 005 table s1 during the dry phase both sites at both zones were dry during the filling 1 phase only the middle zones were inundated with overall deeper water in site 2 overall during the last two phases of the experiment filling 2 and full the middle zones showed 2 7 fold higher water levels 37 6 1 6 cm compared to the edge while site 2 showed 1 2 fold higher water levels 26 8 6 4 cm compared to site 1 the co2 equivalents of co2 and ch4 showed significant differences from the interaction between site phase and zone co2 p 0 001 ch4 p 0 01 table s7 compared to the dry phase when the wetland was fully inundated co2 emissions were 5 5 fold and 8 7 fold lower in site 1 and site 2 respectively in addition during filling 2 and full phases co2 emissions were almost 2 fold higher in the middle zones ch4 emissions started to show positive values during the filling 2 phase during filling 2 and full phases ch4 emissions in the middle zones were almost 2 2 fold higher compared to the edge and 1 4 fold higher in site 2 compared to site 1 3 2 total bacterial community structure the analysis of the microbial community composition associated with wetland soil resulted in 4 124 626 sequences and more than 26 000 asvs see table s3 the α diversity indices shannon and pielou indicated a significant interaction between phase and zone p 0 009 table s6 here while there was little difference in diversity across phases in the edge zone the middle had its lowest diversity in the dry phase and the highest diversity in the full phase a clear shift of the most abundant classes at the same time as the introduction of water was observed throughout the experiment fig s1 acidobacteriia and deltaproteobacteria showed a trend of increasing relative abundances after the introduction of water and were at least 3 fold more abundant during the full phase compared to the dry phase conversely the relative abundance of oxyphotobacteria and actinobacteria decreased by 2 to 3 fold throughout the experiment archaeal class methanomicrobia was observed across zones during both filling 1 and filling 2 similarly β diversity was also significantly influenced by an interaction between phase and zone permanova outputs table s4 pair wise test table s5 early phases dry and filling 1 were significantly different from filling 2 and full sampling times at the middle zone while at the edge only the dry phase showed differences with both filling 2 and full simper analysis fig 2 showed that during the dry phase at the edge there were higher relative abundances of blastococcus spp actinobacteria and chitinophagaceae bacteroidia compared to the full phase dry and filling 1 phases at the edge showed overall less candidatus koribacter acidobacteriia but more skermanella spp alphaproteobacteria compared to the filling 2 phase arthrobacter spp actinobacteria nostocaceae oxyphotobacteria and pontibacter spp bacteroidia were relatively more abundant during the dry and filling 1 phase in the middle zone compared to filling 2 and full ammonia oxidizing nitrosospira spp gammaproteobacteria were overall more abundant during filling 2 at both zones while geobacter spp deltaproteobacteria was relatively more abundant during the full phase in the middle zone the microbial community composition was linked to greenhouse gas emissions by using the weighted unifrac data the db rda analysis between co2 and ch4 emissions converted into carbon equivalents and the 16s rrna gene data explained 12 2 of the variation in the first two axes fig 3 axis 1 db rda1 confirmed the separation of phases according to ch4 emissions with a positive correlation between ch4 emissions and microbial samples collected during the full phase especially in the middle zone of the wetland r 0 774 best aic 82 62 the middle zone filled up with water at a faster rate compared to the edge zone and this has likely promoted a faster microbial response axis 2 db rda2 separated the dry phase from the filling 1 and filling 2 phases with a negative correlation r 0 774 best aic 81 87 between co2 emissions and filling 1 phase at middle zone and filling 2 at both zones this is likely related to the fact that the edge zone was still dry during the filling 1 phase and showed higher co2 concentrations compared to the middle zone during the same phase 3 3 prokaryotic abundance viral abundance and virus to prokaryote abundance ratio the prokaryotic abundance was significantly affected by the interaction between site phase and zone p 0 03 fig 4 a b prokaryotic abundance showed the same trend across sites with higher values at the edge only during the full phase and lower values at the edge compared to the middle during both the dry and filling 1 phases moreover prokaryotic abundance measured at site 1 was more than 2 fold higher than that in site 2 fig 4a b significant differences in viral abundance were found in response to the interaction between site and zone p 0 007 fig 4a b the viral abundance in site 1 was 1 fold higher at the middle compared to the edge while in site 2 viral abundance was almost 1 5 fold lower at the middle compared to the edge the interaction between phase and zone p 0 0001 table s6 fig 4a b resulted in higher values of viral abundance at the middle zone only during the dry phase while viral abundance showed lower values at the middle compared to the edge during both filling 1 and full phases although the trend of viral abundance from the dry phase to the full phase showed decreasing values across sites significant differences were found from the interaction between site and phase p 0 0001 table s6 fig 4a b this interaction was likely driven by the fact that while in site 1 viral abundance decreased by 19 from filling 1 to full phase in site 2 viral abundance decreased by 67 from filling 1 to full phase which was more than 3 fold compared to site 1 the virus to prokaryote abundance ratio showed significant differences across site p 0 0001 and from the interaction between phase and zone p 0 02 and zone and site p 0 02 table s6 the virus to prokaryote abundance ratio at site 1 ranged from 0 10 0 04 to 1 16 0 07 at phase filling 1 and dry respectively and was 5 fold lower compared to that at site 2 that ranged from 0 55 0 01 to 5 0 4 at phase full and pre respectively compared to the full phase the virus to prokaryote abundance ratio was higher at the edge zone compared to the middle during both the dry and filling 1 phases the virus to prokaryote abundance ratio in site 2 at the edge was almost 2 fold higher than that at the middle while in site 1 the virus to prokaryote abundance ratio value between the edge 0 62 0 09 and the middle 0 41 0 11 was similar fig 5 3 4 viral production and viral induced prokaryotic mortality significant differences were found in net viral production across phases p 0 02 table s6 and between sites p 0 04 fig 6 a b as a result of the introduction of water the net viral production at the full phase 1 3 0 3 1010 viruses g 1 d 1 was 3 3 fold lower compared to that during the dry phase 4 1 4 1010 viruses g 1 d 1 similar to the viral abundance viral production at site 2 3 8 1 4 1010 viruses g 1 d 1 was 1 8 fold higher compared to that of site 1 2 1 0 6 1010 viruses g 1 d 1 the viral induced prokaryotic mortality was 3 6 fold higher overall in site 2 compared to site 1 p 0 002 during the dry phase the viral induced prokaryotic mortality was significantly higher than during the wet phases filling 1 and full p 0 02 fig 6a b this resulted in up to 69 more killed prokaryotes per gram per day during the dry phase compared to the filling 1 and full phases related to the higher viral induced prokaryotic mortality the carbon released by viral lysis was higher during the dry phase 9 3 3 1 µg c g 1 d 1 compared to filling 1 7 9 3 µg c g 1 d 1 and full 2 9 0 7 µg c g 1 d 1 3 5 carbon released by viral lysis and greenhouse gas emissions a significant positive correlation was detected between the carbon released by viral lysis and co2 emissions p 0 0005 fig 7 a and between the carbon released by viral lysis and the total co2 and ch4 emissions expressed as carbon equivalents p 0 0005 fig 7c conversely a significant negative correlation was observed between the carbon released by viral lysis and ch4 emissions p 0 003 fig 7b 4 discussion this study aimed to explore the response to hydrological rehabilitation of prokaryotes viruses and prokaryote virus interaction and the effects on greenhouse gas emissions specifically we want to test whether viral infection strategies can have a prevalent role in regulating the production of greenhouse gas emissions we found that rehabilitation increased prokaryotic diversity and promoted a significant shift of prokaryotic groups involved in methanogenesis nitrogen and sulfate iron cycling and fermentation moreover the introduction of water reduced the number of prokaryotic cells killed by viruses by 69 when the wetland was fully inundated the minor role of viral shunt and therefore the decreased rate of organic carbon recycling through the viral shunt was positively correlated with the reduced carbon emissions 4 1 environmental watering increased the relative abundance of microbial functional groups holding anaerobic metabolisms the microbial community structure was strongly affected by the introduction of water that promoted prokaryotic community succession throughout the experiment the dry phase was characterized by the predominance of aerobic metabolism and microbial taxa involved in organic carbon decomposition and turnover this includes chitinophagaceae bacteroidia and blastococcus spp actinobacteria that were found more abundant at the edge and the saprophytic genus arthrobacter actinobacteria yu et al 2012 relatively more abundant at the middle both phyla are involved in the decomposition of complex organic carbons as previously documented in arctic peatlands tveit et al 2013 and grasslands jenkins et al 2009 and greatly contribute to the production and emission of co2 limpert et al 2020 here co2 emissions were for instance higher in dry soils and before the introduction of water finally the high relative abundance of massilia spp gammaproteobacteria under dry conditions can be explained with the ability of this taxon to survive under incredibly arid conditions and possibly feeding on the products of cyanobacteria aslam et al 2016 that were 3 to 4 fold more abundant during the dry phase compared to the full phase once the environmental watering commenced microbial functional groups involved in methane cycling and fermentation started to become more abundant however from a similar ecosystem level manipulation of environmental watering on a semi arid wetland limpert et al 2020 observed how significant shifts in carbon emissions and microbial community structure may take up to 24 h after the introduction of water which was similar to what was seen in this study for instance in our study although methanomicrobia were already present at the filling 1 phase the high abundance of taxa involved in carbon decomposition such as those from the actinobacteria and bacteroidia groups might explain the high co2 emissions and slow increase of ch4 emissions during the filling 1 phase the archaeal methanogenic class methanomicrobia was relatively more abundant when ch4 emissions started to significantly increase filling 2 phase another taxon that was found highly abundant during the filling 2 phase was candidatus koribacter acidobacteriia candidatus koribacter is a fermentative bacteria able to decompose organic matter into a substrate available to methanogenic archaea king and weber 2007 given their role in facilitating the anaerobic hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis over more competitive anaerobic reactions i e nitrogen sulfate reduction it is expected that this class was most abundant in conjunction with methanogens and linked to the increased ch4 emissions as filling 1 progressed inundation and water logged conditions decreased o2 diffusion allowing for a diversification of anaerobic metabolic pathways in the inundated phases filling 1 filling 2 full which was captured by the increased relative abundances of microbial species involved in nitrogen sulfate and iron cycles for instance ammonia oxidizing nitrosospira spp gammaproteobacteria were overall highly abundant at both zones during the filling 2 phase and iron sulfate cycler geobacter spp deltaproteobacteria were higher during the full phase in the middle zone geobacteraceae is a microbial family involved in methane cycling and because of the conductivity of their pili geobacteraceae were previously found to have a major role in interspecies electron exchange with methanogenic archaea thus facilitating the conversion of organic carbon into ch4 morita et al 2011 this might have contributed to the highest ch4 emissions measured during the full phase in the middle zone despite the low abundance of methanogenic classes for instance a previous study documented a low abundance of methanogens coupled with high geobacteraceae leading to high methane emissions during a watering experiment limpert et al 2020 4 2 viral infection strategies were influenced by the introduction of water and linked to carbon emission rates our research study shows that virus to prokaryote ratio viral production and viral induced prokaryotic mortality decreased significantly with the introduction of water the environmental changes triggered by waterlogged soils i e temperature ph and redox might have created unfavorable conditions that reduced the rates of viral replication through lytic infection thus promoting a lysogenic viral strategy in which viral lytic genes and host s metabolic processes are repressed the virus to prokaryote ratio can be used as a proxy of potential viral infection danovaro 2010 given that viral abundance which is strictly dependent on viral burst size is correlated to the microbial growth rate for instance a higher virus to prokaryote ratio reflects higher viral abundance over prokaryotic abundance and suggests a predominance of lytic strategy over lysogeny middelboe 2000 therefore the decreasing trend of virus to prokaryote ratio between the dry phase and the full phase could indicate a transition from lytic to lysogenic strategy likely promoted by the introduction of water alternatively the lower virus to prokaryote ratio after the introduction of water could also be justified with higher viral decay either through the physical removal of phages from the sediment by the water flow or with loss of infectivity triggered by the increased difficulty in finding a suitable host as microbial communities become more diverse jackson and jackson 2008 weinbauer and rassoulzadegan 2004 the values observed for viral production and viral induced prokaryotic mortality when the wetland was full were more than 3 fold and 4 fold lower respectively than those during the dry phase our findings suggest that the high viral production and viral induced prokaryotic mortality might reflect a dominant viral lytic strategy when the wetland was dry under this condition the prokaryotic assemblages were mainly grazed by viruses top down control that determined the release of a higher amount of carbon biomass via the viral shunt middelboe et al 2008 here the high viral impact might have contributed to increasing the rates of microbial mediated recycling of the soil organic matter with major consequences on c cycling and nutrient regeneration for instance in our experiment the µgc d 1 released by killing prokaryotes was significantly correlated to the co2 emissions and the total carbon emission equivalents here the highest total emissions were registered during the dry phase during which the maximum percent of killed cells was also detected 16 4 d 1 in contrast to co2 emissions ch4 emissions showed a negative correlation with the carbon released through viral lysis methanogenic archaea detected in our study belonged to the class methanomicrobia methanomicrobium spp whose infecting virus was discovered in 1989 assigned to the bacteriophage family siphoviridae and classified as a head tail dsdna virus with a lytic replication cycle lange and ahring 2001 meile et al 1989 pina et al 2011 prangishvili 2013 robb et al 1995 if our hypothesis on the influence of viral infections on the production of greenhouse gases holds true the increasing abundance of methanogenic archaea during the final two phases of our experiment filling 2 and full might have triggered archaea infecting viruses with lytic infection strategy that might have contributed to the increasing production in ch4 emissions however considering that the relative abundance of methanogenic archaea represented only 0 5 of the total prokaryotic community the viral host dynamics of the bacteria population might have overridden those of the methanogenic archaea counterparts thus explaining the negative correlation between ch4 emissions and the µgc d 1 released by killing prokaryotes further studies should consider the approach to viral and phage metagenomics techniques and archaeal production rates during infection for understanding microbial assemblages underlying the biogeochemical processes involved in the production of major greenhouse gas species co2 ch4 we found that both prokaryotic and viral abundance resulted in high concentration 109 1010 and this is similar to that previously reported for wetlands that showed the highest values compared to several soil types such as hot cold deserts 104 109 and agricultural soils 107 109 williamson et al 2017 the introduction of water significantly affected viral abundance in our experiment the prokaryotic abundance did not change significantly throughout the watering event however the viral abundance was overall higher during the dry phase following a decreasing trend in abundance once the water was added to the wetland previous studies conducted on permanently inundated wetlands revealed no correlation of prokaryotic abundance to water content but a significantly lower viral abundance in dry wetlands compared to wet wetlands williamson et al 2005 such discrepancies between our study and others could be related to the fact that the introduction of water to a dry wetland and a short term reaction to rapid environmental changes i e water level temperature and ph can differ from the conditions promoted by long term acclimatization to water presence in addition the introduction of water created a condition of high water turbidity high turbidity levels are characterized by a dense concentration of suspended particles starkley and karr 1984 although the contribution of the water column dynamics and aquatic viral communities to the benthic processes are still largely unclear and debated suspended particles have been found to provide an important ecological service to the benthic viral community by binding free living viruses and acting as scavengers of viruses suspended particles could overall reduce benthic viral abundance and impact kernegger et al 2009 weinbauer et al 2009 explaining the decreasing viral abundance with increasing water levels observed in this study not all prokaryote or viral response variables changed significantly in response to environmental watering for instance sites showed significant spatial differences for prokaryotic abundance viral abundance viral production and all the parameters directly correlated to microbial abundances and viral production such as virus to prokaryote ratio and viral induced prokaryotic mortality these site difference may be related to the differing water levels between the sites whereby site 2 was consistently deeper than site 1 pinto et al 2013 observed how water depth was able to influence the microbial component with water depth having a negative relationship with prokaryotic abundance but a positive relationship with the virus to prokaryote abundance ratio this could explain why in site 2 compared to site 1 we observed a lower prokaryotic abundance and higher virus to prokaryote ratio in general viral abundance is linked to host prokaryotic abundance however viruses are strictly host specific specific viruses infect specific taxa and the total number of prokaryotic cells counted might not reflect all available viral hosts emerson 2019 weinbauer and rassoulzadegan 2004 moreover viral abundance and replication is dependent upon microbial growth rate rather than prokaryotic abundance middelboe 2000 this is one possible reason for the lack of a significant correlation between prokaryotic abundance and viral abundance in our experiment further in wetlands and other aquatic ecosystems the spatial patterns in viral abundance and production have been positively correlated to nitrogen and phosphorus concentration and primary productivity jackson and jackson 2008 payet and suttle 2013 however no significant differences were observed with respect to carbon and nitrogen content across sites or zones therefore our findings indicate that there might be other factors we didn t measure such as temperature ph or redox directly affecting virus survival possibly through virus adsorption to soil as previously reported hurst et al 1980 and or doc concentration able to stimulate prokaryotic abundance and productivity farnell jackson and ward 2003 4 3 methodological and interpretation drawbacks it has been recently highlighted that the use of derived viral parameters i e virus to prokaryote abundance ratio to infer major viral dynamics such as the replication strategies must be used with caution parikka et al 2017 for instance viral and prokaryotic abundance alone are not enough to predict the nature of ongoing viral infection strategies in the studied ecosystem therefore in this study the virus to prokaryote abundance ratio has been used in conjunction with other determined variables i e viral production in order to avoid misinterpretations as previously suggested parikka et al 2017 parikka et al 2017 found no significant relationship between the virus to prokaryote ratio and viral production this suggests that in general 1 the virus to prokaryote ratio is more likely affected by the fluctuation of prokaryotic abundance and 2 the viral production can be a more valuable and reliable variable to be used in the investigation of viral replication strategies however in this study the prokaryotic abundance was not significantly different across phases therefore the decreasing virus to prokaryote ratio over the course of the experiment was likely related to the viral abundance that was significantly reduced by the introduction of water due to a number of different possible explanations such as suspended particles viral decay difficulties in finding hosts or a shift to lysogenic strategy kernegger et al 2009 weinbauer et al 2009 weinbauer and rassoulzadegan 2004 therefore the virus to prokaryote ratio did not allow us to infer without doubts the dominant viral infection strategies however it is still an important component to understand viral host abundance relationships viral production and prokaryotic abundance together with the prokaryotic burst size allow to calculate another derived viral parameter which is the viral induced prokaryotic mortality given the impossibility in this study to estimate the prokaryotic burst size using approaches such as the transmission electron microscopy for each prokaryotic cell killed by viruses we assumed an average burst size of 90 viruses cell 1 qin et al 2017 to date the burst size provided by qin et al 2017 is the only estimate available for freshwater wetlands previous literature found that the burst size calculated from freshwater aquatic ecosystems i e lakes rivers reservoirs was significantly higher 28 40 compared to that of marine systems 20 25 parada et al 2006 wommack and colwell 2000 moreover burst size can increase in more productive ecosystems given the direct correlation to the microbial growth rate that is likely favoured by enhanced production weinbauer 2004 prokaryotic burst size has also been found to be very high for terrestrial sediments 100 vandieken et al 2017 therefore considering that our experiment investigated the transition from a terrestrial ecosystem to an aquatic one the burst size assumed in this study represents the closest estimation of the actual number of viral particles released per each killed prokaryotic cell lastly we used 20 fg c cell 1 as conversion factor to convert the killed prokaryotic cells into carbon content as this is the most widely adopted conversion factor in literature in the last 30 years in marine and freshwater ecosystems danovaro 2010 duarte et al 2008 fukuda et al 1998 rastelli et al 2015 moreover previous studies in wetlands have adopted 20 fg c cell 1 as most bacterial cell estimates are in the range of 10 20 fg c cell 1 cotner and biddanda 2002 waiser and robarts 2004 especially for cells smaller than 0 036 0 07 µm3 cho and azam 2021 lee and fuhrman 1987 in this study we used a 0 2 µm filter volume 0 004 µm3 which limited prokaryotic cells to this smaller size range therefore although small differences in size have a large impact on bacterial biomass and volume we consider 20 fg c cell 1 as the most suitable conversion factor to be adopted when investigating viral ecology in wetlands furthermore it is important to note that changes in carbon emissions observed in this study across variables could be related to many other factors including prokaryotic biomass turnover nutrient availability heterotrophic respiration soil water content and vegetation oertel et al 2016 in particular the effects of the overlying water column after the introduction of water may influence the balance between greenhouse gas producers and consumers as well as gas exchange rate with the atmosphere olefeldt et al 2017 in this study ch4 emissions were higher in the middle zones and in site 2 whereby the highest water levels were also observed the production of ch4 from aquatic ecosystems is dependent upon methanogenesis activity in the sediment which has been found to be significantly correlated to increased water levels that reduce oxygen diffusion at the soil water boundary therefore promoting anaerobic metabolisms and ch4 production limpert et al 2020 moreover methanogenesis activity can be enhanced by sediment resuspension after flooding that 1 can significantly reduce water oxygen availability through the consumption of newly available organic matter gatland et al 2014 sieczko et al 2016 and 2 can increase water temperature by boosting heat absorption from solar radiation paaijmans et al 2008 therefore it is likely that environmental factors promoted by water flooding i e sediment resuspension turbidity water temperature have contributed to increased ch4 emissions observed in our study after the introduction of water in addition to diffusive ch4 emissions ebullitive ch4 flux generally represent a considerable fraction 30 95 of the total ch4 released to the atmosphere from wetlands bridgham et al 2013 delsontro et al 2016 however as this transportation method was not focus of this study we have likely underestimated the overall ch4 emissions from the studied wetland aquatic prokaryotic community composition in the water column can also be largely impacted by hydrological events i e flooding fluctuating water levels previous studies in wetlands showed that hydrogeochemical parameters such as nutrient and oxygen concentration water temperature and organic particle concentration represent the strongest drivers of aquatic bacterial community composition and function mayr et al 2020 negandhi et al 2014 the most abundant functional groups found in shallow water aquatic ecosystems were characterized by carbon decomposers and methanotrophic bacteria negandhi et al 2014 for instance an oxic water column can also create favourable conditions for ch4 oxidation with measured values of up to 80 of ch4 converted into co2 in shallow aquatic ecosystems bastviken et al 2008 this could have contributed to the overall higher co2 emissions measured during the inundated phases in the middle zones which is where also high water levels were observed because of the potential contribution of water column microbial mediated processes in the production and emission of co2 and ch4 the correlation observed in our study between the carbon released by the viral shunt and the total carbon emissions could indicate a rather small and localized contribution on the overall organic matter turnover however despite the highlighted drawbacks of the viral methodology used here and data interpretation based on the current knowledge of viral dynamics this paper provides a unique insight on the biogeochemical role of viruses in wetlands which is relatively untested bonetti et al 2019 5 conclusion overall our results indicated that hydrological rehabilitation had a positive impact on the wetland ecosystem by decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and shifting the microbial community to prokaryotic species with less efficient anaerobic metabolisms also the introduction of water seemed to promote a reduction in viral predatory pressure on prokaryotes potentially due to a different viral life strategy lysogeny with a minor role of the viral shunt a stronger lysogenic infection could then limit the prokaryotic efficiency in the utilization of organic substrates hence contributing to storage of any non remineralized within the soil for a longer period which may result in the reduction of carbon emissions as observed in our experiment this is particularly relevant if considering managing viruses in wetlands as a potential innovative strategy to tip the carbon balance towards the increment of the pool of sequestered carbon bonetti et al 2019 ultimately although our study suggests that viral infections could contribute to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions this is the first study exploring this relationship in wetland soils while the spatiotemporal scope of this study was limited we hope that future viral carbon investigations in wetland ecosystems will further validate the hypotheses presented here resolving the extent to which the role of viral ecology is linked to greenhouse gas emissions could challenge the long standing paradigm that bacteria are the master regulators of wetland emissions and thereby having global implications to our understanding of the global carbon cycle declaration of competing interest

17167,wetlands are among the earth s most efficient ecosystems for carbon sequestration but can also emit potent greenhouse gases ghgs depending on how they are managed global management strategies have sought to maximize carbon drawdown by wetlands by manipulating wetland hydrology to inhibit bacterially mediated emissions however it has recently been hypothesized within wetlands that viruses have the potential to dictate the magnitude and direction of ghg emissions by attacking prokaryotes involved in the carbon cycle here we tested this hypothesis in a whole ecosystem manipulation by hydrologically restoring a degraded wetland rewetting and investigated the changes in ghg emissions prokaryotes viruses and virus host interactions we found that hydrological restoration significantly increased prokaryotic diversity methanogenic methanomicrobia as well as putative iron sulfate cyclers geobacteraceae nitrogen cyclers nitrosomonadaceae and fermentative bacteria koribacteraceae these results provide insights into successional microbial community shifts during rehabilitation additionally in response to watering viral induced prokaryotic mortality declined by 77 resulting in limited carbon released by viral shunt that was significantly correlated with the 2 8 fold reduction in wetland carbon emissions our findings highlight for the first time the potential implications of viral infections in soil prokaryotes on wetland greenhouse gas dynamics and confirm the importance of wetland rehabilitation as a tool to offset carbon emissions keywords carbon cycle environmental watering greenhouse gases rehabilitation viral infection wetland 1 introduction wetlands are broadly acknowledged for their role as major carbon sinks and soil microorganisms underlie several wetland biogeochemical processes important to carbon sequestration including nutrient cycling and carbon decomposition mitsch and gosselink 2007 freshwater wetlands despite occupying less than 10 of the global surface area are known to store up to 33 of the world s soil carbon limpens et al 2008 nahlik and fennessy 2016 long term storage of organic carbon in freshwater wetlands is achieved due to accelerated plant growth and slow microbial decomposition rates promoted by the presence of water that limits oxygen availability and creates suboxic to anoxic conditions bridgham et al 2014 anaerobic conditions however can potentially increase the production of ch4 that has 32 times the global warming potential of co2 neubauer and megonigal 2015 and can potentially offset soil carbon accumulation transforming wetlands into carbon sources bridgham et al 2013 the hydroperiod of a wetland is one of the environmental factors capable of shaping microbial community composition and this is especially true for seasonal wetlands the temporary presence of water drastically affects the microbial ecology and ecosystem biogeochemistry by modifying the redox potential within the soil and the availability of alternative other than oxygen electron acceptors boon et al 2014 along a decreasing energy yield scale labile organic carbon is broken down into co2 and ch4 through numerous reactions that involve diverse prokaryotic functional groups such as denitrifying manganese iron and sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea bridgham et al 2014 in the past decades however rising temperatures decreasing rainfall rates and the conversion to agricultural uses have jeopardized the carbon cycling services of freshwater wetlands davidson 2014 for instance the reduced frequency of wetland s hydroperiod promotes oxygen availability and leads to high microbial respiration rates hirota et al 2005 as a result disturbed wetlands could then release more greenhouse gases than they sequester switching them from carbon sinks to carbon sources whalen 2005 arid and semi arid zones cover more than 33 of the earth s land surface and rain filled wetlands in semi arid regions have been shown to highly contribute to long term carbon sequestration carnell et al 2018 kingsford 1997 nairn and kingsford 2012 however the increased degradation caused by humans can shift these wetlands from ephemeral wetlands to grazing or farmland by reducing natural water flow finlayson et al 2019 in the last two decades governments and institutions internationally have started to recommend either active or passive rehabilitation practices that remove pressures that cause wetland degradation such as grazing agriculture and water diversion ramsar 2016 tanentzap and coomes 2012 wong 2008 rehabilitation practices that actively aim to restore the original wetland hydrology or do this through once off managed events also known as environmental watering have been previously assessed as more effective compared to passive rehabilitation practices i e grazing removal for reducing carbon emissions and or promoting biodiversity more rapidly bossio et al 2006 chandra et al 2020 limpert et al 2020 treby et al 2020 however although rehabilitation practices have had global positive recognition for biodiversity further empirical evidence evaluating the microbial response to hydrological rehabilitation is needed to better understand the effects of short term manipulation on the microbial communities involved in the carbon cycle in addition to the prokaryotic members a wetland soil microbiome also includes fungi and viruses sylvia et al 1998 viruses are the most numerous biological entities on the planet and play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by influencing prokaryotic dynamics and biogeochemical cycling jackson and jackson 2008 weinbauer 2004 temperate viruses are those viruses whose infection does not result in immediate cell death lytic strategy instead the viral genome is integrated into the host genome lysogenic strategy ackermann and dubow 1987 the lytic strategy boosts the expression and activation of auxiliary metabolic genes amgs that are acquired from the host and involved in several functions including carbon nitrogen sulfur and lipid metabolism emerson et al 2018 roux et al 2016 trubl et al 2018 in ecosystems characterized by high proportion of recalcitrant carbon i e rivers and wetlands the carbon released by viral lysis despite accounting for only a small fraction of the total available carbon could make significant contributions to the assimilation and utilization of labile carbon by prokaryotes and therefore represents a major control over the carbon cycle peduzzi 2016 in contrast a lysogenic strategy can confer competitive advantages to the hosts including a change in prokaryote morphology and or superinfection immunity weinbauer 2004 williamson et al 2017 however under unfavorable conditions lysogeny can also negatively affect the host s metabolism by repressing host metabolic process genes and or by reducing the prokaryote s ability to utilize organic matter therefore reducing their growth rate paul 2008 with that in mind it has been hypothesized that there is a direct link between the viral infection rate and the production of greenhouse gases via the prokaryotic decomposition of consumed organic matter bonetti et al 2019 a higher lytic rate might boost carbon recycling resulting in increased carbon emissions while a higher lysogenic rate might drastically reduce organic matter utilization by the prokaryotic host hence reducing greenhouse gas emissions bonetti et al 2019 the aim of this study was 1 to explore the correlation of virus prokaryote interactions to the watering event this is the first study that aims to investigate the potential correlation between viral infection rates and the emissions of greenhouse gases by measuring co2 and ch4 emissions before and after the addition of water and 2 to investigate the shift in prokaryotic community structure triggered by the introduction of water in a whole ecosystem wetland manipulation a key objective of this research was to bring new insights into viral ecology in freshwater ecosystems addressing significant knowledge gaps in the global understanding of the role of viral infections in the carbon cycle additionally we sought to generate practical information to inform wetland management plans by investigating the environmental factors that trigger viral infections with the view that managing viruses in wetlands may provide a potential new strategy for minimizing carbon emissions 2 methods 2 1 site overview and experimental design our study took place in the semi arid noorong area within the murray river catchment riverina region in new south wales nsw south east australia semi arid regions represent the dominant type of bioregion in australia covering up to 70 of australia in nsw the total wetland area encompasses ca 4 320 000 ha and the murray riverina region is one of the catchments with the highest percentage of wetland area relative to total land area kingsford et al 2003 however despite its extent and ecological relevance by hosting more than 50 of nationally important wetlands listed in the diwa directory of important wetlands in australia more than 20 of the murray riverina catchment has been altered as a result of agricultural practices increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall rates kingsford et al 2004 since 2001 the office of environment heritage oeh in nsw has been promoting a rehabilitation plan termed environmental watering whose main goal is through water delivery the restoration of the original hydroperiod of wetlands subject to human disturbances nias et al 2003 this study was conducted on a river red gum wetland on private land 3 ha 35 374296 143 981245 in which grazing has been excluded and that has been part of the environmental watering project since 2005 our experiment consisted of a whole ecosystem manipulation in which environmental water from irrigation channels was added to a dry wetland for three days at 18 ml day 1 for a total of ca 50 ml greenhouse gas measurements and samples for microbial community composition prokaryotic abundance viral abundance and viral production were collected during three phases fig 1 pre watering dry 17 10 2018 day 1 twice when water was filling 1 in the wetland filling 1 at day 3 filling 2at day 5 and when the wetland was full full day 10 however due to cost restrictions only extra greenhouse gas measurements and samples for analysis of microbial community composition were collected during the second filling 2 phase samples for soil carbon and nitrogen analysis were only collected during the dry phase the experimental design consisted of two sites in the wetland with two zones at each site one in the middle of the wetland and one at the edge hereafter referred to as zones for each response variable three replicates were measured or sampled at each zone both zones middle and edge at each site were completely dry at the beginning of the experiment dry only the middle zones were inundated during the filling 1 phase and both zones middle and edge were inundated at the filling 2 and full phase of the experiment table s1 2 2 soil analysis before the introduction of water the soil top 0 5 cm were collected in triplicate from each zone using a 50 mm diameter polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe we followed soil analyses as per carnell et al 2018 in the laboratory soil cores were extruded dried at 60 c and homogenized with an rm 200 electric mortar grinder retsch haan germany a microelemental cn analyzer with callidus v5 1 software eurovector pavia italy was used to analyze the c and n of soil samples soil carbon and nitrogen densities g cm 3 were obtained by multiplying the percentage of organic carbon by the soil bulk density molar c n ratio was obtained by normalizing carbon and nitrogen percentages to the soil dry weights 2 3 greenhouse gas emissions co2 and ch4 measurements were taken using 34 1 l pvc static chambers when the wetland was dry and 27 6 l floating chambers when the wetland was inundated floating chambers were made from white plastic tubs in order to reduce solar radiative heating of chamber air chambers were cautiously inserted into the water surface at about 2 cm depth to avoid surface boundary layer disturbance that can potentially affect measurement accuracy as previously observed in low wind and low wave environments matthews et al 2003 for water depth data at each replicate site see table s1 in addition prior to sampling we confirmed that gas concentration within the chamber was in equilibrium with atmospheric levels a los gatos ultra portable greenhouse gas analyzer ugga was used to measure co2 and ch4 parts per million ppm s for 300 s for each chamber and the emission rates over time were calculated using a standard flux equation ollivier et al 2019a although floating chambers allow to capture both diffusive and ebullitive emissions in this study we focused solely on diffusive emissions therefore emission rates were accepted when the r2 value of the regression line was 0 70 repo et al 2007 to avoid the incorporation of intermittent ebullitive emissions ollivier et al 2019b co2 and ch4 fluxes with negative or slightly positive values 0 1 to 0 1 g co2 m 2 d 1 and 0 001 to 0 001 g ch4 m 2 d 1 were included with r2 values limited by the accuracy of the instrument ugga and did not necessarily reflect the quality of the measurements repo et al 2007 ch4 emissions were converted into co2 equivalents co2 e over a projected 100 year period 32 fold co2 to measure the global warming potential gwp neubauer and megonigal 2015 samples were collected during each phase dry filling 1 filling 2 full with three replicates per zone 2 4 microbial community diversity using a modified 3 ml syringe the top 1 cm of soil was collected at each phase dry filling 1 filling 2 full with three replicates each zone to match the greenhouse gas flux measurements soil samples were stabilized with rna later poulos 2015 and stored at 20 c waiting for further processing genomic dna was extracted using the qiagen dneasy powersoil kit from a range of 0 22 to 0 26 g of the stored sample before sequencing with illumina miseq the v4 variable region of 16s rrna was amplified with the eubacterial primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 walters et al 2016 and purified using zymo clean and concentrate kit 2 5 total prokaryotic abundance for the determination of prokaryotic abundance ca 1 cm3 of surface soil was fixed with glutaraldehyde final concentration 2 and stored at 20 c until processing samples were collected during each phase dry filling 1 full with three replicates per zone samples were processed according to the protocol from danovaro 2010 see supplementary materials for detailed protocol 2 6 viral abundance production and viral induced prokaryotic mortality for the analysis of viral abundance 1 cm3 of surface soil was collected without the addition of any fixative this was because of the recognized loss of viral particles as a result of the use of formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde to preserve the soil samples corinaldesi et al 2012 samples were collected during each phase dry filling 1 full with three replicates per zone samples were processed according to a modified protocol from danovaro et al 2001 see supplementary materials for detailed protocol the analysis of viral production was determined by time course experiment using the dilution approach dell anno et al 2009 approximately 1 cm3 of surface soil was diluted dilution 1 1 vol vol and collected after 1 5 3 6 and 12 h of incubation in the dark at in situ temperature samples were collected during each phase dry filling 1 full with three replicates per zone soil samples were then processed following the same protocol used for viral abundance it was not possible using the standard method of linear regression because the viral abundance does not progress according to a linear trend for this reason the net viral production was calculated as the maximum increment of viral particles per gram dry weight per hour the viral induced prokaryotic mortality vipm was calculated as follows v i p m k p 100 p a where kp prokaryotes killed by viral infection pa prokaryotic abundance kp was calculated as viral production burst size the burst size i e the average number of viruses released by a single prokaryotic cell due to viral infection was assumed to be of 90 virus cell 1 as previously reported for wetlands qin et al 2017 the carbon released by the viral shunt was calculated by converting the number of killed prokaryotes into c content using 20 fg c cell 1 as a conversion factor rastelli et al 2015 2 7 statistical analyses 2 7 1 soil analyses total carbon emissions prokaryotic and viral parameters total carbon emissions prokaryotic and viral parameters were each statistically analyzed using a three way analysis of variance anova with site phase and zone as fixed factors soil carbon analysis was analyzed using a two way analysis of variance anova with site and zone as fixed factors total carbon emissions were square root transformed for homogeneity and normality before being statistically tested using the statistical program spss version 26 however as five samples showed negative total carbon emissions a positive constant was added to all carbon emission samples before transformation to allow for positive data normalization mcdonald 2009 ollivier et al 2019a post hoc tukey s tests were run when significant differences p 0 05 were encountered linear regression models were performed to investigate the correlation between the carbon released from the viral shunt and total co2 and ch4 equivalent emissions 2 7 2 microbial communities bioinformatic analyses were performed with qiime 2 version 2019 1 bolyen et al 2019 using dada 2 pipeline on raw sequences after being trimmed to between 70 and 230 base pairs forward and between 45 and 210 base pairs reverse the resulting asvs amplicon sequence variants were classified using the silva reference database v132 99 identity criterion 16s 18s ssu small subunit asvs were then rarefied to 36 000 reads before running statistical tests which resulted in the loss of two samples s2 full edge s2 filling 1 middle alpha diversity indices chao1 observed asvs and shannon diversity were statistically analyzed using a three way analysis of variance site phase zone anova spss version 26 beta diversity was analyzed using the weighted unifrac distance matrix with a three way distance based permutational analysis of variance site phase zone permanova on primer 7 clarke and gorley 2015 similarity percentage analysis site phase zone simper to interpret taxa contributions was performed on the 99 observed asvs table filtered to 0 05 relative abundance across all samples distance based linear modelling distlm using best selection procedure and aic criterion was used to assess the relationship between ghg emissions and the relative abundance of the microbial community the outcome was visualized using dbrda distance based redundancy analyses legendre and anderson 1999 3 results 3 1 soil analyses water depth and greenhouse gas emissions no significant differences for soil carbon density nitrogen density and c n ratio were found across site carbon p 0 5 nitrogen p 0

s2 water depth was significantly affected by the interaction between site phase and zone p 0 005 table s1 during the dry phase both sites at both zones were dry during the filling 1 phase only the middle zones were inundated with overall deeper water in site 2 overall during the last two phases of the experiment filling 2 and full the middle zones showed 2 7 fold higher water levels 37 6 1 6 cm compared to the edge while site 2 showed 1 2 fold higher water levels 26 8 6 4 cm compared to site 1 the co2 equivalents of co2 and ch4 showed significant differences from the interaction between site phase and zone co2 p 0 001 ch4 p 0 01 table s7 compared to the dry phase when the wetland was fully inundated co2 emissions were 5 5 fold and 8 7 fold lower in site 1 and site 2 respectively in addition during filling 2 and full phases co2 emissions were almost 2 fold higher in the middle zones ch4 emissions started to show positive values during the filling 2 phase during filling 2 and full phases ch4 emissions in the middle zones were almost 2 2 fold higher compared to the edge and 1 4 fold higher in site 2 compared to site 1 3 2 total bacterial community structure the analysis of the microbial community composition associated with wetland soil resulted in 4 124 626 sequences and more than 26 000 asvs see table s3 the α diversity indices shannon and pielou indicated a significant interaction between phase and zone p 0 009 table s6 here while there was little difference in diversity across phases in the edge zone the middle had its lowest diversity in the dry phase and the highest diversity in the full phase a clear shift of the most abundant classes at the same time as the introduction of water was observed throughout the experiment fig s1 acidobacteriia and deltaproteobacteria showed a trend of increasing relative abundances after the introduction of water and were at least 3 fold more abundant during the full phase compared to the dry phase conversely the relative abundance of oxyphotobacteria and actinobacteria decreased by 2 to 3 fold throughout the experiment archaeal class methanomicrobia was observed across zones during both filling 1 and filling 2 similarly β diversity was also significantly influenced by an interaction between phase and zone permanova outputs table s4 pair wise test table s5 early phases dry and filling 1 were significantly different from filling 2 and full sampling times at the middle zone while at the edge only the dry phase showed differences with both filling 2 and full simper analysis fig 2 showed that during the dry phase at the edge there were higher relative abundances of blastococcus spp actinobacteria and chitinophagaceae bacteroidia compared to the full phase dry and filling 1 phases at the edge showed overall less candidatus koribacter acidobacteriia but more skermanella spp alphaproteobacteria compared to the filling 2 phase arthrobacter spp actinobacteria nostocaceae oxyphotobacteria and pontibacter spp bacteroidia were relatively more abundant during the dry and filling 1 phase in the middle zone compared to filling 2 and full ammonia oxidizing nitrosospira spp gammaproteobacteria were overall more abundant during filling 2 at both zones while geobacter spp deltaproteobacteria was relatively more abundant during the full phase in the middle zone the microbial community composition was linked to greenhouse gas emissions by using the weighted unifrac data the db rda analysis between co2 and ch4 emissions converted into carbon equivalents and the 16s rrna gene data explained 12 2 of the variation in the first two axes fig 3 axis 1 db rda1 confirmed the separation of phases according to ch4 emissions with a positive correlation between ch4 emissions and microbial samples collected during the full phase especially in the middle zone of the wetland r 0 774 best aic 82 62 the middle zone filled up with water at a faster rate compared to the edge zone and this has likely promoted a faster microbial response axis 2 db rda2 separated the dry phase from the filling 1 and filling 2 phases with a negative correlation r 0 774 best aic 81 87 between co2 emissions and filling 1 phase at middle zone and filling 2 at both zones this is likely related to the fact that the edge zone was still dry during the filling 1 phase and showed higher co2 concentrations compared to the middle zone during the same phase 3 3 prokaryotic abundance viral abundance and virus to prokaryote abundance ratio the prokaryotic abundance was significantly affected by the interaction between site phase and zone p 0 03 fig 4 a b prokaryotic abundance showed the same trend across sites with higher values at the edge only during the full phase and lower values at the edge compared to the middle during both the dry and filling 1 phases moreover prokaryotic abundance measured at site 1 was more than 2 fold higher than that in site 2 fig 4a b significant differences in viral abundance were found in response to the interaction between site and zone p 0 007 fig 4a b the viral abundance in site 1 was 1 fold higher at the middle compared to the edge while in site 2 viral abundance was almost 1 5 fold lower at the middle compared to the edge the interaction between phase and zone p 0 0001 table s6 fig 4a b resulted in higher values of viral abundance at the middle zone only during the dry phase while viral abundance showed lower values at the middle compared to the edge during both filling 1 and full phases although the trend of viral abundance from the dry phase to the full phase showed decreasing values across sites significant differences were found from the interaction between site and phase p 0 0001 table s6 fig 4a b this interaction was likely driven by the fact that while in site 1 viral abundance decreased by 19 from filling 1 to full phase in site 2 viral abundance decreased by 67 from filling 1 to full phase which was more than 3 fold compared to site 1 the virus to prokaryote abundance ratio showed significant differences across site p 0 0001 and from the interaction between phase and zone p 0 02 and zone and site p 0 02 table s6 the virus to prokaryote abundance ratio at site 1 ranged from 0 10 0 04 to 1 16 0 07 at phase filling 1 and dry respectively and was 5 fold lower compared to that at site 2 that ranged from 0 55 0 01 to 5 0 4 at phase full and pre respectively compared to the full phase the virus to prokaryote abundance ratio was higher at the edge zone compared to the middle during both the dry and filling 1 phases the virus to prokaryote abundance ratio in site 2 at the edge was almost 2 fold higher than that at the middle while in site 1 the virus to prokaryote abundance ratio value between the edge 0 62 0 09 and the middle 0 41 0 11 was similar fig 5 3 4 viral production and viral induced prokaryotic mortality significant differences were found in net viral production across phases p 0 02 table s6 and between sites p 0 04 fig 6 a b as a result of the introduction of water the net viral production at the full phase 1 3 0 3 1010 viruses g 1 d 1 was 3 3 fold lower compared to that during the dry phase 4 1 4 1010 viruses g 1 d 1 similar to the viral abundance viral production at site 2 3 8 1 4 1010 viruses g 1 d 1 was 1 8 fold higher compared to that of site 1 2 1 0 6 1010 viruses g 1 d 1 the viral induced prokaryotic mortality was 3 6 fold higher overall in site 2 compared to site 1 p 0 002 during the dry phase the viral induced prokaryotic mortality was significantly higher than during the wet phases filling 1 and full p 0 02 fig 6a b this resulted in up to 69 more killed prokaryotes per gram per day during the dry phase compared to the filling 1 and full phases related to the higher viral induced prokaryotic mortality the carbon released by viral lysis was higher during the dry phase 9 3 3 1 µg c g 1 d 1 compared to filling 1 7 9 3 µg c g 1 d 1 and full 2 9 0 7 µg c g 1 d 1 3 5 carbon released by viral lysis and greenhouse gas emissions a significant positive correlation was detected between the carbon released by viral lysis and co2 emissions p 0 0005 fig 7 a and between the carbon released by viral lysis and the total co2 and ch4 emissions expressed as carbon equivalents p 0 0005 fig 7c conversely a significant negative correlation was observed between the carbon released by viral lysis and ch4 emissions p 0 003 fig 7b 4 discussion this study aimed to explore the response to hydrological rehabilitation of prokaryotes viruses and prokaryote virus interaction and the effects on greenhouse gas emissions specifically we want to test whether viral infection strategies can have a prevalent role in regulating the production of greenhouse gas emissions we found that rehabilitation increased prokaryotic diversity and promoted a significant shift of prokaryotic groups involved in methanogenesis nitrogen and sulfate iron cycling and fermentation moreover the introduction of water reduced the number of prokaryotic cells killed by viruses by 69 when the wetland was fully inundated the minor role of viral shunt and therefore the decreased rate of organic carbon recycling through the viral shunt was positively correlated with the reduced carbon emissions 4 1 environmental watering increased the relative abundance of microbial functional groups holding anaerobic metabolisms the microbial community structure was strongly affected by the introduction of water that promoted prokaryotic community succession throughout the experiment the dry phase was characterized by the predominance of aerobic metabolism and microbial taxa involved in organic carbon decomposition and turnover this includes chitinophagaceae bacteroidia and blastococcus spp actinobacteria that were found more abundant at the edge and the saprophytic genus arthrobacter actinobacteria yu et al 2012 relatively more abundant at the middle both phyla are involved in the decomposition of complex organic carbons as previously documented in arctic peatlands tveit et al 2013 and grasslands jenkins et al 2009 and greatly contribute to the production and emission of co2 limpert et al 2020 here co2 emissions were for instance higher in dry soils and before the introduction of water finally the high relative abundance of massilia spp gammaproteobacteria under dry conditions can be explained with the ability of this taxon to survive under incredibly arid conditions and possibly feeding on the products of cyanobacteria aslam et al 2016 that were 3 to 4 fold more abundant during the dry phase compared to the full phase once the environmental watering commenced microbial functional groups involved in methane cycling and fermentation started to become more abundant however from a similar ecosystem level manipulation of environmental watering on a semi arid wetland limpert et al 2020 observed how significant shifts in carbon emissions and microbial community structure may take up to 24 h after the introduction of water which was similar to what was seen in this study for instance in our study although methanomicrobia were already present at the filling 1 phase the high abundance of taxa involved in carbon decomposition such as those from the actinobacteria and bacteroidia groups might explain the high co2 emissions and slow increase of ch4 emissions during the filling 1 phase the archaeal methanogenic class methanomicrobia was relatively more abundant when ch4 emissions started to significantly increase filling 2 phase another taxon that was found highly abundant during the filling 2 phase was candidatus koribacter acidobacteriia candidatus koribacter is a fermentative bacteria able to decompose organic matter into a substrate available to methanogenic archaea king and weber 2007 given their role in facilitating the anaerobic hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis over more competitive anaerobic reactions i e nitrogen sulfate reduction it is expected that this class was most abundant in conjunction with methanogens and linked to the increased ch4 emissions as filling 1 progressed inundation and water logged conditions decreased o2 diffusion allowing for a diversification of anaerobic metabolic pathways in the inundated phases filling 1 filling 2 full which was captured by the increased relative abundances of microbial species involved in nitrogen sulfate and iron cycles for instance ammonia oxidizing nitrosospira spp gammaproteobacteria were overall highly abundant at both zones during the filling 2 phase and iron sulfate cycler geobacter spp deltaproteobacteria were higher during the full phase in the middle zone geobacteraceae is a microbial family involved in methane cycling and because of the conductivity of their pili geobacteraceae were previously found to have a major role in interspecies electron exchange with methanogenic archaea thus facilitating the conversion of organic carbon into ch4 morita et al 2011 this might have contributed to the highest ch4 emissions measured during the full phase in the middle zone despite the low abundance of methanogenic classes for instance a previous study documented a low abundance of methanogens coupled with high geobacteraceae leading to high methane emissions during a watering experiment limpert et al 2020 4 2 viral infection strategies were influenced by the introduction of water and linked to carbon emission rates our research study shows that virus to prokaryote ratio viral production and viral induced prokaryotic mortality decreased significantly with the introduction of water the environmental changes triggered by waterlogged soils i e temperature ph and redox might have created unfavorable conditions that reduced the rates of viral replication through lytic infection thus promoting a lysogenic viral strategy in which viral lytic genes and host s metabolic processes are repressed the virus to prokaryote ratio can be used as a proxy of potential viral infection danovaro 2010 given that viral abundance which is strictly dependent on viral burst size is correlated to the microbial growth rate for instance a higher virus to prokaryote ratio reflects higher viral abundance over prokaryotic abundance and suggests a predominance of lytic strategy over lysogeny middelboe 2000 therefore the decreasing trend of virus to prokaryote ratio between the dry phase and the full phase could indicate a transition from lytic to lysogenic strategy likely promoted by the introduction of water alternatively the lower virus to prokaryote ratio after the introduction of water could also be justified with higher viral decay either through the physical removal of phages from the sediment by the water flow or with loss of infectivity triggered by the increased difficulty in finding a suitable host as microbial communities become more diverse jackson and jackson 2008 weinbauer and rassoulzadegan 2004 the values observed for viral production and viral induced prokaryotic mortality when the wetland was full were more than 3 fold and 4 fold lower respectively than those during the dry phase our findings suggest that the high viral production and viral induced prokaryotic mortality might reflect a dominant viral lytic strategy when the wetland was dry under this condition the prokaryotic assemblages were mainly grazed by viruses top down control that determined the release of a higher amount of carbon biomass via the viral shunt middelboe et al 2008 here the high viral impact might have contributed to increasing the rates of microbial mediated recycling of the soil organic matter with major consequences on c cycling and nutrient regeneration for instance in our experiment the µgc d 1 released by killing prokaryotes was significantly correlated to the co2 emissions and the total carbon emission equivalents here the highest total emissions were registered during the dry phase during which the maximum percent of killed cells was also detected 16 4 d 1 in contrast to co2 emissions ch4 emissions showed a negative correlation with the carbon released through viral lysis methanogenic archaea detected in our study belonged to the class methanomicrobia methanomicrobium spp whose infecting virus was discovered in 1989 assigned to the bacteriophage family siphoviridae and classified as a head tail dsdna virus with a lytic replication cycle lange and ahring 2001 meile et al 1989 pina et al 2011 prangishvili 2013 robb et al 1995 if our hypothesis on the influence of viral infections on the production of greenhouse gases holds true the increasing abundance of methanogenic archaea during the final two phases of our experiment filling 2 and full might have triggered archaea infecting viruses with lytic infection strategy that might have contributed to the increasing production in ch4 emissions however considering that the relative abundance of methanogenic archaea represented only 0 5 of the total prokaryotic community the viral host dynamics of the bacteria population might have overridden those of the methanogenic archaea counterparts thus explaining the negative correlation between ch4 emissions and the µgc d 1 released by killing prokaryotes further studies should consider the approach to viral and phage metagenomics techniques and archaeal production rates during infection for understanding microbial assemblages underlying the biogeochemical processes involved in the production of major greenhouse gas species co2 ch4 we found that both prokaryotic and viral abundance resulted in high concentration 109 1010 and this is similar to that previously reported for wetlands that showed the highest values compared to several soil types such as hot cold deserts 104 109 and agricultural soils 107 109 williamson et al 2017 the introduction of water significantly affected viral abundance in our experiment the prokaryotic abundance did not change significantly throughout the watering event however the viral abundance was overall higher during the dry phase following a decreasing trend in abundance once the water was added to the wetland previous studies conducted on permanently inundated wetlands revealed no correlation of prokaryotic abundance to water content but a significantly lower viral abundance in dry wetlands compared to wet wetlands williamson et al 2005 such discrepancies between our study and others could be related to the fact that the introduction of water to a dry wetland and a short term reaction to rapid environmental changes i e water level temperature and ph can differ from the conditions promoted by long term acclimatization to water presence in addition the introduction of water created a condition of high water turbidity high turbidity levels are characterized by a dense concentration of suspended particles starkley and karr 1984 although the contribution of the water column dynamics and aquatic viral communities to the benthic processes are still largely unclear and debated suspended particles have been found to provide an important ecological service to the benthic viral community by binding free living viruses and acting as scavengers of viruses suspended particles could overall reduce benthic viral abundance and impact kernegger et al 2009 weinbauer et al 2009 explaining the decreasing viral abundance with increasing water levels observed in this study not all prokaryote or viral response variables changed significantly in response to environmental watering for instance sites showed significant spatial differences for prokaryotic abundance viral abundance viral production and all the parameters directly correlated to microbial abundances and viral production such as virus to prokaryote ratio and viral induced prokaryotic mortality these site difference may be related to the differing water levels between the sites whereby site 2 was consistently deeper than site 1 pinto et al 2013 observed how water depth was able to influence the microbial component with water depth having a negative relationship with prokaryotic abundance but a positive relationship with the virus to prokaryote abundance ratio this could explain why in site 2 compared to site 1 we observed a lower prokaryotic abundance and higher virus to prokaryote ratio in general viral abundance is linked to host prokaryotic abundance however viruses are strictly host specific specific viruses infect specific taxa and the total number of prokaryotic cells counted might not reflect all available viral hosts emerson 2019 weinbauer and rassoulzadegan 2004 moreover viral abundance and replication is dependent upon microbial growth rate rather than prokaryotic abundance middelboe 2000 this is one possible reason for the lack of a significant correlation between prokaryotic abundance and viral abundance in our experiment further in wetlands and other aquatic ecosystems the spatial patterns in viral abundance and production have been positively correlated to nitrogen and phosphorus concentration and primary productivity jackson and jackson 2008 payet and suttle 2013 however no significant differences were observed with respect to carbon and nitrogen content across sites or zones therefore our findings indicate that there might be other factors we didn t measure such as temperature ph or redox directly affecting virus survival possibly through virus adsorption to soil as previously reported hurst et al 1980 and or doc concentration able to stimulate prokaryotic abundance and productivity farnell jackson and ward 2003 4 3 methodological and interpretation drawbacks it has been recently highlighted that the use of derived viral parameters i e virus to prokaryote abundance ratio to infer major viral dynamics such as the replication strategies must be used with caution parikka et al 2017 for instance viral and prokaryotic abundance alone are not enough to predict the nature of ongoing viral infection strategies in the studied ecosystem therefore in this study the virus to prokaryote abundance ratio has been used in conjunction with other determined variables i e viral production in order to avoid misinterpretations as previously suggested parikka et al 2017 parikka et al 2017 found no significant relationship between the virus to prokaryote ratio and viral production this suggests that in general 1 the virus to prokaryote ratio is more likely affected by the fluctuation of prokaryotic abundance and 2 the viral production can be a more valuable and reliable variable to be used in the investigation of viral replication strategies however in this study the prokaryotic abundance was not significantly different across phases therefore the decreasing virus to prokaryote ratio over the course of the experiment was likely related to the viral abundance that was significantly reduced by the introduction of water due to a number of different possible explanations such as suspended particles viral decay difficulties in finding hosts or a shift to lysogenic strategy kernegger et al 2009 weinbauer et al 2009 weinbauer and rassoulzadegan 2004 therefore the virus to prokaryote ratio did not allow us to infer without doubts the dominant viral infection strategies however it is still an important component to understand viral host abundance relationships viral production and prokaryotic abundance together with the prokaryotic burst size allow to calculate another derived viral parameter which is the viral induced prokaryotic mortality given the impossibility in this study to estimate the prokaryotic burst size using approaches such as the transmission electron microscopy for each prokaryotic cell killed by viruses we assumed an average burst size of 90 viruses cell 1 qin et al 2017 to date the burst size provided by qin et al 2017 is the only estimate available for freshwater wetlands previous literature found that the burst size calculated from freshwater aquatic ecosystems i e lakes rivers reservoirs was significantly higher 28 40 compared to that of marine systems 20 25 parada et al 2006 wommack and colwell 2000 moreover burst size can increase in more productive ecosystems given the direct correlation to the microbial growth rate that is likely favoured by enhanced production weinbauer 2004 prokaryotic burst size has also been found to be very high for terrestrial sediments 100 vandieken et al 2017 therefore considering that our experiment investigated the transition from a terrestrial ecosystem to an aquatic one the burst size assumed in this study represents the closest estimation of the actual number of viral particles released per each killed prokaryotic cell lastly we used 20 fg c cell 1 as conversion factor to convert the killed prokaryotic cells into carbon content as this is the most widely adopted conversion factor in literature in the last 30 years in marine and freshwater ecosystems danovaro 2010 duarte et al 2008 fukuda et al 1998 rastelli et al 2015 moreover previous studies in wetlands have adopted 20 fg c cell 1 as most bacterial cell estimates are in the range of 10 20 fg c cell 1 cotner and biddanda 2002 waiser and robarts 2004 especially for cells smaller than 0 036 0 07 µm3 cho and azam 2021 lee and fuhrman 1987 in this study we used a 0 2 µm filter volume 0 004 µm3 which limited prokaryotic cells to this smaller size range therefore although small differences in size have a large impact on bacterial biomass and volume we consider 20 fg c cell 1 as the most suitable conversion factor to be adopted when investigating viral ecology in wetlands furthermore it is important to note that changes in carbon emissions observed in this study across variables could be related to many other factors including prokaryotic biomass turnover nutrient availability heterotrophic respiration soil water content and vegetation oertel et al 2016 in particular the effects of the overlying water column after the introduction of water may influence the balance between greenhouse gas producers and consumers as well as gas exchange rate with the atmosphere olefeldt et al 2017 in this study ch4 emissions were higher in the middle zones and in site 2 whereby the highest water levels were also observed the production of ch4 from aquatic ecosystems is dependent upon methanogenesis activity in the sediment which has been found to be significantly correlated to increased water levels that reduce oxygen diffusion at the soil water boundary therefore promoting anaerobic metabolisms and ch4 production limpert et al 2020 moreover methanogenesis activity can be enhanced by sediment resuspension after flooding that 1 can significantly reduce water oxygen availability through the consumption of newly available organic matter gatland et al 2014 sieczko et al 2016 and 2 can increase water temperature by boosting heat absorption from solar radiation paaijmans et al 2008 therefore it is likely that environmental factors promoted by water flooding i e sediment resuspension turbidity water temperature have contributed to increased ch4 emissions observed in our study after the introduction of water in addition to diffusive ch4 emissions ebullitive ch4 flux generally represent a considerable fraction 30 95 of the total ch4 released to the atmosphere from wetlands bridgham et al 2013 delsontro et al 2016 however as this transportation method was not focus of this study we have likely underestimated the overall ch4 emissions from the studied wetland aquatic prokaryotic community composition in the water column can also be largely impacted by hydrological events i e flooding fluctuating water levels previous studies in wetlands showed that hydrogeochemical parameters such as nutrient and oxygen concentration water temperature and organic particle concentration represent the strongest drivers of aquatic bacterial community composition and function mayr et al 2020 negandhi et al 2014 the most abundant functional groups found in shallow water aquatic ecosystems were characterized by carbon decomposers and methanotrophic bacteria negandhi et al 2014 for instance an oxic water column can also create favourable conditions for ch4 oxidation with measured values of up to 80 of ch4 converted into co2 in shallow aquatic ecosystems bastviken et al 2008 this could have contributed to the overall higher co2 emissions measured during the inundated phases in the middle zones which is where also high water levels were observed because of the potential contribution of water column microbial mediated processes in the production and emission of co2 and ch4 the correlation observed in our study between the carbon released by the viral shunt and the total carbon emissions could indicate a rather small and localized contribution on the overall organic matter turnover however despite the highlighted drawbacks of the viral methodology used here and data interpretation based on the current knowledge of viral dynamics this paper provides a unique insight on the biogeochemical role of viruses in wetlands which is relatively untested bonetti et al 2019 5 conclusion overall our results indicated that hydrological rehabilitation had a positive impact on the wetland ecosystem by decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and shifting the microbial community to prokaryotic species with less efficient anaerobic metabolisms also the introduction of water seemed to promote a reduction in viral predatory pressure on prokaryotes potentially due to a different viral life strategy lysogeny with a minor role of the viral shunt a stronger lysogenic infection could then limit the prokaryotic efficiency in the utilization of organic substrates hence contributing to storage of any non remineralized within the soil for a longer period which may result in the reduction of carbon emissions as observed in our experiment this is particularly relevant if considering managing viruses in wetlands as a potential innovative strategy to tip the carbon balance towards the increment of the pool of sequestered carbon bonetti et al 2019 ultimately although our study suggests that viral infections could contribute to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions this is the first study exploring this relationship in wetland soils while the spatiotemporal scope of this study was limited we hope that future viral carbon investigations in wetland ecosystems will further validate the hypotheses presented here resolving the extent to which the role of viral ecology is linked to greenhouse gas emissions could challenge the long standing paradigm that bacteria are the master regulators of wetland emissions and thereby having global implications to our understanding of the global carbon cycle declaration of competing interest

17168,hydrate based desalination hbd a type of freezing based desalination can concentrate salts of saline water and produce fresh water via hydrate crystal formation in this study the thermodynamic stability crystallographic information and kinetic growth behavior of hfc 152a hydrate were investigated to estimate the desalination efficiency of hbd the phase equilibria revealed that the hfc 152a hydrate could be formed at a higher temperature in the presence of nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt than the hfc 134a hydrate at 0 3 mpa the hydration number of the hfc 152a hydrate si was found to be 7 74 through the rietveld refinement of the powder x ray diffraction patterns and it was also used to determine the dissociation enthalpy of the hfc 152a hydrate the hu lee sum correlation was employed to predict the equilibrium shift and hydrate depression temperature of both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates in the presence of nacl faster hydrate growth kinetics and higher hydrate conversion were observed for the hfc 152a hydrate in saline solutions despite the smaller initial driving force at 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k additionally to quantify the desalination efficiency of the hfc 152a hbd the maximum achievable salinity and maximum water yield were examined using the hls correlation the salt enrichment efficiency decreased with an increase in the initial salinity and increased with increasing the subcooling the overall results indicate that hfc 152a is potentially a superior candidate for hbd the novel approach examined in this study will be useful for assessing the desalination efficiency of the hbd process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hfc 152a gas hydrate desalination efficiency water yield subcooling 1 introduction while the demand for fresh water continues to rise due to the rapid growth of the world population and industrial development only about 0 014 of the water resources on earth are directly available to living organism shatat et al 2013 research on desalination which refers to the removal or separation of salts and minerals from saline water to obtain fresh water is considered inevitable for the sustainable development of human civilization el dessouky and ettouney 2002 thermal desalination distillation and membrane based separation using reverse osmosis ro have been widely used in many actual sites al obaidani et al 2008 adham et al 2013 qiblawey and banat 2008 al sahali and ettouney 2007 however these methods still have several technological issues thermal desalination requires an excessive amount of heat for water evaporation which results in lower energy efficiency for the thermal process brogioli et al 2018 the ro process is subject to frequent membrane fouling in treating saline water with high salt concentration and it also requires high operational pressure which can be a serious disadvantage in terms of operational costs zhu et al 2009 as an alternative to these processes freeze desalination fd has been regarded as a fascinating technology because of its lower tendency to foul and fewer corrosion problems nebbia and menozzi 1968 rahman et al 2006 additionally several researchers have reported that the energy efficiency of fd can be significantly improved by using cold energy from the regasification of liquified natural gas lng wang and chung 2012 chang et al 2016 lin et al 2017 the process efficiency of fd is generally determined by considering the salt separation efficiency of the process and the amount of cooling energy required for freezing and subsequent crystal growth therefore hydrate based desalination hbd which is part of fd is of strong interest because the crystallization process can be operated at a much higher temperature compared to fd usually above the freezing point of water and thus the energy consumption for crystallization can be drastically reduced babu et al 2018 he et al 2018 chong et al 2019 javanmardi and moshfeghian 2003 gas hydrates are ice like crystalline compounds which incorporate guest molecules into hydrogen bonded host water frameworks gas hydrates exist in three different structure types structure i si structure ii sii and structure h sh depending primarily on the size and shape of the entrapped guest molecules sloan and koh 2007 in particular when gas hydrates are formed all other impurities except the guest and host components are excluded from hydrate crystals thus gas hydrate formation from wastewater or brine water leads to the production of purified water and further concentrated solution hbd as a method to produce fresh water from seawater began to receive significant attention in the 1960s and there were attempts to operate pilot scale plants in hawaii and san diego to investigate its technical feasibility in the 1990s barduhn et al 1962 mccormack and niblock 1998 2000 mccormack and andersen 1995 subramani and jacangelo 2015 one prominent issue that hampered technical progress of hbd was the morphology of synthesized gas hydrates because a substantial amount of salts was entrapped in the interstitial pore space of dendritic hydrate crystals a filtration and an additional wash column were employed as separation methods the estimated cost of water produced by hbd was reported to be comparable to that by multi stage flash msf and ro karagiannis and soldatos 2008 for efficient solid liquid separation in the hbd process several researchers introduced a new apparatus which can produce solid hydrate pellets in a continuous manner and evaluated the ion removal efficiency for actual seawater samples using it park et al 2011 kang et al 2014 they produced solid gas hydrate pellets after the formation of gas hydrates using co2 and ch4 without the pretreatment of seawater to show the effects of the hydraulic pressure to produce pellets and the types of hydrate forming gases on the removal efficiency of ions recently lee and park 2021 introduced a novel conceptual hbd process which can cogenerate fresh water and electricity using lng cold energy the propane based cogeneration model can significantly lower the production cost of fresh water by adding a power generation unit an expander to the process in addition several researchers attempted to adopt liquid phase hydrate formers such as cyclopentane cp cyclohexane ch and 1 1 dichloro 1 fluoroethane hcfc 141b to increase the energy efficiency and kinetics of the hbd process han et al 2014 cha and seol 2013 han et al 2017 dong et al 2019 karamoddin and varaminian 2014 lv et al 2017 xu et al 2018 these liquid hydrate guests can form the gas hydrate crystals at relatively lower pressures at any given temperature compared to other general gaseous guests such as ch4 and co2 cha and seol 2013 investigated the effect of secondary hydrate guests cp and ch on the co2 hydrate based desalination process the addition of these liquid hydrate formers as secondary guests resulted in the faster formation rate of mixed gas hydrates co2 ch and co2 cp and the increased removal efficiency of ions however these liquid guests can contaminate the solution and are not free from corrosion and human health issues as an alternative f gases such as 1 1 1 2 tetrafluoroethane hfc 134a pentafluoroethane hfc 125 and chlorodifluoromethane r22 were suggested as new gaseous hydrate formers for the hbd process lee et al 2016a seo et al 2019 choi et al 2019 woo et al 2019 however the gaseous guests are still more thermodynamically disadvantageous to the hbd process than the liquid guests due to their higher pressure requirement for gas hydrate formation in addition studies on the assessment of separation efficiency for the hbd process are still insufficient and an understanding of salt enrichment during gas hydrate formation remains incomplete for applying hbd technology to the actual desalination process when gas hydrates are formed from saline water the residual solution is gradually concentrated as the crystal growth progresses and thus its salinity also gradually increases a gradual increase in the salt concentration of the residual solution causes the change in the thermodynamic environment and driving force for gas hydrate formation which implies that it also affects the change in hydrate growth behavior dholabhai et al 1993 woo et al 2019 furthermore the maximum achievable separation efficiency of the hbd process might vary depending on the types of hydrate guests operating conditions and initial salt concentration of the solution therefore the efficiency evaluation process design and optimal operation of the hbd process should be performed by considering both the kinetics of the hydrate growth in the saline water and the maximum achievable desalination efficiency herein 1 1 difluoroethane hfc 152a was selected as a potential gas hydrate former for the hbd process because it has milder hydrate equilibrium pressures than other f gases such as hfc 134a and hfc 125 kubota et al 1984 liang et al 2001 furthermore hfc 152a has a significantly lower global warming potential 124 compared to other f gases 1430 for hfc 134a and 3500 for hfc 125 so it will present less of a burden on the environment forster et al 2007 to examine the effect of salinity on the thermodynamic stability of an hfc 152a hydrate the hydrate phase equilibria of hfc 152a nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt water mixtures were measured the dissociation enthalpy of hfc 152a hydrate was measured using a high pressure micro differential scanning calorimeter hp μ dsc powder x ray diffraction pxrd was used to reveal the structural information and cage occupancy of an hfc 152a hydrate which enabled us to calculate hydrate conversion from the amount of gas consumption the amount of gas consumption during the hydrate formation in saline solutions was measured to observe the effect of salinity on kinetics of hydrate conversion in this study to evaluate the performance of the hfc 152a hbd process the hydrate growth rate and hydrate conversion of hfc 152a during hydrate formation were compared to those of hfc 134a which is one of the widely used hydrate formers for the hbd process in addition the hu lee sum hls correlation was employed to predict the equilibrium shift of both the hfc 152a hydrate and the hfc 134a hydrate in the presence of nacl and it enabled us to observe the time dependent changes in the driving force for hydrate formation as well as the maximum achievable salinity and maximum water yield of the hbd process hu et al 2017 2 experimental section 2 1 materials both hfc 152a and hfc 134a with a purity of 99 9 were obtained from rigas co republic of korea and dupont usa respectively nacl with a purity of 99 5 was purchased from sigma aldrich usa double distilled deionized water was used for hydrate formation all materials were used without further purification 2 2 methods 2 2 1 hydrate phase equilibrium measurement in order to measure three phase hydrate h liquid water lw vapor v equilibria of hfc 152a nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt water mixtures an isochoric pressure search method was adopted after loading the solution into a high pressure reactor which had an internal volume of 150 cm3 and was equipped with an impeller type stirrer the reactor was immersed into a water bath which was connected to an external water circulator after elimination of residual air in the reactor hfc 152a gas was injected up to the desired pressure then the reactor was slowly cooled down with agitation to induce hydrate nucleation after the hydrate formation the temperature was raised by 0 1 k with a time interval of 5 h for sufficient pressure equilibration at each step as suggested by cha et al 2016 the three phase equilibrium point was determined by the intersection between the thermal expansion line and the hydrate dissociation line 2 2 2 pxrd measurement hfc 152a hydrate samples were ground into fine powders using a test sieve with a mesh size of 50 μm for pxrd analysis after packing hydrate samples into polyimide tubing cole parmer usa the pxrd patterns were collected at 180 k using a synchrotron monochromatic x ray diffractometer at pohang accelerator laboratory republic of korea the collected two dimensional patterns q spacing nm 1 were converted into one dimensional diffraction patterns with an energy of 8 0478 kev the acquired pxrd pattern was refined by a profile matching mode the position of a hfc 152a molecule in the 51262 cages were determined by the direct space method using fox program and the site occupancy of the rigid body was refined by the rietveld method takeya et al 2010 2 2 3 hp μ dsc measurement the dissociation enthalpy of hfc 152a hydrates formed with pure water and nacl 3 5 wt solution was measured using a high pressure micro differential scanning calorimeter hp μ dsc vii evo setaram inc france the equipment consisted of two hastelloy c276 alloy cells a sample cell and a reference cell with an inner volume of 0 5 cm3 after the sample cell was charged with approximately 12 mg of solution and pressurized with hfc 152a cooling heating cycles between 253 2 k and 274 2 k were repeated for complete conversion of water to gas hydrates until no further change in heat flow peaks was observed then the cell temperature was increased with 0 5 k min up to 300 k to dissociate gas hydrates at 0 16 mpa the area of the endothermic heat flow curve was integrated to determine the dissociation enthalpy of gas hydrates 2 2 4 gas uptake measurement the amount of gas consumed during the formation of hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates in the presence of nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt was measured in isobaric and isothermal conditions the high pressure reactor was charged with 10 g of solution and the pressure was maintained at 0 3 mpa using a micro flow syringe pump 500d teledyne isco usa the subcooling which refers to the difference between the actual operating temperature and hydrate equilibrium temperature of 3 k was given for hydrate formation at 0 3 mpa the volume of gas consumed during hydrate formation was continuously recorded using labview software the accumulated gas consumption gc t ngas nwater at time t was calculated with the following equation 1 g c t δ v t ρ w m w in which δvt ρ w and mw represented the accumulated volume of gas consumed at time t the molecular density of gas the weight of the water and the molecular weight of the water respectively more detailed descriptions about the experimental apparatus and procedure are available in fig s1 and our previous papers lee et al 2016a choi et al 2019 lee et al 2019 2 3 hu lee sum correlation to predict the hydrate equilibrium temperature at a given pressure and at specific salinity conditions the hls correlation was employed hu et al reported that the hydrate depression temperature δt t0 t can be derived as follows hu et al 2017 2 δ t t 0 t n r δ h d ln a w in which t0 and t are hydrate equilibrium temperatures in pure water and saline water respectively and δhd n and a w are hydrate dissociation enthalpy hydration number and water activity respectively according to their results the left term of the equation was independent of temperature and pressure and strongly dependent on the salt species and concentration they developed the water activity term to a polynomial form given by 3 ln a w b 1 x b 2 x 2 b 3 x 3 in which b1 b2 and b3 are fitted coefficients from the universal correlation and x is an effective mole fraction x i i o n s z i x i in which zi and xi are the charge of the ions and the mole fraction of the salts respectively the hydrate dissociation temperature can be calculated with the following equation 4 t t 0 1 δ t t 0 t t 0 1 for the hls correlation the fitted coefficients b1 1 028743829 b2 2 929237521 and b3 36 5112452 were obtained from the literature hu et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermodynamic properties of hfc 152a hydrate the accurate thermodynamic properties of gas hydrates are important prerequisites for the application of gas hydrates to various industrial processes because they can be fundamental criterion for determining the optimal operating conditions of the processes to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of hfc 152a hydrate in the saline system the three phase equilibria of the hfc 152a nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt water mixtures were measured using an isochoric method and the results were shown in fig 1 and table 1 the three phase equilibrium data of pure hfc 152a hydrate were in good agreement with those from the literature sugahara et al 2011 for saline systems the equilibrium curves of hfc 152a hydrate were shifted to harsher regions represented by lower temperature and higher pressure by the inhibition effect of salt ions as seen in fig 1 the extent of the equilibrium curve shift increased with an increase in the nacl concentration indicating that an additional and larger subcooling for gas hydrate formation is required for saline water with a higher nacl concentration the crystallographic information about gas hydrates enabled us to estimate the amount of gas that could be captured in gas hydrates because the cage to water ratio in a unit cell of gas hydrates is an intrinsic characteristic of each hydrate structure to examine the crystalline structure of hfc 152a hydrate pxrd was employed and the measured diffraction patterns of pure hfc 152a hydrate were provided as shown in fig 2 there has been a controversy over the crystalline structure of hfc 152a hydrate si or sii eslamimanesh et al 2011 the pxrd patterns in fig 2 clearly demonstrate that the hfc 152a hydrate is si with a space group of cubic pm 3 n and that it has a lattice parameter of 11 9888 5 å rwp 10 7 and χ2 8 08 the si hydrate consists of 6 large 51262 cages and 2 small 512 cages with 46 water molecules and its ideal unit cell formula is 6 51262 2 512 46 h2o due to the molecular size of hfc 152a the rietveld refinement of the pxrd patterns showed that hfc 152a molecules were captured only in the large 51262 cages of si and the cage occupancy of hfc 152a molecules in the large 51262 cages was 0 99 indicating that the hydration number n which refers to the ratio of the number of host water molecules to the number of entrapped guest molecules in a unit cell is 7 74 hfc 152a 7 74h2o atomic coordinates and site occupancies in table s1 sugahara et al 2011 as noted earlier ions and salts are not included in hydrate crystals so it is reasonable to say that the crystallographic properties of hfc 152a hydrate are not affected by the surrounding saline environment because the continuous hbd process requires the repeated formation and dissociation of gas hydrates the heat transfer absorption or liberation during the phase changes of the gas hydrates is a critical factor in establishing an energy balance of the process in this study the heat flows during the dissociation of hfc 152a hydrate formed with pure water and nacl 3 5 wt solution were observed using the hp μ dsc as depicted in fig 3 a and b the hfc 152a nacl 3 5 wt hydrate showed a much broader endothermic heat flow curve than the pure hfc 152a hydrate because salt is excluded from hydrate crystallization the nacl concentration in the residual solution after hfc 152a hydrate formation was expected to be much higher than 3 5 wt therefore as can be seen in fig 3 the temperature at which the hfc 152a hydrate formed with nacl 3 5 wt solution started to dissociate was much lower than that of the pure hfc 152a hydrate and even lower than the expected dissociation temperature for the nacl 3 5 wt solution as the dissociation of hfc 152a hydrate progressed the nacl concentration in the residual solution gradually decreased due to the dilution caused by the water supply from dissociated hydrates it finally approached the initial nacl concentration because of the gradual and progressive dissociation of gas hydrates in the salt containing systems it was very difficult to measure the accurate onset temperature of hfc 152a nacl hydrate using the dynamic dsc method however the peak temperatures of the endothermic heat flow curves in fig 3 a and b indicated that the presence of nacl inhibited the hydrate formation and accordingly the dissociation temperature of the gas hydrate was shifted to the lower one for saline water since the values of cage occupancy and the hydration number of hfc 152a hydrate were quantitatively given by the rietveld refinement of the pxrd patterns the dissociation enthalpy δhd value of the hfc 152a hydrate was obtained by integrating the endothermic heat flow curve measured by the hp μ dsc the δhd values of the hfc 152a hydrates formed with pure water and nacl 3 5 wt solution were found to be 82 2 0 2 kj mol gas and 81 9 0 5 kj mol gas respectively which were consistent with the literature value 85 5 kj mol gas calculated using the clausius clapeyron equation kubota et al 1984 a slightly larger error in the δhd value for the nacl 3 5 wt solution was attributable to a slightly larger uncertainty in integrating the broader and more progressive heat flow curve for the nacl 3 5 wt solution which might contain hfc 152a hydrate as well as a small amount of solid nacl and nacl 2h2o at low temperatures choi et al 2019 3 2 formation kinetics of hfc 152a hydrate in saline water for the gas uptake measurements the initial subcooling for formation of both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates was set to be 3 k at 0 3 mpa therefore to apply the accurate subcooling for the gas uptake experiments the accurately measured hydrate equilibria of both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates as well as the thermodynamically predicted hydrate equilibria are required at wider pressure and temperature ranges there are several methods for predicting hydrate equilibria depending on salt concentrations the combination of the van der waals platteeuw solid solution theory with the soave redlich kwong equation of state and the pitzer activity coefficient model the standard freezing point depression approach and the correlation developed by østergaard et al waals and platteeuw 2007 miyawaki et al 1997 østergaard et al 2005 in this study the hls correlation which was based on the fundamental principle of freezing point depression was employed to predict the equilibrium depression temperature of gas hydrates in saline water because of its simplicity and reliability hu et al 2017 the three phase equilibria of hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates in the presence of nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt were plotted along with the predicted ones using the hls correlation in fig 4 the hydrate phase equilibria clearly show that the calculated values using the hls correlation fitted well with the experimentally measured ones for both hfc 152a nacl 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt and hfc 134a nacl 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt hydrates indicating that the hls correlation can offer the accurate hydrate equilibrium prediction for both hfc 152a nacl and hfc 134a nacl hydrates for the design and operation of the gas hydrate based process more thermodynamically stable gas hydrates are economically advantageous because the process can be operated at a higher temperature at any given pressure or at a lower pressure at any given temperature as shown in fig 4 at temperatures greater than 277 k in which two hydrate equilibrium curves intersect pure hfc 152a hydrate can be synthesized at thermodynamically milder conditions than pure hfc 134a hydrate for instance the equilibrium temperature of pure hfc 152a hydrate was 3 6 k higher than that of pure hfc 134a hydrate at 0 3 mpa 285 3 k for hfc 152a hydrate and 281 7 k for hfc 134a hydrate this tendency for a higher equilibrium temperature of hfc 152a hydrates was also observed for saline solutions 4 0 k higher 283 8 k for hfc 152a hydrate and 279 8 k for hfc 134a hydrate for nacl 3 5 wt solution and 4 5 k higher 281 9 k for hfc 152a hydrate and 277 4 k for hfc 134a hydrate for nacl 8 0 wt solution at 0 3 mpa this indicates that hfc 152a is a more energy efficient hydrate former than hfc 134a because the hfc 152a hydrate based process can be operated at milder temperature conditions at a specified pressure 0 3 mpa in addition since the slope of the equilibrium curve for the hfc 134a hydrate was steeper compared to that of the hfc 152a hydrate the temperature difference between two hydrate equilibria became larger as the pressure increased for example 3 6 k at 0 3 mpa and 4 4 k at 0 4 mpa prior to applying hfc 152a and hfc 134a gases to the hbd process the hydrate formation behaviors in the pure water system were examined to understand the kinetic characteristics of each gas hydrate which is important in evaluating the kinetic performance of the hbd process fig 5 shows the gas uptakes during the formation of both pure hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates at p 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k the gas consumption behaviors at the initial stage of rapid growth for both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates were fitted using the representative hydrate growth model proposed by englezos et al which was expressed as follows englezos et al 1987 yin et al 2018 5 d n d t p k a p f e x p f e q where n represents the consumed moles of gas t represents the time for the hydrate formation k represents the overall kinetic rate constant which is the harmonic mean of mass transfer coefficient kd and reaction rate constant kr ap is the surface area of the hydrate particle fexp is the fugacity of the dissolved gas and feq is the three phase equilibrium fugacity at the experimental temperature because all the gas uptake experiments were conducted using the same mechanical setup ap and k could be combined into a comprehensive kinetic parameter as k k ap the experimental conditions and the d n d t fexp feq and k values for both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates are listed in table 2 the fugacity values were calculated using the peng robinson equation of state englezos et al 1987 in this study all the gas uptake experiments were conducted at 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k however a relatively larger driving force of the fugacity difference δf fexp feq was given to the hfc 134a hydrate δf 0 131 mpa compared to that of the hfc 152a hydrate δf 0 091 mpa at 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k because of the steeper slope of the equilibrium curve for the hfc 134a hydrate it is noteworthy that despite the lower driving force of the fugacity difference the hfc 152a hydrate had larger d n d t and k values than hfc 134a at 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k the different gas uptake behavior between the hfc 152a hydrate and the hfc 134a hydrate was also observed in the presence of nacl 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt as shown in fig 6 a in the presence of nacl both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates showed a smaller amount of gas consumption than pure hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates this is because the thermodynamic driving force for the hydrate growth became continuously smaller during the hydrate formation due to the hydrate equilibrium shift caused by gradual enrichment of the salinity in the residual solution as can be seen in fig 6 a hfc 152a hydrates with and without nacl exhibited generally larger gas uptakes than hfc 134a hydrates with and without nacl however the larger gas uptake of a certain hydrate former does not necessarily lead to the better hbd efficiency because the amount of gas hydrates formed relative to the amount of gas consumed depends on the hydration number of each gas hydrate the hydration number of hfc 152a hydrate si was obtained from pxrd analysis in this study 7 74 and that of the hfc 134a hydrate sii can be found in the literature 17 0 lee et al 2016 the hydrate saturation the ratio of water converted into gas hydrate to water initially injected was calculated using the hydration number of each gas hydrate fig 6 b shows the changes in the hydrate saturation during hydrate formation for both hfc 152a nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt water and hfc 134a nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt water mixtures it should be noted that despite the 31 smaller driving force δf value for the pure hfc 152a hydrate the increasing rate of hydrate saturation for pure hfc 152a was almost identical to that of the pure hfc 134a hydrate considering that hfc 134a has the larger initial driving force of δf for hydrate formation than hfc 152a at 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k it is reasonable to say that hfc 152a is a kinetically more advantageous hydrate former than hfc 134a furthermore in the presence of nacl hfc 152a hydrate showed slightly slower formation kinetics than hfc 134a hydrate at the initial stage due to the smaller initial driving force of δf for hydrate formation but it finally reached higher hydrate saturation 65 1 nacl 3 5 wt and 42 1 nacl 8 0 wt for hfc 152a hydrate and 60 6 nacl 3 5 wt and 36 7 nacl 8 0 wt for hfc 134a hydrate this indicates that the efficiency of the hbd process using hfc 152a will be also higher compared to hfc 134a 3 3 quantitative analysis for process design of hydrate based desalination in this study all the gas uptake experiments were conducted at pexp 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k but as pointed out in the previous section the actual driving force that can directly affect the hydrate growth kinetics is the fugacity difference δf fexp feq as shown in the schematic illustration of fig 7 the hydrate equilibrium curve gradually shifts to harsher regions higher pressure and lower temperature regions due to gradual enrichment of salts in the residual solution as the gas hydrate formation progresses in saline water resulting in a gradual increase in feq because the experimental conditions are isothermal and isobaric which means constant texp and fexp an increase in feq due to the equilibrium line shift at a given texp leads to a decrease in δf in this study a novel approach to examine the time dependent driving force δf fexp feq for hydrate formation in the presence of salts was suggested by employing the hls correlation which offers the predicted hydrate equilibria corresponding to the time dependent nacl concentration in the residual solution during hydrate formation the salinity in the residual solution at time t during hydrate formation st was calculated from the following equation using the hydration number of each gas hydrate and hydrate saturation at time t 6 s t 100 s w w s δ v t ρ n m w in which sw ws δvt ρ n and mw represent weight of salt in solution weight of solution accumulated volume of consumed gas at time t molecular density of gas hydration number of gas hydrate and molecular weight of water respectively fig 8 clearly demonstrates that the saline water was gradually concentrated by the hbd process during hydrate formation and the degree of salt enrichment when using hfc 152a was finally larger than when using hfc 134a for both nacl 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt solutions the nacl concentrations in the residual solutions after 700 min were found to be 9 4 wt nacl 3 5 wt and 13 2 wt nacl 8 0 wt for hfc 152a and 8 4 wt nacl 3 5 wt and 12 1 wt nacl 8 0 wt for hfc 134a from the nacl concentration in the residual solution during hydrate formation the corresponding hydrate equilibrium curve can be predicted using the hls correlation for the calculation of the driving force of δf it was reasonably assumed that the temperature and pressure were constantly maintained during the hydrate growth the δf value at time t can be calculated from the difference between the fugacity at the experimental condition fexp and the fugacity at the predicted hydrate equilibria at time t feq despite the constant subcooling 3 k at 0 3 mpa for both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrate formation the initial driving force of δf for hfc 152a was smaller due to the less steep slope of the equilibrium curve of hfc 152a hydrate as shown in fig 4 thus the initial δf value of the hfc 134a hydrate was larger than that of the hfc 152a hydrate for both nacl 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt solutions as shown in fig 9 a and b the higher initial driving force of δf facilitated slightly faster growth of hfc 134a hydrate at the early stage as shown in fig 6 b fig 9 shows that the driving force of δf for both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates in nacl solutions was declining during hydrate formation which led to a decrease in the hydrate growth rate it should be noted that the declining behavior of δf during hydrate formation varied depending on hydrate formers hfc 152a hydrate exhibited higher nacl enrichment in the residual solution fig 8 but the degree of reduction in δf for the hfc 152a hydrate was smaller than that of the hfc 134a hydrate in the hls correlation the δ t t 0 t term is dependent on both the heat of hydrate formation dissociation term n r δ h d and the water activity term ln a w and the hydrate depression temperature δt is strongly affected by the n r δ h d term since the value of the n r δ h d term of the hfc 134a hydrate is larger than that of hfc 152a hydrate 0 00078 for the hfc 152a hydrate and 0 00097 for the hfc 134a hydrate the hydrate depression temperature δt of the hfc 134a hydrate became greater than that of the hfc 152a hydrate at the same degree of salt enrichment which indicates that hfc 152a is more advantageous for the hbd process the larger hydrate depression temperature δt for the hfc 134a hydrate was also experimentally observed at 0 3 mpa as can be seen in fig 4 δt 1 5 k 3 5 wt and 3 4 k 8 0 wt for the hfc 152a hydrate and δt 1 9 k 3 5 wt and 4 3 k 8 0 wt for the hfc 134a hydrate therefore the reduction in δf for the hfc 152a hydrate during hydrate formation was smaller compared to the hfc 134a hydrate because the hfc 152a hydrate had the lower effect of salt enrichment on the hydrate equilibrium depression this phenomenon was more pronounced at a higher initial nacl concentration 8 0 wt as shown in fig 6 the hfc 134a hydrate showed a very slow growth rate after the rapid hydrate formation at the initial stage whereas the hfc 152a hydrate showed a continuous increase in the hydrate growth this can be also explained by the changes in water activity a w which has a strong influence on the hydrate equilibrium depression in electrolyte solution during hydrate formation the water activity term ln a w in the hls correlation is given by the cubic equation of the effective mole fraction of the electrolyte species indicating that the effect of the nacl concentration on the hydrate equilibrium becomes greater at higher salinity fig 9 c demonstrates the changes in the water activity term ln a w during hydrate formation for nacl 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt solutions as seen in fig 9 c the nacl 8 0 wt solution showed a more significant decrease in the water activity term ln a w for both the hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates than the nacl 3 5 wt solution which indicates that the extent of the hydrate equilibrium shift was greater at a higher salinity in spite of a lower hydrate conversion in the nacl 8 0 wt solution moreover for the hfc 134a nacl 8 0 wt hydrate the water activity term ln a w decreased dramatically at the early stage due to the drastic hydrate formation caused by the relatively higher initial driving force of δf then the growth rate was sharply reduced due to the significant hydrate equilibrium depression and the consequent decrease in the driving force of δf as shown in fig 9 b on the other hand because of the smaller decrease in the driving force of δf during hydrate formation the hfc 152a nacl 8 0 wt hydrate exhibited continuous and gradual hydrate growth which implies that hfc 152a can be more effective for the hbd process than hfc 134a 3 4 efficiency evaluation for the hydrate based desalination process hbd is a type of freezing based desalination and thus it undoubtedly has a maximum salt enrichment efficiency which can be achieved under a given pressure and temperature condition because the increased salt concentration in the residual solution causes the hydrate equilibrium depression in other words if the temperature pressure and initial salinity in the solution are given the thermodynamically achievable maximum salt concentration in the residual solution can be calculated therefore the quantitative analysis of the maximum salt enrichment under a given thermodynamic condition is vital for the optimal design and operation of the hbd process and its further convergence with other desalination processes in this study to quantify the theoretical maximum salt enrichment of the hbd process a new approach was introduced using the hls correlation in the previous section the shift of the hydrate phase equilibrium caused by the enrichment of nacl in the residual solution and the changes in the driving force of δf for the hydrate growth were calculated to examine the kinetic behavior of both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates however in this section the maximum achievable salinity in the residual solution by hbd at a given pressure and temperature condition for each hydrate former was predicted from the maximally depressed hydrate equilibrium using the hls correlation black colored dotted line in fig 7 fig 10 shows the theoretically achievable maximum salinity of hbd using hfc 152a and hfc 134a for nacl 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt solutions at p 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k the maximum achievable salinity was 10 6 wt hfc 152a and 9 5 wt hfc 134a for nacl 3 5 wt solution and 13 7 wt hfc 152a and 12 9 wt hfc 134a for nacl 8 0 wt solution demonstrating that hfc 152a is a potentially superior candidate for hbd this is because the hydrate equilibrium depression at the same extent of nacl enrichment in the residual solution was smaller for the hfc 152a hydrate because of the smaller n r δ h d term and thus hfc 152a could achieve a higher conversion of gas hydrates than hfc 134a at the same subcooling temperature of 3 k in addition a salinity increment in the residual solution after hydrate formation for the nacl 8 0 wt solution 5 7 wt for hfc 152a and 4 9 wt for hfc 134a was smaller than that of the nacl 3 5 wt solution 7 1 wt for hfc 152a and 6 0 wt for hfc 134a due to the lower conversion of gas hydrates in the nacl 8 0 wt solution to investigate the performance and efficiency of the hfc 152a hbd for saline water with various nacl concentrations the maximum achievable salinity and the corresponding maximum water yield which refers to the ratio of the amount of water included in the hfc 152a hydrate at maximum achievable salinity to the amount of water initially injected were calculated at p 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k using the hls correlation and the mass balance fig 11 presents the maximum salinity and the corresponding maximum water yield of hfc 152 hbd at p 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k according to the initial salinity the maximum achievable salinity in the residual solution was 10 6 wt and 13 7 wt and the corresponding maximum water yield was 69 3 and 45 3 for the initial nacl 3 5 wt and nacl 8 0 wt solutions respectively because the hydrate equilibrium depression was larger at higher salinity due to the larger ln a w term the capacity for desalination became smaller for the saline solution with a higher initial nacl concentration at p 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k because the desalination efficiency is also closely related with the subcooling temperature the effect of subcooling for hydrate formation on the salt enrichment efficiency should be examined to determine the optimal subcooling for the desired desalination efficiency fig 12 demonstrates the maximum water yield of hfc 152a hbd according to various initial levels of salinity in the solution at three different subcooling temperatures of 1 k 3 k and 5 k at p 0 3 mpa as shown in fig 12 the difference in the maximum water yield between the subcooling temperatures of 3 k and 5 k was significantly smaller than that between the subcooling temperatures of 1 k and 3 k indicating that the degree of subcooling was not in direct proportion to the salt enrichment efficiency even though a better efficiency was observed at a higher subcooling temperature as seen in fig 12 the changes in the maximum water yield of hfc 152 hbd at p 0 3 mpa according to initial salinity were very susceptible to the degree of subcooling for instance the maximum water yield decreased from 84 2 to 23 2 at the subcooling temperature of 1 k while it decreased from 96 4 to 55 8 at the subcooling temperature of 5 k when the initial salinity changed from 0 5 wt to 8 0 wt a decrease in the maximum water yield with an increase in the initial salinity was much smaller at higher subcooling and the difference in maximum water yield at lower initial salinity between lower and higher subcooling was not significant however higher subcooling for hydrate formation requires more energy for cooling and can also cause difficulties in separating salts from the surface of the hydrate crystals due to the altered crystallization mechanism and the hydrate morphology at higher subcooling chang et al 2016 tanaka et al 2009 ohmura et al 2004 sakemoto et al 2010 kishimoto et al 2012 therefore the optimal operating conditions in the hbd process should be determined by considering the maximum water yield according to the target initial salinity as well as the trade off between salt enrichment efficiency and solid liquid separation efficiency zheng and yang 2020 because capex and opex as well as the hbd efficiency are also strongly affected by the operating conditions considerations for both the thermodynamic nature of guest gases and the theoretical hbd efficiency will be of great help to operators or researchers who are looking for the economically feasible operating conditions of the hbd process in this study the hls correlation was employed as a novel approach to predict the hydrate equilibrium shift and the maximum achievable salinity of the hbd process however for scale up and commercialization of the hbd process active follow up studies should be continued the theoretical desalination efficiency calculated by more complex hydrate phase equilibria considering various ions na k mg2 ca2 b3 cl and so4 2 should be compared with the hbd efficiency using real seawater furthermore advanced process design considering the kinetic behavior hydrate desalination capacity and theoretical desalination efficiency for given hydrate formers should also be conducted to maximize the energy and economic efficiency of the hbd process on the other hand rather than being used as single process for desalination the hbd process can be coupled with an existing desalination process like ro lee et al 2016b a hybrid process of hbd and ro can generate significant synergy because ro is vulnerable to corrosion or fouling caused by foreign matter or high salinity whereas hbd is less sensitive to those issues and thus can be used as an effective pretreatment process therefore thermodynamic and kinetic considerations for the hfc 152a hbd process examined in this study will be helpful for determining the optimal operating conditions of the hbd process to increase its energy efficiency and for constituting a hybrid process coupled with other methods 4 conclusions the thermodynamic properties and hydrate growth kinetics of hfc 152a hydrates in saline water and the efficiency analysis of the hfc 152a hbd process were investigated with a primary focus on the change in the driving force and maximum salt enrichment efficiency of the hbd process the three phase equilibria of hfc 152a hydrates in the presence of nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt confirmed that the hfc 152a hydrate could be formed at a higher temperature than the hfc 134a hydrate at 0 3 mpa the hydration number and dissociation enthalpy of the hfc 152a hydrate were obtained using the rietveld refinement of the pxrd patterns and the dsc measurement respectively the hls correlation was employed to predict the equilibrium shift and hydrate depression temperature δt of both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates in the presence of nacl the gas uptake measurements at 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k indicated that the hfc 152a hydrate had faster formation kinetics and a higher hydrate conversion in saline solutions than the hfc 134a hydrate despite its 31 lower initial driving force of δf this is because the hfc 152a hydrate exhibited a smaller decrease in the driving force of δf during the hydrate growth additionally the maximum achievable salinity and maximum water yield were also calculated using the hls correlation to quantitatively examine the performance of hbd the hfc 152a hydrate showed a higher maximum salinity than the hfc 134a hydrate at 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k the calculated maximum water yield of the hfc 152a hbd process in the nacl concentration range of 0 5 wt to 8 0 wt demonstrated that the salt enrichment efficiency decreased with an increase in the initial salinity and it could be significantly enhanced by increasing the subcooling the overall results indicate that the kinetic growth behavior of gas hydrates and the theoretical efficiency of hbd can be estimated from the thermodynamic properties of gas hydrates and that the capacity of desalination varies depending on the initial salinity of the solution and the operating conditions like subcooling and pressure therefore thermodynamic properties of gas hydrates as well as mechanical properties should be considered to determine the optimal operating condition of the hbd process and to maximize its energy efficiency the novel approach examined in this study to quantify the performance of hbd using the calculation of hydrate depression temperature will be applicable to any hbd process regardless of the types of guest molecules operating conditions and salt concentrations of the target solution and thus will be useful for assessing the desalination efficiency of the hbd process declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research was supported by the mid career research program through the national

17168,hydrate based desalination hbd a type of freezing based desalination can concentrate salts of saline water and produce fresh water via hydrate crystal formation in this study the thermodynamic stability crystallographic information and kinetic growth behavior of hfc 152a hydrate were investigated to estimate the desalination efficiency of hbd the phase equilibria revealed that the hfc 152a hydrate could be formed at a higher temperature in the presence of nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt than the hfc 134a hydrate at 0 3 mpa the hydration number of the hfc 152a hydrate si was found to be 7 74 through the rietveld refinement of the powder x ray diffraction patterns and it was also used to determine the dissociation enthalpy of the hfc 152a hydrate the hu lee sum correlation was employed to predict the equilibrium shift and hydrate depression temperature of both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates in the presence of nacl faster hydrate growth kinetics and higher hydrate conversion were observed for the hfc 152a hydrate in saline solutions despite the smaller initial driving force at 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k additionally to quantify the desalination efficiency of the hfc 152a hbd the maximum achievable salinity and maximum water yield were examined using the hls correlation the salt enrichment efficiency decreased with an increase in the initial salinity and increased with increasing the subcooling the overall results indicate that hfc 152a is potentially a superior candidate for hbd the novel approach examined in this study will be useful for assessing the desalination efficiency of the hbd process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hfc 152a gas hydrate desalination efficiency water yield subcooling 1 introduction while the demand for fresh water continues to rise due to the rapid growth of the world population and industrial development only about 0 014 of the water resources on earth are directly available to living organism shatat et al 2013 research on desalination which refers to the removal or separation of salts and minerals from saline water to obtain fresh water is considered inevitable for the sustainable development of human civilization el dessouky and ettouney 2002 thermal desalination distillation and membrane based separation using reverse osmosis ro have been widely used in many actual sites al obaidani et al 2008 adham et al 2013 qiblawey and banat 2008 al sahali and ettouney 2007 however these methods still have several technological issues thermal desalination requires an excessive amount of heat for water evaporation which results in lower energy efficiency for the thermal process brogioli et al 2018 the ro process is subject to frequent membrane fouling in treating saline water with high salt concentration and it also requires high operational pressure which can be a serious disadvantage in terms of operational costs zhu et al 2009 as an alternative to these processes freeze desalination fd has been regarded as a fascinating technology because of its lower tendency to foul and fewer corrosion problems nebbia and menozzi 1968 rahman et al 2006 additionally several researchers have reported that the energy efficiency of fd can be significantly improved by using cold energy from the regasification of liquified natural gas lng wang and chung 2012 chang et al 2016 lin et al 2017 the process efficiency of fd is generally determined by considering the salt separation efficiency of the process and the amount of cooling energy required for freezing and subsequent crystal growth therefore hydrate based desalination hbd which is part of fd is of strong interest because the crystallization process can be operated at a much higher temperature compared to fd usually above the freezing point of water and thus the energy consumption for crystallization can be drastically reduced babu et al 2018 he et al 2018 chong et al 2019 javanmardi and moshfeghian 2003 gas hydrates are ice like crystalline compounds which incorporate guest molecules into hydrogen bonded host water frameworks gas hydrates exist in three different structure types structure i si structure ii sii and structure h sh depending primarily on the size and shape of the entrapped guest molecules sloan and koh 2007 in particular when gas hydrates are formed all other impurities except the guest and host components are excluded from hydrate crystals thus gas hydrate formation from wastewater or brine water leads to the production of purified water and further concentrated solution hbd as a method to produce fresh water from seawater began to receive significant attention in the 1960s and there were attempts to operate pilot scale plants in hawaii and san diego to investigate its technical feasibility in the 1990s barduhn et al 1962 mccormack and niblock 1998 2000 mccormack and andersen 1995 subramani and jacangelo 2015 one prominent issue that hampered technical progress of hbd was the morphology of synthesized gas hydrates because a substantial amount of salts was entrapped in the interstitial pore space of dendritic hydrate crystals a filtration and an additional wash column were employed as separation methods the estimated cost of water produced by hbd was reported to be comparable to that by multi stage flash msf and ro karagiannis and soldatos 2008 for efficient solid liquid separation in the hbd process several researchers introduced a new apparatus which can produce solid hydrate pellets in a continuous manner and evaluated the ion removal efficiency for actual seawater samples using it park et al 2011 kang et al 2014 they produced solid gas hydrate pellets after the formation of gas hydrates using co2 and ch4 without the pretreatment of seawater to show the effects of the hydraulic pressure to produce pellets and the types of hydrate forming gases on the removal efficiency of ions recently lee and park 2021 introduced a novel conceptual hbd process which can cogenerate fresh water and electricity using lng cold energy the propane based cogeneration model can significantly lower the production cost of fresh water by adding a power generation unit an expander to the process in addition several researchers attempted to adopt liquid phase hydrate formers such as cyclopentane cp cyclohexane ch and 1 1 dichloro 1 fluoroethane hcfc 141b to increase the energy efficiency and kinetics of the hbd process han et al 2014 cha and seol 2013 han et al 2017 dong et al 2019 karamoddin and varaminian 2014 lv et al 2017 xu et al 2018 these liquid hydrate guests can form the gas hydrate crystals at relatively lower pressures at any given temperature compared to other general gaseous guests such as ch4 and co2 cha and seol 2013 investigated the effect of secondary hydrate guests cp and ch on the co2 hydrate based desalination process the addition of these liquid hydrate formers as secondary guests resulted in the faster formation rate of mixed gas hydrates co2 ch and co2 cp and the increased removal efficiency of ions however these liquid guests can contaminate the solution and are not free from corrosion and human health issues as an alternative f gases such as 1 1 1 2 tetrafluoroethane hfc 134a pentafluoroethane hfc 125 and chlorodifluoromethane r22 were suggested as new gaseous hydrate formers for the hbd process lee et al 2016a seo et al 2019 choi et al 2019 woo et al 2019 however the gaseous guests are still more thermodynamically disadvantageous to the hbd process than the liquid guests due to their higher pressure requirement for gas hydrate formation in addition studies on the assessment of separation efficiency for the hbd process are still insufficient and an understanding of salt enrichment during gas hydrate formation remains incomplete for applying hbd technology to the actual desalination process when gas hydrates are formed from saline water the residual solution is gradually concentrated as the crystal growth progresses and thus its salinity also gradually increases a gradual increase in the salt concentration of the residual solution causes the change in the thermodynamic environment and driving force for gas hydrate formation which implies that it also affects the change in hydrate growth behavior dholabhai et al 1993 woo et al 2019 furthermore the maximum achievable separation efficiency of the hbd process might vary depending on the types of hydrate guests operating conditions and initial salt concentration of the solution therefore the efficiency evaluation process design and optimal operation of the hbd process should be performed by considering both the kinetics of the hydrate growth in the saline water and the maximum achievable desalination efficiency herein 1 1 difluoroethane hfc 152a was selected as a potential gas hydrate former for the hbd process because it has milder hydrate equilibrium pressures than other f gases such as hfc 134a and hfc 125 kubota et al 1984 liang et al 2001 furthermore hfc 152a has a significantly lower global warming potential 124 compared to other f gases 1430 for hfc 134a and 3500 for hfc 125 so it will present less of a burden on the environment forster et al 2007 to examine the effect of salinity on the thermodynamic stability of an hfc 152a hydrate the hydrate phase equilibria of hfc 152a nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt water mixtures were measured the dissociation enthalpy of hfc 152a hydrate was measured using a high pressure micro differential scanning calorimeter hp μ dsc powder x ray diffraction pxrd was used to reveal the structural information and cage occupancy of an hfc 152a hydrate which enabled us to calculate hydrate conversion from the amount of gas consumption the amount of gas consumption during the hydrate formation in saline solutions was measured to observe the effect of salinity on kinetics of hydrate conversion in this study to evaluate the performance of the hfc 152a hbd process the hydrate growth rate and hydrate conversion of hfc 152a during hydrate formation were compared to those of hfc 134a which is one of the widely used hydrate formers for the hbd process in addition the hu lee sum hls correlation was employed to predict the equilibrium shift of both the hfc 152a hydrate and the hfc 134a hydrate in the presence of nacl and it enabled us to observe the time dependent changes in the driving force for hydrate formation as well as the maximum achievable salinity and maximum water yield of the hbd process hu et al 2017 2 experimental section 2 1 materials both hfc 152a and hfc 134a with a purity of 99 9 were obtained from rigas co republic of korea and dupont usa respectively nacl with a purity of 99 5 was purchased from sigma aldrich usa double distilled deionized water was used for hydrate formation all materials were used without further purification 2 2 methods 2 2 1 hydrate phase equilibrium measurement in order to measure three phase hydrate h liquid water lw vapor v equilibria of hfc 152a nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt water mixtures an isochoric pressure search method was adopted after loading the solution into a high pressure reactor which had an internal volume of 150 cm3 and was equipped with an impeller type stirrer the reactor was immersed into a water bath which was connected to an external water circulator after elimination of residual air in the reactor hfc 152a gas was injected up to the desired pressure then the reactor was slowly cooled down with agitation to induce hydrate nucleation after the hydrate formation the temperature was raised by 0 1 k with a time interval of 5 h for sufficient pressure equilibration at each step as suggested by cha et al 2016 the three phase equilibrium point was determined by the intersection between the thermal expansion line and the hydrate dissociation line 2 2 2 pxrd measurement hfc 152a hydrate samples were ground into fine powders using a test sieve with a mesh size of 50 μm for pxrd analysis after packing hydrate samples into polyimide tubing cole parmer usa the pxrd patterns were collected at 180 k using a synchrotron monochromatic x ray diffractometer at pohang accelerator laboratory republic of korea the collected two dimensional patterns q spacing nm 1 were converted into one dimensional diffraction patterns with an energy of 8 0478 kev the acquired pxrd pattern was refined by a profile matching mode the position of a hfc 152a molecule in the 51262 cages were determined by the direct space method using fox program and the site occupancy of the rigid body was refined by the rietveld method takeya et al 2010 2 2 3 hp μ dsc measurement the dissociation enthalpy of hfc 152a hydrates formed with pure water and nacl 3 5 wt solution was measured using a high pressure micro differential scanning calorimeter hp μ dsc vii evo setaram inc france the equipment consisted of two hastelloy c276 alloy cells a sample cell and a reference cell with an inner volume of 0 5 cm3 after the sample cell was charged with approximately 12 mg of solution and pressurized with hfc 152a cooling heating cycles between 253 2 k and 274 2 k were repeated for complete conversion of water to gas hydrates until no further change in heat flow peaks was observed then the cell temperature was increased with 0 5 k min up to 300 k to dissociate gas hydrates at 0 16 mpa the area of the endothermic heat flow curve was integrated to determine the dissociation enthalpy of gas hydrates 2 2 4 gas uptake measurement the amount of gas consumed during the formation of hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates in the presence of nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt was measured in isobaric and isothermal conditions the high pressure reactor was charged with 10 g of solution and the pressure was maintained at 0 3 mpa using a micro flow syringe pump 500d teledyne isco usa the subcooling which refers to the difference between the actual operating temperature and hydrate equilibrium temperature of 3 k was given for hydrate formation at 0 3 mpa the volume of gas consumed during hydrate formation was continuously recorded using labview software the accumulated gas consumption gc t ngas nwater at time t was calculated with the following equation 1 g c t δ v t ρ w m w in which δvt ρ w and mw represented the accumulated volume of gas consumed at time t the molecular density of gas the weight of the water and the molecular weight of the water respectively more detailed descriptions about the experimental apparatus and procedure are available in fig s1 and our previous papers lee et al 2016a choi et al 2019 lee et al 2019 2 3 hu lee sum correlation to predict the hydrate equilibrium temperature at a given pressure and at specific salinity conditions the hls correlation was employed hu et al reported that the hydrate depression temperature δt t0 t can be derived as follows hu et al 2017 2 δ t t 0 t n r δ h d ln a w in which t0 and t are hydrate equilibrium temperatures in pure water and saline water respectively and δhd n and a w are hydrate dissociation enthalpy hydration number and water activity respectively according to their results the left term of the equation was independent of temperature and pressure and strongly dependent on the salt species and concentration they developed the water activity term to a polynomial form given by 3 ln a w b 1 x b 2 x 2 b 3 x 3 in which b1 b2 and b3 are fitted coefficients from the universal correlation and x is an effective mole fraction x i i o n s z i x i in which zi and xi are the charge of the ions and the mole fraction of the salts respectively the hydrate dissociation temperature can be calculated with the following equation 4 t t 0 1 δ t t 0 t t 0 1 for the hls correlation the fitted coefficients b1 1 028743829 b2 2 929237521 and b3 36 5112452 were obtained from the literature hu et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermodynamic properties of hfc 152a hydrate the accurate thermodynamic properties of gas hydrates are important prerequisites for the application of gas hydrates to various industrial processes because they can be fundamental criterion for determining the optimal operating conditions of the processes to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of hfc 152a hydrate in the saline system the three phase equilibria of the hfc 152a nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt water mixtures were measured using an isochoric method and the results were shown in fig 1 and table 1 the three phase equilibrium data of pure hfc 152a hydrate were in good agreement with those from the literature sugahara et al 2011 for saline systems the equilibrium curves of hfc 152a hydrate were shifted to harsher regions represented by lower temperature and higher pressure by the inhibition effect of salt ions as seen in fig 1 the extent of the equilibrium curve shift increased with an increase in the nacl concentration indicating that an additional and larger subcooling for gas hydrate formation is required for saline water with a higher nacl concentration the crystallographic information about gas hydrates enabled us to estimate the amount of gas that could be captured in gas hydrates because the cage to water ratio in a unit cell of gas hydrates is an intrinsic characteristic of each hydrate structure to examine the crystalline structure of hfc 152a hydrate pxrd was employed and the measured diffraction patterns of pure hfc 152a hydrate were provided as shown in fig 2 there has been a controversy over the crystalline structure of hfc 152a hydrate si or sii eslamimanesh et al 2011 the pxrd patterns in fig 2 clearly demonstrate that the hfc 152a hydrate is si with a space group of cubic pm 3 n and that it has a lattice parameter of 11 9888 5 å rwp 10 7 and χ2 8 08 the si hydrate consists of 6 large 51262 cages and 2 small 512 cages with 46 water molecules and its ideal unit cell formula is 6 51262 2 512 46 h2o due to the molecular size of hfc 152a the rietveld refinement of the pxrd patterns showed that hfc 152a molecules were captured only in the large 51262 cages of si and the cage occupancy of hfc 152a molecules in the large 51262 cages was 0 99 indicating that the hydration number n which refers to the ratio of the number of host water molecules to the number of entrapped guest molecules in a unit cell is 7 74 hfc 152a 7 74h2o atomic coordinates and site occupancies in table s1 sugahara et al 2011 as noted earlier ions and salts are not included in hydrate crystals so it is reasonable to say that the crystallographic properties of hfc 152a hydrate are not affected by the surrounding saline environment because the continuous hbd process requires the repeated formation and dissociation of gas hydrates the heat transfer absorption or liberation during the phase changes of the gas hydrates is a critical factor in establishing an energy balance of the process in this study the heat flows during the dissociation of hfc 152a hydrate formed with pure water and nacl 3 5 wt solution were observed using the hp μ dsc as depicted in fig 3 a and b the hfc 152a nacl 3 5 wt hydrate showed a much broader endothermic heat flow curve than the pure hfc 152a hydrate because salt is excluded from hydrate crystallization the nacl concentration in the residual solution after hfc 152a hydrate formation was expected to be much higher than 3 5 wt therefore as can be seen in fig 3 the temperature at which the hfc 152a hydrate formed with nacl 3 5 wt solution started to dissociate was much lower than that of the pure hfc 152a hydrate and even lower than the expected dissociation temperature for the nacl 3 5 wt solution as the dissociation of hfc 152a hydrate progressed the nacl concentration in the residual solution gradually decreased due to the dilution caused by the water supply from dissociated hydrates it finally approached the initial nacl concentration because of the gradual and progressive dissociation of gas hydrates in the salt containing systems it was very difficult to measure the accurate onset temperature of hfc 152a nacl hydrate using the dynamic dsc method however the peak temperatures of the endothermic heat flow curves in fig 3 a and b indicated that the presence of nacl inhibited the hydrate formation and accordingly the dissociation temperature of the gas hydrate was shifted to the lower one for saline water since the values of cage occupancy and the hydration number of hfc 152a hydrate were quantitatively given by the rietveld refinement of the pxrd patterns the dissociation enthalpy δhd value of the hfc 152a hydrate was obtained by integrating the endothermic heat flow curve measured by the hp μ dsc the δhd values of the hfc 152a hydrates formed with pure water and nacl 3 5 wt solution were found to be 82 2 0 2 kj mol gas and 81 9 0 5 kj mol gas respectively which were consistent with the literature value 85 5 kj mol gas calculated using the clausius clapeyron equation kubota et al 1984 a slightly larger error in the δhd value for the nacl 3 5 wt solution was attributable to a slightly larger uncertainty in integrating the broader and more progressive heat flow curve for the nacl 3 5 wt solution which might contain hfc 152a hydrate as well as a small amount of solid nacl and nacl 2h2o at low temperatures choi et al 2019 3 2 formation kinetics of hfc 152a hydrate in saline water for the gas uptake measurements the initial subcooling for formation of both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates was set to be 3 k at 0 3 mpa therefore to apply the accurate subcooling for the gas uptake experiments the accurately measured hydrate equilibria of both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates as well as the thermodynamically predicted hydrate equilibria are required at wider pressure and temperature ranges there are several methods for predicting hydrate equilibria depending on salt concentrations the combination of the van der waals platteeuw solid solution theory with the soave redlich kwong equation of state and the pitzer activity coefficient model the standard freezing point depression approach and the correlation developed by østergaard et al waals and platteeuw 2007 miyawaki et al 1997 østergaard et al 2005 in this study the hls correlation which was based on the fundamental principle of freezing point depression was employed to predict the equilibrium depression temperature of gas hydrates in saline water because of its simplicity and reliability hu et al 2017 the three phase equilibria of hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates in the presence of nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt were plotted along with the predicted ones using the hls correlation in fig 4 the hydrate phase equilibria clearly show that the calculated values using the hls correlation fitted well with the experimentally measured ones for both hfc 152a nacl 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt and hfc 134a nacl 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt hydrates indicating that the hls correlation can offer the accurate hydrate equilibrium prediction for both hfc 152a nacl and hfc 134a nacl hydrates for the design and operation of the gas hydrate based process more thermodynamically stable gas hydrates are economically advantageous because the process can be operated at a higher temperature at any given pressure or at a lower pressure at any given temperature as shown in fig 4 at temperatures greater than 277 k in which two hydrate equilibrium curves intersect pure hfc 152a hydrate can be synthesized at thermodynamically milder conditions than pure hfc 134a hydrate for instance the equilibrium temperature of pure hfc 152a hydrate was 3 6 k higher than that of pure hfc 134a hydrate at 0 3 mpa 285 3 k for hfc 152a hydrate and 281 7 k for hfc 134a hydrate this tendency for a higher equilibrium temperature of hfc 152a hydrates was also observed for saline solutions 4 0 k higher 283 8 k for hfc 152a hydrate and 279 8 k for hfc 134a hydrate for nacl 3 5 wt solution and 4 5 k higher 281 9 k for hfc 152a hydrate and 277 4 k for hfc 134a hydrate for nacl 8 0 wt solution at 0 3 mpa this indicates that hfc 152a is a more energy efficient hydrate former than hfc 134a because the hfc 152a hydrate based process can be operated at milder temperature conditions at a specified pressure 0 3 mpa in addition since the slope of the equilibrium curve for the hfc 134a hydrate was steeper compared to that of the hfc 152a hydrate the temperature difference between two hydrate equilibria became larger as the pressure increased for example 3 6 k at 0 3 mpa and 4 4 k at 0 4 mpa prior to applying hfc 152a and hfc 134a gases to the hbd process the hydrate formation behaviors in the pure water system were examined to understand the kinetic characteristics of each gas hydrate which is important in evaluating the kinetic performance of the hbd process fig 5 shows the gas uptakes during the formation of both pure hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates at p 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k the gas consumption behaviors at the initial stage of rapid growth for both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates were fitted using the representative hydrate growth model proposed by englezos et al which was expressed as follows englezos et al 1987 yin et al 2018 5 d n d t p k a p f e x p f e q where n represents the consumed moles of gas t represents the time for the hydrate formation k represents the overall kinetic rate constant which is the harmonic mean of mass transfer coefficient kd and reaction rate constant kr ap is the surface area of the hydrate particle fexp is the fugacity of the dissolved gas and feq is the three phase equilibrium fugacity at the experimental temperature because all the gas uptake experiments were conducted using the same mechanical setup ap and k could be combined into a comprehensive kinetic parameter as k k ap the experimental conditions and the d n d t fexp feq and k values for both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates are listed in table 2 the fugacity values were calculated using the peng robinson equation of state englezos et al 1987 in this study all the gas uptake experiments were conducted at 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k however a relatively larger driving force of the fugacity difference δf fexp feq was given to the hfc 134a hydrate δf 0 131 mpa compared to that of the hfc 152a hydrate δf 0 091 mpa at 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k because of the steeper slope of the equilibrium curve for the hfc 134a hydrate it is noteworthy that despite the lower driving force of the fugacity difference the hfc 152a hydrate had larger d n d t and k values than hfc 134a at 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k the different gas uptake behavior between the hfc 152a hydrate and the hfc 134a hydrate was also observed in the presence of nacl 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt as shown in fig 6 a in the presence of nacl both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates showed a smaller amount of gas consumption than pure hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates this is because the thermodynamic driving force for the hydrate growth became continuously smaller during the hydrate formation due to the hydrate equilibrium shift caused by gradual enrichment of the salinity in the residual solution as can be seen in fig 6 a hfc 152a hydrates with and without nacl exhibited generally larger gas uptakes than hfc 134a hydrates with and without nacl however the larger gas uptake of a certain hydrate former does not necessarily lead to the better hbd efficiency because the amount of gas hydrates formed relative to the amount of gas consumed depends on the hydration number of each gas hydrate the hydration number of hfc 152a hydrate si was obtained from pxrd analysis in this study 7 74 and that of the hfc 134a hydrate sii can be found in the literature 17 0 lee et al 2016 the hydrate saturation the ratio of water converted into gas hydrate to water initially injected was calculated using the hydration number of each gas hydrate fig 6 b shows the changes in the hydrate saturation during hydrate formation for both hfc 152a nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt water and hfc 134a nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt water mixtures it should be noted that despite the 31 smaller driving force δf value for the pure hfc 152a hydrate the increasing rate of hydrate saturation for pure hfc 152a was almost identical to that of the pure hfc 134a hydrate considering that hfc 134a has the larger initial driving force of δf for hydrate formation than hfc 152a at 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k it is reasonable to say that hfc 152a is a kinetically more advantageous hydrate former than hfc 134a furthermore in the presence of nacl hfc 152a hydrate showed slightly slower formation kinetics than hfc 134a hydrate at the initial stage due to the smaller initial driving force of δf for hydrate formation but it finally reached higher hydrate saturation 65 1 nacl 3 5 wt and 42 1 nacl 8 0 wt for hfc 152a hydrate and 60 6 nacl 3 5 wt and 36 7 nacl 8 0 wt for hfc 134a hydrate this indicates that the efficiency of the hbd process using hfc 152a will be also higher compared to hfc 134a 3 3 quantitative analysis for process design of hydrate based desalination in this study all the gas uptake experiments were conducted at pexp 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k but as pointed out in the previous section the actual driving force that can directly affect the hydrate growth kinetics is the fugacity difference δf fexp feq as shown in the schematic illustration of fig 7 the hydrate equilibrium curve gradually shifts to harsher regions higher pressure and lower temperature regions due to gradual enrichment of salts in the residual solution as the gas hydrate formation progresses in saline water resulting in a gradual increase in feq because the experimental conditions are isothermal and isobaric which means constant texp and fexp an increase in feq due to the equilibrium line shift at a given texp leads to a decrease in δf in this study a novel approach to examine the time dependent driving force δf fexp feq for hydrate formation in the presence of salts was suggested by employing the hls correlation which offers the predicted hydrate equilibria corresponding to the time dependent nacl concentration in the residual solution during hydrate formation the salinity in the residual solution at time t during hydrate formation st was calculated from the following equation using the hydration number of each gas hydrate and hydrate saturation at time t 6 s t 100 s w w s δ v t ρ n m w in which sw ws δvt ρ n and mw represent weight of salt in solution weight of solution accumulated volume of consumed gas at time t molecular density of gas hydration number of gas hydrate and molecular weight of water respectively fig 8 clearly demonstrates that the saline water was gradually concentrated by the hbd process during hydrate formation and the degree of salt enrichment when using hfc 152a was finally larger than when using hfc 134a for both nacl 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt solutions the nacl concentrations in the residual solutions after 700 min were found to be 9 4 wt nacl 3 5 wt and 13 2 wt nacl 8 0 wt for hfc 152a and 8 4 wt nacl 3 5 wt and 12 1 wt nacl 8 0 wt for hfc 134a from the nacl concentration in the residual solution during hydrate formation the corresponding hydrate equilibrium curve can be predicted using the hls correlation for the calculation of the driving force of δf it was reasonably assumed that the temperature and pressure were constantly maintained during the hydrate growth the δf value at time t can be calculated from the difference between the fugacity at the experimental condition fexp and the fugacity at the predicted hydrate equilibria at time t feq despite the constant subcooling 3 k at 0 3 mpa for both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrate formation the initial driving force of δf for hfc 152a was smaller due to the less steep slope of the equilibrium curve of hfc 152a hydrate as shown in fig 4 thus the initial δf value of the hfc 134a hydrate was larger than that of the hfc 152a hydrate for both nacl 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt solutions as shown in fig 9 a and b the higher initial driving force of δf facilitated slightly faster growth of hfc 134a hydrate at the early stage as shown in fig 6 b fig 9 shows that the driving force of δf for both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates in nacl solutions was declining during hydrate formation which led to a decrease in the hydrate growth rate it should be noted that the declining behavior of δf during hydrate formation varied depending on hydrate formers hfc 152a hydrate exhibited higher nacl enrichment in the residual solution fig 8 but the degree of reduction in δf for the hfc 152a hydrate was smaller than that of the hfc 134a hydrate in the hls correlation the δ t t 0 t term is dependent on both the heat of hydrate formation dissociation term n r δ h d and the water activity term ln a w and the hydrate depression temperature δt is strongly affected by the n r δ h d term since the value of the n r δ h d term of the hfc 134a hydrate is larger than that of hfc 152a hydrate 0 00078 for the hfc 152a hydrate and 0 00097 for the hfc 134a hydrate the hydrate depression temperature δt of the hfc 134a hydrate became greater than that of the hfc 152a hydrate at the same degree of salt enrichment which indicates that hfc 152a is more advantageous for the hbd process the larger hydrate depression temperature δt for the hfc 134a hydrate was also experimentally observed at 0 3 mpa as can be seen in fig 4 δt 1 5 k 3 5 wt and 3 4 k 8 0 wt for the hfc 152a hydrate and δt 1 9 k 3 5 wt and 4 3 k 8 0 wt for the hfc 134a hydrate therefore the reduction in δf for the hfc 152a hydrate during hydrate formation was smaller compared to the hfc 134a hydrate because the hfc 152a hydrate had the lower effect of salt enrichment on the hydrate equilibrium depression this phenomenon was more pronounced at a higher initial nacl concentration 8 0 wt as shown in fig 6 the hfc 134a hydrate showed a very slow growth rate after the rapid hydrate formation at the initial stage whereas the hfc 152a hydrate showed a continuous increase in the hydrate growth this can be also explained by the changes in water activity a w which has a strong influence on the hydrate equilibrium depression in electrolyte solution during hydrate formation the water activity term ln a w in the hls correlation is given by the cubic equation of the effective mole fraction of the electrolyte species indicating that the effect of the nacl concentration on the hydrate equilibrium becomes greater at higher salinity fig 9 c demonstrates the changes in the water activity term ln a w during hydrate formation for nacl 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt solutions as seen in fig 9 c the nacl 8 0 wt solution showed a more significant decrease in the water activity term ln a w for both the hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates than the nacl 3 5 wt solution which indicates that the extent of the hydrate equilibrium shift was greater at a higher salinity in spite of a lower hydrate conversion in the nacl 8 0 wt solution moreover for the hfc 134a nacl 8 0 wt hydrate the water activity term ln a w decreased dramatically at the early stage due to the drastic hydrate formation caused by the relatively higher initial driving force of δf then the growth rate was sharply reduced due to the significant hydrate equilibrium depression and the consequent decrease in the driving force of δf as shown in fig 9 b on the other hand because of the smaller decrease in the driving force of δf during hydrate formation the hfc 152a nacl 8 0 wt hydrate exhibited continuous and gradual hydrate growth which implies that hfc 152a can be more effective for the hbd process than hfc 134a 3 4 efficiency evaluation for the hydrate based desalination process hbd is a type of freezing based desalination and thus it undoubtedly has a maximum salt enrichment efficiency which can be achieved under a given pressure and temperature condition because the increased salt concentration in the residual solution causes the hydrate equilibrium depression in other words if the temperature pressure and initial salinity in the solution are given the thermodynamically achievable maximum salt concentration in the residual solution can be calculated therefore the quantitative analysis of the maximum salt enrichment under a given thermodynamic condition is vital for the optimal design and operation of the hbd process and its further convergence with other desalination processes in this study to quantify the theoretical maximum salt enrichment of the hbd process a new approach was introduced using the hls correlation in the previous section the shift of the hydrate phase equilibrium caused by the enrichment of nacl in the residual solution and the changes in the driving force of δf for the hydrate growth were calculated to examine the kinetic behavior of both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates however in this section the maximum achievable salinity in the residual solution by hbd at a given pressure and temperature condition for each hydrate former was predicted from the maximally depressed hydrate equilibrium using the hls correlation black colored dotted line in fig 7 fig 10 shows the theoretically achievable maximum salinity of hbd using hfc 152a and hfc 134a for nacl 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt solutions at p 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k the maximum achievable salinity was 10 6 wt hfc 152a and 9 5 wt hfc 134a for nacl 3 5 wt solution and 13 7 wt hfc 152a and 12 9 wt hfc 134a for nacl 8 0 wt solution demonstrating that hfc 152a is a potentially superior candidate for hbd this is because the hydrate equilibrium depression at the same extent of nacl enrichment in the residual solution was smaller for the hfc 152a hydrate because of the smaller n r δ h d term and thus hfc 152a could achieve a higher conversion of gas hydrates than hfc 134a at the same subcooling temperature of 3 k in addition a salinity increment in the residual solution after hydrate formation for the nacl 8 0 wt solution 5 7 wt for hfc 152a and 4 9 wt for hfc 134a was smaller than that of the nacl 3 5 wt solution 7 1 wt for hfc 152a and 6 0 wt for hfc 134a due to the lower conversion of gas hydrates in the nacl 8 0 wt solution to investigate the performance and efficiency of the hfc 152a hbd for saline water with various nacl concentrations the maximum achievable salinity and the corresponding maximum water yield which refers to the ratio of the amount of water included in the hfc 152a hydrate at maximum achievable salinity to the amount of water initially injected were calculated at p 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k using the hls correlation and the mass balance fig 11 presents the maximum salinity and the corresponding maximum water yield of hfc 152 hbd at p 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k according to the initial salinity the maximum achievable salinity in the residual solution was 10 6 wt and 13 7 wt and the corresponding maximum water yield was 69 3 and 45 3 for the initial nacl 3 5 wt and nacl 8 0 wt solutions respectively because the hydrate equilibrium depression was larger at higher salinity due to the larger ln a w term the capacity for desalination became smaller for the saline solution with a higher initial nacl concentration at p 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k because the desalination efficiency is also closely related with the subcooling temperature the effect of subcooling for hydrate formation on the salt enrichment efficiency should be examined to determine the optimal subcooling for the desired desalination efficiency fig 12 demonstrates the maximum water yield of hfc 152a hbd according to various initial levels of salinity in the solution at three different subcooling temperatures of 1 k 3 k and 5 k at p 0 3 mpa as shown in fig 12 the difference in the maximum water yield between the subcooling temperatures of 3 k and 5 k was significantly smaller than that between the subcooling temperatures of 1 k and 3 k indicating that the degree of subcooling was not in direct proportion to the salt enrichment efficiency even though a better efficiency was observed at a higher subcooling temperature as seen in fig 12 the changes in the maximum water yield of hfc 152 hbd at p 0 3 mpa according to initial salinity were very susceptible to the degree of subcooling for instance the maximum water yield decreased from 84 2 to 23 2 at the subcooling temperature of 1 k while it decreased from 96 4 to 55 8 at the subcooling temperature of 5 k when the initial salinity changed from 0 5 wt to 8 0 wt a decrease in the maximum water yield with an increase in the initial salinity was much smaller at higher subcooling and the difference in maximum water yield at lower initial salinity between lower and higher subcooling was not significant however higher subcooling for hydrate formation requires more energy for cooling and can also cause difficulties in separating salts from the surface of the hydrate crystals due to the altered crystallization mechanism and the hydrate morphology at higher subcooling chang et al 2016 tanaka et al 2009 ohmura et al 2004 sakemoto et al 2010 kishimoto et al 2012 therefore the optimal operating conditions in the hbd process should be determined by considering the maximum water yield according to the target initial salinity as well as the trade off between salt enrichment efficiency and solid liquid separation efficiency zheng and yang 2020 because capex and opex as well as the hbd efficiency are also strongly affected by the operating conditions considerations for both the thermodynamic nature of guest gases and the theoretical hbd efficiency will be of great help to operators or researchers who are looking for the economically feasible operating conditions of the hbd process in this study the hls correlation was employed as a novel approach to predict the hydrate equilibrium shift and the maximum achievable salinity of the hbd process however for scale up and commercialization of the hbd process active follow up studies should be continued the theoretical desalination efficiency calculated by more complex hydrate phase equilibria considering various ions na k mg2 ca2 b3 cl and so4 2 should be compared with the hbd efficiency using real seawater furthermore advanced process design considering the kinetic behavior hydrate desalination capacity and theoretical desalination efficiency for given hydrate formers should also be conducted to maximize the energy and economic efficiency of the hbd process on the other hand rather than being used as single process for desalination the hbd process can be coupled with an existing desalination process like ro lee et al 2016b a hybrid process of hbd and ro can generate significant synergy because ro is vulnerable to corrosion or fouling caused by foreign matter or high salinity whereas hbd is less sensitive to those issues and thus can be used as an effective pretreatment process therefore thermodynamic and kinetic considerations for the hfc 152a hbd process examined in this study will be helpful for determining the optimal operating conditions of the hbd process to increase its energy efficiency and for constituting a hybrid process coupled with other methods 4 conclusions the thermodynamic properties and hydrate growth kinetics of hfc 152a hydrates in saline water and the efficiency analysis of the hfc 152a hbd process were investigated with a primary focus on the change in the driving force and maximum salt enrichment efficiency of the hbd process the three phase equilibria of hfc 152a hydrates in the presence of nacl 0 wt 3 5 wt and 8 0 wt confirmed that the hfc 152a hydrate could be formed at a higher temperature than the hfc 134a hydrate at 0 3 mpa the hydration number and dissociation enthalpy of the hfc 152a hydrate were obtained using the rietveld refinement of the pxrd patterns and the dsc measurement respectively the hls correlation was employed to predict the equilibrium shift and hydrate depression temperature δt of both hfc 152a and hfc 134a hydrates in the presence of nacl the gas uptake measurements at 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k indicated that the hfc 152a hydrate had faster formation kinetics and a higher hydrate conversion in saline solutions than the hfc 134a hydrate despite its 31 lower initial driving force of δf this is because the hfc 152a hydrate exhibited a smaller decrease in the driving force of δf during the hydrate growth additionally the maximum achievable salinity and maximum water yield were also calculated using the hls correlation to quantitatively examine the performance of hbd the hfc 152a hydrate showed a higher maximum salinity than the hfc 134a hydrate at 0 3 mpa and the subcooling temperature of 3 k the calculated maximum water yield of the hfc 152a hbd process in the nacl concentration range of 0 5 wt to 8 0 wt demonstrated that the salt enrichment efficiency decreased with an increase in the initial salinity and it could be significantly enhanced by increasing the subcooling the overall results indicate that the kinetic growth behavior of gas hydrates and the theoretical efficiency of hbd can be estimated from the thermodynamic properties of gas hydrates and that the capacity of desalination varies depending on the initial salinity of the solution and the operating conditions like subcooling and pressure therefore thermodynamic properties of gas hydrates as well as mechanical properties should be considered to determine the optimal operating condition of the hbd process and to maximize its energy efficiency the novel approach examined in this study to quantify the performance of hbd using the calculation of hydrate depression temperature will be applicable to any hbd process regardless of the types of guest molecules operating conditions and salt concentrations of the target solution and thus will be useful for assessing the desalination efficiency of the hbd process declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research was supported by the mid career research program through the national

with an influent containing 120 mgse l 1 selenate and ethanol as electron donor and carbon source was operated for 495 days the high rates 419 17 mgse l 1 day 1 were recorded between day 446 and day 495 for a hydraulic retention time of 6 h the maximum conversion efficiency of selenate amounted to 96 with a volumetric conversion rate of 444 mgse l 1 day 1 which is 6 times higher than the rates reported in the literature thus far at the end of the experiment a highly enriched selenate reducing biomass had developed with a specific activity of 856 26 mgse 1day 1gbiomass 1 which was nearly 1000 fold higher than that of the inoculum no evidence was found for the formation of methane sulfide or volatile reduced selenium compounds like dimethyl selenide or h2se revealing a high selectivity ethanol was incompletely oxidized to acetate the produced elemental selenium partially accumulated in the reactor as pure 80 se of the total mixture of biomass sludge flocs and flaky aggregates and 100 of the specific flaky aggregates selenium black hexagonal needles with cluster sizes between 20 and 200 µm the new process may serve as the basis for a high rate technology to remove and recover pure selenium from wastewater or process streams with high selectivity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological selenate reduction ethanol selenium recovery selenite sequencing batch reactor 1 introduction anthropogenic activities have dramatically increased selenium emissions especially in the mining and metallurgical industries etteieb et al 2020 although selenium se is an essential micronutrient for animals and humans it is toxic at slightly higher intake levels than metabolically needed rayman 2012 ullah et al 2018 selenate seo4 2 the prevailing se species in discharged industrial effluents he et al 2018 accumulates in aquatic ecosystems causing severe environmental impacts such as reproductive and teratogenic defects of aquatic life lemly 2004 a promising method to eliminate selenate from industrial effluents is the microbiological reduction to elemental selenium se0 under anaerobic conditions technologies based on this concept can successfully remove selenate down to low ppb levels lenz et al 2008a staicu and barton 2017 tan 2018 with ethanol as an electron donor the selenate reduction reaction is 2 seo 4 2 c 2 h 5 oh 2 h 2 s e 0 2 hco 3 3 h 2 o 1

some issues remain in particular the relatively low volumetric selenate conversion rate in bioreactors with a reported maximum of only 72 mgse l 1 day 1 ontiveros valencia et al 2016 hageman et al 2013 reported a rate of 104 mgse l 1 day 1 but most selenate 95 was only partially reduced to selenite seo3 2 and was therefore not removed from the solution although selenate displays a similar chemical behavior as sulfate volumetric selenate reduction rates in bioreactors are up to 100 times lower than for biological sulfate reduction liamleam and annachhatre 2007 especially at higher selenate concentrations such as in effluents from the selenium and copper refining industry ike et al 2017 it becomes relevant to reach higher bio reduction rates another issue is the poor recovery of the final selenium products selenate bio reduction at ph 7 0 and temperatures of up to 30 c was reported to result in the formation of red amorphous se0 particles with an estimated average size of 250 nm astratinei et al 2006 hageman et al 2017a staicu et al 2015 while intermediates form spheres to acicular selenium particles at ph 7 4 8 at 30 c hageman et al 2017a h2se and organic se compounds may form under highly reducing conditions lenz et al 2008b nancharaiah and lens 2015 the selenium content of the generated suspended solids is often low as it may also contain methanogenic and sulfate reducing biomass inorganic precipitates that have formed in the anaerobic reactor or organic matter table 2 this hinders the recycling of the selenium product which is relevant as selenium represents a potentially scarce element in the future weijden et al 2013 moreover storing selenium containing solid residues results in environmental risks when the selenium is remobilized under oxic conditions staicu et al 2015 zhang et al 2004 here we aimed to obtain a high rate and highly selective process for biological selenate reduction from simulated selenate waste streams in order to generate a selenium solid product with relatively high purity for this purpose a sequencing batch reactor sbr which has been studied for selenate removal with ammonium removal mal et al 2017 or nitrate removal kim et al 2020 and has been reported to be able to rapidly enrich selenate reducers kim et al 2020 was operated at ph 7 5 fed with an influent containing up to 120 mgse l 1 as selenate furthermore we aimed to produce settleable selenium crystals or clusters thereof which are relatively easy to separate from the aqueous phase 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of biomass the microbial inoculum consisted of anaerobic granular sludge originating from a full scale uasb reactor treating wastewater from a paper factory in eerbeek the netherlands hageman et al 2017a hulshoff pol et al 2001 sludge from this reactor is mainly methanogenic but also has sulfate reducing activity the microbial composition of sludge from this reactor has been investigated previously roest et al 2005 tan et al 2018b the biomass was stored at 4 c before inoculation of the reactor and was therefore not adapted to selenate 2 2 medium composition the basal medium used as influent for the bioreactor was adapted from stams et al 1992 omitting sodium selenite sodium sulfide and yeast extract stams et al 1992 the medium consisted of g l 1 nahco3 4 na2hpo4 2h2o 0 53 kh2po4 0 41 nh4cl 0 3 cacl2 2h2o 0 11 mgcl2 6h2o 0 10 and acid and base trace elements and vitamin solution stams et al 1992 sulfate was not added to the influent medium until day 66 in order to suppress the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria which are known to be present in the inoculum sludge hageman et al 2013 from day 66 onwards around 142 mg l 1 na2so4 was added to the medium to provide sulfur as a nutrient for biomass growth ethanol was added as the electron donor to the medium the reagents were of analytical grade unless stated otherwise 2 3 reactor setup a reactor with a working volume of 0 40 l was operated in sequencing batch mode with four stages feeding mixing settling and discharging figure s1 si the reactor temperature was controlled at 30 c using a water bath nitrogen gas was bubbled continuously through the reactor solution at a rate of 0 02 ml s 1 to maintain anoxic conditions the ph of the reactor solution was measured with a 210 mm glass s8 ph electrode qp181x 210 and kept at 7 5 0 1 by a ph controller the redox of the reactor liquid was measured from day 220 495 of the experiment with a 210 mm glass s8 pt billet redox electrode against ag agcl and monitored with a phm 210 radiometer the hydraulic retention time of the sbr was 24 h during day 0 351 12 h during day 352 413 6 h during day 414 419 12 h during day 420 427 and 6 h until the end of the experiment the following operational disturbances occurred that temporarily affected the reactor performance in terms of selenate reduction day 146 160 influent tubing clogged day 186 204 air leakage day 259 266 too much 8 ml of 70 ethanol v v as influent to the rector on day 259 and reactor leakage on day 263 day 311 331 day 358 363 feed pump failure and influent clogging day 433 day 463 day 478 482 influent clogging two gas scrubbers were connected to the gas outlet of the reactor the first scrubber contained 200 ml of concentrated ethylene glycol allride coolant newco europe uk ltd the netherlands to capture any volatile organic se compounds while the second scrubber contained 200 ml of 3 m koh to capture any possibly formed h2se hageman et al 2013 2 4 batch experiments utilization of the electron donors ethanol and h2 by reactor sludge in the presence of selenate was assessed on day 498 for each experiment a volume of 20 ml well mixed content containing 1163 21 mgcod l 1 acetate from the reactor was incubated in 125 ml bottles with 60 ml of fresh medium containing selenate and sulfate to reach a starting concentration of 1 1 mmol l 1 selenate and 1 mmol l 1 sulfate further composition of medium same as described in section 2 2 in total 200 ml content was taken from the reactor for batch experiments the culture bottles were closed with a butyl rubber stopper and aluminum crimp seal the headspace was degassed to 0 5 atm and then gassed to 1 5 atm with 100 n2 except the experiment with h2 as the electron donor which was flushed with 80 h2 and 20 co2 this was repeated 5 times with a final overpressure of 0 2 atm the bottles were incubated in a shaker 120 rpm at 30 c the selenate selenite ethanol concentration in solution and the headspace gas composition were regularly analyzed batch experiments were carried out in duplicate for comparing the cod change among experiments with different electron donors the h2 concentration is also expressed as mgcod l 1 calculated based on the ideal gas law and related to the liquid volume we designed an additional experiment to further elucidate the reaction pathway in this experiment hydrogen was added in excess to an incubation also containing selenate selenite and furthermore biomass and medium with an excess of hydrogen the fermentation of ethanol to hydrogen and acetate becomes thermodynamically unfeasible conrad et al 1986 ethanol consumption in the presence of hydrogen supports the direct pathway while the absence of ethanol consumption would support the indirect route after day 498 the reactor s biomass was transferred to a sealed culture bottle with 1 2 atm 100 n2 in the headspace the culture bottle was stored at 4 c and 50 of the medium inside the bottle was refreshed every month the medium contained 1 5 mmol l 1 sodium selenate 1 mmol l 1 sodium sulfate and 200 mgcod l 1 ethanol the other components of the medium were the same as described in section 2 2 the ethanol utilization route was assessed using biomass from the reactor stored at 4 c for 3 months 1 ml well mixed content containing 10 mgcod l 1 ethanol and acetate was incubated in 125 ml bottles with 30 ml of fresh medium containing ethanol selenate and sulfate leading with a starting concentration of 191 mgcod l 1 ethanol 1 2 mmol l 1 selenate and 1 mmol l 1 sulfate the culture bottles were sealed as described above and filled with 1 5 atm 100 n2 in the headspace the bottles were incubated in a shaker 120 rpm at 30 c liquid samples were taken on days 1 3 and 5 afterward 10 ml fresh medium was added to the culture bottles to mix with the residual components and the headspace was refilled with 1 2 atm of 80 h2 and 20 co2 therefore the starting concentration in assays was 25 mgcod l 1 ethanol 84 mgcod l 1 acetate 1572 mgcod l 1 h2 0 74 mmol l 1 selenite 0 34 mmol l 1 selenate and 1 mmol l 1 sulfate the bottles were incubated in a shaker 120 rpm at 30 c liquid samples and gas composition were analyzed on day 1 and 2 to investigate the morphology change of the produced elemental selenium phase v we transported the upper liquid from the reactor to culture bottles and tracked the size and structure change of samples by microscope 0 02 nan3 was added to control experiments by mixing se0 laden effluent and nan3 solution to inhibit microbial activity and the nan3 was refreshed every 3 days the culture bottles were sealed as described above and kept anaerobic by filling the headspace with 100 n2 the batch bottles were incubated in a shaker 120 rpm at 30 c samples of the mixed content were collected on day 3 2 5 analysis and calculation liquid samples were filtered 0 45 µm before analysis ethanol and acetate concentrations were measured by gas chromatography as described by hageman et al 2017b ch4 co2 and n2 were analyzed by a gas chromatograph shimadzu gc 2010 containing porabond q and molsieve 5a columns and h2 was analyzed using gas chromatography hewlett packard 5890a as described by van eerten jansen et al 2015 the sulfide concentration was measured using a hach lange test lck 635 and a hach lange xion 500 spectrophotometer when the sulfide concentration was lower than the detection limit of this method 0 1 mg l 1 sulfide an additional analysis with lead ii acetate paper merck darmstadt germany was performed to check if trace sulfide levels less than parts per billion were present de rink et al 2019 ter heijne et al 2018 the selenate selenite and sulfate concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatography dionex ics 2100 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the total selenium concentration was analyzed at wavelength 196 nm by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry vista mpx ccd simultaneous varian co equipped with an mpx megapixel detector the samples for total selenium analysis were first digested with 10 ml aqua regia in a microwave ethos easy advanced microwave digestion system milestone srl italy the solid samples were washed as described previously hageman et al 2017a and characterized by light microscopy with a nikon eclipse e400 1000x magnification nikon tokyo japan x ray diffraction xrd on a bruker d8 advanced diffractometer equipped with a vantec position sensitive detector and with a co kα radiation λ 0 179 nm over a range of 10 90 in 0 02 step sizes with an integration time of 0 5 s and scanning electron microscope sem magellan 400 fei eindhoven the netherlands for sem analysis samples were washed with milli q water and dried at room temperature the method for sem analysis was described previously mol et al 2020 the chemical composition was analyzed by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx using the aztec x ray analyzer oxford instruments analytical high wycombe england with a resolution of 0 4 na at 10 kv the biomass was collected from the reactor on day 220 and concentrated by centrifugation to remove the supernatant the sample pellet was subsequently frozen by liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c the composition of the microbial community was analyzed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing as described previously de leeuw et al 2020 the sequencing data were submitted to the ena database and the accession number for the presented 16s rrna sequencing set is prjeb41212 the biomass concentration was measured as the total organic nitrogen using dr lange cuvette test lck138 hach lange germany the specific method was described previously de rink et al 2019 the biomass formula is regarded as ch1 8o0 5n0 2 thus the measured total organic nitrogen accounts for 11 w w of the total weight biomass the difference between selenate load and the load of dissolved selenium sum of selenate and selenite in the effluent was regarded as the production of elemental selenium se0 this assumption is based on the finding in the literature that se0 is the dominant product of biological selenate reduction under similar conditions table 2 and our experimental findings that se0 was found to precipitate in the reactor as a final product and so that no volatile se species were detected in the gas scrubbing solution of the reactor 3 results and discussion 3 1 selenate conversion rate at hrt of 24 h the reactor was inoculated with 5 g wet anaerobic granular eerbeek sludge and operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h for the first 350 days divided into 3 phases i iii the results of the reactor performance are shown in fig 1 a d during the start up phase i day 0 100 the volumetric selenate conversion rate gradually increased until a fairly stable level of 25 34 mgse l 1 day 1 was reached from day 69 to 100 although the influent contained 4 to 6 fold excess of ethanol cod relative to the stoichiometric needed cod for complete selenate reduction fig 1b the selenate conversion efficiency was only 67 79 with 7 14 mgse l 1 still present in the effluent figure s3 si the low efficiency may have been caused by substrate limitation because ethanol was consumed entirely data not shown and the effluent acetate concentration remained below 15 mgcod l 1 from day 69 100 presumably a large fraction of the ethanol cod was converted to methane by the methanogenic consortia present in the inoculum this is supported by the poor cod recovery which remained below 50 in phase i fig 1d at the start of phase ii day 100 225 the selenate load was doubled to 80 mgse l 1 day 1 while the ethanol load was increased by only 20 to 170 mg cod l 1 day 1 fig 1a b in an attempt to steer the competition for reducing equivalents from ethanol towards selenate reduction although the selenate conversion rate increased immediately a fraction of selenate was only partially reduced to selenite fig 1a after stepwise decreasing the ethanol load to ultimately 60 mgcod l 1 day 1 on day 169 selenite formation further increased with about 1 3 of the depleted selenate appearing as selenite fig 1a the ethanol load was increased stepwise to 150 mgcod l 1 day 1 from day 205 225 after which the selenite formation rate decreased to below 5 mgse l 1 day 1 while the selenate reduction rate increased the start of phase iii day 225 350 was marked by a 50 increase of the ethanol and selenate load selenite was formed transiently fig 1a until day 254 and again after periods of operational disturbances day 259 266 and day 311 331 the reactor performance remained stable with a high conversion efficiency 94 from day 332 to 350 with no selenite 3 2 selenate conversion rate at hrt of 12 and 6 h phase iv started with an hrt of 12 h and with a selenate and ethanol loading rate of 210 250 mgse l 1 day 1 and 900 1100 mgcod l 1 day 1 respectively the selenate conversion rate rapidly increased to levels close to the loading rate in two days with a conversion efficiency 95 however the selenate conversion rate started to decline after two weeks while the selenite formation rate started to increase this was thought to be caused by substrate limitation therefore the ethanol load was increased to 1920 mgcod l 1 day 1 on day 387 resulting in a selenate conversion efficiency of 95 on day 413 then it was tested whether this conversion efficiency would hold with low hrt at the start of phase v day 414 so the hrt was further decreased to 6 h within 1 day the selenate conversion rate increased from 172 to 236 mgse l 1 day 1 conversion efficiency 65 and further increased to 377 mgse l 1 day 1 conversion efficiency 79 on day 415 yet up to 25 of selenate was converted to selenite selenite formation kept increasing to 190 mgse l 1 day 1 even after doubling the ethanol load to avoid the potential toxic effects of the high concentration of selenite on the microbial biomass hunter and manter 2009 the hrt was increased to 12 h for 1 week the selenite formation rate dropped within 1 day to 8 mgse l 1 day 1 on day 422 and further decreased to below 0 5mgse l 1 day 1 on day 427 meanwhile the selenate conversion efficiency recovered to 98 on day 425 rate 202 mgse l 1 day 1 the hrt was again changed to 6 h on day 428 the selenate conversion rate first increased while the selenite formation rate rapidly increased the following 5 days afterward selenite formation decreased from 151 mgse l 1 day 1 day 433 to only 1 5 mgse l 1 day 1 day 450 while the selenate conversion rate gradually increased to around 440 mgse l 1 day 1 from day 446 to 495 efficiency 90 several operational issues see materials and methods section resulted in the fluctuation of selenate reduction and selenite formation from day 450 490 the average selenate conversion rate was 415 17 mgse l 1 day 1 in this period with effluent concentrations of 5 8 mgse l 1 selenate and 0 3 mgse l 1 selenite the average cod recovery in phase iv and v was 83 13 of which 73 15 was attributed to acetate formation and 7 7 3 5 to selenate reduction as either selenite or elemental selenium in contrast with previous bioreactor studies in our study selenate reduction was independent of sulfate reduction as sulfate reduction the slight difference between sulfate inflow and outflow and methanogenesis no ch4 detected in headspace were negligible we presume that the missing cod was covered by the unquantified microbial biomass production and possibly hydrogen formation from ethanol fermentation the latter could not be measured as it was purged from the solution and reactor with the nitrogen gas the maximum volumetric selenate conversion rate 444 mgse l 1 day 1 is around 6 times higher than previously reported 72 mgse l 1 day 1 table 2 when compared to previous research table 2 the relatively high selenate load in our study was achieved by using a low hrt in combination with a relatively high selenate concentration in the influent for a prolonged period this enabled the development of a highly specific selenate reducing biofilm in the reactor this would likely not have been possible with the low selenate concentration used in previous studies as then unrealistically low hrts would have to be applied interaction of sulfate and selenate reduction has been reported hockin and gadd 2006 lenz et al 2009 tan et al 2018a zehr and oremland 1987 but here the selenate conversion rate was not affected by sulfate reduction or the resulting potentially toxic sulfide lenz et al 2008a and therefore there is no competition for electron donor the low or no production of methane also in the batch experiments confirmed that mainly selenate is used in the reactor as the terminal electron acceptor by the specialized selenate reducing biomass 3 3 incomplete ethanol oxidation during day 0 14 in phase i up to 55 mgcod l 1 acetate was formed but afterward acetate formation remained low during phase i fig 1c with concentrations below 15 mgcod l 1 in phase ii the acetate concentration in the effluent gradually increased while the molar ratio acetate formed ethanol consumed increased to 0 5 fig 1c revealing partially incomplete oxidation of ethanol this ratio further increased until it stabilized from day 275 350 with an average value of 1 01 0 15 mol acetate produced mol ethanol consumed which revealed that all ethanol was incompletely oxidized to acetate in period iv and v the molar ratio was 1 14 0 23 also indicating incomplete ethanol oxidation thus at the high rates observed in phase iii v selenate reduction proceeded according to eq 2 this is in line with thermodynamics where the incomplete oxidation results in more gibb s free energy change per electron 74 0 kj mol 1 e than the complete oxidation of ethanol 69 0 kj mol 1 e under actual reactor conditions 3 4 specific selenate reduction rate we attempted to monitor the biomass concentration based on the nitrogen content of suspended solids in the reactor unfortunately a representative sampling from the reactor without opening the reactor proved impossible to prevent exposing the biomass to oxygen in the air we refrained from opening the reactor the biomass concentration at the start day 0 and end day 498 of the experiment amounted to 1 59 gbiomass l 1 and 0 50 gbiomass l 1 respectively corresponding to a 73 decrease the specific selenate reducing activity of the inoculum as assessed in a batch assay was 0 82 0 06 mg se 1 day 1 gbiomass 1 while in the reactor at the end of the experiment it was 856 26 mg se 1 day 1 gbiomass 1 the latter was based on the volumetric selenate reduction rate in the reactor during day 476 495 and the biomass concentration as assessed after the termination of the reactor experiment on day 495 thus the specific selenate reducing activity increased approximately 1000 fold during the almost 500 day experiment indicating that selenate reducers were strongly enriched in the sludge the inoculum sludge originated from a full scale anaerobic reactor treating paper factory wastewater and was predominantly methanogenic the biomass collected at the end of the experiment did not produce measurable amounts of methane or sulfide in batch assays containing 0 12 gbiomass l 1 within 72 h also in the reactor sulfate reduction was negligible figure s5 si while the high cod recovery of 93 14 fig 2 d indicated that also methane formation did not contribute substantially as a sink for the electron donor in conclusion the long term experiment resulted in highly specific biomass which incompletely oxidized ethanol using selenate as the sole terminal electron acceptor 3 5 reaction route in the reactor ethanol may be directly used for selenate reduction eq 2 or ethanol may first be fermented to acetate and hydrogen eq 3 followed by the use of hydrogen by selenate reducing microorganisms eq 4 3 c 2 h 5 oh h 2 o c h 3 co o 2 h 2 h 4 seo 4 2 3 h 2 2 h 2 s e 0 4 h 2 o to gain more insight into the ethanol degradation pathway batch experiments with samples from the reactor taken on day 498 were carried out with either ethanol or hydrogen as added electron donor and selenate as the electron acceptor with 740 5 mgcod l 1 ethanol the molar ratio acetate formed ethanol consumed was 1 0 0 2 after 24 h fig 3 b confirming the incomplete oxidation of ethanol as already observed in the sbr while hydrogen accumulated to 0 55 0 02 v v in the headspace these results indicated that ethanol is oxidized to acetate with h as an electron sink hydrogen decreased to 0 036 0 003 after 48 h while the average molar ratio acetate formed ethanol consumed increased to 1 34 0 01 hydrogen composition further decreased to 0 0008 0 01 after 72 h while the molar ratio acetate formed ethanol consumed was 1 36 0 02 similar as after 48 h though the h2 concentration fig 3b decreased from 24 h to 72 h the maximum measured h2 concentration was 2 35 0 09 mgcod l 1 at 24 h which was less compared to the cod needed for selenate reduction thus although this strongly supports that ethanol oxidation coupled to selenate reduction proceeded at least partially via hydrogen we cannot exclude that ethanol was used also directly unlike in the reactor the larger part of the reduced selenate was converted to selenite fig 3a after a lag phase the selenate depletion and selenite formation showed a linear trend from 16 to 48 h with a selenate depletion rate of 43 2 mgse l 1 day 1 r2 0 9963 and a selenite formation rate of 31 2 mgse l 1 day 1 r2 0 9927 respectively table 1 thus 73 of the depleted selenate was converted to selenite while in the reactor it was only 15 on the day of sampling of the microbial biomass day 498 after 48 h both the selenate conversion and selenite formation became slower corresponding with the limitation of ethanol with h2 as electron donor 323 mgcod l 1 at the start selenate was depleted within 72 h fig 4 while the h2 concentration dropped to 275 3 mgcod l 1 providing further support for the hypothesis that hydrogen is an important contributing electron donor for selenate reduction in the reactor it is noted that acetate was also present 314 1 mgcod l 1 at the start transferred together with the microbial biomass from the reactor however acetate did not serve as the electron donor for selenate reduction 315 8 mgcod l 1 acetate after 72 h on average 48 mgcod l 1 h2 was consumed of which 65 was covered by selenate reduction to both selenite and elemental selenium selenite was also found with hydrogen as the added electron donor the calculated se0 production which was based on the difference between selenate depletion and selenite formation showed a linear trend from 24 72 h table 1 figure s6b1 and s6b2 si revealing that the se0 production was stable in the presence of both selenite and h2 the se0 production did not decrease when all selenate was depleted 0 1 mmol l 1 after 72 h indicating that the se0 may be formed solely by selenite reduction methane was not detected in any of the batches the results of the batch experiments using biomass from the reactor after storing at 4 c for 3 months are shown in figure s8 with ethanol as the sole electron donor the selenate was almost completely converted to 0 03 mgse l 1 as selenate in 5 days to selenite 84 of the total removed selenate and elemental selenium while the ethanol was incompletely oxidized to acetate afterward with ethanol and hydrogen selenate was reduced with hydrogen being consumed while the ethanol concentration did not change this result revealed that when hydrogen was present in excess ethanol degradation is inhibited this finding suggests that the indirect route where hydrogen formed from ethanol fermentation serves as the electron donor for selenate reduction is predominant though hardly any literature reported this indirect ethanol consumption pathway the utilization of h2 as an electron donor chung et al 2006 huber et al 2000 lai et al 2014 ontiveros valencia et al 2018 2016 pearce et al 2008 van ginkel et al 2011 or incomplete electron donor lactate oxidation fujita et al 1997 nancharaiah and lens 2015 switzer blum et al 1998 for selenate or selenite reduction has already been studied selenite production as a final or intermediate selenate reduction product was also found astratinei et al 2006 chasteen and bentley 2003 hageman et al 2013 switzer blum et al 1998 therefore we may conclude that selenate reduction with selenite as an intermediated product is achieved using the h2 formed through the ethanol fermentation fig 5 the transient accumulation of hydrogen in the batch experiments with ethanol and the inhibition of ethanol consumption by the excess presence of hydrogen points to the occurrence of this pathway furthermore the initial accumulation of selenite indicates that selenate is first reduced to selenite step 1 fig 5 and then to elemental selenium step 2 fig 5 3 5 selenite formation in the reactor the redox was monitored from day 220 495 fig 6 increases of the redox potential and selenite formation rate in the reactor experiment followed either after a process upset redox selenite formation peak 2 3 4 5 6 7 10 11 and 12 or increase of the selenate load peak 1 8 and 9 a concomitant increase of selenite accumulation and redox potential was also found in previous work hageman et al 2013 after process upsets the selenate reducing biomass may have been partially inhibited or may have decayed resulting in a high load of selenate per number of active cells which is the same effect after a sudden increase of the selenate load therefore we speculate that a high ratio of selenate load active cells triggers the inhibition of the reduction of selenite to elemental selenium resulting in selenite accumulation this would imply that selective selenite production from selenate might be achieved by controlling the redox e g by maintaining substrate limiting conditions the insights gained from the batch experiments may also help to better explain the formation of selenite in the reactor fig 1a and 2a 3 6 se speciation total selenium in the effluent was measured and shown for selected days fig 7 selenate reduction rate 390 mgse l 1 day 1 the total dissolved se measured by icp did not show much difference with the sum of selenate and selenite in the effluent data not shown indicating that no substantial other dissolved selenium species selenide organic selenium or colloidal se0 were formed this is different from what lenz found where the dissolved selenium concentration was about three times higher than detected selenate concentration in the effluent no selenite production which was thought to have resulted from the formation of colloidally dispersed se0 nanoparticles lenz et al 2008a thus the slight differences between the total dissolved se and se oxyanions also exclude the production of colloidally dispersed se0 the difference between the total se and total dissolved se sum of selenate and selenite fluctuated from 3 to 11 mgse l 1 indicating that a small fraction of the solid selenium washed out from the reactor indeed red colored particles most likely amorphous selenium were present in the sbr effluent which could be removed by either 0 45 µm filter or centrifugation xrd analysis did not show any crystalline se0 signal for washed out particles suggesting that the red selenium solids indeed were amorphous the increase of total washed out amorphous se at day 471 could be attributed to mixing of the reactor prior to the attempted sampling for biomass density analysis which may release attached amorphous elemental selenium the short hrt in this phase 6 h may be not feasible for settling of all the solids because 5 mgse l 1 elemental selenium was washed out several days after the attempt for biomass density sampling day 471 478 which was not seen in the case of 24 h or 12 h hrt 3 mgse l 1 before and after sampling data not shown the total se concentration in the gas scrubbing solutions was always lower than the detection limit 1 mgse l 1 indicating no organic se or h2se was produced in the reactor h2se was reported to be produced by srbs nelson et al 1996 and dimethylselenide and dimethyldiselenide were found to be produced by srbs and methanogens michalke et al 2000 the absence of volatile se species in the sbr after the long term operation points to the selection of specialized selenate and selenite reducers while the sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens from the original eerbeek sludge were washed out the total dissolved selenium concentration was much higher than allowed according to the discharge limit 50 μg l 1 as selenate or 10 µgse l 1 as total selenium tan et al 2016a still the batch experiments showed the possibility to remove selenate to less than 20 µgse l 1 detection limit within144 h and 0 35 µgse l 1 of selenite the latter may be further reduced by extending of the reaction time 3 7 solids accumulation in the reactor in phase i similarly to previous work we found that the first formed se solids using eerbeek sludge were orange red spherical amorphous selenium particles attached to the biomass hageman et al 2017a because amorphous selenium is thermodynamically not the most stable phase it was postulated that bacterial organic material polysaccharides polymers attached to the selenium hinders crystallization to hexagonal selenium hageman et al 2017a lenz et al 2011 as listed in table 2 the amorphous se0 attachment to biomass was found in various processes hageman et al 2017a lenz et al 2011 2008a mal et al 2017 however several factors in this system might still allow the formation and recrystallization of amorphous selenium into black hexagonal selenium the ph the accumulation of amorphous selenium in the reactor increasing the probability of aggregation and the driving force to obtain the thermodynamically most stable phase first of all the ph in our experiments was 7 5 and according to hageman s findings with increasing ph from ph 7 onwards he found black hexagonal selenium forms already at a ph of 7 4 hageman et al 2017a it is reported that the surface potential of biopolymers would become more negative with ph increase carneiro da cunha et al 2011 the same is true for proteins schmitt et al 1998 therefore there is more likely that the selenium particles detach from the negatively charged bacteria besides the sorption affinity of proteins and lipopolysaccharides lps to selenium surfaces may decrease with an increase in ph parikh and chorover 2008 the accumulation of amorphous se particles resulting from feeding the reactor with high selenate concentrations can then promote the aggregation it is reported that the organics tend to detach from the inorganic materials allowing the formation of a larger structure because brownian motion driven particle collisions decreasing the effective surface area with the solution would overcome the surface tension energy allowing crystallization banfield et al 2000 hence the re crystallization and transformation to the most stable phase is allowed banfield et al 2000 jin et al 2018 which can lead to larger organized single crystals as mentioned in a comment on the work by banfield et al 2000 alivisatos 2000 the aggregation of selenium particles has already been reported previously hageman et al 2017a besides the observation of morphology changes of the solids from amorphous round to acicular crystalline phases was confirmed in batch experiments where biomass activity was inhibited with nan3 indicating an abiotic process after biomineralization of amorphous selenium figure s9a showed how sphere particles aggregated with the existed acicular clusters on day 3 the overview picture of the particles figure s9b showed that generally quantity and size of the clusters increased when sampled from day 3 to day 30 one may note that this batch experiment was carried out in phase v when the reactor has already operated continuously for 500 days it is reasonable to find several large acicular clusters at the beginning of batch assays with the picture shown in figure s9b we speculated both size and numbers of acicular particles in the aggregates increased with time furthermore attachment to reactor walls and tubing enhances this aggregation and recrystallization process as the attachment also decreases the surface tension energy that has to be overcome probably therefore we found the black hexagonal selenium on the tubing and reactor walls as systems tend to progress to the most stable thermodynamic state then recrystallization leads to black hexagonal selenium recrystallization is based on both the ostwald step rule going from amorphous to crystalline state and ostwald ripening small particles merge recrystallize to large particles as to reduce surface area i e aging the longer the srt in the reactor the more time for ostwald processes and the more likely black hexagonal selenium will make up the bulk of the solids found in the reactor it is also reported that the attachment of se0 to the sludge leads to faster settling rates and higher hydrophilicity compared with sludge without entrapment se0 jain et al 2015 which helps capture the produced amorphous se0 in the reactor the sequence batch mode was also reported to benefit the settling of the produced se0 mal et al 2017 as a result red color was observed in the sludge and on the reactor wall in the first stages of the experiment after day 100 in phase ii more of the reactor wall area was covered with solids and the color changed from red to black dried macroscopic flakes from the n2 tubing on day 229 had a metallic luster these consisted of clusters of needles with a size ranging between 20 and 200 µm the cluster fig 8 a is remarkably similar to the cluster of the selenium particles found on day 195 in a thermophilic 50 c selenate reducing reactor hageman et al 2015 but the reduction rate in our case was much higher than in the thermophilic reactor 5 of 1 mmol l 1 selenate the length of an individual needle was approximately 10 µm this result is similar to the size that hageman et al found for ph 8 but somewhat smaller than at ph 9 hageman et al 2017a after 495 days flaky aggregates 1 mm of black solids attached to the n2 tubing solids that had settled at the bottom of the reactor solids attached to the reactor wall and suspended solids were collected with icp the total se content in the solid materials from the bottom of the reactor was 80 0 8 g se g 1 dry solid these solid materials were a mixture of biomass sludge flocs and flaky selenium aggregates more specifically the flaky aggregates not only mixed with biomass in the bottom but also attached to n2 tubbing or the reactor wall contained 100 pure se 1 g se g 1 dry solid these se aggregates are more hydrophobic more adamant and constitute the largest mass fraction in the sludge the larger particle sizes of these aggregates compared with biomass make them easily separable from biomass by mesh sieves ruiken et al 2013 the density of pure hexagonal selenium is also high 4 81 g cm3 so separation by gravitational methods i e centrifugation hageman et al 2017a hydrocycloning coffey 2009 microbubble flotation yoon 1993 or sedimentation may also be applicable the formation of pure 80 of total mixed solids large selenium precipitates has not yet been reported in the literature table 2 the solid mixture in the bottom contained 67 g se 6 7 g se ml 1 of in total of 10 ml solids which is 87 w w of the calculated total selenate load to the reactor during the experiment 77 g se calculated value one may note that the start up of this process day 0 50 and during some operational disturbances the reactor had relatively low selenate removal efficiency which was also included in the calculation thus we may conclude that the se recovery potential of this process is 87 an increase in the retainment of solids amorphous and hexagonal in the reactor could be achieved by an increase in the surface area for se0 attachment for instance by adding more supporting material inside the reactor and an increase in the settling time compared to the stirring time which were 2 and 34 min respectively repeated in cycles of 40 min for phase analysis of the black needles sampled from the reactor xrd on day 240 and sem edx on day 287 were used the xrd spectra fig 9 matched with the hexagonal crystalline se with a probability of 92 with sem fig 10 the needle form can be distinguished which is typical for hexagonal selenium and edx analysis confirmed that this acicular structure consisted of 100 se therefore after the initial precipitation of amorphous selenium in phase i crystallization to hexagonal elemental selenium has occurred as the bioreactor is continuously precipitating new selenium this could promote the growth of these needles 3 8 biomass community we chose the eerbeek inoculum based on its high microbial diversity roest et al 2005 and applied selective conditions for over a year and a half thereby aiming to select and enrich species that would be well adapted next generation sequencing ngs analysis of the biomass revealed that the community in the reactor sampled at day 220 end of phase ii was different from the biomass of the original eerbeek sludge roest et al 2005 tan et al 2018b the biomass community was dominated by bacteria and the most abundant microorganisms were from the proteobacteria phylum 30 of the community sequences table s2 si followed by firmicutes 17 and bacteroidetes 16 many reported selenate selenite reducing bacteria distribute in the proteobacteria knotek smith et al 2006 tan et al 2016b though firmicutes is known to contain sulfate reducing species tan et al 2018a these are often also able to reduce selenate knotek smith et al 2006 tan et al 2016b bacteroidetes are also believed to play a role in the reduction of selenium oxyanions as selenate reductase was identified in the genomes of this phylum fakra 2015 geobacteraceae is the most abundant family representing 16 of total community families identified there are various members of this family known as metal reducers and selenite is included nancharaiah and lens 2015 pearce et al 2009 tan et al 2018a for instance strain kmt was reported to be able to use acetate to reduce selenate and selenite nasaringarao and häggblom 2007 more specifically geobacter accounted for 16 of the total genera identified one member of this genus geobacter sulfurreducens pca was reported to couple hydrogen or acetate oxidation with selenite respiration nancharaiah and lens 2015 pearce et al 2009 the most abundant archaeal group was methanosaetaceae 6 of the total microbial families which are known acetotrophic methanogens on the day of sampling day 220 the molar ratio acetate formed ethanol consumed was 0 5 suggesting that 50 of the acetate was still consumed by the reactor biomass likely the acetate was converted to undetected methane as indicated by the low cod recovery of around 60 on day 220 the increase in the molar ratio acetate formed ethanol consumed and the cod recovery to approximately 1 0 and 80 90 respectively from day 280 onwards indicate that the acetotrophic methanogens gradually washed out or became inactive desulfuromonadaceae which are known as sulfate sulfur reducers was found to contribute to 5 of the population however hardly any sulfate concentration change was found in the effluent figure s5 si many sulfate reducers also reduce selenate which may explain their presence as so many members from the abundant phylum are found to be related to selenate selenite reduction we may conclude that during the 495 days of the microbial community development microbes that are well adapted to the selenium reduction were selected this is in line with the satisfying reactor performance of on the average 97 selenate selectivity before the sampling date day 216 219 the increased cod recovery in phase i iii and the negligible methane production or sulfate reduction as discussed before in section 3 4 is also due to the biomass community change the strategy of a starting with a rich community and b applying selective conditions for a prolonged period has proven successful in our environmental biotechnological research hageman et al 2013 lindeboom et al 2011 weijma et al 2000 still by default we cannot exclude that other inocula would have led to the same biomass development or even higher selenate reduction rates 4 conclusion this study presented a high rate process for the recovery of selenium based on biological selenate reduction to elemental selenium without the formation of highly toxic hydrogen selenide or organic selenium species pure crystalline hexagonal se0 was identified as selenium solid accumulating in the reactor in clusters and was easy to separate the achieved high purity would facilitate the recycling of the generated selenium selenate was the predominant electron acceptor in the process while co2 and sulfate reduction were absent however ethanol was incompletely oxidized implying that maximally 1 3 of the electron equivalents in ethanol could be used for the desired conversion selenite was found both in reactor and batch experiments revealing the presence of selenite as

17169,recovery of selenium se from wastewater provides a solution for both securing se supply and preventing se pollution here we developed a high rate process for biological selenate reduction to elemental selenium distinctive from other studies we aimed for a process with selenate as the main biological electron sink with minimal formation of methane or sulfide a sequencing batch reactor fed with an influent containing 120 mgse l 1 selenate and ethanol as electron donor and carbon source was operated for 495 days the high rates 419 17 mgse l 1 day 1 were recorded between day 446 and day 495 for a hydraulic retention time of 6 h the maximum conversion efficiency of selenate amounted to 96 with a volumetric conversion rate of 444 mgse l 1 day 1 which is 6 times higher than the rates reported in the literature thus far at the end of the experiment a highly enriched selenate reducing biomass had developed with a specific activity of 856 26 mgse 1day 1gbiomass 1 which was nearly 1000 fold higher than that of the inoculum no evidence was found for the formation of methane sulfide or volatile reduced selenium compounds like dimethyl selenide or h2se revealing a high selectivity ethanol was incompletely oxidized to acetate the produced elemental selenium partially accumulated in the reactor as pure 80 se of the total mixture of biomass sludge flocs and flaky aggregates and 100 of the specific flaky aggregates selenium black hexagonal needles with cluster sizes between 20 and 200 µm the new process may serve as the basis for a high rate technology to remove and recover pure selenium from wastewater or process streams with high selectivity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological selenate reduction ethanol selenium recovery selenite sequencing batch reactor 1 introduction anthropogenic activities have dramatically increased selenium emissions especially in the mining and metallurgical industries etteieb et al 2020 although selenium se is an essential micronutrient for animals and humans it is toxic at slightly higher intake levels than metabolically needed rayman 2012 ullah et al 2018 selenate seo4 2 the prevailing se species in discharged industrial effluents he et al 2018 accumulates in aquatic ecosystems causing severe environmental impacts such as reproductive and teratogenic defects of aquatic life lemly 2004 a promising method to eliminate selenate from industrial effluents is the microbiological reduction to elemental selenium se0 under anaerobic conditions technologies based on this concept can successfully remove selenate down to low ppb levels lenz et al 2008a staicu and barton 2017 tan 2018 with ethanol as an electron donor the selenate reduction reaction is 2 seo 4 2 c 2 h 5 oh 2 h 2 s e 0 2 hco 3 3 h 2 o 1

some issues remain in particular the relatively low volumetric selenate conversion rate in bioreactors with a reported maximum of only 72 mgse l 1 day 1 ontiveros valencia et al 2016 hageman et al 2013 reported a rate of 104 mgse l 1 day 1 but most selenate 95 was only partially reduced to selenite seo3 2 and was therefore not removed from the solution although selenate displays a similar chemical behavior as sulfate volumetric selenate reduction rates in bioreactors are up to 100 times lower than for biological sulfate reduction liamleam and annachhatre 2007 especially at higher selenate concentrations such as in effluents from the selenium and copper refining industry ike et al 2017 it becomes relevant to reach higher bio reduction rates another issue is the poor recovery of the final selenium products selenate bio reduction at ph 7 0 and temperatures of up to 30 c was reported to result in the formation of red amorphous se0 particles with an estimated average size of 250 nm astratinei et al 2006 hageman et al 2017a staicu et al 2015 while intermediates form spheres to acicular selenium particles at ph 7 4 8 at 30 c hageman et al 2017a h2se and organic se compounds may form under highly reducing conditions lenz et al 2008b nancharaiah and lens 2015 the selenium content of the generated suspended solids is often low as it may also contain methanogenic and sulfate reducing biomass inorganic precipitates that have formed in the anaerobic reactor or organic matter table 2 this hinders the recycling of the selenium product which is relevant as selenium represents a potentially scarce element in the future weijden et al 2013 moreover storing selenium containing solid residues results in environmental risks when the selenium is remobilized under oxic conditions staicu et al 2015 zhang et al 2004 here we aimed to obtain a high rate and highly selective process for biological selenate reduction from simulated selenate waste streams in order to generate a selenium solid product with relatively high purity for this purpose a sequencing batch reactor sbr which has been studied for selenate removal with ammonium removal mal et al 2017 or nitrate removal kim et al 2020 and has been reported to be able to rapidly enrich selenate reducers kim et al 2020 was operated at ph 7 5 fed with an influent containing up to 120 mgse l 1 as selenate furthermore we aimed to produce settleable selenium crystals or clusters thereof which are relatively easy to separate from the aqueous phase 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of biomass the microbial inoculum consisted of anaerobic granular sludge originating from a full scale uasb reactor treating wastewater from a paper factory in eerbeek the netherlands hageman et al 2017a hulshoff pol et al 2001 sludge from this reactor is mainly methanogenic but also has sulfate reducing activity the microbial composition of sludge from this reactor has been investigated previously roest et al 2005 tan et al 2018b the biomass was stored at 4 c before inoculation of the reactor and was therefore not adapted to selenate 2 2 medium composition the basal medium used as influent for the bioreactor was adapted from stams et al 1992 omitting sodium selenite sodium sulfide and yeast extract stams et al 1992 the medium consisted of g l 1 nahco3 4 na2hpo4 2h2o 0 53 kh2po4 0 41 nh4cl 0 3 cacl2 2h2o 0 11 mgcl2 6h2o 0 10 and acid and base trace elements and vitamin solution stams et al 1992 sulfate was not added to the influent medium until day 66 in order to suppress the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria which are known to be present in the inoculum sludge hageman et al 2013 from day 66 onwards around 142 mg l 1 na2so4 was added to the medium to provide sulfur as a nutrient for biomass growth ethanol was added as the electron donor to the medium the reagents were of analytical grade unless stated otherwise 2 3 reactor setup a reactor with a working volume of 0 40 l was operated in sequencing batch mode with four stages feeding mixing settling and discharging figure s1 si the reactor temperature was controlled at 30 c using a water bath nitrogen gas was bubbled continuously through the reactor solution at a rate of 0 02 ml s 1 to maintain anoxic conditions the ph of the reactor solution was measured with a 210 mm glass s8 ph electrode qp181x 210 and kept at 7 5 0 1 by a ph controller the redox of the reactor liquid was measured from day 220 495 of the experiment with a 210 mm glass s8 pt billet redox electrode against ag agcl and monitored with a phm 210 radiometer the hydraulic retention time of the sbr was 24 h during day 0 351 12 h during day 352 413 6 h during day 414 419 12 h during day 420 427 and 6 h until the end of the experiment the following operational disturbances occurred that temporarily affected the reactor performance in terms of selenate reduction day 146 160 influent tubing clogged day 186 204 air leakage day 259 266 too much 8 ml of 70

scrubbers were connected to the gas outlet of the reactor the first scrubber contained 200 ml of concentrated ethylene glycol allride coolant newco europe uk ltd the netherlands to capture any volatile organic se compounds while the second scrubber contained 200 ml of 3 m koh to capture any possibly formed h2se hageman et al 2013 2 4 batch experiments utilization of the electron donors ethanol and h2 by reactor sludge in the presence of selenate was assessed on day 498 for each experiment a volume of 20 ml well mixed content containing 1163 21 mgcod l 1 acetate from the reactor was incubated in 125 ml bottles with 60 ml of fresh medium containing selenate and sulfate to reach a starting concentration of 1 1 mmol l 1 selenate and 1 mmol l 1 sulfate further composition of medium same as described in section 2 2 in total 200 ml content was taken from the reactor for batch experiments the culture bottles were closed with a butyl rubber stopper and aluminum crimp seal the headspace was degassed to 0 5 atm and then gassed to 1 5 atm with 100 n2 except the experiment with h2 as the electron donor which was flushed with 80 h2 and 20 co2 this was repeated 5 times with a final overpressure of 0 2 atm the bottles were incubated in a shaker 120 rpm at 30 c the selenate selenite ethanol concentration in solution and the headspace gas composition were regularly analyzed batch experiments were carried out in duplicate for comparing the cod change among experiments with different electron donors the h2 concentration is also expressed as mgcod l 1 calculated based on the ideal gas law and related to the liquid volume we designed an additional experiment to further elucidate the reaction pathway in this experiment hydrogen was added in excess to an incubation also containing selenate selenite and furthermore biomass and medium with an excess of hydrogen the fermentation of ethanol to hydrogen and acetate becomes thermodynamically unfeasible conrad et al 1986 ethanol consumption in the presence of hydrogen supports the direct pathway while the absence of ethanol consumption would support the indirect route after day 498 the reactor s biomass was transferred to a sealed culture bottle with 1 2 atm 100 n2 in the headspace the culture bottle was stored at 4 c and 50 of the medium inside the bottle was refreshed every month the medium contained 1 5 mmol l 1 sodium selenate 1 mmol l 1 sodium sulfate and 200 mgcod l 1 ethanol the other components of the medium were the same as described in section 2 2 the ethanol utilization route was assessed using biomass from the reactor stored at 4 c for 3 months 1 ml well mixed content containing 10 mgcod l 1 ethanol and acetate was incubated in 125 ml bottles with 30 ml of fresh medium containing ethanol selenate and sulfate leading with a starting concentration of 191 mgcod l 1 ethanol 1 2 mmol l 1 selenate and 1 mmol l 1 sulfate the culture bottles were sealed as described above and filled with 1 5 atm 100 n2 in the headspace the bottles were incubated in a shaker 120 rpm at 30 c liquid samples were taken on days 1 3 and 5 afterward 10 ml fresh medium was added to the culture bottles to mix with the residual components and the headspace was refilled with 1 2 atm of 80 h2 and 20 co2 therefore the starting concentration in assays was 25 mgcod l 1 ethanol 84 mgcod l 1 acetate 1572 mgcod l 1 h2 0 74 mmol l 1 selenite 0 34 mmol l 1 selenate and 1 mmol l 1 sulfate the bottles were incubated in a shaker 120 rpm at 30 c liquid samples and gas composition were analyzed on day 1 and 2 to investigate the morphology change of the produced elemental selenium phase v we transported the upper liquid from the reactor to culture bottles and tracked the size and structure change of samples by microscope 0 02 nan3 was added to control experiments by mixing se0 laden effluent and nan3 solution to inhibit microbial activity and the nan3 was refreshed every 3 days the culture bottles were sealed as described above and kept anaerobic by filling the headspace with 100 n2 the batch bottles were incubated in a shaker 120 rpm at 30 c samples of the mixed content were collected on day 3 2 5 analysis and calculation liquid samples were filtered 0 45 µm before analysis ethanol and acetate concentrations were measured by gas chromatography as described by hageman et al 2017b ch4 co2 and n2 were analyzed by a gas chromatograph shimadzu gc 2010 containing porabond q and molsieve 5a columns and h2 was analyzed using gas chromatography hewlett packard 5890a as described by van eerten jansen et al 2015 the sulfide concentration was measured using a hach lange test lck 635 and a hach lange xion 500 spectrophotometer when the sulfide concentration was lower than the detection limit of this method 0 1 mg l 1 sulfide an additional analysis with lead ii acetate paper merck darmstadt germany was performed to check if trace sulfide levels less than parts per billion were present de rink et al 2019 ter heijne et al 2018 the selenate selenite and sulfate concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatography dionex ics 2100 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the total selenium concentration was analyzed at wavelength 196 nm by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry vista mpx ccd simultaneous varian co equipped with an mpx megapixel detector the samples for total selenium analysis were first digested with 10 ml aqua regia in a microwave ethos easy advanced microwave digestion system milestone srl italy the solid samples were washed as described previously hageman et al 2017a and characterized by light microscopy with a nikon eclipse e400 1000x magnification nikon tokyo japan x ray diffraction xrd on a bruker d8 advanced diffractometer equipped with a vantec position sensitive detector and with a co kα radiation λ 0 179 nm over a range of 10 90 in 0 02 step sizes with an integration time of 0 5 s and scanning electron microscope sem magellan 400 fei eindhoven the netherlands for sem analysis samples were washed with milli q water and dried at room temperature the method for sem analysis was described previously mol et al 2020 the chemical composition was analyzed by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx using the aztec x ray analyzer oxford instruments analytical high wycombe england with a resolution of 0 4 na at 10 kv the biomass was collected from the reactor on day 220 and concentrated by centrifugation to remove the supernatant the sample pellet was subsequently frozen by liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c the composition of the microbial community was analyzed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing as described previously de leeuw et al 2020 the sequencing data were submitted to the ena database and the accession number for the presented 16s rrna sequencing set is prjeb41212 the biomass concentration was measured as the total organic nitrogen using dr lange cuvette test lck138 hach lange germany the specific method was described previously de rink et al 2019 the biomass formula is regarded as ch1 8o0 5n0 2 thus the measured total organic nitrogen accounts for 11 w w of the total weight biomass the difference between selenate load and the load of dissolved selenium sum of selenate and selenite in the effluent was regarded as the production of elemental selenium se0 this assumption is based on the finding in the literature that se0 is the dominant product of biological selenate reduction under similar conditions table 2 and our experimental findings that se0 was found to precipitate in the reactor as a final product and so that no volatile se species were detected in the gas scrubbing solution of the reactor 3 results and discussion 3 1 selenate conversion rate at hrt of 24 h the reactor was inoculated with 5 g wet anaerobic granular eerbeek sludge and operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h for the first 350 days divided into 3 phases i iii the results of the reactor performance are shown in fig 1 a d during the start up phase i day 0 100 the volumetric selenate conversion rate gradually increased until a fairly stable level of 25 34 mgse l 1 day 1 was reached from day 69 to 100 although the influent contained 4 to 6 fold excess of ethanol cod relative to the stoichiometric needed cod for complete selenate reduction fig 1b the selenate conversion efficiency was only 67 79 with 7 14 mgse l 1 still present in the effluent figure s3 si the low efficiency may have been caused by substrate limitation because ethanol was consumed entirely data not shown and the effluent acetate concentration remained below 15 mgcod l 1 from day 69 100 presumably a large fraction of the ethanol cod was converted to methane by the methanogenic consortia present in the inoculum this is supported by the poor cod recovery which remained below 50 in phase i fig 1d at the start of phase ii day 100 225 the selenate load was doubled to 80 mgse l 1 day 1 while the ethanol load was increased by only 20 to 170 mg cod l 1 day 1 fig 1a b in an attempt to steer the competition for reducing equivalents from ethanol towards selenate reduction although the selenate conversion rate increased immediately a fraction of selenate was only partially reduced to selenite fig 1a after stepwise decreasing the ethanol load to ultimately 60 mgcod l 1 day 1 on day 169 selenite formation further increased with about 1 3 of the depleted selenate appearing as selenite fig 1a the ethanol load was increased stepwise to 150 mgcod l 1 day 1 from day 205 225 after which the selenite formation rate decreased to below 5 mgse l 1 day 1 while the selenate reduction rate increased the start of phase iii day 225 350 was marked by a 50 increase of the ethanol and selenate load selenite was formed transiently fig 1a until day 254 and again after periods of operational disturbances day 259 266 and day 311 331 the reactor performance remained stable with a high conversion efficiency 94 from day 332 to 350 with no selenite 3 2 selenate conversion rate at hrt of 12 and 6 h phase iv started with an hrt of 12 h and with a selenate and ethanol loading rate of 210 250 mgse l 1 day 1 and 900 1100 mgcod l 1 day 1 respectively the selenate conversion rate rapidly increased to levels close to the loading rate in two days with a conversion efficiency 95 however the selenate conversion rate started to decline after two weeks while the selenite formation rate started to increase this was thought to be caused by substrate limitation therefore the ethanol load was increased to 1920 mgcod l 1 day 1 on day 387 resulting in a selenate conversion efficiency of 95 on day 413 then it was tested whether this conversion efficiency would hold with low hrt at the start of phase v day 414 so the hrt was further decreased to 6 h within 1 day the selenate conversion rate increased from 172 to 236 mgse l 1 day 1 conversion efficiency 65 and further increased to 377 mgse l 1 day 1 conversion efficiency 79 on day 415 yet up to 25 of selenate was converted to selenite selenite formation kept increasing to 190 mgse l 1 day 1 even after doubling the ethanol load to avoid the potential toxic effects of the high concentration of selenite on the microbial biomass hunter and manter 2009 the hrt was increased to 12 h for 1 week the selenite formation rate dropped within 1 day to 8 mgse l 1 day 1 on day 422 and further decreased to below 0 5mgse l 1 day 1 on day 427 meanwhile the selenate conversion efficiency recovered to 98 on day 425 rate 202 mgse l 1 day 1 the hrt was again changed to 6 h on day 428 the selenate conversion rate first increased while the selenite formation rate rapidly increased the following 5 days afterward selenite formation decreased from 151 mgse l 1 day 1 day 433 to only 1 5 mgse l 1 day 1 day 450 while the selenate conversion rate gradually increased to around 440 mgse l 1 day 1 from day 446 to 495 efficiency 90 several operational issues see materials and methods section resulted in the fluctuation of selenate reduction and selenite formation from day 450 490 the average selenate conversion rate was 415 17 mgse l 1 day 1 in this period with effluent concentrations of 5 8 mgse l 1 selenate and 0 3 mgse l 1 selenite the average cod recovery in phase iv and v was 83 13 of which 73 15 was attributed to acetate formation and 7 7 3 5 to selenate reduction as either selenite or elemental selenium in contrast with previous bioreactor studies in our study selenate reduction was independent of sulfate reduction as sulfate reduction the slight difference between sulfate inflow and outflow and methanogenesis no ch4 detected in headspace were negligible we presume that the missing cod was covered by the unquantified microbial biomass production and possibly hydrogen formation from ethanol fermentation the latter could not be measured as it was purged from the solution and reactor with the nitrogen gas the maximum volumetric selenate conversion rate 444 mgse l 1 day 1 is around 6 times higher than previously reported 72 mgse l 1 day 1 table 2 when compared to previous research table 2 the relatively high selenate load in our study was achieved by using a low hrt in combination with a relatively high selenate concentration in the influent for a prolonged period this enabled the development of a highly specific selenate reducing biofilm in the reactor this would likely not have been possible with the low selenate concentration used in previous studies as then unrealistically low hrts would have to be applied interaction of sulfate and selenate reduction has been reported hockin and gadd 2006 lenz et al 2009 tan et al 2018a zehr and oremland 1987 but here the selenate conversion rate was not affected by sulfate reduction or the resulting potentially toxic sulfide lenz et al 2008a and therefore there is no competition for electron donor the low or no production of methane also in the batch experiments confirmed that mainly selenate is used in the reactor as the terminal electron acceptor by the specialized selenate reducing biomass 3 3 incomplete ethanol oxidation during day 0 14 in phase i up to 55 mgcod l 1 acetate was formed but afterward acetate formation remained low during phase i fig 1c with concentrations below 15 mgcod l 1 in phase ii the acetate concentration in the effluent gradually increased while the molar ratio acetate formed ethanol consumed increased to 0 5 fig 1c revealing partially incomplete oxidation of ethanol this ratio further increased until it stabilized from day 275 350 with an average value of 1 01 0 15 mol acetate produced mol ethanol consumed which revealed that all ethanol was incompletely oxidized to acetate in period iv and v the molar ratio was 1 14 0 23 also indicating incomplete ethanol oxidation thus at the high rates observed in phase iii v selenate reduction proceeded according to eq 2 this is in line with thermodynamics where the incomplete oxidation results in more gibb s free energy change per electron 74 0 kj mol 1 e than the complete oxidation of ethanol 69 0 kj mol 1 e under actual reactor conditions 3 4 specific selenate reduction rate we attempted to monitor the biomass concentration based on the nitrogen content of suspended solids in the reactor unfortunately a representative sampling from the reactor without opening the reactor proved impossible to prevent exposing the biomass to oxygen in the air we refrained from opening the reactor the biomass concentration at the start day 0 and end day 498 of the experiment amounted to 1 59 gbiomass l 1 and 0 50 gbiomass l 1 respectively corresponding to a 73 decrease the specific selenate reducing activity of the inoculum as assessed in a batch assay was 0 82 0 06 mg se 1 day 1 gbiomass 1 while in the reactor at the end of the experiment it was 856 26 mg se 1 day 1 gbiomass 1 the latter was based on the volumetric selenate reduction rate in the reactor during day 476 495 and the biomass concentration as assessed after the termination of the reactor experiment on day 495 thus the specific selenate reducing activity increased approximately 1000 fold during the almost 500 day experiment indicating that selenate reducers were strongly enriched in the sludge the inoculum sludge originated from a full scale anaerobic reactor treating paper factory wastewater and was predominantly methanogenic the biomass collected at the end of the experiment did not produce measurable amounts of methane or sulfide in batch assays containing 0 12 gbiomass l 1 within 72 h also in the reactor sulfate reduction was negligible figure s5 si while the high cod recovery of 93 14 fig 2 d indicated that also methane formation did not contribute substantially as a sink for the electron donor in conclusion the long term experiment resulted in highly specific biomass which incompletely oxidized ethanol using selenate as the sole terminal electron acceptor 3 5 reaction route in the reactor ethanol may be directly used for selenate reduction eq 2 or ethanol may first be fermented to acetate and hydrogen eq 3 followed by the use of hydrogen by selenate reducing microorganisms eq 4 3 c 2 h 5 oh h 2 o c h 3 co o 2 h 2 h 4 seo 4 2 3 h 2 2 h 2 s e 0 4 h 2 o to gain more insight into the ethanol degradation pathway batch experiments with samples from the reactor taken on day 498 were carried out with either ethanol or hydrogen as added electron donor and selenate as the electron acceptor with 740 5 mgcod l 1 ethanol the molar ratio acetate formed ethanol consumed was 1 0 0 2 after 24 h fig 3 b confirming the incomplete oxidation of ethanol as already observed in the sbr while hydrogen accumulated to 0 55 0 02 v v in the headspace these results indicated that ethanol is oxidized to acetate with h as an electron sink hydrogen decreased to 0 036 0 003 after 48 h while the average molar ratio acetate formed ethanol consumed increased to 1 34 0 01 hydrogen composition further decreased to 0 0008 0 01 after 72 h while the molar ratio acetate formed ethanol consumed was 1 36 0 02 similar as after 48 h though the h2 concentration fig 3b decreased from 24 h to 72 h the maximum measured h2 concentration was 2 35 0 09 mgcod l 1 at 24 h which was less compared to the cod needed for selenate reduction thus although this strongly supports that ethanol oxidation coupled to selenate reduction proceeded at least partially via hydrogen we cannot exclude that ethanol was used also directly unlike in the reactor the larger part of the reduced selenate was converted to selenite fig 3a after a lag phase the selenate depletion and selenite formation showed a linear trend from 16 to 48 h with a selenate depletion rate of 43 2 mgse l 1 day 1 r2 0 9963 and a selenite formation rate of 31 2 mgse l 1 day 1 r2 0 9927 respectively table 1 thus 73 of the depleted selenate was converted to selenite while in the reactor it was only 15 on the day of sampling of the microbial biomass day 498 after 48 h both the selenate conversion and selenite formation became slower corresponding with the limitation of ethanol with h2 as electron donor 323 mgcod l 1 at the start selenate was depleted within 72 h fig 4 while the h2 concentration dropped to 275 3 mgcod l 1 providing further support for the hypothesis that hydrogen is an important contributing electron donor for selenate reduction in the reactor it is noted that acetate was also present 314 1 mgcod l 1 at the start transferred together with the microbial biomass from the reactor however acetate did not serve as the electron donor for selenate reduction 315 8 mgcod l 1 acetate after 72 h on average 48 mgcod l 1 h2 was consumed of which 65 was covered by selenate reduction to both selenite and elemental selenium selenite was also found with hydrogen as the added electron donor the calculated se0 production which was based on the difference between selenate depletion and selenite formation showed a linear trend from 24 72 h table 1 figure s6b1 and s6b2 si revealing that the se0 production was stable in the presence of both selenite and h2 the se0 production did not decrease when all selenate was depleted 0 1 mmol l 1 after 72 h indicating that the se0 may be formed solely by selenite reduction methane was not detected in any of the batches the results of the batch experiments using biomass from the reactor after storing at 4 c for 3 months are shown in figure s8 with ethanol as the sole electron donor the selenate was almost completely converted to 0 03 mgse l 1 as selenate in 5 days to selenite 84 of the total removed selenate and elemental selenium while the ethanol was incompletely oxidized to acetate afterward with ethanol and hydrogen selenate was reduced with hydrogen being consumed while the ethanol concentration did not change this result revealed that when hydrogen was present in excess ethanol degradation is inhibited this finding suggests that the indirect route where hydrogen formed from ethanol fermentation serves as the electron donor for selenate reduction is predominant though hardly any literature reported this indirect ethanol consumption pathway the utilization of h2 as an electron donor chung et al 2006 huber et al 2000 lai et al 2014 ontiveros valencia et al 2018 2016 pearce et al 2008 van ginkel et al 2011 or incomplete electron donor lactate oxidation fujita et al 1997 nancharaiah and lens 2015 switzer blum et al 1998 for selenate or selenite reduction has already been studied selenite production as a final or intermediate selenate reduction product was also found astratinei et al 2006 chasteen and bentley 2003 hageman et al 2013 switzer blum et al 1998 therefore we may conclude that selenate reduction with selenite as an intermediated product is achieved using the h2 formed through the ethanol fermentation fig 5 the transient accumulation of hydrogen in the batch experiments with ethanol and the inhibition of ethanol consumption by the excess presence of hydrogen points to the occurrence of this pathway furthermore the initial accumulation of selenite indicates that selenate is first reduced to selenite step 1 fig 5 and then to elemental selenium step 2 fig 5 3 5 selenite formation in the reactor the redox was monitored from day 220 495 fig 6 increases of the redox potential and selenite formation rate in the reactor experiment followed either after a process upset redox selenite formation peak 2 3 4 5 6 7 10 11 and 12 or increase of the selenate load peak 1 8 and 9 a concomitant increase of selenite accumulation and redox potential was also found in previous work hageman et al 2013 after process upsets the selenate reducing biomass may have been partially inhibited or may have decayed resulting in a high load of selenate per number of active cells which is the same effect after a sudden increase of the selenate load therefore we speculate that a high ratio of selenate load active cells triggers the inhibition of the reduction of selenite to elemental selenium resulting in selenite accumulation this would imply that selective selenite production from selenate might be achieved by controlling the redox e g by maintaining substrate limiting conditions the insights gained from the batch experiments may also help to better explain the formation of selenite in the reactor fig 1a and 2a 3 6 se speciation total selenium in the effluent was measured and shown for selected days fig 7 selenate reduction rate 390 mgse l 1 day 1 the total dissolved se measured by icp did not show much difference with the sum of selenate and selenite in the effluent data not shown indicating that no substantial other dissolved selenium species selenide organic selenium or colloidal se0 were formed this is different from what lenz found where the dissolved selenium concentration was about three times higher than detected selenate concentration in the effluent no selenite production which was thought to have resulted from the formation of colloidally dispersed se0 nanoparticles lenz et al 2008a thus the slight differences between the total dissolved se and se oxyanions also exclude the production of colloidally dispersed se0 the difference between the total se and total dissolved se sum of selenate and selenite fluctuated from 3 to 11 mgse l 1 indicating that a small fraction of the solid selenium washed out from the reactor indeed red colored particles most likely amorphous selenium were present in the sbr effluent which could be removed by either 0 45 µm filter or centrifugation xrd analysis did not show any crystalline se0 signal for washed out particles suggesting that the red selenium solids indeed were amorphous the increase of total washed out amorphous se at day 471 could be attributed to mixing of the reactor prior to the attempted sampling for biomass density analysis which may release attached amorphous elemental selenium the short hrt in this phase 6 h may be not feasible for settling of all the solids because 5 mgse l 1 elemental selenium was washed out several days after the attempt for biomass density sampling day 471 478 which was not seen in the case of 24 h or 12 h hrt 3 mgse l 1 before and after sampling data not shown the total se concentration in the gas scrubbing solutions was always lower than the detection limit 1 mgse l 1 indicating no organic se or h2se was produced in the reactor h2se was reported to be produced by srbs nelson et al 1996 and dimethylselenide and dimethyldiselenide were found to be produced by srbs and methanogens michalke et al 2000 the absence of volatile se species in the sbr after the long term operation points to the selection of specialized selenate and selenite reducers while the sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens from the original eerbeek sludge were washed out the total dissolved selenium concentration was much higher than allowed according to the discharge limit 50 μg l 1 as selenate or 10 µgse l 1 as total selenium tan et al 2016a still the batch experiments showed the possibility to remove selenate to less than 20 µgse l 1 detection limit within144 h and 0 35 µgse l 1 of selenite the latter may be further reduced by extending of the reaction time 3 7 solids accumulation in the reactor in phase i similarly to previous work we found that the first formed se solids using eerbeek sludge were orange red spherical amorphous selenium particles attached to the biomass hageman et al 2017a because amorphous selenium is thermodynamically not the most stable phase it was postulated that bacterial organic material polysaccharides polymers attached to the selenium hinders crystallization to hexagonal selenium hageman et al 2017a lenz et al 2011 as listed in table 2 the amorphous se0 attachment to biomass was found in various processes hageman et al 2017a lenz et al 2011 2008a mal et al 2017 however several factors in this system might still allow the formation and recrystallization of amorphous selenium into black hexagonal selenium the ph the accumulation of amorphous selenium in the reactor increasing the probability of aggregation and the driving force to obtain the thermodynamically most stable phase first of all the ph in our experiments was 7 5 and according to hageman s findings with increasing ph from ph 7 onwards he found black hexagonal selenium forms already at a ph of 7 4 hageman et al 2017a it is reported that the surface potential of biopolymers would become more negative with ph increase carneiro da cunha et al 2011 the same is true for proteins schmitt et al 1998 therefore there is more likely that the selenium particles detach from the negatively charged bacteria besides the sorption affinity of proteins and lipopolysaccharides lps to selenium surfaces may decrease with an increase in ph parikh and chorover 2008 the accumulation of amorphous se particles resulting from feeding the reactor with high selenate concentrations can then promote the aggregation it is reported that the organics tend to detach from the inorganic materials allowing the formation of a larger structure because brownian motion driven particle collisions decreasing the effective surface area with the solution would overcome the surface tension energy allowing crystallization banfield et al 2000 hence the re crystallization and transformation to the most stable phase is allowed banfield et al 2000 jin et al 2018 which can lead to larger organized single crystals as mentioned in a comment on the work by banfield et al 2000 alivisatos 2000 the aggregation of selenium particles has already been reported previously hageman et al 2017a besides the observation of morphology changes of the solids from amorphous round to acicular crystalline phases was confirmed in batch experiments where biomass activity was inhibited with nan3 indicating an abiotic process after biomineralization of amorphous selenium figure s9a showed how sphere particles aggregated with the existed acicular clusters on day 3 the overview picture of the particles figure s9b showed that generally quantity and size of the clusters increased when sampled from day 3 to day 30 one may note that this batch experiment was carried out in phase v when the reactor has already operated continuously for 500 days it is reasonable to find several large acicular clusters at the beginning of batch assays with the picture shown in figure s9b we speculated both size and numbers of acicular particles in the aggregates increased with time furthermore attachment to reactor walls and tubing enhances this aggregation and recrystallization process as the attachment also decreases the surface tension energy that has to be overcome probably therefore we found the black hexagonal selenium on the tubing and reactor walls as systems tend to progress to the most stable thermodynamic state then recrystallization leads to black hexagonal selenium recrystallization is based on both the ostwald step rule going from amorphous to crystalline state and ostwald ripening small particles merge recrystallize to large particles as to reduce surface area i e aging the longer the srt in the reactor the more time for ostwald processes and the more likely black hexagonal selenium will make up the bulk of the solids found in the reactor it is also reported that the attachment of se0 to the sludge leads to faster settling rates and higher hydrophilicity compared with sludge without entrapment se0 jain et al 2015 which helps capture the produced amorphous se0 in the reactor the sequence batch mode was also reported to benefit the settling of the produced se0 mal et al 2017 as a result red color was observed in the sludge and on the reactor wall in the first stages of the experiment after day 100 in phase ii more of the reactor wall area was covered with solids and the color changed from red to black dried macroscopic flakes from the n2 tubing on day 229 had a metallic luster these consisted of clusters of needles with a size ranging between 20 and 200 µm the cluster fig 8 a is remarkably similar to the cluster of the selenium particles found on day 195 in a thermophilic 50 c selenate reducing reactor hageman et al 2015 but the reduction rate in our case was much higher than in the thermophilic reactor 5 of 1 mmol l 1 selenate the length of an individual needle was approximately 10 µm this result is similar to the size that hageman et al found for ph 8 but somewhat smaller than at ph 9 hageman et al 2017a after 495 days flaky aggregates 1 mm of black solids attached to the n2 tubing solids that had settled at the bottom of the reactor solids attached to the reactor wall and suspended solids were collected with icp the total se content in the solid materials from the bottom of the reactor was 80 0 8 g se g 1 dry solid these solid materials were a mixture of biomass sludge flocs and flaky selenium aggregates more specifically the flaky aggregates not only mixed with biomass in the bottom but also attached to n2 tubbing or the reactor wall contained 100 pure se 1 g se g 1 dry solid these se aggregates are more hydrophobic more adamant and constitute the largest mass fraction in the sludge the larger particle sizes of these aggregates compared with biomass make them easily separable from biomass by mesh sieves ruiken et al 2013 the density of pure hexagonal selenium is also high 4 81 g cm3 so separation by gravitational methods i e centrifugation hageman et al 2017a hydrocycloning coffey 2009 microbubble flotation yoon 1993 or sedimentation may also be applicable the formation of pure 80 of total mixed solids large selenium precipitates has not yet been reported in the literature table 2 the solid mixture in the bottom contained 67 g se 6 7 g se ml 1 of in total of 10 ml solids which is 87 w w of the calculated total selenate load to the reactor during the experiment 77 g se calculated value one may note that the start up of this process day 0 50 and during some operational disturbances the reactor had relatively low selenate removal efficiency which was also included in the calculation thus we may conclude that the se recovery potential of this process is 87 an increase in the retainment of solids amorphous and hexagonal in the reactor could be achieved by an increase in the surface area for se0 attachment for instance by adding more supporting material inside the reactor and an increase in the settling time compared to the stirring time which were 2 and 34 min respectively repeated in cycles of 40 min for phase analysis of the black needles sampled from the reactor xrd on day 240 and sem edx on day 287 were used the xrd spectra fig 9 matched with the hexagonal crystalline se with a probability of 92 with sem fig 10 the needle form can be distinguished which is typical for hexagonal selenium and edx analysis confirmed that this acicular structure consisted of 100 se therefore after the initial precipitation of amorphous selenium in phase i crystallization to hexagonal elemental selenium has occurred as the bioreactor is continuously precipitating new selenium this could promote the growth of these needles 3 8 biomass community we chose the eerbeek inoculum based on its high microbial diversity roest et al 2005 and applied selective conditions for over a year and a half thereby aiming to select and enrich species that would be well adapted next generation sequencing ngs analysis of the biomass revealed that the community in the reactor sampled at day 220 end of phase ii was different from the biomass of the original eerbeek sludge roest et al 2005 tan et al 2018b the biomass community was dominated by bacteria and the most abundant microorganisms were from the proteobacteria phylum 30 of the community sequences table s2 si followed by firmicutes 17 and bacteroidetes 16 many reported selenate selenite reducing bacteria distribute in the proteobacteria knotek smith et al 2006 tan et al 2016b though firmicutes is known to contain sulfate reducing species tan et al 2018a these are often also able to reduce selenate knotek smith et al 2006 tan et al 2016b bacteroidetes are also believed to play a role in the reduction of selenium oxyanions as selenate reductase was identified in the genomes of this phylum fakra 2015 geobacteraceae is the most abundant family representing 16 of total community families identified there are various members of this family known as metal reducers and selenite is included nancharaiah and lens 2015 pearce et al 2009 tan et al 2018a for instance strain kmt was reported to be able to use acetate to reduce selenate and selenite nasaringarao and häggblom 2007 more specifically geobacter accounted for 16 of the total genera identified one member of this genus geobacter sulfurreducens pca was reported to couple hydrogen or acetate oxidation with selenite respiration nancharaiah and lens 2015 pearce et al 2009 the most abundant archaeal group was methanosaetaceae 6 of the total microbial families which are known acetotrophic methanogens on the day of sampling day 220 the molar ratio acetate formed ethanol consumed was 0 5 suggesting that 50 of the acetate was still consumed by the reactor biomass likely the acetate was converted to undetected methane as indicated by the low cod recovery of around 60 on day 220 the increase in the molar ratio acetate formed ethanol consumed and the cod recovery to approximately 1 0 and 80 90 respectively from day 280 onwards indicate that the acetotrophic methanogens gradually washed out or became inactive desulfuromonadaceae which are known as sulfate sulfur reducers was found to contribute to 5 of the population however hardly any sulfate concentration change was found in the effluent figure s5 si many sulfate reducers also reduce selenate which may explain their presence as so many members from the abundant phylum are found to be related to selenate selenite reduction we may conclude that during the 495 days of the microbial community development microbes that are well adapted to the selenium reduction were selected this is in line with the satisfying reactor performance of on the average 97 selenate selectivity before the sampling date day 216 219 the increased cod recovery in phase i iii and the negligible methane production or sulfate reduction as discussed before in section 3 4 is also due to the biomass community change the strategy of a starting with a rich community and b applying selective conditions for a prolonged period has proven successful in our environmental biotechnological research hageman et al 2013 lindeboom et al 2011 weijma et al 2000 still by default we cannot exclude that other inocula would have led to the same biomass development or even higher selenate reduction rates 4 conclusion this study presented a high rate process for the recovery of selenium based on biological selenate reduction to elemental selenium without the formation of highly toxic hydrogen selenide or organic selenium species pure crystalline hexagonal se0 was identified as selenium solid accumulating in the reactor in clusters and was easy to separate the achieved high purity would facilitate the recycling of the generated selenium selenate was the predominant electron acceptor in the process while co2 and sulfate reduction were absent however ethanol was incompletely oxidized implying that maximally 1 3 of the electron equivalents in ethanol could be used for the desired conversion selenite was found both in reactor and batch experiments revealing the presence of selenite as intermediate being produced from selenate this process can be used for high concentrated process and waste streams declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
