24735,this conceptual article continues a discussion into the nature of complexity in ecosystems and environmental change through the improved conceptual model icm the icm developed is useful for reducing the usability gap i e between what scientists consider useful information and what users consider usable in decision making by improving understanding and representation of complexity in ecosystems assessment of climate change impacts and development of adaptation and mitigation strategies the icm is demonstrated by applying it to an agroecosystem in the southeastern united states as a case study it improves anandhi and bentley 2018 s framework by adding indicators theory complex adaptive systems theory a framework cynefin framework and a model knowledge hierarchy to the conceptualization since this study focused on demonstrating the framework several simplifying assumptions were made for conciseness and simplicity selecting precipitation and temperature variables to represent climate having fewer indicators frost and wet dry spells influencing frost only by minimum temperature influencing wet dry spells by daily precipitation assuming equal likelihood of potential changes in climate scenarios selecting studies based on impacts and selecting fewer adaptation strategies future studies could use the icm framework to examine more closely mathematical relationships among climate variables indicators prediction uncertainty and decision making in more realistic scenarios choosing multiple indicators with detailed information and measured data in each keywords scenario development causal chains complex adaptive systems theory cynefin framework knowledge hierarchy model adaptation and mitigation strategies ecosystem functioning 1 introduction the inherently multi disciplinary nature of real world systems physical natural social economic cultural and political result in collective behaviors that are difficult to understand and predict using tools from individual disciplines beveridge et al 2018 much has been written about the complexity of ecosystems environmental change e g climate change land use change vulnerability and adaption of ecosystems to these changes and mitigation of the changes this conceptual article continues this discussion into the nature of complexity in ecosystems and environmental change conceptualizations which are often an excellent point from which to understand a system can involve mental or physical images and may not be quantitative blair and buytaert 2016 therefore conceptual models are needed to collate visualize understand and explain the issues and problems relating to actual or predicted situations and how they might be solved patrício et al 2016 these models can be an important first step in developing a quantified model blair and buytaert 2016 when they are considered as organizational diagrams that bring together and summarize information in a standard logical and hierarchical way patrício et al 2016 anandhi and bentley 2018 developed a conceptual framework to reduce the usability gap i e between what scientists consider useful information and what users consider usable in decision making lemos et al 2012 by representing complexity using known knowns known unknowns and unknown unknowns rumsfeld 2002 new observations empirical studies and conceptual modeling increase knowledge and reduce uncertainties due to known unknowns and unknown unknowns di baldassarre et al 2016 in complex systems policy and decision making strategies are understood only partially but they can be improved as knowledge and understanding improves mercure et al 2019 the goal of this study was to reduce the usability gap further the specific objective was to develop an improved model that is eclectic it improves anandhi and bentley 2018 s original framework by adding indicators examination of the framework through the lens of a theory complex adaptive systems theory neely 2019 a framework cynefin framework breitschuh et al 2018 and a knowledge model to the conceptualization to distinguish them we refer to the original and improved frameworks as the original conceptual model ocm and improved conceptual model icm respectively with this study we hope to promote discussion and insight by researchers into the nature of complexity in ecosystems and environmental change in particular we hope to improve understanding and representation of complexity in ecosystems assessment of climate change impacts and development of adaptation and mitigation strategies and thus help reduce the usability gap this article presents the icm framework in general and then applies it to a case study to demonstrate the value of the framework 2 methodology improved conceptual model 2 1 theoretical framework the theoretical framework diagram fig 1 outlines the improvement in icm using indicators in icm we undertook a more structured multidisciplinary perspective by incorporating a complex adaptive systems theory cas and a knowledge hierarchy model to improve our understanding of known knowns and known unknowns and to decrease the unknown unknowns and the usability gap cas coined by buckley buckley 1968 is based on complexity theory in which a collective behavior and self organizing patterns emerges as a result of a large number of interactions among components within a system and among system components and its environment mcleod and childs 2013 a cas systems modifies and adapts its behavior to changes in its environment rammel et al 2007 the cas theory lens is useful for understanding various space time varying structures and processes in agroecosystems and climate because they share several cas characteristics listed below the cynefin framework is a tool that draws from cas theory and knowledge management to help stakeholders make sense of the data and to choose solutions mcleod and childs 2013 knowledge management is developed from economics and technology disciplines identifies and gathers content from various sources and is used to develop meaningful relationships french 2014 the cynefin framework perceives the complex process and has five domains namely simple complicated complex chaos and disorder van beurden et al 2013 the first two domains are ordered the next two are the un ordered domains and the last is disordered by distinguishing the known and potentially knowable simple complicated from less knowable complex chaos the framework provides unique insights and generate knowledges about the interactions between components sturmberg and topolski 2014 the cynefin framework helps determine a system s state and decide how to act breitschuh et al 2018 although in the cynefin framework the domains complex and complicated are distinguished it is important to be aware that they can be interchanged for example the oxford english dictionary defines complex as the state or quality of being intricate or complicated a factor involved in a complicated process or situation geraldi et al 2011 the knowledge hierarchy has been shown to decrease the usability gap for sustainable water management in agriculture le roux et al 2018 the knowledge hierarchy also referred to as the data information knowledge wisdom dikw hierarchy information hierarchy and the knowledge pyramid is one of the fundamental models in information systems and knowledge management rowley 2007 as frické 2019 state information systems generate store retrieve and process data in the knowledge hierarchy data represent observable properties provides information processed data statistically arithmetically information provides knowledge know how of a system and knowledge provides wisdom practicality and unknown in a situation frické 2019 data are the base of the hierarchy with wisdom at the pinnacle rowley 2007 the icm uses indicators to improve our understanding of known knowns and known unknowns while reducing the usability gap for the following reasons 1 indicators are powerful tools to communicate technical data from field experiments studies in relatively simple terms for developing adaptation strategies e g using the cista framework anandhi 2017 anandhi et al 2016b 2 they support representation of complex adaptive systems that expresses the combination of the system and its environment observed in natural systems this helps examine change and adaption in ecosystems as co evolution between the system and the environment rather separating them chan 2001 3 they portray inter relationships between climate environment and plant growth system anandhi 2016 this is connectivity a characteristic of cas in which the inter relationship inter action and inter connectivity between parts of the system and environment results in actions in one part influencing other linked parts in different ways chan 2001 4 they can reveal evidence of already discernible impacts of climate change and provide important insights into factors processes and structures anandhi et al 2018 this is emergent behavior another characteristic of cas systems in which new behavior emerge from connectivity chan 2001 5 they are valuable for monitoring trends in ecosystems schulterbrandt gragg et al 2018 this is in some way co evolution a third cas characteristic where the connectivity and behavior changes over time chan 2001 6 they are useful in impact studies for example for high temperatures that decrease crop yield anandhi and blocksome 2017 this can be an associated in which sensitive dependence on initial conditions a fourth characteristic of cas where small disturbances can produce exponentially divergent behavior with unpredictable consequences chan 2001 7 they are useful in vulnerability studies e g using the vista framework anandhi and kannan 2018 this can be an associated with distance from equilibrium a fifth characteristic of cas in which systems develop different relationships and structures to explore space of possibilities chan 2001 8 they are useful for applying the knowledge hierarchy model to represent cross scale interactions 2 2 icm framework to understand and represent complexity both the ocm fig 2 a and icm fig 2e use rumsfeld s 2002 three categories known knowns known unknowns and unknown unknowns to represent complexity in a system the main difference between ocm and icm is the use of indicators outlined in the theoretical framework diagram fig 1 using complex adaptive systems theory the cynefin framework and knowledge hierarchy model which we believe increase understanding of known knowns and known unknowns while decreasing unknown unknowns fig 2 we also attempted to elaborate upon these three categories to represent complexity and uncertainty chow and sarin 2002 the icm has six steps the first four focus on known knowns while the last two focus on known unknowns known knowns icm uses meta analysis and data analysis of drivers to represent known knowns uncertainty can be known i e probability is precisely known and specified simple problems lie in the realm of known knowns for example relatively uniform and replicable results can be expected in simple systems by following a formula and with little expertise snyder 2013 they lie in the obvious domain of the cynefin framework and use a straightforward process i e sense categorize respond to obtain good results kurtz and snowden 2003 step 1 drivers and target systems select the variables and spatial and temporal scales to represent the drivers and target system for a study region step 2 meta analysis anandhi and bentley 2018 from a literature review tabulate changes in driver variables for the region at the spatial and temporal scales using the research tool developed by baker and anandhi 2013 this step is the same in ocm and icm step 3 data analysis anandhi and bentley 2018 from measured observed modeled data tabulate changes in driver variables for the region at the spatial and temporal scales step 4 indicator estimation the indicators that represent the ecosystems and assessment of climate change impact are first selected they are then estimated from measured observed modeled data this step is unique to icm known unknowns known unknowns are complicated requires expertise and data analysis have cause and effect that are not obvious but needs to be gathered through analysis snyder 2013 known unknown uncertainty arises when the probability is not currently known but can be obtained by further research in complex systems successful i e replicable results are obtained by following a formula using higher order expertise and knowledge of a variety of fields which requires extensive involvement of experts breitschuh et al 2018 step 5 document variability the variability observed in the driver variables during the previous steps meta analysis data analysis and indicator estimation in a region is documented in the meta analysis spatial and temporal scales of the data can depend upon the case study selected step 6 assess the degree of uncertainty the degree of certainty in key findings from the meta analysis is based on the consistency of evidence and degree of agreement when a majority of studies show a change in a driver the middle half of the range is assigned as a low degree of uncertainty based on expert judgement and the rest of the range upper and lower quartiles are assigned a high degree of uncertainty in the data analysis the interquartile range is assigned a low degree of uncertainty and the rest of the data is assigned a high degree of uncertainty more information on how these uncertainties are addressed can be found in mastrandrea et al 2010 unknown unknowns complex problems lie in the realm of unknown unknowns a space in constant flux and are prone to significant change unpredictability of system behavior lack stability have no right answers and have only emergent behaviors breitschuh et al 2018 snyder 2013 unknowable unknown uncertainty represents a reasonable degree of uncertainty whose probability is unknown we used scenarios in this study because they focus explicitly on a range of plausible futures enable deep uncertainty uncertainty is challenging to described to be included in analyses and are useful for policy making challinor et al 2018 yung et al 2019 2 3 scenario funnel both ocm and icm use the concept of scenario funnels fig 2b f unlike the scenario funnels in ocm which document variability alone those in icm document variability and assess the degree of uncertainty steps 5 and 6 the funnels are drawn from expert judgement and thus are not usually probabilistic or quantitative but they can be arbitrarily complex in ways that are difficult to model e g when key mechanisms are uncertain or unknown challinor et al 2018 in the funnel plots for scenarios the x axis represents time e g years seasons and the y axis represents the driver and indicator variables the y axis can represent changes in the variable e g in ocm and or the value of the variable e g in icm they can be obtained from the meta analysis and data analysis the width of the funnel mouth represents the difference among various predictions from the studies meta analysis and indicator estimates data analysis and indicators broader mouths indicate more variability in the results the number of scenario funnels developed depends on the funnel width level of detail required available resources and spatial and temporal scales of the study more details on the method for developing the funnel plots can be found in anandhi and bentley 2018 and anandhi et al 2018 funnel plots form the basis for selecting variables and parameter values that allow pathways or projections of the future to be modeled that are mathematically consistent the scenarios used by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc are based on emissions trajectories special report on emissions scenarios representative concentration pathways rcps and narratives shared socioeconomic pathways challinor et al 2018 in this study rcp based scenarios were used 2 4 cross scale interactions the complex task of describing the causal chain between the driving forces impacts and response is broken down into subtasks kristensen 2004 these subtasks explain the cause and effect behavior from the standpoint of systems e g agroecosystems to assess impacts of drivers e g climate change and responses of target systems e g ecosystems in this study we attempt to break down the causal chain by using cross scale interactions csi in fig 2 the conceptualization framework for the csi in both ocm and icm are similar in that both have layers for drivers with multiple scales spatial temporal and response variables as well as three levels of scenario complexity fig 2c g fig 3 they differ in that icm contains the cynefin framework and indicators to classify the interactions into three groups group 1 no csi known interactions group 2 csi between drivers knowable interactions group 3 csi due to feedback between drivers and response variables complex interactions in ocm the drivers are variables such as changes in precipitation and temperature from the meta analysis and data analysis in icm the drivers are ocm variables and indicator variables these csi are used to develop causal chains loops of varying complexity applying the cynefin framework results in three ontological states i e relations between concepts and categories in a domain order complexity and chaos each with an epistemological option i e relating to theory of knowledge kurtz and snowden 2003 the framework is related to these three groups group 1 represents known cause and effects group 2 represents the knowable and group 3 represents the complex a causal chain is an ordered sequence of events in which any one event in the chain causes the next schulterbrandt gragg et al 2018 when an event in the chain causes an earlier event in the chain the chain becomes a causal loop spatial scales can vary from a point to a region while temporal scales can range from sub daily to centennial group 1 scenarios are causal chains with the least complexity and unidirectional interactions between driver and response variables fig 2c g green arrows in column 1 most complex scenarios in group 3 that have driver variables interact across scales and have feedback from the response variables two way blue arrows between driver and response variables in column 3 group 2 scenarios have intermediate complexity when the driver variables at different scales influence the response variables fig 2c g one way purple arrows between driver and response variables in column 2 these interactions can be documented and useful to stakeholders this approach is iterative 3 applying the icm we applied icm to the southeastern united states usa as a case study since steps 1 3 are the same for ocm and icm their results are summarized more detailed information about these steps can be found in anandhi and bentley 2018 3 1 representing complexity known knowns and known unknowns step 1 drivers and target systems changes in precipitation and temperature were selected as driver variables an agroecosystem with plant climate and land use water use interactions was selected as the target system like for ocm the study region was the southeastern usa i e alabama florida georgia mississippi north carolina south carolina and tennessee the scale of analysis which can vary among steps was documented step 2 meta analysis from a literature review 33 values of change in precipitation from 15 studies and 35 values of change in temperature from 14 studies were documented at seasonal and annual time scales for the southeastern usa step 3 data analysis the ipcc global climate model gcm simulated a modeled time series of precipitation and temperature for the southeastern usa using data on a 1 1 grid spatial scale at a monthly time step temporal scale this study used gcms for a multi model gcm simulation of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 in them changes in annual precipitation and temperature between historical time periods 1950 2005 and future time periods 2006 2100 are estimated from 19 gcm simulations for two scenarios of future rcp rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for the southeastern usa step 4 indicator estimation four frost and 10 wet dry spell indicators were selected to represent the agroecosystems and assessments of climate change impact the indicators were estimated from daily simulations of precipitation and temperature from gcms for the southeastern usa frost and wet dry spells for the study region were defined following anandhi et al 2016a and anandhi et al 2013 step 5 document variability in general from the meta analysis step 2 the changes in precipitation ranged from 30 to 35 and the changes in temperature ranged from 2 c to 6 c by 2099 from the data analysis step 3 the median of the 19 gcms predicted no change in precipitation and an increase in temperature of 2 5 c in the region by 2099 among the 19 gcms the variability 5th and 95th percentiles of the change in precipitation ranged from 40 to 110 while those of the change in temperature ranged from 2 c to 6 c by 2099 among the 19 gcms the variability in the frost indicators step 4 for the number of frost days last spring freeze first fall freeze and growing season duration ranged from 0 to 190 days day of year doy 0 90 doy 275 365 and 150 365 days respectively during the 1950 2099 period for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 among the gcms the variability in the wet spell indicators step 4 for the number of wet spells maximum wet spell duration mean wet spell duration and number of wet days were 35 70 0 200 days 2 9 days and 365 days respectively similarly the variability in the dry spell indicators step 4 for the number of dry spells maximum dry spell duration mean dry spell duration and number of dry days were 35 90 0 80 days 2 9 days and 110 250 days respectively step 6 document uncertainty uncertainty was represented using scenario funnel plots and listed using cross scale interactions 3 2 scenario funnel plots the scenario funnel plots depicted the degree of uncertainty in the drivers climate variables fig 3 the degree of uncertainty in the meta analysis and data analysis varied in the meta analysis the studies used multiple data sources e g measurements gridded data model simulations combinations thereof with varied density in measurements simulation e g scattered individual locations uniform grids varied time steps of model output e g sub daily daily monthly and varied measuring instruments mathematical models in the data analysis of climate and indicator drivers the uncertainty was due to the 19 models and two rcp scenarios considered in the study the indicators had additional uncertainty due to variability in their definitions calculating climate indicators allows decision makers to break down larger variables i e temperature or precipitation to quantify changes that they deem important and further narrow the cone of possible futures while acknowledging that one cannot predict the future nor the unknown unknowns scenario funnels can be used in future thinking to help develop scenarios that provide insight into implications of current choices on future trajectories in the context of impacts as well as developing adaptation and mitigation strategies the scenario funnel provides a range of futures that can be selected qualitatively and or quantitatively from the range from high to low degrees of uncertainty the scenarios selected can be used to reflect on current dynamics of systems with varying degrees of complexity assumptions and relationships known knowable and unknown that govern the historical and potential drivers of future change by engaging with a range of possible outcomes one can prepare for and embrace uncertainty 3 3 cross scale interactions several causal chains loops can be developed using the climate variables indicators drivers and adaptation strategies responses used in this study fig 2c g here we discuss the causal chains loop developed in the context of icm among temperature spring freeze driver and planting dates response in the three groups discussed previously when developing a causal loop chain between the drivers and response variables in group 1 the relationship between daily minimum temperature tmin last spring freeze and planning dates need to be known and clearly defined the relationship becomes repeatable perceivable and predictable when the definitions of frost day and last spring freeze are predictable e g tmin 0 c and the last day in spring with tmin 0 c respectively when changes in early spring and late fall can be estimated repeatedly e g using a linear trend and when there is a fixed relationship between the last spring freeze and planting dates in group 1 the causal loop developed senses the incoming data tmin categorizes these data last spring freeze dates and then responds in accordance with practice planting dates as kurtz and snowden 2003 state structured techniques are not only desirable but mandatory in this space in group 2 the cause and effect relationships between tmin last spring freeze and planting dates are not fully known or are known only to a few people the definition of a frost day now can vary in time and space if a plant variety that tolerates 0 c frost day is introduced in the future the definition of a frost day will have changed over time the definition of frost day tmin 0 c can vary in space if one compares a plant variety e g of wheat grown in a cold place e g kansas to a different variety of the same species e g different wheat variety grown in a warmer place e g india besides temperature the impact of freezing on plants can depend on other parameters e g soil moisture in addition there can be multiple ways to describe the cause and effect relationships doing so may require systems thinking approaches in which experiments expert opinion fact finding and scenario planning are appropriate kurtz and snowden 2003 the same holds true for the relationships between spring freeze planting dates etc relationships in group 2 may be known only by certain scientists who have performed experiments in a given region the causal chains loops developed in group 2 requires more expert knowledge more time and resources can move group 2 to the known domain the causal chain loop is developed by sensing the incoming data tmin analyzing the data freeze days and then responding in accordance with expert advice or interpretation of the analysis planting days in this group structured techniques are desirable but assumptions must be open to examination and challenge kurtz and snowden 2003 in group 3 the cause and effect relationships between tmin last spring freeze and planting dates are coherent only in retrospect do not repeat and have no perceptible relationships the relationships elude categorization or analytic techniques and may require enactment tools kurtz and snowden 2003 retrospectively emergent patterns in the relationships such as the warming hole in the southeastern usa may be perceived for a time due to the complexity of the climate buckley and moore driskell 2019 they may not be repeatable however because the underlying pattern sources are not observable and past stable patterns will be insufficient to recognize and act on these emergent patterns kurtz and snowden 2003 for example many factors can cause non uniform change high spatial and temporal variability in temperature and precipitation sparse long term high quality and high resolution measurements to detect trends and variability and the influence of multiple factors and phenomenon such as complex physical mechanisms atmosphere terrain interactions topography microclimates and teleconnection patterns kinlaw et al 2019 these changes result in unexpected in system behavior that cannot be attributed to any subset of its parts white 2007 3 4 icm and knowledge hierarchy in this study the knowledge hierarchy model is applied to reduce the usability gap fig 4 in the pyramid the data from observable environmental parameters temperature and precipitation lie at the bottom of the hierarchy the information is built from data interpretation by 1 analyzing changes in temperature and precipitation using meta analysis and data analysis and 2 estimating and analyzing spell indicators in the meta analysis published literature with changes in temperature and precipitation were identified from several articles and changes synthesized meta analysis in scenario funnels in data analysis the changes in temperature and precipitation were estimated form gcm simulations from the modeled temperature warm and cold spell indicators are estimated while from precipitation wet and dry spells are estimated from this information knowledge is built by 1 developing causal chain and loops to represent driver response interactions 2 developing adaptation strategies and 3 impacts of spells from meta analysis of published literature stakeholders experts utilizing this important difficult and uncertain knowledge and make judgements about the adaptation strategies to take wise decisions to utilize the benefits of change while reducing the negative impacts is wisdom 4 discussion 4 1 representing complexity several forms of defining characterizing and representing complexity in systems have been observed however this study used the theoretical framework that uses complex adaptive systems theory cas and the knowledge hierarchy model fig 1 this study partly addresses both complexity in systems which uses a variety of complexity theories such as emergent behavior non linearity and dynamics of complex systems and complexity of systems application that is stakeholder driven identification of characteristics geraldi et al 2011 concepts such as risk and uncertainty have been used to represent knowns and unknowns in the complexity framework challinor et al 2018 elements such as difficult cause and effect relationship characterization can be categorized as known unknowns while unknown unknowns would have no probability distribution functions harken et al 2019 uncertainty from unknown unknowns can also be due to ignored and or unexpected regime shifts elsawah et al 2020 key mechanisms may be uncertain or unknown and arbitrarily complex in ways that are difficult to model challinor et al 2018 in the cynefin framework the degree of expert knowledge opinions and judgements increase along the three categories of complexity known knowns known unknowns and unknown unknowns expert knowledge opinions and judgements can differ among experts in different groups scientists politicians public as well as within the same group depending on the modeling framework and assumptions a model based approach can provide precise projections of the future and its risks however it may have blind spots due to an inability to capture known unknowns challinor et al 2018 the levee paradox and adaptation effect are two examples of known unknowns di baldassarre et al 2016 the levee paradox is also known as land use management paradox levee effect and the safe development paradox they are unintended consequences of coupled interactions or feedbacks armstrong and lazarus 2019 for example regions with hazard protections encourage further development in places prone to hazard impacts an adaptation effect is attributed to spontaneous learning processes and responses when change is experienced di baldassarre et al 2016 for example flood damage is often lower when a flood event occurs soon after a previous one 4 2 icm and knowledge hierarchy the identified knowledge hierarchy components in fig 4 can be subjective to the context and complexity of the analysis methods data at the bottom of the knowledge hierarchy becomes information can be interpreted in different ways similarly doing something with information is knowledge and judgement of actions right or wrong is wisdom can also be viewed differently for example changes in temperature and precipitation from the literature considered information in this study can also be considered as data additionally even though indicators represent information in the hierarchy model they also can be considered as knowledge while representing complex concepts such as vulnerability e g vulnerability metrics and impacts e g impact indices likewise developing adaptation strategies that use this knowledge and impact information from meta analysis can be considered knowledge for stakeholders while developing causal chains loops for scientists to understand emergent properties e g unknowns can be considered wisdom also making judgements about the strategies and making wise decisions is wisdom 4 3 dimensions of complexity studies have described five dimensions of complexity structural complexity uncertainty dynamic changes in other dimensions pace temporal aspects and socio political complexity e g due to hidden agendas communication barriers breitschuh et al 2018 structural complexity the most common uncertainty dynamics and pace are the four dimensions of complexity described in icm in this study the change in temperature and precipitation and the frost and spell indicators are the elements these elements and their interdependence form the structural complexity dimension of icm the current and future time periods time scale of the changes and indicators represent the temporal aspects of icm pace dimension several forms of defining characterizing and representing uncertainty dimension have been observed uncertainty can be directly or indirectly related to randomness and probability di baldassarre et al 2016 uncertainty relates to both the current and future states of elements ecosystems indicators and climate elements that make up the system being managed adaptation mitigation strategies but also to what the impact of these states and interactions will be cross scale interactions and how they interact uncertainty can be defined in other ways such as or epistemic uncertainty ambiguity lack of information lack of agreement over current and future situations geraldi et al 2011 di baldassarre et al 2016 call epistemic uncertainty the seventh facet of uncertainty characterize it according to known unknowns unknown unknowns and wrong assumptions and then relate it to knightian uncertainty that which cannot be known yung et al 2019 referred to them as deep uncertainties because the description of uncertainty is challenging we do not even know which questions to ask nor is the definition of the likelihood magnitude and direction of these uncertainties fully known the dynamic dimension provides a high level system overview holism in system comprehension because it focuses on macro scale outcomes non linearities emergence cross scale interactions blair and buytaert 2016 the dynamic dimension is a mathematical re creation useful for understanding the system and its feedbacks to explain the past and understand predict the future and for exploring dynamic responses to changes within outside the system haraldsson 2004 juston et al 2012 believed that the future is bright for uncertainty for seven reasons we are learning about data and models we produce more reliable and robust predictions we learn about the value of additional data we can engender trust by recognizing and communicating uncertainties we deepen academic understanding and uncertainty estimation is getting easier 4 4 methods used to analyze complexity different complexity levels require different courses of action this knowledge can be gained through intellectual and deductive reasoning which can span the spectrum of empiricism and rationalism sturmberg and topolski 2014 blair and buytaert 2016 suggested modeling classifications and approaches to represent complexity they classified models into data based vs physics based vs conceptual based bottom up vs top down and distributed vs lumped methods to gain knowledge can be reason and logic mathematical proofs scientific methods trial and error applying algorithms experience intuition listening conversations arguments and observation without performing experiments sturmberg and topolski 2014 a number of methods to represent complexity are listed by blair and buytaert 2016 challinor et al 2018 and yung et al 2019 some of these methods include futures thinking such as data mining examining large data sets to identify trends the delphi method consulting expert panels backcasting one future is envisioned and then traced backwards to the present visioning imagining the ideal future and analogue space and time challinor et al 2018 yung et al 2019 for uncertainty related to chance and randomness probabilistic methods are valuable tools di baldassarre et al 2016 di baldassarre et al 2016 suggested that adaptive management techniques are an effective way to represent epistemic and knightian uncertainty but do not necessarily provide a solution to unknown unknowns two metrics for communicating the degree of certainty 1 qualitative confidence in the validity of a finding based on evidence e g mechanistic understanding theory data models and or expert judgment and the degree of agreement 2 quantitative measures of uncertainty in a finding using probabilistic methods e g statistical analysis of observations or model results expert judgment mastrandrea et al 2010 causal loop diagrams are useful to represent the dynamic dimension haraldsson 2004 numerical methods are used to solve dynamic problems using open loop e g optimization methods linear or nonlinear programming and closed loop methods e g dynamic programming policy search herman et al 2020 to model unknown unknowns rubin et al 2018 suggested two approaches probability theory using a set of prior distributions updating beliefs using bayes rule and decision theory maximizing expected utility and deriving decision rules from dempster shafer belief functions harken et al 2019 addressed unknown unknowns using the rdade risk based data acquisition design evaluation framework for decision making by communicating uncertainty and risk they suggested using multiple models rather than one to calculate statistics about the state of the system and decision making process bogdan 2019 suggested using dynamic space complex time varying interdependency dynamic models that are constructed between the processes and memory properties to model unknown unknowns weak and strong emergence behaviors have been modeled to explain unknown unknowns methods to identify emergent properties and to test the feasibility of emergent states can be found in sanders and smith 2012 and elsawah et al 2020 respectively 4 5 assumptions in the study the emphasis of this study was the demonstration of the icm framework using the theoretical framework that combined cas theory and the knowledge hierarchy model for conciseness and simplicity several simplifying assumptions were made selecting precipitation and temperature variables to represent climate having fewer indicators frost and wet dry spells influencing frost only by minimum temperature influencing wet dry spells by daily precipitation assuming equal likelihood of potential changes in climate scenarios selecting studies based on impacts and selecting fewer adaptation strategies when assumptions are used interactions and components sometimes become simplified and the distinction between known knowns known unknowns and unknown can become vague in such cases it is important to keep in mind h l mencken s aphorism for every complex problem there is an answer that is clear simple and wrong sturmberg and topolski 2014 5 conclusions the theoretical framework developed was applied using indicators to demonstrate the improvements in icm in icm a multidisciplinary perspective is used to incorporate a complex adaptive systems theory cas and the knowledge hierarchy model to decrease the usability gap by improving understanding and representation of complexity in ecosystems assessment of climate change impacts and development of adaptation and mitigation strategies while demonstrating the icm model for agroecosystems in the southeastern usa several assumptions were made to make the model concise and simple the assumptions can limit the applicability of the conclusions drawn regarding the usability of the developed adaptation strategies by multiple stakeholders however the assumptions made in the case study are for the general use of the framework future studies could use the icm framework to examine more closely the mathematical relationship between climate variables indicators prediction uncertainty and decision making in more realistic scenarios choosing multiple indicators with detailed information and measured data in each declaration of competing interest the authors

ecosystems assessment of climate change impacts and development of adaptation and mitigation strategies the icm is demonstrated by applying it to an agroecosystem in the southeastern united states as a case study it improves anandhi and bentley 2018 s framework by adding indicators theory complex adaptive systems theory a framework cynefin framework and a model knowledge hierarchy to the conceptualization since this study focused on demonstrating the framework several simplifying assumptions were made for conciseness and simplicity selecting precipitation and temperature variables to represent climate having fewer indicators frost and wet dry spells influencing frost only by minimum temperature influencing wet dry spells by daily precipitation assuming equal likelihood of potential changes in climate scenarios selecting studies based on impacts and selecting fewer adaptation strategies future studies could use the icm framework to examine more closely mathematical relationships among climate variables indicators prediction uncertainty and decision making in more realistic scenarios choosing multiple indicators with detailed information and measured data in each keywords scenario development causal chains complex adaptive systems theory cynefin framework knowledge hierarchy model adaptation and mitigation strategies ecosystem functioning 1 introduction the inherently multi disciplinary nature of real world systems physical natural social economic cultural and political result in collective behaviors that are difficult to understand and predict using tools from individual disciplines beveridge et al 2018 much has been written about the complexity of ecosystems environmental change e g climate change land use change vulnerability and adaption of ecosystems to these changes and mitigation of the changes this conceptual article continues this discussion into the nature of complexity in ecosystems and environmental change conceptualizations which are often an excellent point from which to understand a system can involve mental or physical images and may not be quantitative blair and buytaert 2016 therefore conceptual models are needed to collate visualize understand and explain the issues and problems relating to actual or predicted situations and how they might be solved patrício et al 2016 these models can be an important first step in developing a quantified model blair and buytaert 2016 when they are considered as organizational diagrams that bring together and summarize information in a standard logical and hierarchical way patrício et al 2016 anandhi and bentley 2018 developed a conceptual framework to reduce the usability gap i e between what scientists consider useful information and what users consider usable in decision making lemos et al 2012 by representing complexity using known knowns known unknowns and unknown unknowns rumsfeld 2002 new observations empirical studies and conceptual modeling increase knowledge and reduce uncertainties due to known unknowns and unknown unknowns di baldassarre et al 2016 in complex systems policy and decision making strategies are understood only partially but they can be improved as knowledge and understanding improves mercure et al 2019 the goal of this study was to reduce the usability gap further the specific objective was to develop an improved model that is eclectic it improves anandhi and bentley 2018 s original framework by adding indicators examination of the framework through the lens of a theory complex adaptive systems theory neely 2019 a framework cynefin framework breitschuh et al 2018 and a knowledge model to the conceptualization to distinguish them we refer to the original and improved frameworks as the original conceptual model ocm and improved conceptual model icm respectively with this study we hope to promote discussion and insight by researchers into the nature of complexity in ecosystems and environmental change in particular we hope to improve understanding and representation of complexity in ecosystems assessment of climate change impacts and development of adaptation and mitigation strategies and thus help reduce the usability gap this article presents the icm framework in general and then applies it to a case study to demonstrate the value of the framework 2 methodology improved conceptual model 2 1 theoretical framework the theoretical framework diagram fig 1 outlines the improvement in icm using indicators in icm we undertook a more structured multidisciplinary perspective by incorporating a complex adaptive systems theory cas and a knowledge hierarchy model to improve our understanding of known knowns and known unknowns and to decrease the unknown unknowns and the usability gap cas coined by buckley buckley 1968 is based on complexity theory in which a collective behavior and self organizing patterns emerges as a result of a large number of interactions among components within a system and among system components and its environment mcleod and childs 2013 a cas systems modifies and adapts its behavior to changes in its environment rammel et al 2007 the cas theory lens is useful for understanding various space time varying structures and processes in agroecosystems and climate because they share several cas characteristics listed below the cynefin framework is a tool that draws from cas theory and knowledge management to help stakeholders make sense of the data and to choose solutions mcleod and childs 2013 knowledge management is developed from economics and technology disciplines identifies and gathers content from various sources and is used to develop meaningful relationships french 2014 the cynefin framework perceives the complex process and has five domains namely simple complicated complex chaos and disorder van beurden et al 2013 the first two domains are ordered the next two are the un ordered domains and the last is disordered by distinguishing the known and potentially knowable simple complicated from less knowable complex chaos the framework provides unique insights and generate knowledges about the interactions between components sturmberg and topolski 2014 the cynefin framework helps determine a system s state and decide how to act breitschuh et al 2018 although in the cynefin framework the domains complex and complicated are distinguished it is important to be aware that they can be interchanged for example the oxford english dictionary defines complex as the state or quality of being intricate or complicated a factor involved in a complicated process or situation geraldi et al 2011 the knowledge hierarchy has been shown to decrease the usability gap for sustainable water management in agriculture le roux et al 2018 the knowledge hierarchy also referred to as the data information knowledge wisdom dikw hierarchy information hierarchy and the knowledge pyramid is one of the fundamental models in information systems and knowledge management rowley 2007 as frické 2019 state information systems generate store retrieve and process data in the knowledge hierarchy data represent observable properties provides information processed data statistically arithmetically information provides knowledge know how of a system and knowledge provides wisdom practicality and unknown in a situation frické 2019 data are the base of the hierarchy with wisdom at the pinnacle rowley 2007 the icm uses indicators to improve our understanding of known knowns and known unknowns while reducing the usability gap for the following reasons 1 indicators are powerful tools to communicate technical data from field experiments studies in relatively simple terms for developing adaptation strategies e g using the cista framework anandhi 2017 anandhi et al 2016b 2 they support representation of complex adaptive systems that expresses the combination of the system and its environment observed in natural systems this helps examine change and adaption in ecosystems as co evolution between the system and the environment rather separating them chan 2001 3 they portray inter relationships between climate environment and plant growth system anandhi 2016 this is connectivity a characteristic of cas in which the inter relationship inter action and inter connectivity between parts of the system and environment results in actions in one part influencing other linked parts in different ways chan 2001 4 they can reveal evidence of already discernible impacts of climate change and provide important insights into factors processes and structures anandhi et al 2018 this is emergent behavior another characteristic of cas systems in which new behavior emerge from connectivity chan 2001 5 they are valuable for monitoring trends in ecosystems schulterbrandt gragg et al 2018 this is in some way co evolution a third cas characteristic where the connectivity and behavior changes over time chan 2001 6 they are useful in impact studies for example for high temperatures that decrease crop yield anandhi and blocksome 2017 this can be an associated in which sensitive dependence on initial conditions a fourth characteristic of cas where small disturbances can produce exponentially divergent behavior with unpredictable consequences chan 2001 7 they are useful in vulnerability studies e g using the vista framework anandhi and kannan 2018 this can be an associated with distance from equilibrium a fifth characteristic of cas in which systems develop different relationships and structures to explore space of possibilities chan 2001 8 they are useful for applying the knowledge hierarchy model to represent cross scale interactions 2 2 icm framework to understand and represent complexity both the ocm fig 2 a and icm fig 2e use rumsfeld s 2002 three categories known knowns known unknowns and unknown unknowns to represent complexity in a system the main difference between ocm and icm is the use of indicators outlined in the theoretical framework diagram fig 1 using complex adaptive systems theory the cynefin framework and knowledge hierarchy model which we believe increase understanding of known knowns and known unknowns while decreasing unknown unknowns fig 2 we also attempted to elaborate upon these three categories to represent complexity and uncertainty chow and sarin 2002 the icm has six steps the first four focus on known knowns while the last two focus on known unknowns known knowns icm uses meta analysis and data analysis of drivers to represent known knowns uncertainty can be known i e probability is precisely known and specified simple problems lie in the realm of known knowns for example relatively uniform and replicable results can be expected in simple systems by following a formula and with little expertise snyder 2013 they lie in the obvious domain of the cynefin framework and use a straightforward process i e sense categorize respond to obtain good results kurtz and snowden 2003 step 1 drivers and target systems select the variables and spatial and temporal scales to represent the drivers and target system for a study region step 2 meta analysis anandhi and bentley 2018 from a literature review tabulate changes in driver variables for the region at the spatial and temporal scales using the research tool developed by baker and anandhi 2013 this step is the same in ocm and icm step 3 data analysis anandhi and bentley 2018 from measured observed modeled data tabulate changes in driver variables for the region at the spatial and temporal scales step 4 indicator estimation the indicators that represent the ecosystems and assessment of climate change impact are first selected they are then estimated from measured observed modeled data this step is unique to icm known unknowns known unknowns are complicated requires expertise and data analysis have cause and effect that are not obvious but needs to be gathered through analysis snyder 2013 known unknown uncertainty arises when the probability is not currently known but can be obtained by further research in complex systems successful i e replicable results are obtained by following a formula using higher order expertise and knowledge of a variety of fields which requires extensive involvement of experts breitschuh et al 2018 step 5 document variability the variability observed in the driver variables during the previous steps meta analysis data analysis and indicator estimation in a region is documented in the meta analysis spatial and temporal scales of the data can depend upon the case study selected step 6 assess the degree of uncertainty the degree of certainty in key findings from the meta analysis is based on the consistency of evidence and degree of agreement when a majority of studies show a change in a driver the middle half of the range is assigned as a low degree of uncertainty based on expert judgement and the rest of the range upper and lower quartiles are assigned a high degree of uncertainty in the data analysis the interquartile range is assigned a low degree of uncertainty and the rest of the data is assigned a high degree of uncertainty more information on how these uncertainties are addressed can be found in mastrandrea et al 2010 unknown unknowns complex problems lie in the realm of unknown unknowns a space in constant flux and are prone to significant change unpredictability of system behavior lack stability have no right answers and have only emergent behaviors breitschuh et al 2018 snyder 2013 unknowable unknown uncertainty represents a reasonable degree of uncertainty whose probability is unknown we used scenarios in this study because they focus explicitly on a range of plausible futures enable deep uncertainty uncertainty is challenging to described to be included in analyses and are useful for policy making challinor et al 2018 yung et al 2019 2 3 scenario funnel both ocm and icm use the concept of scenario funnels fig 2b f unlike the scenario funnels in ocm which document variability alone those in icm document variability and assess the degree of uncertainty steps 5 and 6 the funnels are drawn from expert judgement and thus are not usually probabilistic or quantitative but they can be arbitrarily complex in ways that are difficult to model e g when key mechanisms are uncertain or unknown challinor et al 2018 in the funnel plots for scenarios the x axis represents time e g years seasons and the y axis represents the driver and indicator variables the y axis can represent changes in the variable e g in ocm and or the value of the variable e g in icm they can be obtained from the meta analysis and data analysis the width of the funnel mouth represents the difference among various predictions from the studies meta analysis and indicator estimates data analysis and indicators broader mouths indicate more variability in the results the number of scenario funnels developed depends on the funnel width level of detail required available resources and spatial and temporal scales of the study more details on the method for developing the funnel plots can be found in anandhi and bentley 2018 and anandhi et al 2018 funnel plots form the basis for selecting variables and parameter values that allow pathways or projections of the future to be modeled that are mathematically consistent the scenarios used by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc are based on emissions trajectories special report on emissions scenarios representative concentration pathways rcps and narratives shared socioeconomic pathways challinor et al 2018 in this study rcp based scenarios were used 2 4 cross scale interactions the complex task of describing the causal chain between the driving forces impacts and response is broken down into subtasks kristensen 2004 these subtasks explain the cause and effect behavior from the standpoint of systems e g agroecosystems to assess impacts of drivers e g climate change and responses of target systems e g ecosystems in this study we attempt to break down the causal chain by using cross scale interactions csi in fig 2 the conceptualization framework for the csi in both ocm and icm are similar in that both have layers for drivers with multiple scales spatial temporal and response variables as well as three levels of scenario complexity fig 2c g fig 3 they differ in that icm contains the cynefin framework and indicators to classify the interactions into three groups group 1 no csi known interactions group 2 csi between drivers knowable interactions group 3 csi due to feedback between drivers and response variables complex interactions in ocm the drivers are variables such as changes in precipitation and temperature from the meta analysis and data analysis in icm the drivers are ocm variables and indicator variables these csi are used to develop causal chains loops of varying complexity applying the cynefin framework results in three ontological states i e relations between concepts and categories in a domain order complexity and chaos each with an epistemological option i e relating to theory of knowledge kurtz and snowden 2003 the framework is related to these three groups group 1 represents known cause and effects group 2 represents the knowable and group 3 represents the complex a causal chain is an ordered sequence of events in which any one event in the chain causes the next schulterbrandt gragg et al 2018 when an event in the chain causes an earlier event in the chain the chain becomes a causal loop spatial scales can vary from a point to a region while temporal scales can range from sub daily to centennial group 1 scenarios are causal chains with the least complexity and unidirectional interactions between driver and response variables fig 2c g green arrows in column 1 most complex scenarios in group 3 that have driver variables interact across scales and have feedback from the response variables two way blue arrows between driver and response variables in column 3 group 2 scenarios have intermediate complexity when the driver variables at different scales influence the response variables fig 2c g one way purple arrows between driver and response variables in column 2 these interactions can be documented and useful to stakeholders this approach is iterative 3 applying the icm we applied icm to the southeastern united states usa as a case study since steps 1 3 are the same for ocm and icm their results are summarized more detailed information about these steps can be found in anandhi and bentley 2018 3 1 representing complexity known knowns and known unknowns step 1 drivers and target systems changes in precipitation and temperature were selected as driver variables an agroecosystem with plant climate and land use water use interactions was selected as the target system like for ocm the study region was the southeastern usa i e alabama florida georgia mississippi north carolina south carolina and tennessee the scale of analysis which can vary among steps was documented step 2 meta analysis from a literature review 33 values of change in precipitation from 15 studies and 35 values of change in temperature from 14 studies were documented at seasonal and annual time scales for the southeastern usa step 3 data analysis the ipcc global climate model gcm simulated a modeled time series of precipitation and temperature for the southeastern usa using data on a 1 1 grid spatial scale at a monthly time step temporal scale this study used gcms for a multi model gcm simulation of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 in them changes in annual precipitation and temperature between historical time periods 1950 2005 and future time periods 2006 2100 are estimated from 19 gcm simulations for two scenarios of future rcp rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for the southeastern usa step 4 indicator estimation four frost and 10 wet dry spell indicators were selected to represent the agroecosystems and assessments of climate change impact the indicators were estimated from daily simulations of precipitation and temperature from gcms for the southeastern usa frost and wet dry spells for the study region were defined following anandhi et al 2016a and anandhi et al 2013 step 5 document variability in general from the meta analysis step 2 the changes in precipitation ranged from 30 to 35 and the changes in temperature ranged from 2 c to 6 c by 2099 from the data analysis step 3 the median of the 19 gcms predicted no change in precipitation and an increase in temperature of 2 5 c in the region by 2099 among the 19 gcms the variability 5th and 95th percentiles of the change in precipitation ranged from 40 to 110 while those of the change in temperature ranged from 2 c to 6 c by 2099 among the 19 gcms the variability in the frost indicators step 4 for the number of frost days last spring freeze first fall freeze and growing season duration ranged from 0 to 190 days day of year doy 0 90 doy 275 365 and 150 365 days respectively during the 1950 2099 period for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 among the gcms the variability in the wet spell indicators step 4 for the number of wet spells maximum wet spell duration mean wet spell duration and number of wet days were 35 70 0 200 days 2 9 days and 365 days respectively similarly the variability in the dry spell indicators step 4 for the number of dry spells maximum dry spell duration mean dry spell duration and number of dry days were 35 90 0 80 days 2 9 days and 110 250 days respectively step 6 document uncertainty uncertainty was represented using scenario funnel plots and listed using cross scale interactions 3 2 scenario funnel plots the scenario funnel plots depicted the degree of uncertainty in the drivers climate variables fig 3 the degree of uncertainty in the meta analysis and data analysis varied in the meta analysis the studies used multiple data sources e g measurements gridded data model simulations combinations thereof with varied density in measurements simulation e g scattered individual locations uniform grids varied time steps of model output e g sub daily daily monthly and varied measuring instruments mathematical models in the data analysis of climate and indicator drivers the uncertainty was due to the 19 models and two rcp scenarios considered in the study the indicators had additional uncertainty due to variability in their definitions calculating climate indicators allows decision makers to break down larger variables i e temperature or precipitation to quantify changes that they deem important and further narrow the cone of possible futures while acknowledging that one cannot predict the future nor the unknown unknowns scenario funnels can be used in future thinking to help develop scenarios that provide insight into implications of current choices on future trajectories in the context of impacts as well as developing adaptation and mitigation strategies the scenario funnel provides a range of futures that can be selected qualitatively and or quantitatively from the range from high to low degrees of uncertainty the scenarios selected can be used to reflect on current dynamics of systems with varying degrees of complexity assumptions and relationships known knowable and unknown that govern the historical and potential drivers of future change by engaging with a range of possible outcomes one can prepare for and embrace uncertainty 3 3 cross scale interactions several causal chains loops can be developed using the climate variables indicators drivers and adaptation strategies responses used in this study fig 2c g here we discuss the causal chains loop developed in the context of icm among temperature spring freeze driver and planting dates response in the three groups discussed previously when developing a causal loop chain between the drivers and response variables in group 1 the relationship between daily minimum temperature tmin last spring freeze and planning dates need to be known and clearly defined the relationship becomes repeatable perceivable and predictable when the definitions of frost day and last spring freeze are predictable e g tmin 0 c and the last day in spring with tmin 0 c respectively when changes in early spring and late fall can be estimated repeatedly e g using a linear trend and when there is a fixed relationship between the last spring freeze and planting dates in group 1 the causal loop developed senses the incoming data tmin categorizes these data last spring freeze dates and then responds in accordance with practice planting dates as kurtz and snowden 2003 state structured techniques are not only desirable but mandatory in this space in group 2 the cause and effect relationships between tmin last spring freeze and planting dates are not fully known or are known only to a few people the definition of a frost day now can vary in time and space if a plant variety that tolerates 0 c frost day is introduced in the future the definition of a frost day will have changed over time the definition of frost day tmin 0 c can vary in space if one compares a plant variety e g of wheat grown in a cold place e g kansas to a different variety of the same species e g different wheat variety grown in a warmer place e g india besides temperature the impact of freezing on plants can depend on other parameters e g soil moisture in addition there can be multiple ways to describe the cause and effect relationships doing so may require systems thinking approaches in which experiments expert opinion fact finding and scenario planning are appropriate kurtz and snowden 2003 the same holds true for the relationships between spring freeze planting dates etc relationships in group 2 may be known only by certain scientists who have performed experiments in a given region the causal chains loops developed in group 2 requires more expert knowledge more time and resources can move group 2 to the known domain the causal chain loop is developed by sensing the incoming data tmin analyzing the data freeze days and then responding in accordance with expert advice or interpretation of the analysis planting days in this group structured techniques are desirable but assumptions must be open to examination and challenge kurtz and snowden 2003 in group 3 the cause and effect relationships between tmin last spring freeze and planting dates are coherent only in retrospect do not repeat and have no perceptible relationships the relationships elude categorization or analytic techniques and may require enactment tools kurtz and snowden 2003 retrospectively emergent patterns in the relationships such as the warming hole in the southeastern usa may be perceived for a time due to the complexity of the climate buckley and moore driskell 2019 they may not be repeatable however because the underlying pattern sources are not observable and past stable patterns will be insufficient to recognize and act on these emergent patterns kurtz and snowden 2003 for example many factors can cause non uniform change high spatial and temporal variability in temperature and precipitation sparse long term high quality and high resolution measurements to detect trends and variability and the influence of multiple factors and phenomenon such as complex physical mechanisms atmosphere terrain interactions topography microclimates and teleconnection patterns kinlaw et al 2019 these changes result in unexpected in system behavior that cannot be attributed to any subset of its parts white 2007 3 4 icm and knowledge hierarchy in this study the knowledge hierarchy model is applied to reduce the usability gap fig 4 in the pyramid the data from observable environmental parameters temperature and precipitation lie at the bottom of the hierarchy the information is built from data interpretation by 1 analyzing changes in temperature and precipitation using meta analysis and data analysis and 2 estimating and analyzing spell indicators in the meta analysis published literature with changes in temperature and precipitation were identified from several articles and changes synthesized meta analysis in scenario funnels in data analysis the changes in temperature and precipitation were estimated form gcm simulations from the modeled temperature warm and cold spell indicators are estimated while from precipitation wet and dry spells are estimated from this information knowledge is built by 1 developing causal chain and loops to represent driver response interactions 2 developing adaptation strategies and 3 impacts of spells from meta analysis of published literature stakeholders experts utilizing this important difficult and uncertain knowledge and make judgements about the adaptation strategies to take wise decisions to utilize the benefits of change while reducing the negative impacts is wisdom 4 discussion 4 1 representing complexity several forms of defining characterizing and representing complexity in systems have been observed however this study used the theoretical framework that uses complex adaptive systems theory cas and the knowledge hierarchy model fig 1 this study partly addresses both complexity in systems which uses a variety of complexity theories such as emergent behavior non linearity and dynamics of complex systems and complexity of systems application that is stakeholder driven identification of characteristics geraldi et al 2011 concepts such as risk and uncertainty have been used to represent knowns and unknowns in the complexity framework challinor et al 2018 elements such as difficult cause and effect relationship characterization can be categorized as known unknowns while unknown unknowns would have no probability distribution functions harken et al 2019 uncertainty from unknown unknowns can also be due to ignored and or unexpected regime shifts elsawah et al 2020 key mechanisms may be uncertain or unknown and arbitrarily complex in ways that are difficult to model challinor et al 2018 in the cynefin framework the degree of expert knowledge opinions and judgements increase along the three categories of complexity known knowns known unknowns and unknown unknowns expert knowledge opinions and judgements can differ among experts in different groups scientists politicians public as well as within the same group depending on the modeling framework and assumptions a model based approach can provide precise projections of the future and its risks however it may have blind spots due to an inability to capture known unknowns challinor et al 2018 the levee paradox and adaptation effect are two examples of known unknowns di baldassarre et al 2016 the levee paradox is also known as land use management paradox levee effect and the safe development paradox they are unintended consequences of coupled interactions or feedbacks armstrong and lazarus 2019 for example regions with hazard protections encourage further development in places prone to hazard impacts an adaptation effect is attributed to spontaneous learning processes and responses when change is experienced di baldassarre et al 2016 for example flood damage is often lower when a flood event occurs soon after a previous one 4 2 icm and knowledge hierarchy the identified knowledge hierarchy components in fig 4 can be subjective to the context and complexity of the analysis methods data at the bottom of the knowledge hierarchy becomes information can be interpreted in different ways similarly doing something with information is knowledge and judgement of actions right or wrong is wisdom can also be viewed differently for example changes in temperature and precipitation from the literature considered information in this study can also be considered as data additionally even though indicators represent information in the hierarchy model they also can be considered as knowledge while representing complex concepts such as vulnerability e g vulnerability metrics and impacts e g impact indices likewise developing adaptation strategies that use this knowledge and impact information from meta analysis can be considered knowledge for stakeholders while developing causal chains loops for scientists to understand emergent properties e g unknowns can be considered wisdom also making judgements about the strategies and making wise decisions is wisdom 4 3 dimensions of complexity studies have described five dimensions of complexity structural complexity uncertainty dynamic changes in other dimensions pace temporal aspects and socio political complexity e g due to hidden agendas communication barriers breitschuh et al 2018 structural complexity the most common uncertainty dynamics and pace are the four dimensions of complexity described in icm in this study the change in temperature and precipitation and the frost and spell indicators are the elements these elements and their interdependence form the structural complexity dimension of icm the current and future time periods time scale of the changes and indicators represent the temporal aspects of icm pace dimension several forms of defining characterizing and representing uncertainty dimension have been observed uncertainty can be directly or indirectly related to randomness and probability di baldassarre et al 2016 uncertainty relates to both the current and future states of elements ecosystems indicators and climate elements that make up the system being managed adaptation mitigation strategies but also to what the impact of these states and interactions will be cross scale interactions and how they interact uncertainty can be defined in other ways such as or epistemic uncertainty ambiguity lack of information lack of agreement over current and future situations geraldi et al 2011 di baldassarre et al 2016 call epistemic uncertainty the seventh facet of uncertainty characterize it according to known unknowns unknown unknowns and wrong assumptions and then relate it to knightian uncertainty that which cannot be known yung et al 2019 referred to them as deep uncertainties because the description of uncertainty is challenging we do not even know which questions to ask nor is the definition of the likelihood magnitude and direction of these uncertainties fully known the dynamic dimension provides a high level system overview holism in system comprehension because it focuses on macro scale outcomes non linearities emergence cross scale interactions blair and buytaert 2016 the dynamic dimension is a mathematical re creation useful for understanding the system and its feedbacks to explain the past and understand predict the future and for exploring dynamic responses to changes within outside the system haraldsson 2004 juston et al 2012 believed that the future is bright for uncertainty for seven reasons we are learning about data and models we produce more reliable and robust predictions we learn about the value of additional data we can engender trust by recognizing and communicating uncertainties we deepen academic understanding and uncertainty estimation is getting easier 4 4 methods used to analyze complexity different complexity levels require different courses of action this knowledge can be gained through intellectual and deductive reasoning which can span the spectrum of empiricism and rationalism sturmberg and topolski 2014 blair and buytaert 2016 suggested modeling classifications and approaches to represent complexity they classified models into data based vs physics based vs conceptual based bottom up vs top down and distributed vs lumped methods to gain knowledge can be reason and logic mathematical proofs scientific methods trial and error applying algorithms experience intuition listening conversations arguments and observation without performing experiments sturmberg and topolski 2014 a number of methods to represent complexity are listed by blair and buytaert 2016 challinor et al 2018 and yung et al 2019 some of these methods include futures thinking such as data mining examining large data sets to identify trends the delphi method consulting expert panels backcasting one future is envisioned and then traced backwards to the present visioning imagining the ideal future and analogue space and time challinor et al 2018 yung et al 2019 for uncertainty related to chance and randomness probabilistic methods are valuable tools di baldassarre et al 2016 di baldassarre et al 2016 suggested that adaptive management techniques are an effective way to represent epistemic and knightian uncertainty but do not necessarily provide a solution to unknown unknowns two metrics for communicating the degree of certainty 1 qualitative confidence in the validity of a finding based on evidence e g mechanistic understanding theory data models and or expert judgment and the degree of agreement 2 quantitative measures of uncertainty in a finding using probabilistic methods e g statistical analysis of observations or model results expert judgment mastrandrea et al 2010 causal loop diagrams are useful to represent the dynamic dimension haraldsson 2004 numerical methods are used to solve dynamic problems using open loop e g optimization methods linear or nonlinear programming and closed loop methods e g dynamic programming policy search herman et al 2020 to model unknown unknowns rubin et al 2018 suggested two approaches probability theory using a set of prior distributions updating beliefs using bayes rule and decision theory maximizing expected utility and deriving decision rules from dempster shafer belief functions harken et al 2019 addressed unknown unknowns using the rdade risk based data acquisition design evaluation framework for decision making by communicating uncertainty and risk they suggested using multiple models rather than one to calculate statistics about the state of the system and decision making process bogdan 2019 suggested using dynamic space complex time varying interdependency dynamic models that are constructed between the processes and memory properties to model unknown unknowns weak and strong emergence behaviors have been modeled to explain unknown unknowns methods to identify emergent properties and to test the feasibility of emergent states can be found in sanders and smith 2012 and elsawah et al 2020 respectively 4 5 assumptions in the study the emphasis of this study was the demonstration of the icm framework using the theoretical framework that combined cas theory and the knowledge hierarchy model for conciseness and simplicity several simplifying assumptions were made selecting precipitation and temperature variables to represent climate having fewer indicators frost and wet dry spells influencing frost only by minimum temperature influencing wet dry spells by daily precipitation assuming equal likelihood of potential changes in climate scenarios selecting studies based on impacts and selecting fewer adaptation strategies when assumptions are used interactions and components sometimes become simplified and the distinction between known knowns known unknowns and unknown can become vague in such cases it is important to keep in mind h l mencken s aphorism for every complex problem there is an answer that is clear simple and wrong sturmberg and topolski 2014 5 conclusions the theoretical framework developed was applied using indicators to demonstrate the improvements in icm in icm a multidisciplinary perspective is used to incorporate a complex adaptive systems theory cas and the knowledge hierarchy model to decrease the usability gap by improving understanding and representation of complexity in ecosystems assessment of climate change impacts and development of adaptation and mitigation strategies while demonstrating the icm model for agroecosystems in the southeastern usa several assumptions were made to make the model concise and simple the assumptions can limit the applicability of the conclusions drawn regarding the usability of the developed adaptation strategies by multiple stakeholders however the assumptions made in the case study are for the general use of the framework future studies could use the icm framework to examine more closely the mathematical relationship between climate variables indicators prediction uncertainty and decision making in more realistic scenarios choosing multiple indicators with detailed information and measured data in each declaration of competing interest the authors

in these works the life cycle of the organism is divided into distinct stages with specific feeding properties here we generalize this approach by not only allowing feeding to depend on discrete stages but also to change continuously over the course of development within a stage our study system is a developing tadpole which gradually ceases feeding towards the end of its metamorphosis a process that accompanies a range of changes to the organisms body absorption of the gills change of body shape i e loss of the tail and adaptation of the mouth and digestion system to eventually switch from a omnivorous to a carnivorous diet we set out to describe two versions of the model variants on standard deb and debkiss and parameterize them with empirical data on developing tadpoles of

paper is structured as follows in section 2 we describe how the empirical data was collected in the lab in section 3 we present the deb model variants in section 4 we explain how we estimated the parameters using empirical data finally in section 5 we discuss the results consider possible shortcomings of our models and give an outlook on future deb developments for organisms that undergo major physiological changes through ontogeny 2 data collection field collection we collected clutches of pseudacris regilla eggs from atascadero creek in santa barbara california in may of 2017 dd coordinates 34 433604 119 780062 we housed egg clutches in separate 4 oz glad containers with four holes poked through the sides thirteen to seventeen of these containers were placed in a large bin where water could move through the smaller containers we placed air bubblers throughout each large bin and housed one to two bins in each of three percival incubators at 15 c after hatching and muscle development tadpoles were moved to one of five large aquaria tanks animal husbandry we individually housed all tadpoles in plastic 9 7 x 6 6 x 4 inch ziploc containers with 1 l of water at 21 23 c tadpole water consisted of 50 50 mixture of sparkletts bottled water and di water treated with kents liquid r o right a total of 66 individuals was used for this study the tadpoles were euthanized at different time points because they were principally used for another experiment the experiment was ended after one month around the time when the remaining tadpoles reached metamorphosis at the beginning of the experiment on every feeding day and on the days on which the tadpoles were euthanized we determined tadpole snout to vent length by measuring the distance from the tip the snout to the vent using an ocular micrometer the snout to vent length does not include the tail and therefore can be used as a proxy for the size of the tadpole even when the tail shrinks towards the end of the metamorphosis at the time points at which length was measured we also assessed the developmental state through the gosner stage system by examining morphological traits gosner 1960 we did not change water throughout the experiment or use air bubblers to oxygenate the water because of the large amount of water relative to tadpole size in each container feeding rates we prepared food for the tapoles from a mixture consisting of 100 ml of water 5 g of spirulina 5 g of tetramin and 2 g of agar we dried this mixture and cut pellets from sheets of this gelatin mixture using a standardized pellet cutter the wet weight of a pellet was 550 10 mg mean sd and the dry weight was 70 4 mg the tadpoles were fed either one or two pellets at intervals of three to eight days when we added new pellets to tadpole tanks we removed all previous solid pellet remains and we did not change the water in the tanks we observed that pellets left alone in tanks dissolved over time but that the water did not become turbid when a tadpole was present suggesting that the tadpoles consumed suspended particles in the water to estimate the feeding rates we dried the remaining pellets in a drying oven for at least 24 hrs on a low heat when pellets no longer contained moisture we weighted them on an analytical scale to the closest 1 mg we calculated the feeding rates mg day by subtracting the weight of the dried pellets from the product of the number of pellets fed and the mean dry weight of a new pellet and dividing this quantity by the number of days between the feeding events we then converted this to j day by using the energy densities of the ingredients tetramin has an energy density of 14 0 j mg prevedelli and vandini 1998 dry agar has an energy density of about 1 3 j mg and dry spirulina of about 1 2 j mg https fdc nal usda gov using the proportions from the recipe we find that the food pellets have an energy density of 6 5 j mg respirometry we set up respirometry chambers by modifying 1 pint mason jars 473 ml we cut out a circular hole on the lid and inserted the top of a 50 ml falcon tube sealed with aquaria sealant this small opening created an air tight seal while allowing easy access to the contents inside the chamber to insert the oxygen probe we also divided the mason jar using a circular cut out plastic mesh with two zip ties to avoid harming the tadpole while measurements were recorded we filled each mason jar with treated water that had been sitting with a bubbler for at least 30 minutes prior to the respirometry procedure to ensure the water was saturated with oxygen we filled the mason jars entirely with treated water and recorded an initial oxygen concentration using a ysi multilab 4010 and ysi proobod optical bod probe the tadpole and mesh were then quickly added to the mason jar and the modified falcon tube cap on the jar lids was screwed on to create an air tight seal after 90 minutes the falcon tube cap was removed and the oxygen probe was inserted to record the final oxygen concentration we sterilized the ysi proobod optical bod probe in between recordings of treatment groups by dipping in into a bleach solution followed by a rinse with di water and drying with a kim wipe four control jars containing only treated water were used to ensure that seals were airtight the controls showed no decrease of oxygen in the absence of tadpoles we excluded significant respiration by microrganisms because respiration of tadpoles was measured in fresh water respirometry recordings were performed one day prior to euthanasia no individual was sampled twice the change of the o 2 concentration in the respirometry chamber was used to calculated the individuals oxygen consumption rate o 2 mg day laboratory temperature was maintained at 20 23 c and water temperature was recorded before and after respirometry procedure we also recorded temperature of the water in the jars which remained constant between 20 22 c it is important that water temperature is constant throughout the trial because it would affect the dissolved oxygen concentration in the water 3 models we describe two versions of the model a standard deb model with reserves kooijman 2010 and a debkiss model jager et al 2013 which assumes that assimilates are used directly fig 2 gives an overview of the general structure of the models table 1 lists the state variables of the models and the derived auxiliary variables used to relate the models to the data the ingestion rate is p x a fraction κx of this food is assimilated so that the assimilation rate is 1 p a κ x p x we start with the standard deb assumption for isomorphic organisms that food uptake is proportional to the individuals surface 2 p x p x l 2 where l is the volumetric length l v 1 3 we generally adopt the formulation that square brackets indicate quantities per volume v and curly brackets indicate quantities per volumetric surface area l 2 we also adopt the notation that a dot above a quantity indicates a rate measured per time to account for changing feeding rates through development we depart from the standard assumption that p x depends only on the resource level and let it instead depend on the tadpoles maturation state we assume p x is fixed at a given developmental stage because animals were fed ad libidum in principle however resource dependence can be added to the model in the standard way by setting 3 p x f p x m where f is the resource dependent functional response and with values between 0 and 1 and p x m is the maximum area specific assimilation rate maturation of the organism is tracked by an additional state variable g we assume that maturation in terms of gosner stages gosner 1960 progresses at a constant rate s until the final stage 46 is reached 4 d d t g s g 46 0 afterwards we do not explicitly model the energy used for maturation reproduction we instead assume that maturation costs are included in the somatic maintenance term in standard deb formulation this would correspond to the case that all energy used goes to growth and somatic maintenance κ 1 with the addition of an independently progressing maturation variable we decided to simplify the model in this fashion because with our data it seems impossible to distinguish between metabolic work for maturation and metabolic work for somatic maintenance as in the standard deb model we assume that somatic maintenance costs p s are proportional to the volume of the organism 5 p s p s v where p s is the volume specific maintenance rate we assume there is no separate term for the maintenance of maturity in the standard deb model this term would be proportional to the total energy spent for maturation we also assume that the energy reserves in the full deb model do not require metabolic work to be maintained the volume of the organism is assumed to grow according to 6 d v d t r v the growth rate r will depend on the model we choose 3 1 model with reserves deb this model version is close to the canonical deb model described in kooijman 2010 assimilated energy is first saved in energy reserves e from where it is then drawn to fuel the various processes in the organism such as growth and maintenance as explained in kooijman 2010 1 1 equation 2 10 with κ 1 reserve energy density e per structural volume of the organism changes according to 7 d d t e p a e v l where p a is the energy assimilation per square volumetric length l 2 and v is the energy conductance determining how fast reserves are mobilized referring to kooijman 2010 2 2 equation 2 13 the growth rate of the organism is 8 r e v l p s e e g this equation holds for non starving organisms which mobilize more energy than needed for maintenance e v l p s deb theory leaves the rules for starving organisms open several possibilities are described in kooijman 2010 for our application we assume that structural biomass is formed with an efficiency of y between 0 and 1 and that in times of starvation structure can be again metabolized to cover maintenance costs assuming that all the energy of metabolized structure can be used for maintenance we find that for starving organisms e v l p s the negative growth rate is 9 r 1 y e v l p s e e g note that y does not appear in the growth equation for non starving organisms because the parameter eg captures all volume specific costs for building new structure including the overhead on growth which adds to respiration 3 2 model without reserves debkiss the deb model can be simplified to a debkiss model by assuming that energy turnover is fast v jager et al 2013 with this simplification reserves vanish e 0 and assimilated energy is used directly to fuel growth and maintenance because v e p a plugging this into the growth equation growth is then simply given by the energy left after paying maintenance costs so that given the per volume costs of structure eg the growth rate of the organism is 10 r p a l p s e g where p a is the energy assimilation per square volumetric length l 2 and p s is the volume specific maintenance rate this equation describes growth as long as the organism takes up enough energy to cover the maintenance costs p a l p s if assimilation is lower the organism starves analogously to eq 9 in the deb model it reverts structure to cover maintenance costs and the negative growth rate is 11 r 1 y p a l p s e g 3 3 respiration to relate the models to the respiration measures we formulate respiration r we assume that all assimilated carbon used for maintenance and for overhead costs on growth is respired in this process o2 is transformed to co2 with ηr being mg oxygen used per j energy this leads for non starving organisms with d v d t 0 to the rate of o2 consumption 12 r η r p s v 1 y e g d v d t and for starving organisms to 13 r η r p s v 4 parameter estimations and data fitting here we estimate the various parameters for the two model variants some of the parameters are estimated from different sources and some are fitted to the data of our experiment table 2 summarizes the estimates we used wolfram mathematica version 12 0 to estimate the model parameters 4 1 maximum likelihood function the parameters p s κx and y both models and additionally v for the full deb model are fitted using a maximum likelihood approach the procedure is described in jager and ashauer 2018 we denote the times when length was measured with t l i and the times when respiration was measured with t r j to speed up the fitting procedure we use the mean values over individuals at each time point we denote the mean length data points with t l i l i and the respiration data points with t r j r j the corresponding model predictions are l t l i and r t r i now the likelihood function l is 14 l l l l r with l l i f l t l i σ l l i l r j f r t r j σ r r j where f μ σ x is the probability density function of the normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ at the value x 15 f μ σ x 1 2 π σ exp 1 2 μ x σ 2 the likelihood is maximized with respect to the parameters p s κx y and for the full deb model additionally v and the standard deviations σl and σr to obtain likelihood profiles for the parameters we find the maximum likelihood l 0 with all parameters fitted and compare it to the maximum likelihood l 1 with a focal parameter fixed to a range of values while the other parameters are fitted again we then find the 95 confidence intervals for the parameter by using wilks theorem jager and ashauer 2018 according to this theorem the test statistic 16 d 2 log l 1 l 0 is approximately χ 2 distributed with one degree of freedom the 95 confidence interval is thus given by all parameter values for which d is lower than the p 95 quantile of the χ 2 distribution 4 2 volumetric length to snout to vent length δ m we assume that the volumetric length l v 1 3 is proportional to the snout to vent length lw such that 17 l δ m l w to estimate the parameter δm we use measures on snout to vent length and wet weight of tadpoles shown in fig 3 we assume that 1 mg wet weight corresponds to 1 mm3 volume because their volume is mostly filled with water and they are neutrally buoyant finally we fit the parameter minimizing the square error of the equation 18 v l 3 δ m l w 3 and find δ m 0 53 mm mm 4 3 cost per structure eg dried tadpoles of a similar species reportedly have an energy content of about 23 j mg turnipseed and altig 1975 to find the energy content per volume we combine this with data on dry weight per volume from pieter johnson shown in fig 3 using linear regression we find the density of dry weight to volume of 0 04 mg mm3 assuming again that wet tadpoles have a density similar to water this leads to an energy density of δ e 0 9 j mm3 we use this energy density and the growth efficiency y which is fitted to the growth trajectories together with the other free parameters after fixing all other parameters to estimate the energetic costs for producing structure 4 3 1 debkiss for the debkiss model all mass is assumed to be structural mass i e reserves are lumped together with structure using the growth efficiency y we calculate the energetic cost per structure 19 e g δ e y 4 3 2 deb for this model we need to distinguish between structural weight and reserve weight absent information we could use to estimate the ratio of structure to reserves we assume that ρ 0 5 of the dry weight in the data is structural weight and the rest is reserves thus only a fraction ρ of the weighted body mass counts towards structural cost and we find 20 e g ρ δ e y this estimation is close to that of grably and piery 1981 who measured the effect of starvation on adult frogs of another species taking into account the differences they found for wet weight and water content their experiment suggests that starved frogs have a 60 lower dry weight than non starved frogs of the same length 4 4 oxygen used per assimilate ηr to find the constant ηr for how much oxygen in mg is used to metabolize assimilates in j we assume that assimilates are comparable to glucose using the caloric value of glucose linstrom and mallard 2014 we find that one j of assimilates corresponds to 0 06 mg glucose from the chemical equation for the oxidation of glucose and the molar weights of the reactants we find that 1 mg glucose is combusted with 1 1 mg oxygen this leads to 21 η r 0 06 mgglucose j 1 1 mgo 2 mgglucose 0 07 mgo 2 j to check the sensitivity of the assumption on the composition of assimilates we imagined an extreme scenario where the assimilate was entirely composed of lipids re estimated the parameter ηr and repeated the fitting the fitted curves were close to indistinguishable but the estimated values of some parameters notably κx and y were different not shown 4 5 the stage dependent feeding rate p x we estimated the stage dependent ingestion rates j day from the amount of food consumed between feeding events for each gosner stage between 28 and 46 we used the data from individual feeding periods where the individual was in this gosner stage at the beginning the end or between the feeding events including the last event where only the remaining food was weighted but no food was added we then calculated the mean snout to vent length lw during the feeding periods from the measurements at the beginning and the end of the period converted this to volumetric length l and fitted a curve for the feeding rate 22 p x p x l 2 for each gosner stage as shown in fig 4 the average maturation between feeding event is 3 0 gosner stages so the estimated feeding rates are smoothed across this range because we have only a few data points on the final stages and smoothed over stage 43 46 we assume that the animals entirely stop feeding when turning into a froglet at stage 46 and interpolate the feeding rates between stage 43 to 46 afterwards the froglets would start eating again i e their diet consisting predominantly of insects but our experiment did not continue into this life stage the surface area specific feeding rates p x at the different gosner stages are shown in fig 5 4 6 the parameter s the maturation speed s is fitted to the experimental data shown in fig 6 we choose all individuals for whom the final measure was at least one week after the start of the experiment thereby focusing on individuals that arrive to higher stages when feeding is reduced for each of these individuals we calculate how many stages were passed per day on average we then calculate the mean value of all individuals finding the maturation speed s 0 64 day the maturation state progresses until the final gosner stage 46 is reached note that we make maturation a continuous variable connecting the original discrete stages defined by gosner 1960 4 7 initial values we initialize the model using the mean length and mean gosner stage at the beginning of the experiment the reserve energy density at the beginning is set to its feeding and thus maturity dependent equilibrium given by eq 7 5 results and discussion in this work we described two variants of a deb model for a developing tadpole which changes its feeding behavior during metamorphosis the first variant is a full deb model where assimilates are first stored as reserves and from there are used to fuel the various processes the second variant is a debkiss model where reserve turnover is assumed to be fast so that reserves can be neglected and assimilated energy is used directly for growth and maintenance the models do not distinguish between energy spent for maintenance or maturity work and are intended only to describe the tadpole stage until metamorphosis is reached we fitted both model variants to growth trajectories and respiration data of a cohort of tadpoles the growth trajectories are shown in fig 7 and the likelihood profiles of the parameters are shown in figs 8 and 9 visually both models fit the data reasonably well with the exception that the models predict a decrease of snout to vent length towards the end of the experiment this trend is not clearly evident in the data the models predict this decrease because they assume that when feeding is reduced structure is reverted to cover maintenance the full deb model includes a reserve buffer through which growth and maintenance can continue for some time after feeding is reduced this makes it fit arguably a bit better to the growth and respiration data the limiting case in which the deb model becomes the debkiss model large energy conductance v does not lie within the 95 confidence interval this means that the model fits are significantly better for the full deb model reflecting that reserves are an essential feature for the energy budget of tadpoles undergoing metamorphosis still reserve dynamics and physiological changes can be implemented in different ways in a deb framework it is therefore important to scrutinize the model assumptions and discuss possible modifications that could improve the models a critical simplification of our models is the assumption that the shape coefficient and the volume specific costs of structure are constant over the course of development however it appears that when comparing a froglet to a tadpole then 1 the volume to snout to vent length is reduced and 2 the dry weight per body volume is increased unpublished data from pieter johnson and data for a related frog species from takahara et al 2008 to part from the shape assumptions one could either account explicitly for a changing shape coefficient or formally set out the model in terms of body weight instead of volume to make use of the preservation of body mass as the reduced volume and increased dry weight per volume counterbalance each other to some extend another option could be to relax the assumptions on how reserves are handled in the model in the standard deb model energy is mobilized for growth and maintenance at a rate proportional to the reserve density reserves per structural volume so that when surface specific feeding is constant reserve density converges to an equilibrium i e in our application the reserve density stays virtually constant over the first proportion of the tadpole development and then decreases when feeding is reduced this assumption might be not generally met by tadpoles for instance they could steadily increase reserve density until they approach metamorphosis and reduce feeding this kind of reserve dynamics have been observed in fish a modification of the standard deb model deblipid has been developed to capture such dynamics martin et al 2017 despite these possibilities we stick with body volume and with the deb debkiss reserve dynamics to stay close to the canonical deb model and focus on the changing feeding pattern in this work we have shown how deb theory can be used readily to describe an organism which changes its surface area specific energy assimilation over time for this application we used an interpolation of feeding rates at different developmental tadpole stages this captures the patterns from the empirical data but it could be also interesting to find more causative and mechanistic principles describing the change in feeding rates for example one could consider how the functional surface used for assimilation changes during development to infer the assimilation rates we hope that theory from bioenergetic models will be further developed in this direction and help understand the energy balance of organisms that change feeding and other traits during their life credit authorship contribution statement ferdinand pfab writing original draft formal analysis graziella v direnzo investigation conceptualization

while measurements were recorded we filled each mason jar with treated water that had been sitting with a bubbler for at least 30 minutes prior to the respirometry procedure to ensure the water was saturated with oxygen we filled the mason jars entirely with treated water and recorded an initial oxygen concentration using a ysi multilab 4010 and ysi proobod optical bod probe the tadpole and mesh were then quickly added to the mason jar and the modified falcon tube cap on the jar lids was screwed on to create an air tight seal after 90 minutes the falcon tube cap was removed and the oxygen probe was inserted to record the final oxygen concentration we sterilized the ysi proobod optical bod probe in between recordings of treatment groups by dipping in into a bleach solution followed by a rinse with di water and drying with a kim wipe four control jars containing only treated water were used to ensure that seals were airtight the controls showed no decrease of oxygen in the absence of tadpoles we excluded significant respiration by microrganisms because respiration of tadpoles was measured in fresh water respirometry recordings were performed one day prior to euthanasia no individual was sampled twice the change of the o 2 concentration in the respirometry chamber was used to calculated the individuals oxygen consumption rate o 2 mg day laboratory temperature was maintained at 20 23 c and water temperature was recorded before and after respirometry procedure we also recorded temperature of the water in the jars which remained constant between 20 22 c it is important that water temperature is constant throughout the trial because it would affect the dissolved oxygen concentration in the water 3 models we describe two versions of the model a standard deb model with reserves kooijman 2010 and a debkiss model jager et al 2013 which assumes that assimilates are used directly fig 2 gives an overview of the general structure of the models table 1 lists the state variables of the models and the derived auxiliary variables used to relate the models to the data the ingestion rate is p x a fraction κx of this food is assimilated so that the assimilation rate is 1 p a κ x p x we start with the standard deb assumption for isomorphic organisms that food uptake is proportional to the individuals surface 2 p x p x l 2 where l is the volumetric length l v 1 3 we generally adopt the formulation that square brackets indicate quantities per volume v and curly brackets indicate quantities per volumetric surface area l 2 we also adopt the notation that a dot above a quantity indicates a rate measured per time to account for changing feeding rates through development we depart from the standard assumption that p x depends only on the resource level and let it instead depend on the tadpoles maturation state we assume p x is fixed at a given developmental stage because animals were fed ad libidum in principle however resource dependence can be added to the model in the standard way by setting 3 p x f p x m where f is the resource dependent functional response and with values between 0 and 1 and p x m is the maximum area specific assimilation rate maturation of the organism is tracked by an additional state variable g we assume that maturation in terms of gosner stages gosner 1960 progresses at a constant rate s until the final stage 46 is reached 4 d d t g s g 46 0 afterwards we do not explicitly model the energy used for maturation reproduction we instead assume that maturation costs are included in the somatic maintenance term in standard deb formulation this would correspond to the case that all energy used goes to growth and somatic maintenance κ 1 with the addition of an independently progressing maturation variable we decided to simplify the model in this fashion because with our data it seems impossible to distinguish between metabolic work for maturation and metabolic work for somatic maintenance as in the standard deb model we assume that somatic maintenance costs p s are proportional to the volume of the organism 5 p s p s v where p s is the volume specific maintenance rate we assume there is no separate term for the maintenance of maturity in the standard deb model this term would be proportional to the total energy spent for maturation we also assume that the energy reserves in the full deb model do not require metabolic work to be maintained the volume of the organism is assumed to grow according to 6 d v d t r v the growth rate r will depend on the model we choose 3 1 model with reserves deb this model version is close to the canonical deb model described in kooijman 2010 assimilated energy is first saved in energy reserves e from where it is then drawn to fuel the various processes in the organism such as growth and maintenance as explained in kooijman 2010 1 1 equation 2 10 with κ 1 reserve energy density e per structural volume of the organism changes according to 7 d d t e p a e v l where p a is the energy assimilation per square volumetric length l 2 and v is the energy conductance determining how fast reserves are mobilized referring to kooijman 2010 2 2 equation 2 13 the growth rate of the organism is 8 r e v l p s e e g this equation holds for non starving organisms which mobilize more energy than needed for maintenance e v l p s deb theory leaves the rules for starving organisms open several possibilities are described in kooijman 2010 for our application we assume that structural biomass is formed with an efficiency of y between 0 and 1 and that in times of starvation structure can be again metabolized to cover maintenance costs assuming that all the energy of metabolized structure can be used for maintenance we find that for starving organisms e v l p s the negative growth rate is 9 r 1 y e v l p s e e g note that y does not appear in the growth equation for non starving organisms because the parameter eg captures all volume specific costs for building new structure including the overhead on growth which adds to respiration 3 2 model without reserves debkiss the deb model can be simplified to a debkiss model by assuming that energy turnover is fast v jager et al 2013 with this simplification reserves vanish e 0 and assimilated energy is used directly to fuel growth and maintenance because v e p a plugging this into the growth equation growth is then simply given by the energy left after paying maintenance costs so that given the per volume costs of structure eg the growth rate of the organism is 10 r p a l p s e g where p a is the energy assimilation per square volumetric length l 2 and p s is the volume specific maintenance rate this equation describes growth as long as the organism takes up enough energy to cover the maintenance costs p a l p s if assimilation is lower the organism starves analogously to eq 9 in the deb model it reverts structure to cover maintenance costs and the negative growth rate is 11 r 1 y p a l p s e g 3 3 respiration to relate the models to the respiration measures we formulate respiration r we assume that all assimilated carbon used for maintenance and for overhead costs on growth is respired in this process o2 is transformed to co2 with ηr being mg oxygen used per j energy this leads for non starving organisms with d v d t 0 to the rate of o2 consumption 12 r η r p s v 1 y e g d v d t and for starving organisms to 13 r η r p s v 4 parameter estimations and data fitting here we estimate the various parameters for the two model variants some of the parameters are estimated from different sources and some are fitted to the data of our experiment table 2 summarizes the estimates we used wolfram mathematica version 12 0 to estimate the model parameters 4 1 maximum likelihood function the parameters p s κx and y both models and additionally v for the full deb model are fitted using a maximum likelihood approach the procedure is described in jager and ashauer 2018 we denote the times when length was measured with t l i and the times when respiration was measured with t r j to speed up the fitting procedure we use the mean values over individuals at each time point we denote the mean length data points with t l i l i and the respiration data points with t r j r j the corresponding model predictions are l t l i and r t r i now the likelihood function l is 14 l l l l r with l l i f l t l i σ l l i l r j f r t r j σ r r j where f μ σ x is the probability density function of the normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ at the value x 15 f μ σ x 1 2 π σ exp 1 2 μ x σ 2 the likelihood is maximized with respect to the parameters p s κx y and for the full deb model additionally v and the standard deviations σl and σr to obtain likelihood profiles for the parameters we find the maximum likelihood l 0 with all parameters fitted and compare it to the maximum likelihood l 1 with a focal parameter fixed to a range of values while the other parameters are fitted again we then find the 95 confidence intervals for the parameter by using wilks theorem jager and ashauer 2018 according to this theorem the test statistic 16 d 2 log l 1 l 0 is approximately χ 2 distributed with one degree of freedom the 95 confidence interval is thus given by all parameter values for which d is lower than the p 95 quantile of the χ 2 distribution 4 2 volumetric length to snout to vent length δ m we assume that the volumetric length l v 1 3 is proportional to the snout to vent length lw such that 17 l δ m l w to estimate the parameter δm we use measures on snout to vent length and wet weight of tadpoles shown in fig 3 we assume that 1 mg wet weight corresponds to 1 mm3 volume because their volume is mostly filled with water and they are neutrally buoyant finally we fit the parameter minimizing the square error of the equation 18 v l 3 δ m l w 3 and find δ m 0 53 mm mm 4 3 cost per structure eg dried tadpoles of a similar species reportedly have an energy content of about 23 j mg turnipseed and altig 1975 to find the energy content per volume we combine this with data on dry weight per volume from pieter johnson shown in fig 3 using linear regression we find the density of dry weight to volume of 0 04 mg mm3 assuming again that wet tadpoles have a density similar to water this leads to an energy density of δ e 0 9 j mm3 we use this energy density and the growth efficiency y which is fitted to the growth trajectories together with the other free parameters after fixing all other parameters to estimate the energetic costs for producing structure 4 3 1 debkiss for the debkiss model all mass is assumed to be structural mass i e reserves are lumped together with structure using the growth efficiency y we calculate the energetic cost per structure 19 e g δ e y 4 3 2 deb for this model we need to distinguish between structural weight and reserve weight absent information we could use to estimate the ratio of structure to reserves we assume that ρ 0 5 of the dry weight in the data is structural weight and the rest is reserves thus only a fraction ρ of the weighted body mass counts towards structural cost and we find 20 e g ρ δ e y this estimation is close to that of grably and piery 1981 who measured the effect of starvation on adult frogs of another species taking into account the differences they found for wet weight and water content their experiment suggests that starved frogs have a 60 lower dry weight than non starved frogs of the same length 4 4 oxygen used per assimilate ηr to find the constant ηr for how much oxygen in mg is used to metabolize assimilates in j we assume that assimilates are comparable to glucose using the caloric value of glucose linstrom and mallard 2014 we find that one j of assimilates corresponds to 0 06 mg glucose from the chemical equation for the oxidation of glucose and the molar weights of the reactants we find that 1 mg glucose is combusted with 1 1 mg oxygen this leads to 21 η r 0 06 mgglucose j 1 1 mgo 2 mgglucose 0 07 mgo 2 j to check the sensitivity of the assumption on the composition of assimilates we imagined an extreme scenario where the assimilate was entirely composed of lipids re estimated the parameter ηr and repeated the fitting the fitted curves were close to indistinguishable but the estimated values of some parameters notably κx and y were different not shown 4 5 the stage dependent feeding rate p x we estimated the stage dependent ingestion rates j day from the amount of food consumed between feeding events for each gosner stage between 28 and 46 we used the data from individual feeding periods where the individual was in this gosner stage at the beginning the end or between the feeding events including the last event where only the remaining food was weighted but no food was added we then calculated the mean snout to vent length lw during the feeding periods from the measurements at the beginning and the end of the period converted this to volumetric length l and fitted a curve for the feeding rate 22 p x p x l 2 for each gosner stage as shown in fig 4 the average maturation between feeding event is 3 0 gosner stages so the estimated feeding rates are smoothed across this range because we have only a few data points on the final stages and smoothed over stage 43 46 we assume that the animals entirely stop feeding when turning into a froglet at stage 46 and interpolate the feeding rates between stage 43 to 46 afterwards the froglets would start eating again i e their diet consisting predominantly of insects but our experiment did not continue into this life stage the surface area specific feeding rates p x at the different gosner stages are shown in fig 5 4 6 the parameter s the maturation speed s is fitted to the experimental data shown in fig 6 we choose all individuals for whom the final measure was at least one week after the start of the experiment thereby focusing on individuals that arrive to higher stages when feeding is reduced for each of these individuals we calculate how many stages were passed per day on average we then calculate the mean value of all individuals finding the maturation speed s 0 64 day the maturation state progresses until the final gosner stage 46 is reached note that we make maturation a continuous variable connecting the original discrete stages defined by gosner 1960 4 7 initial values we initialize the model using the mean length and mean gosner stage at the beginning of the experiment the reserve energy density at the beginning is set to its feeding and thus maturity dependent equilibrium given by eq 7 5 results and discussion in this work we described two variants of a deb model for a developing tadpole which changes its feeding behavior during metamorphosis the first variant is a full deb model where assimilates are first stored as reserves and from there are used to fuel the various processes the second variant is a debkiss model where reserve turnover is assumed to be fast so that reserves can be neglected and assimilated energy is used directly for growth and maintenance the models do not distinguish between energy spent for maintenance or maturity work and are intended only to describe the tadpole stage until metamorphosis is reached we fitted both model variants to growth trajectories and respiration data of a cohort of tadpoles the growth trajectories are shown in fig 7 and the likelihood profiles of the parameters are shown in figs 8 and 9 visually both models fit the data reasonably well with the exception that the models predict a decrease of snout to vent length towards the end of the experiment this trend is not clearly evident in the data the models predict this decrease because they assume that when feeding is reduced structure is reverted to cover maintenance the full deb model includes a reserve buffer through which growth and maintenance can continue for some time after feeding is reduced this makes it fit arguably a bit better to the growth and respiration data the limiting case in which the deb model becomes the debkiss model large energy conductance v does not lie within the 95 confidence interval this means that the model fits are significantly better for the full deb model reflecting that reserves are an essential feature for the energy budget of tadpoles undergoing metamorphosis still reserve dynamics and physiological changes can be implemented in different ways in a deb framework it is therefore important to scrutinize the model assumptions and discuss possible modifications that could improve the models a critical simplification of our models is the assumption that the shape coefficient and the volume specific costs of structure are constant over the course of development however it appears that when comparing a froglet to a tadpole then 1 the volume to snout to vent length is reduced and 2 the dry weight per body volume is increased unpublished data from pieter johnson and data for a related frog species from takahara et al 2008 to part from the shape assumptions one could either account explicitly for a changing shape coefficient or formally set out the model in terms of body weight instead of volume to make use of the preservation of body mass as the reduced volume and increased dry weight per volume counterbalance each other to some extend another option could be to relax the assumptions on how reserves are handled in the model in the standard deb model energy is mobilized for growth and maintenance at a rate proportional to the reserve density reserves per structural volume so that when surface specific feeding is constant reserve density converges to an equilibrium i e in our application the reserve density stays virtually constant over the first proportion of the tadpole development and then decreases when feeding is reduced this assumption might be not generally met by tadpoles for instance they could steadily increase reserve density until they approach metamorphosis and reduce feeding this kind of reserve dynamics have been observed in fish a modification of the standard deb model deblipid has been developed to capture such dynamics martin et al 2017 despite these possibilities we stick with body volume and with the deb debkiss reserve dynamics to stay close to the canonical deb model and focus on the changing feeding pattern in this work we have shown how deb theory can be used readily to describe an organism which changes its surface area specific energy assimilation over time for this application we used an interpolation of feeding rates at different developmental tadpole stages this captures the patterns from the empirical data but it could be also interesting to find more causative and mechanistic principles describing the change in feeding rates for example one could consider how the functional surface used for assimilation changes during development to infer the assimilation rates we hope that theory from bioenergetic models will be further developed in this direction and help understand the energy balance of organisms that change feeding and other traits during their life credit authorship contribution statement ferdinand pfab writing original draft formal analysis graziella v direnzo investigation conceptualization

24737,modeling energy content and gain of individuals is of increasing importance in ecosystem modeling especially in aquaculture and fisheries traditional models for estimating the content and gain are either imprecise or expensive in part because of intensive data requirements here we show how routine biometric data length and wet weight or condition index can be used to estimate total energy content of fish starting with theoretical partitioning between structure and reserves we create a model to relate energy to the fulton s condition index we then use data from cultured sea bream sparus aurata l to show that the model based on structure should be used to calculate energy content from biometric data validation using independent data shows remarkable ability of the model to predict energy content r 2 0 99 while comparison with previously used models demonstrates marked differences in predictions when fish condition is variable unlike traditional methods our model predicts different energy content and gain or loss for small fat and large thin fish of equal weight and can therefore give considerable additional value to biometric data commonly collected in aquaculture fisheries and related citizen science programs keywords bioenergetic model biometric data condition index energy loss gilthead sea bream sparus aurata l 1 introduction energy content and energy gain or loss of fish are important inputs to bioenergetic models which are a conventional tool in aquaculture seginer 2016 nobre et al 2019 and of increasing importance in fisheries and ecosystem modeling arrhenius et al 1996 spitz et al 2010 barnett et al 2017 bachiller et al 2018 in aquaculture the models are used to optimize feeding by estimating energy required for achieving target fish growth bureau et al 2002 the models typically estimate energy needs using only weight to describe the fish bureau et al 2002 i e without taking condition of the fish into account consequently these models predict the same energy dynamics for a long emaciated and a short fat fish of equal weights this prediction has been disputed empirically jobling 2003 bavčević et al 2010 and is also theoretically unreasonable since the two fish should have vastly different energy requirements for maintenance and growth nevertheless such models especially von bertalanffy s von bertalanffy 1957 and its modern variants e g chambers et al 2017 with the same shortcomings have been used in aquaculture fisheries and ecosystem modeling to overcome the shortcomings alternative models have been constructed broekhuizen et al 1994 gurney et al 2003 kooijman 2010 jusup et al 2017 and references therein these models share an experimentally supported idea that growth depends on both the size and the condition of fish among the models those based on the dynamic energy budget deb theory are the most comprehensive deb models have been used in more than 850 publications a large fraction of which relate to marine environments amp portal 2019 deb models as do any other that successfully disentangle size and condition distinguish structure of the fish from its energy reserves the new class of models account for environmental variability and predict energy content requirements and gain but the models are cumbersome to use consequently energy content and gain in aquaculture fisheries and ecosystem research is still estimated either by weight based models e g wuenschel et al 2006 breck 2008 van poorten and walters 2010 or by expensive chemical analysis thus despite the calls to develop and utilize inexpensive and computationally simple methods for valuation of stored energy in fish based on morphometric indices mcpherson et al 2011 much of the biometric data is chronically underutilized distinction between structure and energy reserves introduced by the new class of models enables us to develop a model for estimation of energy content from simple biometric measurements we start by using concepts from deb theory to link its two state variables structural volume and energy reserves to the most frequently reported biometric data length and condition index structural volume has already been linked to fish length using the shape coefficient δm kooijman 2010 we proceed to link energy reserves and energy reserve density to fulton s condition index k by assuming that length and therefore structural volume sensu deb theory cannot appreciably shrink then since structure as defined in deb theory cannot decrease all changes in weight for non reproducing non growing fish can be attributed to changes in energy reserves this effect has been demonstrated in bavčević et al 2010 who find that k decreases with weight during starvation and schloesser and fabrizio 2017 who find that energy per unit weight in summer flounder depends on k we use data from a mild starvation experiment and proximate analysis to establish the relationship between k and energy density use the relationship to predict total energy density and validate the model using independent data from the literature recorded at different times and or locations finally we discuss limitations of our approach and consider possible use of the new approach to improve existing fish growth models and add value to biometric data in aquaculture and fisheries new developments in biometric data acquisition in fisheries massé et al 2016 mangi et al 2016 regulation eu 2017 1004 and aquaculture puig et al 2012 churnside et al 2012 could make a rapid adoption of our method to other species possible in both fisheries and aquaculture research and management 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and sample analysis two sets of data derived respectively from a starvation experiment and a regular monitoring of gilthead sea bream cage production were used in this study both acquired at a commercial fish farm in eastern adriatic coastal waters near vrgada island croatia change of k during starvation and energy density as a function of k were calculated using a data set ds1 obtained from the experiment the isometric growth was verified using data set ds2 collected from a regular monitoring program at a commercial sea bream farm 2 1 1 ds1 change of k and correlation between energy density and k obtaining relationship between k l and energy content required data from fish of a reasonably wide range of k and l since k does not appreciably vary between fish in aquaculture we conducted a starvation experiment to gather the data a total of 800 gilthead sea bream were collected from four offshore net cages in different stages of the production cycle fish from a single cage formed one group representing a total of four distinct size weight groups a 30 5 cm 1 1 cm sd 359 1 g 38 8 g sd b 27 3 cm 2 0 cm sd 319 3 g 82 2 g sd c 21 7 cm 0 9 cm sd 157 1 g 21 7 g sd and d 13 4 cm 1 1 cm sd 35 4 g 8 7 g sd fish of each group were randomly separated into two replicates and each replicate of approximately 100 fish total n 800 was held in a separate 8 m3 cages for 117 days 40 days of feeding to satiation 77 days of starvation in each cage 50 fish were tagged with micro chips total n 400 to follow the change of k during starvation whereas the remained untagged fish were sampled to estimate relationship between k and energy density temperature and dissolved oxygen were measured daily at the depth of 1 m temperature varied from 21 8 c at the beginning to 18 7 c at the end of the experiment and the saturation of dissolved oxygen was in range of 92 to 105 throughout the experiment fish were first fed to satiation with commercial feed for sea bream protein 46 fats and oil 16 fiber 3 ash 6 3 digestible energy 16 6 mj kg for 40 days to maximize energy reserves and k and then starved for 77 days the first sampling was done at day two of starvation to allow for most of undigested matter to clear the gut total length l and wet weight ww of tagged fish from each cage total n 400 were measured at days 2 9 16 23 30 and 77 of starvation with precisions of 1 mm and 1 g respectively fulton s condition factor k was calculated as 1 k w w l 3 100 we used proximate analysis to estimate total energy of fish even though bomb calorimetry might have been more accurate breck 2014 nobre et al 2019 this has been done to increase number of samples and more importantly to enable validation as there were no adequate bomb calorimetry data available in the literature for comparison differences in estimates between the two methods result from a bias in estimates of energy content of body components chiefly fat johnson et al 2017 to minimize the bias we used bomb callorimetry calibrated energy values for sea bream from lupatsch et al 2003a any remaining bias in our work applies to all fish equally and therefore does not affect correlations to determine correlation between energy density and k four untagged fish from each group were also collected at days 2 9 16 23 30 and 77 of starvation total n 96 these fish were checked for gonad maturity and k was calculated from their l and ww thereafter sampled fish were minced in pairs and frozen for whole body proximate analysis of composite samples total n 48 during the experiment no gonad development was observed proximate composition of sampled fish was determined following standard aoac procedures 1995 briefly lipids were extracted by the procedure of folch et al 1957 and the total lipid content was gravimetrically determined after solvent evaporation protein content was determined using the kjeldahl method and multiplying the total nitrogen content by the factor 6 25 to measure whole body water content a specimen from minced fish was oven dried at 105 c until weight remained constant and reweighed for the ash content determination 1 g homogenate sample was separately combusted in a muffle furnace until weight remained constant the experiment adhered to applicable guidelines and standards for the ethical use of animals in research as well as all applicable laws and regulations to avoid injury experimental protocol mandated termination of the experiment when fish reached a condition index of k 1 2 the minimum k in the experiment was 1 17 since condition indices k 1 have been observed eisawy and wassef 1984 no fish were severely starved and consequently no mortalities occurred at the end of the experiment tagged fish were euthanized in ice slurry as in blessing et al 2010 and remaining fish were slowly fed and returned to the production 2 1 2 ds2 testing for isometric growth weight length relationships of gilthead sea bream were estimated using biometric data l and ww of 340 fish ranging from 7 7 g to 681 g the data were obtained from biometries conducted during regular farming activities over a single month at a commercial sea bream farm near vrgada island croatia fish were fed with commercial feed as indicated above ds1 correlation between energy density and k average temperature during sampling was 22 3 c 2 2 calculation and data analysis calculation and data analysis had seven steps 1 ds1 was used to calculate energy content of the fish 2 structural volume was obtained by calculating the shape coefficient from literature data 3 energy density was calculated i from the ratio of energy content and structural volume and ii from the energy content and wet weight of fish 4 the assumption of isometric growth was checked using ds2 5 k was interpreted as a measure of energy density 6 the relationship between energy content and gain was estimated from length and k 7 the relationship was validated by comparing predictions to observations from independent data sets additionally energy change in fish predicted by our method has been compared to predictions by standard methods lupatsch et al 2003b libralato and solidoro 2008 2 2 1 calculating energy content of the fish from proximate analysis total energy content et of proximate analyzed fish from ds1 was estimated as the sum of main sources of energy in fish proteins and fats protein and fat content determined by the proximate composition analysis were multiplied by the total weight of the fish and average energetic values of proteins and fats calibrated by bomb calorimetry lupatsch et al 2003a 23 1 kj g protein and 35 8 kj g fat 2 e t w w p r o t e i n c o n t e n t 23 1 k j g 1 w w f a t c o n t e n t 35 8 k j g 1 where ww is wet weight of fish in grams while protein content and fat content are respective ratios of weight of protein and fat to ww 2 2 2 calculating the shape coefficient we adopt partitioning of the organism from the deb theory into i energy reserves which are used to fuel metabolic processes without requiring maintenance and ii structure which utilizes energy for growth maintenance and other metabolic work deb assumes that structure and reserves each separately have a constant composition however since the ratio of the two can change so can the total composition of the fish kooijman 2010 the structural size of an organism is represented by structural volume vs which relates to a cube of the body length of the fish l through a dimensionless shape coefficient δm kooijman 2010 3 v s δ m l 3 by definition in a starved non reproductive organism with almost completely depleted reserves only structure i e somatic tissue remains then i k is minimal k kmin and ii the wet weight of the fish ww should be equal to the weight of the structure ws assuming ρ 1 g cm 3 is the average density of somatic tissue van der veer et al 2001 then ww ws ρvs inserting ρvs into eq 1 and using 3 to solve for δm gives 4 δ m 3 k min 100 we estimated kmin from eisawy and wassef 1984 who report the lowest k we could find in literature to avoid underestimating kmin due to individual variability or extreme starvation when even structural tissue is metabolised we averaged the smallest 10 of values of k to estimate kmin 1 2 i e δm 0 229 2 2 3 estimating energy density eds the estimated δm was used to calculate vs from length of each proximate analyzed fish using eq 3 assuming vs represents the structural volume the energy density relative to structural volume i e amount of energy per unit volume of structure eds could be calculated from total energy et of each proximate analyzed specimen square brackets denote densities 5 e d s e t v s for comparison we also calculated energy density edw relative to wet weight ww of the same fish using a common approach as in lawson et al 1998 pangle and sutton 2005 schloesser and fabrizio 2017 6 e d w e t w w 2 2 4 verifying assumption of isometric growth growth type was determined by fitting parameters of the allometric equation ricker 1975 7 w w a l b using nonlinear least squares regression the correlation between wet weight ww and length l of 340 fish data from ds2 was verified using the determination coefficient r2 the 95 confidence intervals of parameter b were estimated and t test h0 b 3 α 0 01 was applied to test whether the value of parameter b statistically differs from isometric growth b 3 sokal and rohlf 1981 2 2 5 using k as a measure of energy density structure as defined in the deb theory is assumed to have constant energy during starvation gurney et al 2003 kooijman 2010 hence changes of energy density should only be the consequence of reserve depletion in addition any changes in energy reserves affect indicators of energetic status such as k therefore k should relate to both structural volume specific energy density eds and weight specific energy density edw we tested whether k is a good measure of energy density using ds1 to calculate linear regressions of eds and edw obtained from the proximate analysis to k obtained from biometries of the same fish hence two linear regression equations were fitted with k as the independent variable one with eds and the other with edw as the dependent variable high coefficient of correlation would indicate that k is a good proxy for energy density 2 2 6 estimating energy content and energy gain of fish the total energy content of the fish at i th measurement is equal to the product of energy density eds i and the estimated structural volume vsi 8 e t i e d s i v s i eq 8 is used to estimate change of energy content of tagged fish n 400 ds1 during starvation equivalent equation could have been used to estimate total energy from edw change in total energy content of the fish is equal to the difference between energy at the start and at the end of the particular period accordingly eq 8 can be used to calculate energy gain or loss the energy gain as fish grows from vsi to vs i 1 is then equal to 9 e g a i n e t i 1 e t i eq 9 can be used to predict energy gain from changes in length and condition of the fish we compared our predictions of energy gain for an illustrative set of l and k to predictions based on methods from lupatsch et al 2003b and libralato and solidoro 2008 2 2 7 validating the energy content estimation we validated our method of total energy prediction eq 8 by comparing predicted and observed total energy et of gilthead sea bream data used for validation were collected from four articles representing different locations breeding stock and periods deguara et al 1999 bavčević et al 2007 bonaldo et al 2010 and mongile et al 2014 observed weight and proximate analysis were used to calculate the observed energy content using eq 2 predicted et was then estimated in three steps first vs was estimated from observed length using eq 3 second eds was predicted from estimated vs and measured k using eq 11 third et was predicted from the definition of energy density eq 8 the observations and predictions were then compared statistically four data sets were used data of deguara et al 1999 represent composite samples n 105 ranging in mean fish weight from 72 05 g to 98 8 g data of bavčević et al 2007 represent composite samples n 140 ranging in mean fish weight from 157 95 g to 193 72 g data of bonaldo et al 2010 represent composite samples n 140 ranging in mean fish weight from 218 g to 238 8 g data of mongile et al 2014 represent composite samples n 150 ranging in mean fish weight from 289 8 g to 303 9 g these independent data sets therefore range from 72 05 g to 303 9 g covering a large fraction of the size range relevant to aquaculture 2 3 statistical analysis relationship between k and either eds or edw was examined by pearson linear regression results from the first starvation experiment ds1 are presented as the mean standard error of the mean sem statistical differences among fish groups were analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova and where appropriate by a post hoc tukey s test at a significance level of p 0 05 to validate our method for calculation of total energy we applied a linear regression to the predicted and observed values of et that were calculated as described in the chapter validation of the energy content estimation we i evaluated the correlation using the correlation coefficient r2 and ii analyzed the differences between predictions and observations using the student s t test all calculations were performed with statistica 6 0 statistical software statsoft tulsa ok usa 3 results 3 1 isometric growth can be assumed fitting eq 7 to the data of ww and l of cultured gilthead sea bream data set ds2 yielded ww 0 0163 l 3 00002 r2 0 993 p 0 001 the 95 confidence interval of the exponent b was 2 998 3 002 indicating isometric growth the indication was confirmed by a t test in which the obtained value of b did not significantly differ p 0 01 from the isometric value of 3 therefore the growth can be assumed to be isometric for farmed fish of the tested size range and δm can be calculated the estimated shape coefficient of δm 0 229 is slightly smaller than the one estimated by serpa et al 2013 because our estimate does not include appreciable energy reserves while that by serpa et al 2013 does since the fish we used to estimate δm was live wild caught and therefore not completely exhausted even our estimate contains a small contribution of reserves and therefore represents an upper boundary of the estimate for δm sensu deb theory i e the true δm is likely to be slightly smaller 3 2 k can be used as a measure of structural volume specific energy density linear regression of eds and edw as functions of k using ds1 fig 1 gives a strong correlation between eds and k and moderate correlation between edw and k 11 e d s 14 244 k 9 453 r 2 0 792 p 0 01 12 e d w 5 583 k 1 18 r 2 0 42 p 0 01 the correlation coefficients strongly suggest that k is a better proxy for eds than for edw knowing k therefore enables the more reliable estimate of eds than of edw consequently we used eds and eq 8 in further analysis tagged fish from the first experiment ds1 were used to monitor change of k during starvation although all size classes were fed to satiation before the experiment significantly different anova p 0 05 initial values of k were recorded between the groups fig 2 panel a during the experiment k gradually declined for all fish groups consequently change of total energy et during starvation experiment fig 2 panel b calculated by eq 8 also gradually declined for all fish groups the differences between final values of k were not significant between groups a b and c but group d remained different 3 3 validating the method to calculate energy content from length and k fig 3 presents plot of the observed total energy versus predicted total energy calculated according to methods from the section validation of the energy content estimation the predicted and observed data were highly correlated r2 0 99 and the student t test cannot reject the hypothesis that the data points come from the same distribution p 0 74 this indicates that et can successfully be calculated using eds estimated from k thus validating the model 3 4 using k to calculate energy gain of fish finally in table 1 we combine 3 and 11 to demonstrate how k can be used to estimate energy change in gilthead sea bream during growth energy gain from time t 1 to time t 2 is equal to the difference in energy contents between these two times combining expression 9 with the expression for eds eq 11 and the estimate of the shape coefficient δm 0 229 we get 13 e g a i n e t i 1 e t i v s i 1 e d s i 1 v s i e d s i 0 229 l i 1 3 14 244 k i 1 9 453 0 229 l i 3 14 244 k i 9 453 where li and ki are total length and fulton s condition index at time ti respectively table 1 compares predictions of our method to those of lupatsch et al 2003b and libralato and solidoro 2008 using four illustrative scenarios at 21 8 c see also table 1 1 growth from l 1 21 cm to l 2 23 cm k constant at 1 7 2 growth from l 1 21 cm to l 2 23 cm k increases from k 1 1 5 to k 2 1 7 3 growth from l 1 15 cm to l 2 23 cm k constant at 1 7 4 growth from l 1 15 cm to l 2 23 cm k increases from k 1 1 5 to k 2 1 7 when k is constant during fish growth lupatsch et al 2003b predicts a much higher energy gain than libralato and solidoro 2008 but our method predicts still higher energy gain when fish grow in length and their k simultaneously increases unlike our model both methods from the literature greatly underestimate the energy gain egain table 1 4 discussion we adopted concepts of structure and energy reserves from advanced bioenergetic models primarily deb to develop a straightforward method for estimating energy content and gain of fish from simple biometric data length and weight or condition index the method was used to parametrize a model for gilthead sea bream an economically important species in mediterranean the method is however general and be used for any fish species that has isometric growth and the necessary data to relate energy content to k for a range of sizes the generality of the method is inherited from the basics of deb theory as described in kooijman 2010 which has been applied to more than 2200 species from all genera plants being a notable exception amp database of models accessed on 13 8 2020 at https www bio vu nl thb deb deblab add my pet about html since deb state variables typically represent or can be converted into energy jusup et al 2017 total energy content could be calculated from deb state variables directly however mapping from weight to state variables is not unique see e g eq 2 in nisbet et al 2012 hence the ode based deb model has to be solved explicitly with the additional complication of having to correctly estimate parameters in eq 2 by nisbet et al 2012 our method adopts basic concepts of energy reserves and structural volume and reduces the problem to calculation of coefficients in the weighted sum of energy between structure and reserves where condition index serves as a proxy for energy density the model is therefore as general as the idea that the condition index captures energetic status i e fatness of organisms we first quantified benefits of our approach by comparing its results based on k and eds eq 11 to the traditional approach of considering weight alone edw eq 12 our approach yields r2 0 81 while the traditional approach yields r2 0 45 thus clearly performing considerably better the improvement is due to the separation of structure and reserves when fish length does not change e g during prolonged starvation the structural volume remains constant kooijman 2010 then any change in total weight is solely due to the change of the weight of the reserves affecting k as a consequence therefore k and ww are interdependent variables and their cross interaction is fully expressed when as total weight changes the energy content of the fish is divided by the weight at any given time therefore the ratio of edw and k is noticeably affected only if the change in total energy of fish with constant length is comparatively large and of significant difference in quality amount of energy per weight conversely since eds is divided by unchanged structural volume change in eds reflects changes in both quantity and quality of energy therefore the eq 11 describing the correlation of eds with k provides more information and is better suited for further applications than the eq 12 for edw next we quantified differences in predictions between ours and commonly used methods of estimating energy gain lupatsch et al 2003b libralato and solidoro 2008 table 1 presents energy gains according to the three methods for four hypothetical but likely scenarios when k is constant case 1 and 3 in table 1 our method agrees well with the estimates calculated using method described by lupatsch et al 2003b while libralato and solidoro 2008 give a lower estimate when k increases during growth case 2 and case 4 in table 1 our method predicts the highest energy gain because it accounts for changes in energy density due to increase in k we hypothesize that increase in weight due to increase in k requires more energy than increase in weight due to growth in length because increase in k represent disproportionate increase in energy reserves which typically contains more energy per unit weight than the structure the large differences in scenarios where k changes case 2 and 4 can only be attributed to the processes captured by our method i e the inclusion of energy reserve dynamics hence our model is to the best of our knowledge the only one that simply and directly translates sea bream biometric data into energy content and gain while differentiating between small obese and large emaciated fish the validation fig 3 is highly suggestive of the validity of our model the slope of predicted vs observed values of 0 98 is very close to 1 and correlation between predicted and observed data is extremely high r2 0 99 the intercept of the regression line 27 kj fish is indicative of a possible minimal bias in our method or the data used for validation if there indeed is a bias its influence reduces with fish size to less than 0 7 for sea bream of 500 g expectedly the energy content and k were declining during starvation fig 2 the asymptotic nature of the decline suggests lower rate of tissue and energy loss in later periods of starvation this is consistent with observations by hepher et al 1983 and lupatsch et al 2003a the most important limitation of our method and the resulting model for sea bream is that neither energy stored in fish eggs nor energy required to produce them is accounted for the limitation does not present a problem in aquaculture as reproduction tends to be minimized or completely avoided by harvesting before reproduction but may prove to be important for other applications our method could in principle account for the energy lost to reproduction using multivariate analysis but then its simplicity and utility would be greatly diminished we therefore suggest that the method be used only when energy lost to reproduction does not play a crucial role or can be estimated independently our method may in some cases also be limited by the mathematical representation between structural volume and length which relies on isometric growth and the value of the shape coefficient δm while there is strong evidence that sea bream has isometric growth kraljević and dulčić 1997 chaoui et al 2006 mehanna 2007 maci et al 2009 balık and emre 2013 seginer 2016 but see can et al 2002 sangun et al 2007 akyol and gamsiz 2011 other species may diverge from the isometric growth to a significant degree thus invalidating eq 3 note that the actual value of δm does not affect the estimate of energy content because while it may cause different partitioning between structure and reserves it will by the same measure affect estimates of energy density in each partition and therefore result in the same estimate of the total energy however the value of δm is important for any and all uses that consider energy reserves separately from the structure and the value needs to be such that none of the biometries has total weight less than minimal structural weight ρ δml 3 which would imply negative energy reserves note that the true δm may be even slightly smaller than estimated here the traditional weight based estimates of energy requirements and feeding ratios in bioenergetic models for gilthead sea bream hernández et al 2003 lupatsch et al 2003a libralato and solidoro 2008 mayer et al 2012 jauralde et al 2013 may be suitable in constant environmental and feeding conditions when fish condition k does not vary significantly however this is not the case in variable environmental conditions experienced by fish in nature and aquaculture when reared in temperate climate ibarz et al 2010 cardinal et al 2011 faggio et al 2014 in such cases the traditional models significantly underestimate required energy and therefore may lead to underfeeding in aquaculture or underestimate of prey intake in ecosystem modeling in conclusion we suggest that the gilthead sea bream model in particular and the presented method in general are significantly more accurate than the existing methods indispensably so in environmental conditions leading to variability in fish condition since minimally trained staff massé et al 2016 mangi et al 2016 and recreational fishermen venturelli et al 2017 can collect the necessary biometries new data could be accumulated cheaply on a massive scale in the short term this could lead to a much better understanding of rearing gilthead sea bream in aquaculture in the medium to long term with the application of the method to other species new insights in aquaculture and fisheries could be gained by e

24737,modeling energy content and gain of individuals is of increasing importance in ecosystem modeling especially in aquaculture and fisheries traditional models for estimating the content and gain are either imprecise or expensive in part because of intensive data requirements here we show how routine biometric data length and wet weight or condition index can be used to estimate total energy content of fish starting with theoretical partitioning between structure and reserves we create a model to relate energy to the fulton s condition index we then use data from cultured sea bream sparus aurata l to show that the model based on structure should be used to calculate energy content from biometric data validation using independent data shows remarkable ability of the model to predict energy content r 2 0 99 while comparison with previously used models demonstrates marked differences in predictions when fish condition is variable unlike traditional methods our model predicts different energy content and gain or loss for small fat and large thin fish of equal weight and can therefore give considerable additional value to biometric data commonly collected in aquaculture fisheries and related citizen science programs keywords bioenergetic model biometric data condition index energy loss gilthead sea bream sparus aurata l 1 introduction energy content and energy gain or loss of fish are important inputs to bioenergetic models which are a conventional tool in aquaculture seginer 2016 nobre et al 2019 and of increasing importance in fisheries and ecosystem modeling arrhenius et al 1996 spitz et al 2010 barnett et al 2017 bachiller et al 2018 in aquaculture the models are used to optimize feeding by estimating energy required for achieving target fish growth bureau et al 2002 the models typically estimate energy needs using only weight to describe the fish bureau et al 2002 i e without taking condition of the fish into account consequently these models predict the same energy dynamics for a long emaciated and a short fat fish of equal weights this prediction has been disputed empirically jobling 2003 bavčević et al 2010 and is also theoretically unreasonable since the two fish should have vastly different energy requirements for maintenance and growth nevertheless such models especially von bertalanffy s von bertalanffy 1957 and its modern variants e g chambers et al 2017 with the same shortcomings have been used in aquaculture fisheries and ecosystem modeling to overcome the shortcomings alternative models have been constructed broekhuizen et al 1994 gurney et al 2003 kooijman 2010 jusup et al 2017 and references therein these models share an experimentally supported idea that growth depends on both the size and the condition of fish among the models those based on the dynamic energy budget deb theory are the most comprehensive deb models have been used in more than 850 publications a large fraction of which relate to marine environments amp portal 2019 deb models as do any other that successfully disentangle size and condition distinguish structure of the fish from its energy reserves the new class of models account for environmental variability and predict energy content requirements and gain but the models are cumbersome to use consequently energy content and gain in aquaculture fisheries and ecosystem research is still estimated either by weight based models e g wuenschel et al 2006 breck 2008 van poorten and walters 2010 or by expensive chemical analysis thus despite the calls to develop and utilize inexpensive and computationally simple methods for valuation of stored energy in fish based on morphometric indices mcpherson et al 2011 much of the biometric data is chronically underutilized distinction between structure and energy reserves introduced by the new class of models enables us to develop a model for estimation of energy content from simple biometric measurements we start by using concepts from deb theory to link its two state variables structural volume and energy reserves to the most frequently reported biometric data length and condition index structural volume has already been linked to fish length using the shape coefficient δm kooijman 2010 we proceed to link energy reserves and energy reserve density to fulton s condition index k by assuming that length and therefore structural volume sensu deb theory cannot appreciably shrink then since structure as defined in deb theory cannot decrease all changes in weight for non reproducing non growing fish can be attributed to changes in energy reserves this effect has been demonstrated in bavčević et al 2010 who find that k decreases with weight during starvation and schloesser and fabrizio 2017 who find that energy per unit weight in summer flounder depends on k we use data from a mild starvation experiment and proximate analysis to establish the relationship between k and energy density use the relationship to predict total energy density and validate the model using independent data from the literature recorded at different times and or locations finally we discuss limitations of our approach and consider possible use of the new approach to improve existing fish growth models and add value to biometric data in aquaculture and fisheries new developments in biometric data acquisition in fisheries massé et al 2016 mangi et al 2016 regulation eu 2017 1004 and aquaculture puig et al 2012 churnside et al 2012 could make a rapid adoption of our method to other species possible in both fisheries and aquaculture research and management 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and sample analysis two sets of data derived respectively from a starvation experiment and a regular monitoring of gilthead sea bream cage production were used in this study both acquired at a commercial fish farm in eastern adriatic coastal waters near vrgada island croatia change of k during starvation and energy density as a function of k were calculated using a data set ds1 obtained from the experiment the isometric growth was verified using data set ds2 collected from a regular monitoring program at a commercial sea bream farm 2 1 1 ds1 change of k and correlation between energy density and k obtaining relationship between k l and energy content required data from fish of a reasonably wide range of k and l since k does not appreciably vary between fish in aquaculture we conducted a starvation experiment to gather the data a total of 800 gilthead sea bream were collected from four offshore net cages in different stages of the production cycle fish from a single cage formed one group representing a total of four distinct size weight groups a 30 5 cm 1 1 cm sd 359 1 g 38 8 g sd b 27 3 cm 2 0 cm sd 319 3 g 82 2 g sd c 21 7 cm 0 9 cm sd 157 1 g 21 7 g sd and d 13 4 cm 1 1 cm sd 35 4 g 8 7 g sd fish of each group were randomly separated into two replicates and each replicate of approximately 100 fish total n 800 was held in a separate 8 m3 cages for 117 days 40 days of feeding to satiation 77 days of starvation in each cage 50 fish were tagged with micro chips total n 400 to follow the change of k during starvation whereas the remained untagged fish were sampled to estimate relationship between k and energy density temperature and dissolved oxygen were measured daily at the depth of 1 m temperature varied from 21 8 c at the beginning to 18 7 c at the end of the experiment and the saturation of dissolved oxygen was in range of 92 to 105 throughout the experiment fish were first fed to satiation with commercial feed for sea bream protein 46 fats and oil 16 fiber 3 ash 6 3 digestible energy 16 6 mj kg for 40 days to maximize energy reserves and k and then starved for 77 days the first sampling was done at day two of starvation to allow for most of undigested matter to clear the gut total length l and wet weight ww of tagged fish from each cage total n 400 were measured at days 2 9 16 23 30 and 77 of starvation with precisions of 1 mm and 1 g respectively fulton s condition factor k was calculated as 1 k w w l 3 100 we used proximate analysis to estimate total energy of fish even though bomb calorimetry might have been more accurate breck 2014 nobre et al 2019 this has been done to increase number of samples and more importantly to enable validation as there were no adequate bomb calorimetry data available in the literature for comparison differences in estimates between the two methods result from a bias in estimates of energy content of body components chiefly fat johnson et al 2017 to minimize the bias we used bomb callorimetry calibrated energy values for sea bream from lupatsch et al 2003a any remaining bias in our work applies to all fish equally and therefore does not affect correlations to determine correlation between energy density and k four untagged fish from each group were also collected at days 2 9 16 23 30 and 77 of starvation total n 96 these fish were checked for gonad maturity and k was calculated from their l and ww thereafter sampled fish were minced in pairs and frozen for whole body proximate analysis of composite samples total n 48 during the experiment no gonad development was observed proximate composition of sampled fish was determined following standard aoac procedures 1995 briefly lipids were extracted by the procedure of folch et al 1957 and the total lipid content was gravimetrically determined after solvent evaporation protein content was determined using the kjeldahl method and multiplying the total nitrogen content by the factor 6 25 to measure whole body water content a specimen from minced fish was oven dried at 105 c until weight remained constant and reweighed for the ash content determination 1 g homogenate sample was separately combusted in a muffle furnace until weight remained constant the experiment adhered to applicable guidelines and standards for the ethical use of animals in research as well as all applicable laws and regulations to avoid injury experimental protocol mandated termination of the experiment when fish reached a condition index of k 1 2 the minimum k in the experiment was 1 17 since condition indices k 1 have been observed eisawy and wassef 1984 no fish were severely starved and consequently no mortalities occurred at the end of the experiment tagged fish were euthanized in ice slurry as in blessing et al 2010 and remaining fish were slowly fed and returned to the production 2 1 2 ds2 testing for isometric growth weight length relationships of gilthead sea bream were estimated using biometric data l and ww of 340 fish ranging from 7 7 g to 681 g the data were obtained from biometries conducted during regular farming activities over a single month at a commercial sea bream farm near vrgada island croatia fish were fed with commercial feed as indicated above ds1 correlation between energy density and k average temperature during sampling was 22 3 c 2 2 calculation and data analysis calculation and data analysis had seven steps 1 ds1 was used to calculate energy content of the fish 2 structural volume was obtained by calculating the shape coefficient from literature data 3 energy density was calculated i from the ratio of energy content and structural volume and ii from the energy content and wet weight of fish 4 the assumption of isometric growth was checked using ds2 5 k was interpreted as a measure of energy density 6 the relationship between energy content and gain was estimated from length and k 7 the relationship was validated by comparing predictions to observations from independent data sets additionally energy change in fish predicted by our method has been compared to predictions by standard methods lupatsch et al 2003b libralato and solidoro 2008 2 2 1 calculating energy content of the fish from proximate analysis total energy content et of proximate analyzed fish from ds1 was estimated as the sum of main sources of energy in fish proteins and fats protein and fat content determined by the proximate composition analysis were multiplied by the total weight of the fish and average energetic values of proteins and fats calibrated by bomb calorimetry lupatsch et al 2003a 23 1 kj g protein and 35 8 kj g fat 2 e t w w p r o t e i n c o n t e n t 23 1 k j g 1 w w f a t c o n t e n t 35 8 k j g 1 where ww is wet weight of fish in grams while protein content and fat content are respective ratios of weight of protein and fat to ww 2 2 2 calculating the shape coefficient we adopt partitioning of the organism from the deb theory into i energy reserves which are used to fuel metabolic processes without requiring maintenance and ii structure which utilizes energy for growth maintenance and other metabolic work deb assumes that structure and reserves each separately have a constant composition however since the ratio of the two can change so can the total composition of the fish kooijman 2010 the structural size of an organism is represented by structural volume vs which relates to a cube of the body length of the fish l through a dimensionless shape coefficient δm kooijman 2010 3 v s δ m l 3 by definition in a starved non reproductive organism with almost completely depleted reserves only structure i e somatic tissue remains then i k is minimal k kmin and ii the wet weight of the fish ww should be equal to the weight of the structure ws assuming ρ 1 g cm 3 is the average density of somatic tissue van der veer et al 2001 then ww ws ρvs inserting ρvs into eq 1 and using 3 to solve for δm gives 4 δ m 3 k min 100 we estimated kmin from eisawy and wassef 1984 who report the lowest k we could find in literature to avoid underestimating kmin due to individual variability or extreme starvation when even structural tissue is metabolised we averaged the smallest 10 of values of k to estimate kmin 1 2 i e δm 0 229 2 2 3 estimating energy density eds the estimated δm was used to calculate vs from length of each proximate analyzed fish using eq 3 assuming vs represents the structural volume the energy density relative to structural volume i e amount of energy per unit volume of structure eds could be calculated from total energy et of each proximate analyzed specimen square brackets denote densities 5 e d s e t v s for comparison we also calculated energy density edw relative to wet weight ww of the same fish using a common approach as in lawson et al 1998 pangle and sutton 2005 schloesser and fabrizio 2017 6 e d w e t w w 2 2 4 verifying assumption of isometric growth growth type was determined by fitting parameters of the allometric equation ricker 1975 7 w w a l b using nonlinear least squares regression the correlation between wet weight ww and length l of 340 fish data from ds2 was verified using the determination coefficient r2 the 95 confidence intervals of parameter b were estimated and t test h0 b 3 α 0 01 was applied to test whether the value of parameter b statistically differs from isometric growth b 3 sokal and rohlf 1981 2 2 5 using k as a measure of energy density structure as defined in the deb theory is assumed to have constant energy during starvation gurney et al 2003 kooijman 2010 hence changes of energy density should only be the consequence of reserve depletion in addition any changes in energy reserves affect indicators of energetic status such as k therefore k should relate to both structural volume specific energy density eds and weight specific energy density edw we tested whether k is a good measure of energy density using ds1 to calculate linear regressions of eds and edw obtained from the proximate analysis to k obtained from biometries of the same fish hence two linear regression equations were fitted with k as the independent variable one with eds and the other with edw as the dependent variable high coefficient of correlation would indicate that k is a good proxy for energy density 2 2 6 estimating energy content and energy gain of fish the total energy content of the fish at i th measurement is equal to the product of energy density eds i and the estimated structural volume vsi 8 e t i e d s i v s i eq 8 is used to estimate change of energy content of tagged fish n 400 ds1 during starvation equivalent equation could have been used to estimate total energy from edw change in total energy content of the fish is equal to the difference between energy at the start and at the end of the particular period accordingly eq 8 can be used to calculate energy gain or loss the energy gain as fish grows from vsi to vs i 1 is then equal to 9 e g a i n e t i 1 e t i eq 9 can be used to predict energy gain from changes in length and condition of the fish we compared our predictions of energy gain for an illustrative set of l and k to predictions based on methods from lupatsch et al 2003b and libralato and solidoro 2008 2 2 7 validating the energy content estimation we validated our method of total energy prediction eq 8 by comparing predicted and observed total energy et of gilthead sea bream data used for validation were collected from four articles representing different locations breeding stock and periods deguara et al 1999 bavčević et al 2007 bonaldo et al 2010 and mongile et al 2014 observed weight and proximate analysis were used to calculate the observed energy content using eq 2 predicted et was then estimated in three steps first vs was estimated from observed length using eq 3 second eds was predicted from estimated vs and measured k using eq 11 third et was predicted from the definition of energy density eq 8 the observations and predictions were then compared statistically four data sets were used data of deguara et al 1999 represent composite samples n 105 ranging in mean fish weight from 72 05 g to 98 8 g data of bavčević et al 2007 represent composite samples n 140 ranging in mean fish weight from 157 95 g to 193 72 g data of bonaldo et al 2010 represent composite samples n 140 ranging in mean fish weight from 218 g to 238 8 g data of mongile et al 2014 represent composite samples n 150 ranging in mean fish weight from 289 8 g to 303 9 g these independent data sets therefore range from 72 05 g to 303 9 g covering a large fraction of the size range relevant to aquaculture 2 3 statistical analysis relationship between k and either eds or edw was examined by pearson linear regression results from the first starvation experiment ds1 are presented as the mean standard error of the mean sem statistical differences among fish groups were analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova and where appropriate by a post hoc tukey s test at a significance level of p 0 05 to validate our method for calculation of total energy we applied a linear regression to the predicted and observed values of et that were calculated as described in the

confirmed by a t test in which the obtained value of b did not significantly differ p 0 01 from the isometric value of 3 therefore the growth can be assumed to be isometric for farmed fish of the tested size range and δm can be calculated the estimated shape coefficient of δm 0 229 is slightly smaller than the one estimated by serpa et al 2013 because our estimate does not include appreciable energy reserves while that by serpa et al 2013 does since the fish we used to estimate δm was live wild caught and therefore not completely exhausted even our estimate contains a small contribution of reserves and therefore represents an upper boundary of the estimate for δm sensu deb theory i e the true δm is likely to be slightly smaller 3 2 k can be used as a measure of structural volume specific energy density linear regression of eds and edw as functions of k using ds1 fig 1 gives a strong correlation between eds and k and moderate correlation between edw and k 11 e d s 14 244 k 9

estimate of eds than of edw consequently we used eds and eq 8 in further analysis tagged fish from the first experiment ds1 were used to monitor change of k during starvation although all size classes were fed to satiation before the experiment significantly different anova p 0 05 initial values of k were recorded between the groups fig 2 panel a during the experiment k gradually declined for all fish groups consequently change of total energy et during starvation experiment fig 2 panel b calculated by eq 8 also gradually declined for all fish groups the differences between final values of k were not significant between groups a b and c but group d remained different 3 3 validating the method to calculate energy content from length and k fig 3 presents plot of the observed total energy versus predicted total energy calculated according to methods from the section validation of the energy content estimation the predicted and observed data were highly correlated r2 0 99 and the student t test cannot reject the hypothesis that the data points come from the same distribution p 0 74 this indicates that et can successfully be calculated using eds estimated from k thus validating the model 3 4 using k to calculate energy gain of fish finally in table 1 we combine 3 and 11 to demonstrate how k can be used to estimate energy change in gilthead sea bream during growth energy gain from time t 1 to time t 2 is equal to the difference in energy contents between these two times combining expression 9 with the expression for eds eq 11 and the estimate of the shape coefficient δm 0

time ti respectively table 1 compares predictions of our method to those of lupatsch et al 2003b and libralato and solidoro 2008 using four illustrative scenarios at 21 8 c see also table 1 1 growth from l 1 21 cm to l 2 23 cm k constant at 1 7 2 growth from l 1 21 cm to l 2 23 cm k increases from k 1 1 5 to k 2 1 7 3 growth from l 1 15 cm to l 2 23 cm k constant at 1 7 4 growth from l 1 15 cm to l 2 23 cm k increases from k 1 1 5 to k 2 1 7 when k is constant during fish growth lupatsch et al 2003b predicts a much higher energy gain than libralato and solidoro 2008 but our method predicts still higher energy gain when fish grow in length and their k simultaneously increases unlike our model both methods from the literature greatly underestimate the energy gain egain table 1 4 discussion we adopted concepts of structure and energy reserves from advanced bioenergetic models primarily deb to develop a straightforward method for estimating energy content and gain of fish from simple biometric data length and weight or condition index the method was used to parametrize a model for gilthead sea bream an economically important species in mediterranean the method is however general and be used for any fish species that has isometric growth and the necessary data to relate energy content to k for a range of sizes the generality of the method is inherited from the basics of deb theory as described in kooijman 2010 which has been applied to more than 2200 species from all genera plants being a notable exception amp database of models accessed on 13 8 2020 at https www bio vu nl thb deb deblab add my pet about html since deb state variables typically represent or can be converted into energy jusup et al 2017 total energy content could be calculated from deb state variables directly however mapping from weight to state variables is not unique see e g eq 2 in nisbet et al 2012 hence the ode based deb model has to be solved explicitly with the additional complication of having to correctly estimate parameters in eq 2 by nisbet et al 2012 our method adopts basic concepts of energy reserves and structural volume and reduces the problem to calculation of coefficients in the weighted sum of energy between structure and reserves where condition index serves as a proxy for energy density the model is therefore as general as the idea that the condition index captures energetic status i e fatness of organisms we first quantified benefits of our approach by comparing its results based on k and eds eq 11 to the traditional approach of considering weight alone edw eq 12 our approach yields r2 0 81 while the traditional approach yields r2 0 45 thus clearly performing considerably better the improvement is due to the separation of structure and reserves when fish length does not change e g during prolonged starvation the structural volume remains constant kooijman 2010 then any change in total weight is solely due to the change of the weight of the reserves affecting k as a consequence therefore k and ww are interdependent variables and their cross interaction is fully expressed when as total weight changes the energy content of the fish is divided by the weight at any given time therefore the ratio of edw and k is noticeably affected only if the change in total energy of fish with constant length is comparatively large and of significant difference in quality amount of energy per weight conversely since eds is divided by unchanged structural volume change in eds reflects changes in both quantity and quality of energy therefore the eq 11 describing the correlation of eds with k provides more information and is better suited for further applications than the eq 12 for edw next we quantified differences in predictions between ours and commonly used methods of estimating energy gain lupatsch et al 2003b libralato and solidoro 2008 table 1 presents energy gains according to the three methods for four hypothetical but likely scenarios when k is constant case 1 and 3 in table 1 our method agrees well with the estimates calculated using method described by lupatsch et al 2003b while libralato and solidoro 2008 give a lower estimate when k increases during growth case 2 and case 4 in table 1 our method predicts the highest energy gain because it accounts for changes in energy density due to increase in k we hypothesize that increase in weight due to increase in k requires more energy than increase in weight due to growth in length because increase in k represent disproportionate increase in energy reserves which typically contains more energy per unit weight than the structure the large differences in scenarios where k changes case 2 and 4 can only be attributed to the processes captured by our method i e the inclusion of energy reserve dynamics hence our model is to the best of our knowledge the only one that simply and directly translates sea bream biometric data into energy content and gain while differentiating between small obese and large emaciated fish the validation fig 3 is highly suggestive of the validity of our model the slope of predicted vs observed values of 0 98 is very close to 1 and correlation between predicted and observed data is extremely high r2 0 99 the intercept of the regression line 27 kj fish is indicative of a possible minimal bias in our method or the data used for validation if there indeed is a bias its influence reduces with fish size to less than 0 7 for sea bream of 500 g expectedly the energy content and k were declining during starvation fig 2 the asymptotic nature of the decline suggests lower rate of tissue and energy loss in later periods of starvation this is consistent with observations by hepher et al 1983 and lupatsch et al 2003a the most important limitation of our method and the resulting model for sea bream is that neither energy stored in fish eggs nor energy required to produce them is accounted for the limitation does not present a problem in aquaculture as reproduction tends to be minimized or completely avoided by harvesting before reproduction but may prove to be important for other applications our method could in principle account for the energy lost to reproduction using multivariate analysis but then its simplicity and utility would be greatly diminished we therefore suggest that the method be used only when energy lost to reproduction does not play a crucial role or can be estimated independently our method may in some cases also be limited by the mathematical representation between structural volume and length which relies on isometric growth and the value of the shape coefficient δm while there is strong evidence that sea bream has isometric growth kraljević and dulčić 1997 chaoui et al 2006 mehanna 2007 maci et al 2009 balık and emre 2013 seginer 2016 but see can et al 2002 sangun et al 2007 akyol and gamsiz 2011 other species may diverge from the isometric growth to a significant degree thus invalidating eq 3 note that the actual value of δm does not affect the estimate of energy content because while it may cause different partitioning between structure and reserves it will by the same measure affect estimates of energy density in each partition and therefore result in the same estimate of the total energy however the value of δm is important for any and all uses that consider energy reserves separately from the structure and the value needs to be such that none of the biometries has total weight less than minimal structural weight ρ δml 3 which would imply negative energy reserves note that the true δm may be even slightly smaller than estimated here the traditional weight based estimates of energy requirements and feeding ratios in bioenergetic models for gilthead sea bream hernández et al 2003 lupatsch et al 2003a libralato and solidoro 2008 mayer et al 2012 jauralde et al 2013 may be suitable in constant environmental and feeding conditions when fish condition k does not vary significantly however this is not the case in variable environmental conditions experienced by fish in nature and aquaculture when reared in temperate climate ibarz et al 2010 cardinal et al 2011 faggio et al 2014 in such cases the traditional models significantly underestimate required energy and therefore may lead to underfeeding in aquaculture or underestimate of prey intake in ecosystem modeling in conclusion we suggest that the gilthead sea bream model in particular and the presented method in general are significantly more accurate than the existing methods indispensably so in environmental conditions leading to variability in fish condition since minimally trained staff massé et al 2016 mangi et al 2016 and recreational fishermen venturelli et al 2017 can collect the necessary biometries new data could be accumulated cheaply on a massive scale in the short term this could lead to a much better understanding of rearing gilthead sea bream in aquaculture in the medium to long term with the application of the method to other species new insights in aquaculture and fisheries could be gained by e g looking at seasonal variability in energy content of fish and how energy content of fish from different niches and positions in the food web e g predator vs prey cross relate data availability

24738,among the models used to describe insect pest populations the distributed delay model has been applied in several case studies in recent years its success is due mainly to its simplicity and its versatility to be easily included in software to calculate numerical solutions in its original formulation the distributed delay model provides as a solution the distribution of the insects maturation flow then this is compared with monitoring in field applications a different form of the model can be obtained with the same assumptions to describe the distribution of the number of individuals which are in a specific life stage at time t the first aim of this work was to show the mathematical details in order to obtain the second form of the distributed delay model and to calculate its analytical solutions the second aim was to analyse the model s behaviour in describing insect pest s population in varying environmental conditions specifically in terms of temperature to pursue this second aim two case studies of noteworthy relevance in agriculture were considered the pepper weevil anthonomus eugenii and the european grapevine moth lobesia botrana for each case study field populations were simulated with both the distributed delay model versions and the results were compared to determine the most appropriate model for application in the case of insect pest populations both the case studies highlighted that the novel formulation presented in this work significantly improves simulation providing a more reliable representation of field data keywords growth models crop protection physiological age integrated pest management age structured models 1 introduction modelling insect pest populations has been an interest of agricultural researchers for a long time getz and gutierrez 1982 gilioli et al 2016 the primary reason to delve into and improve this argument is for the more effective use of these models as decision support systems dss in crop protection besides their support in the comprehension of the biological mechanisms orlandini et al 2018 predictions have a key role to play in integrated pest management ipm because they allow one to forecast pest outbreaks bellocchi et al 2011 pertot et al 2017 accordingly a projection of the insect pest population dynamics provides i a scenario of the risk of economic losses han et al 2019 and ii time to formulate the most efficient control strategy amo salas et al 2011 in agriculture several population dynamics models have been introduced in pursuit of this aim cappio borlino et al 1991 plant and mangel 1987 rebaudo and rabhi 2018 strona et al 2020 2018 to date the most appropriate models to describe insect populations are physiologically based models gilioli et al 2016 these models have the capacity to describe ectotherm populations considering the relationship between species growth and external environment gilbert et al 2004 a pioneering physiologically based model is the distributed delay model ddm introduced for the first time by manetsch 1976 and revised the subsequent year by vansickle 1977 the ddm in fact provided the possibility of linking external sub models usually defined as phenological models describing the relationship between species and environment quinn 2017 for the first time hence with the ddm phenological and population dynamics models were first considered as a unique block schaalje and van der vaart 1989 the ddm represents a valuable candidate to describe ectotherms life cycle typically in fields with homogeneous microclimatic conditions or controlled environments such as greenhouses under the aforementioned hypotheses the whole environment may be represented with a single point where ectotherm populations develop and this is the implicit assumption of all the applications of ddm available in literature in addition the recent implementations in gis systems combined with remote sensing is overcoming the issue of the spatialization in areas where the aforementioned assumptions are not respected as showed by gutierrez et al 2017 2012 the innovative idea behind the ddm was the possibility of representing an insect life cycle or part of it if there is a particular stage of interest as a series of non observable chained stages severini et al 1990 usually considered as the degree of delay or degree of stochasticity of the model limonta et al 2009 as a solution the ddm provides a distribution of the insects maturation flows gutierrez et al 1984 severini et al 1990 representing in other words the flow of individuals that complete their life cycle however the hypotheses behind its formulation manetsch 1976 vansickle 1977 allow to obtain a second mathematical form which at difference of the classical ddm provides as solution the count of individuals belonging to the last stage of their life cycle this second mathematical form was never tested but it is more similar from a conceptual point of view to the modern physiologically based models considering systems of ordinary differential equations di cola et al 1989 nance et al 2018 or partial differential equations ainseba and sebastian 2001 bellagamba et al 1987 gilbert et al 2004 gilioli et al 2016 he and ainseba 2014 pasquali et al 2019 rossini et al 2020b 2019a these models in fact describe the temporal variation of population s individuals and not their maturation flows a wide range of works highlight the reliability of the classical ddm in describing ectotherms such as plants and insects for example cotton gossypium hirsutum l cultivations were modelled by gutierrez and pizzamiglio 1984 then gutierrez et al 1984 successfully extended the study to bean tomatoes and cassava cultivations some years later severini et al 1990 used the ddm to describe the development of apricot flowers a slightly different application of the ddm in plant modelling was provided by wermelinger et al 1991 in this case the ddm was used to describe the allocation of carbon and nitrogen in grapevines dividing the single plant into sub populations of leaves shoots roots and fruits alongside plant modelling other successful applications of the ddm concern insect pest populations the case study of the european grapevine moth lobesia botrana denis schiffermüller was considered by severini et al 2005 and by gutierrez et al 2012 with successful results in particular the first work describes l botrana populations validating the model with field data while in the second work the ddm was used to predict european grapevine moth s populations in a climate change scenario other relevant applications are discussed by schaub et al 2017 with regard to the european corn borer ostrinia nubilalis hübner by limonta et al 2009 with regard to the rice moth corcyra cephalonica stainton and by baumgärtner and severini 1987 with regard to the case of phyllonorycter blancardella fabricius moreover allen and byrd 2000 extended the applicability of the ddm to forensic entomology the applications listed above compare experimental and simulated maturation flows of insect pest populations besides applications in agricultural and environmental sciences the ddm was employed also for flow forecasting by spolia et al 1980 and included in a sirns model to represent the spread of infectious diseases by jensen et al 2019 however from an experimental point of view it is difficult to directly measure the maturation flows or in other words the exact moment of life stage transitions during experimentations researchers usually count the number of individuals in each life stage by direct samplings or using monitoring traps at this point one may wonder if a novel mathematical form of ddm describing the count of individuals into the life stages and demonstrated starting from the same assumptions of the classical one is more suitable to represent ectotherm populations this question is reasonable since to date the ddm is still applied in simulating insect pest populations as some recent works show asplen et al 2015 gutierrez et al 2017 2012 the aim of this work hence is to show how to obtain the novel form of the ddm which describes the temporal variation of the number of individuals into each stage instead of the temporal variation of the maturation flows after the mathematical description a comparison between the two versions of the ddm was conducted investigating which of the two is the better and more effective form for entomological applications in this regard two applications were compared the case study of the european grapevine moth lobesia botrana and the case study of the pepper weevil anthonomus eugenii cano data about these insects population were retrieved from two already published works rossini et al 2020c 2020a this data was selected to investigate the behaviour of the two ddm versions in cases of different species and different development environments a eugenii populations were monitored in an experimental greenhouse while l botrana was monitored in open field conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 distributed delay model considering the scheme showed in fig 1 an ectotherm s life cycle can be represented with a series of h chained substages each ith substage is characterized by an entering flow of individuals denoted with r i 1 t an exit flow of matured individuals ri t and by a flux of dead mi t an additional function qi t describes the temporal variation of the individuals into the stage as reported by manetsch 1976 and vansickle 1977 a mathematical description of each substage consists in three equations the first one 1 is a balance equation which links the variation of the individuals into each substage with the entering and exit flows while the second 2 and the third 3 ones define the flows ri t and mi t in formulas 1 d d t q i t r i 1 t r i t m i t 2 r i t h d t q i t 3 m i t a r t q i t d t and h in the eq 2 represent the expected emergence time of the whole population and the number of substages respectively ar t in expression 3 is the mortality function according to the formulation of vansickle 1977 2 1 1 classical formulation ri t manetsch 1976 and vansickle 1977 obtained the generic ddm equation written with ri t variables substituting the expression 2 and 3 into the eq 1 4 d d t r i t h d t r i 1 t r i t 1 a r t d t h d d t d t h the scheme presented in fig 1 assumes that it is possible to represent a single observable stage or the whole life cycle just varying the number of the equations h of the system this is one of the major criticalities in applying the ddm since h itself is one of the unknown of the problem however even if there is not a direct correspondence between the observable life stages and the chained boxes described in fig 1 there are two possible ways to apply the ddm the first possibility is to consider a system of chained ddms where each system of equations represents a single observable stage gutierrez and baumgärtner 1984 the second possibility is to consider the whole life cycle as a single stage described by a single system of ddm equations at first sight the first proposal seems to be more realistic in representing the real situation but at the same time provides for the estimation of h for each system involved moreover it is more expensive from a computational point of view besides a more complicated validation the second possibility instead provokes loss of biological information but at the same time it is easier to manage and apply it is a good compromise when there is an interest in modelling only a particular life stage this second representation has been chosen for the case studies considered in the present work a common condition to both the aforementioned ways to apply the ddm is that although may not be a direct correspondence between observable and non observable stages alongside the life cycle represented surely the first and the last substage of the process in fig 1 can be directly associated with observable stages for the purpose of this work hence the first substage represents the cohort of eggs entering within the process while the last substage are the adults the hypotheses discussed above were maintained for both the classical ddm version 4 and the novel one that we are going to introduce in the following section 2 1 2 novel formulation qi t the qi t version of eq 4 can be obtained following an analogous logic scheme with a direct substitution of the expressions 2 and 3 expression 1 becomes 5 d d t q i t r i 1 t h d t q i t a r t q i t now let us consider a transformation of the term r i 1 t in the eq 5 with reference to fig 1 it is possible to say that each substage with i 1 can be described with their specific eqs 1 3 this means that even for the substage i 1 a triad of equations similar to the eqs 1 3 will exist rossini 2016 more specifically the r i 1 t term can be obtained considering the equivalent of the expression 2 referred to the substage i 1 6 r i 1 t h d t q i 1 t substituting the expression 6 into the eq 5 the qi t version of ddm is obtained 7 d d t q i t h d t q i 1 t q i t 1 d t h a r t the complete system finally is 8 d d t q 1 t h d t q 0 t q 1 t 1 d t h a r t d d t q 2 t h d t q 1 t q 2 t 1 d t h a r t d d t q h t h d t q h 1 t q h t 1 d t h a r t system 8 represents the main mathematical results of this work written in its most general form in the next sections aspects related to analytical and numerical solutions will be treated before a direct application to the cited case studies in fact the primary question of this paper now revolves around which ddm version is more appropriate for field applications and whether there are particular cases where no differences between the two models can be identified 2 2 analytical solutions 2 2 1 classical formulation ri t concerning the ri t version the classical one several works have faced this problem severini et al 1990 a particular case without mortality and with constant d t term was considered by manetsch 1976 while vansickle 1977 extended the calculation considering a more general case with constant mortality both cases lead to an analytical solution found through the use of laplace transform assuming that r 0 t the input function in the system is represented by a dirac delta function namely r 0 t δ t the analytical solution assuming the hypotheses described is the erlang probability density function erlang pdf 9 r h t h d h t h 1 h 1 exp a r h d t this special case means that in the general equation of the ri t version the eq 4 the term d d t d t h is equal to zero since the function d t is assumed to be a constant 2 2 2 novel formulation qi t it is the task of this section to show that with the same assumptions it is possible to find an analytical solution for the system 8 namely the qi t version of the ddm again through the use of laplace transform rossini 2016 it is possible to convert the system 8 into an algebraic system 10 l q 1 t h d 1 s h d ar l q 2 t h d 1 s h d ar l q 1 t l q h t h d 1 s h d ar l q h 1 t system 10 is solvable with a series of chained substitutions which lead to the following expression 11 l q h t h d h 1 s h d a r h now applying the inverse of the laplace transform to eq 11 it can be demonstrated that the solution of the qi t version of the ddm is again the erlang pdf if and only if the input function q 0 t δ t and d t and ar t are assumed to be constant 12 q h t h d h t h 1 h 1 exp a r h d t moreover the expression 11 can also be obtained considering that in the frequency domain the transfer function of the system is 13 q h s q 0 s h d h 1 s h d a r h where l q h t q h s and l δ t q 0 s the main result to be taken from this section concerns the similarity between the two versions of the ddm in particular conditions represented by the assumptions formulated at the beginning of the calculation they provide the same solution hence it is possible to assess that when the ddm is used in conditions of constant temperature namely with constant d t severini et al 1990 and with a constant mortality term there is no clear preference between the two versions of the model however this situation is not verified in the most general case where a numerical solution is needed to solve both the ddm versions in this case a comparison of the model response is required directly applying both ddm versions to the case studies 2 3 development rate functions biological parameters which clearly identify the species represented can be introduced in the ddm models through development rate functions in fact the mean development time d t included in the system 8 and in its related ri t version is connected to environmental parameters temperature in particular through the following mathematical relation damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 14 g t i 1 d t i the expression 14 connects the mean development time d ti related to a particular temperature to its corresponding development rate g ti moreover it is implicitly intended that there is time dependence in d ti and g ti in varying temperature conditions accordingly writing the mean development time as d t it usually means d t t before discussing the development rate expressions involved in the present work it is helpful to point out the meaning of constant temperature from the point of view of the ddm as detailed in the previous section one of the assumptions needed to calculate analytical solutions for both the ddm versions requires d t as time invariant expression 14 directly connects the mean development time with the daily average temperature a physical dimension subject to changes in the natural environment accordingly it is possible to consider d t as time invariant only in conditions of controlled temperature as for instance in a climatic chamber hence the application of the ddm in varying temperature environments implies a usage of the models in their general form requiring numerical solutions the literature concerning development rate functions has been enriched over the years and several authors have proposed expressions to connect insects stage duration with the temperature reviews on this argument were presented by damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 and ikemoto and kiritani 2019 these functions are formulated both on empirical and physical bases but a common feature between the various proposals is the need to estimate parameters with experimental data to pursue the aim of this work the logan and briére expressions will be considered mathematically speaking the logan expression logan et al 1976 is represented by the following formula 15 g t t ψ exp ρ t t exp ρ t m t m t t δ t where tm is the lower temperature threshold for insects growth δt is the temperature range between the maximum of the function and tm ψ and ρ are empirical parameters the briére development rate function briere et al 1999 instead is mathematically described as follows 16 g t t a t t t t t l t m t t 1 m with tl and tm being the lower and upper temperature thresholds and a and m empirical parameters the introduction of the development rate function completes the meaning of the ddm in fact in the light of the methodology presented in this section the general version of the system 8 and its corresponding classical version ri t can be rewritten as follows 17 d dt q 1 t h g t t q 0 t q 1 t 1 h g t t ar t d dt q 2 t h g t t q 1 t q 2 t 1 h g t t ar t d dt q h t h g t t q h 1 t q h t 1 h g t t ar t g t t in system 17 can be substituted with the expression 15 or 16 on the basis of the specific case study moreover the experimental data used to estimate the development rate function parameters defined as life tables in the entomological jargon harcourt 1969 contributes to choose the way of application of the ddm discussed in section 2 1 1 in fact if data about the average development time at different constant temperatures are provided for all the observable stages then it is possible to estimate the parameter of development rate function for each observable stage in this case a series of chained ddms is applicable on the other hand if data allow the estimation of a single development rate function for the whole life cycle egg adult the ddm application should be oriented towards a single ddm the species considered in this study lie in this latter case analysing the system 17 in greater depth it can be noted that there is no possibility to solve it analytically in the most general case in fact despite expressions 15 and 16 can be manageable from a mathematical point of view they contain the unknown function t t which in line of principle describes the variation of the daily average temperature this physical dimension can be measured directly with meteorological stations or data loggers and predicted for a few days after however there is not an analytical function which describes its trend throughout the year rossini et al 2020c 2019a for this purpose a numerical solution is required for the system 17 and for its analogous classical version ri t 2 4 numerical solutions of both the ddm versions the issues described in the previous section lead to the use of numerical algorithms to find solutions of both ddm versions before their application in case studies the simplest way to implement the systems in a calculation software is the application of the euler s finite difference scheme to each equation of 17 concerning the classical version ri t a numerical scheme of this type was provided by manetsch 1976 vansickle 1977 and alilla et al 2005 therefore in order to not distract the attention of the reader only a discrete version of system 17 will be discussed let us focus on the generic equation of the system 17 18 d d t q i t h g t t q i 1 t q i t 1 h g t t a r t the time variable t can be approximated with a sequence of values tn with the condition t n t n 1 rossini et al 2019a hence defining the discrete time step j t n 1 t n it is possible to apply the finite difference scheme to the eq 18 to distinguish the continuous variables from their discrete versions a change of notation will be adopted q i j g tj arj in the light of the assumptions discussed each equation of the system 17 can be transformed as follows 19 q i j 1 j h g t j q i 1 j q i j 1 j h g t j j a r j this numerical scheme and its respective r i j version were implemented in a specialised software detailed in the works of rossini et al 2019b 2020c this was used to carry out all the operations required to pursue the aims of this paper the last issue before the application of the numerical scheme 19 and of its corresponding classical version concerns the number of equations of the system namely h as stated in section 2 1 1 h represents one of the unknown of the problem needing field data for its estimation the ddm applications listed in the introduction of the present study usually assign a defined value to h but the reasons behind are often difficult to understand hence to overcome the problem a methodology was proposed by rossini et al 2019b 2020d their proposal was to solve a high number of eq 19 considering the h value such that the convergence of the numerical scheme is ensured then since the first and the last stages of the scheme in fig 1 are overlapped to the first and the last observable life stage it is possible to compare each numerical solution with field data in order to find which is the last equation of the system this comparison can be evaluated with the same χ 2 function 20 2 5 comparison between the ddm versions after the model description and discretization a methodology is needed to compare the results with field data in particular for each case study considered in the present work it is necessary to determine which ddm version is more appropriate for accurately representing the field data a methodology to compare simulation outputs and field data was discussed by rossini et al 2020a 2020c on the basis of considerations introduced by ikemoto and kiritani 2019 and mirhosseini et al 2017 the reliability of a simulation can be evaluated considering the χ 2 function with the meaning of indicator of the distance between n field data oi and simulations ei 20 χ 2 i 1 n o i e i 2 e i the coefficient of determination r 2 which provides an estimation of the reliability of the simulation in representing field data 21 r 2 1 i 1 n o i e i 2 i 1 n o i e i 2 coherently with the expression 20 oi in this case indicates the observed data and ei simulations according to this methodology defined as a posteriori analysis rossini et al 2020a the ddm version which provides the lower χ 2 value and an r 2 nearest to 1 is the most reliable to describe field data 2 6 case studies anthonomus eugenii cano and lobesia botrana denis schiffermüller 2 6 1 greenhouse scenario a eugenii the first comparison between the two ddm versions concerns the semi field case of the pepper weevil a eugenii in fact a semi controlled environment is fundamental to understand the response of the models because of the ability to manage factors affecting population development such as natural enemies or other source of stresses during the 2014 growing season a pepper weevil population was sampled in a greenhouse located in fondi lazio region italy these data have been published in the work of rossini et al 2020a to validate a different physiologically based model despite the data acquisition and the experimental scheme being well detailed in the cited literature it is opportune to mark in the present article some additionally fundamental information the a eugenii population was assessed using chromothropic sticky traps deployed along the diagonal of the greenhouse these were checked on a weekly basis an uncertainty of 3 5 days half of the time between two inspections was assumed for the experimental population moreover during the monitoring period the daily average temperature was recorded at a meteorological station these temperature data were then included in the calculation to estimate through the development rate function the corresponding value to insert in the discretized version of the system 17 and into its corresponding ri t version data about the biology and the different response to the external temperature were instead provided by toapanta et al 2005 and were fundamental to estimate the development rate function parameters since the work of rossini et al 2020a shows a better response of the logan function 15 in representing life tables this choice will be maintained for the application of the ddm in the first part of the experimentation the greenhouse was left open to promote the natural infestation by pepper weevil adults once ascertained the presence of the insect the greenhouse was isolated from the external environment with an anti aphid net the day of the greenhouse isolation was considered as day zero for simulations 20th of october assuming that the initial cohort of eggs was laid in that moment 2 6 2 open field scenario l botrana the second case study selected for this work concerns another insect pest of significant importance within agriculture specifically in grape production the european grapevine moth l botrana also in this case the choice was made to use data published in the work of rossini et al 2020c related to a three year survey 2014 2015 and 2016 seasons conducted in an experimental vineyard located in castelli romani area lazio region italy the investigation provided the three yearly generations which are usually reported in the area and for the three growing seasons surveyed adults were caught with pheromone delta traps biogard s r l 20834 nova milanese mb italy equipped with selure lb dispenser shin etsu chemical co ltd tokyo and checked weekly an uncertainty of 3 5 days half of the time between two inspections was assumed for the experimental population during the survey a meteorological station aws310 model vaisala company helsinki finland recorded 48 temperature values per day which were used to estimate the corresponding daily rate to insert into the discretized version of the model 8 and into its corresponding ri t version as regards the development rate functions the protocol followed by rossini et al 2020c was maintained in the present study more specifically the briére expression 16 was used in temperature ranges 6 7 13 c and 25 30 c while logan 15 in the ranges 13 25 c and 30 34 c since the damages usually reported are not relevant for this investigation the first generation of the year was not simulated vassiliou 2011 however the first generation is fundamental in driving the simulation of the second and third generations and accordingly can be used as an initial condition for both the ddm versions more specifically the day in which the peak of the first generation was ascertained by monitoring was considered as day zero for simulations hypothesising that a cohort of eggs was laid in that day in numbers 22nd may 24th april and 19th june were selected for 2014 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 anthonomus eugenii the logan function parameters were retrieved directly from the work of rossini et al 2020a and are listed in table 1 these parameters will be common to both the ddm versions as well as the daily average temperature recorded in the experimental greenhouse the other common value inserted as input in both the model versions is h 10 following the procedure described in section 2 4 for this specific case study simulations showed different responses describing the field population overlapping the numerical solution from both the models with field data it is possible to assess the different trends of the classical ri t and the novel qi t ddm versions in varying temperature conditions the population peaks were well described in both the models even if the qi t version had more reliable results in fact monitoring data indicated an experimental population peak occurring on 23rd november while the qi t and ri t ddm versions simulated the same on 22nd and 19th november respectively a graphical comparison of the results is provided in fig 2 a point to highlight is the higher variability of the classical ddm version ri t right plot on fig 2 which underlines the meaning at the basis of the model formulation the varying temperature conditions in fact provoke abrupt changes in the forecasted flow of emerging adults at first sight undetected by the field data available a more reliable description instead was provided by the novel ddm version qi t left plot in fig 2 which in general seems to better represent the experimental population a numerical estimation of the reliability of both the models was provided analysing the χ 2 and r 2 values listed in table 2 with this methodology in fact it is possible to determine which ddm version is the most effective for the experimental scheme adopted to retrieve the field population focusing on the values listed in table 2 it is possible to assess that the qi t version confirms its reliability with a lower χ 2 value and with a r 2 nearest to 1 respect to the ri t version the open field condition will be discussed in the following section 3 2 lobesia botrana as shown in the a eugenii case study the first step is the logan and briére development rate functions parameters estimation the values table 3 were estimated with life tables from moshtaghi maleki et al 2016 and used for both the ddm versions concerning the simulation for each year of survey the same development rate function parameters the same daily average temperature and the same values h were inserted more specifically h was estimated also for the present case study with the procedure described in section 2 4 values used for the simulations are listed in table 4 let us focus on the 2014 season simulations the second generation reported an experimental peak on 17th june well represented by both the ddm versions advancing by order the novel version qi t left plot on fig 3 forecasted a peak on 14th june while the classical version ri t right plot on fig 3 indicated the same on 15th june regarding the third generation of 2014 monitoring recorded a population peak on 19th august simulations provided a maximum peak on 18th august in the case of qi t version while the ri t provided a forecast for 19th august on the whole the values resulting from both the ddm versions are close to the field data showing their good response in representing a population developing in an open field scenario the results highlighted in the first season of survey were confirmed in the years after in 2015 the second generation occurred on 16th june as observed in the field survey simulations from both the models reported values close to the experimental population peak more specifically the novel version qi t left plot on fig 4 indicated a population peak on 15th june while the classical version ri t right plot on fig 4 on 18th june the third generation s population peak of 2015 season occurred on 19th august while both the ddm versions provided a forecasted value on 11th august as shown in fig 4 thus in this case both the models provided a reliable response in describing the field population the 2016 season was the last year of the survey for the l botrana case study the second generation s peak occurred on 11th august a value simulated on 10th august by the novel version qi t left plot on fig 5 and on 9th august by the classical version ri t concerning the third generation there was no possibility to determine exactly when the experimental population peak occurred since the same highest value was reported on two days namely 14th and 21st september simulations with qi t model indicated a population peak on 17th september left plot on fig 5 while ri t version provided the same on 16th september the values indicated by both ddm versions on the whole represented the experimental population well but it is difficult to determine the most reliable model version without using numerical indicators as already discussed in the case of a eugenii a cross check between χ 2 and r 2 values also answers to the main question of this article in the case study of l botrana referring to table 5 it is possible to notice that the lower χ 2 values and r 2 values nearest to 1 were reported by the qi t ddm version the only case where a higher r 2 value was reported in the case of ri t instead of qi t version occurred in the 2016 season despite the χ 2 value being higher than the qi t version this unusual result if compared to the others may be justified by the lack of a clearly identified experimental population peak in the third generation fig 5 probably located between the two higher values recorded by the monitoring on the other hand there is no significant difference between the two r 2 values and this makes the χ 2 values associated to each ddm version reasonable 4 conclusion results showed that the novel distributed delay model version qi t introduced in the present work is more reliable in representing insect pest populations the new implications of this paper contribute towards an improvement in the historical reliability of the ddm testing a second formulation never used before another important question contained in this work may concern the meaning of data acquired with traps the two ddm versions provide a conceptual distinction between flux and count of individuals although with the simple relation 2 however to explore thoroughly the differences ad hoc experiments at controlled conditions such as in climatic chambers should be conducted in this way it will be possible to control the life cycle of each individual obtaining more detailed information about the newly emerged individuals to simulate with both the ddm versions one of the concerns highlighted by the results of the present work moreover is the time range between two field samplings even if results are oriented towards a higher reliability of the novel ddm version qi t this cannot be stated with certainty in fact the high fluctuations of the classical ddm are not always appreciated by field data and one might wonder if fluctuations are wide as described by the simulations of the present work or not this question is reasonable since colinet et al 2015 assessed that the daily contribution received by ectotherms developing in fluctuating temperature conditions leads to an average temperature value tdt which can be calculated at the end of the life cycle hence it may be possible to assume that changes in development rates are not immediate and depend on the past history of insects living environment the results of the present work do not allow to investigate this aspect but given its importance future studies on ddm should be addressed towards this direction an investigation on ectotherms thermal inertia may provide not only clarifications about the questions raised in the present study but may also contribute to understand which is the optimal time scale to simulate ectotherms with physiologically based models in general although some questions are still open the present study contributed also to fill a theoretical gap of knowledge that is the connection between the classical ddm and the von foerster equation von foerster 1959 22 t n t a a n t a μ t a n t a n t 0 0 β t a n t a d a n 0 a n 0 a eq 22 describes the density of a population n t a developing over time t divided in continuous age classes a and with a mortality rate μ t a n 0 a is the initial condition indicating the distribution of the individuals in the age classes at t 0 while the boundary condition n t 0 provides the new born s profile on the basis of the population density n t a and the fertility rate function β t a plant and wilson 1986 showed that replacing the age variable a with a sequence of values an which respect the condition a n a n 1 it is possible to obtain a similar form of the ddm this discretization in fact leads to an approximation of the partial derivative in the a variable bellagamba et al 1987 gilbert et al 2004 rossini et al 2020d providing a system of ordinary differential equations similar to the ddm 23 d d t n 1 t 1 a n 0 t n 1 t 1 a μ 1 t d d t n 2 t 1 a n 1 t n 2 t 1 a μ 2 t d d t n i t 1 a n i 1 t n i t 1 a μ i t in the system 23 a a n a n 1 is the size of the discrete age classes which are by definition chained now let us assume that the discrete age classes have the same size and that they divide the average duration of the life cycle d t which can be assumed time dependent if the population develops under varying temperature conditions in h parts it follows that 1 a h d t and considering also μ 1 t μ i t a r t the system 23 is similar to the novel formulation of the ddm 8 introduced in the present study it is possible to show also that the system 23 provides an erlang pdf as analytical solution if the assumptions stated in section 2 2 2 are made rossini 2016 hence the discretization of the von foerster equation does not lead to the general form of the classical ddm 4 in the ri t variables but to the novel formulation introduced in the present study nevertheless the mathematical details discussed in section 2 clarify how to pass from qi t variables to ri t and vice versa the situation is different if the assumptions discussed in section 2 2 2 are made in fact in this case has been shown that the two ddm versions have the same behaviour and analytical solutions this may be confusing if connected with the von foerster s equation and needs a clarification the discretization of the eq 22 which leads to the system 23 does not have assumptions restrictive enough as in section 2 2 2 since the discretised mortality rate function μi t is still time dependent as well as the mean development time d t hence the discretization of the eq 22 with the method of the lines leads to the general form of the ddm if no assumptions of constant mean development time and mortality rate are made accordingly the mathematical aspects discussed in this work complete also the connection between the von foerster equation 1959 and the manetsch 1976 vansickle 1977 ddm

24738,among the models used to describe insect pest populations the distributed delay model has been applied in several case studies in recent years its success is due mainly to its simplicity and its versatility to be easily included in software to calculate numerical solutions in its original formulation the distributed delay model provides as a solution the distribution of the insects maturation flow then this is compared with monitoring in field applications a different form of the model can be obtained with the same assumptions to describe the distribution of the number of individuals which are in a specific life stage at time t the first aim of this work was to show the mathematical details in order to obtain the second form of the distributed delay model and to calculate its analytical solutions the second aim was to analyse the model s behaviour in describing insect pest s population in varying environmental conditions specifically in terms of temperature to pursue this second aim two case studies of noteworthy relevance in agriculture were considered the pepper weevil anthonomus eugenii and the european grapevine moth lobesia botrana for each case study field populations were simulated with both the distributed delay model versions and the results were compared to determine the most appropriate model for application in the case of insect pest populations both the case studies highlighted that the novel formulation presented in this work significantly improves simulation providing a more reliable representation of field data keywords growth models crop protection physiological age integrated pest management age structured models 1 introduction modelling insect pest populations has been an interest of agricultural researchers for a long time getz and gutierrez 1982 gilioli et al 2016 the primary reason to delve into and improve this argument is for the more effective use of these models as decision support systems dss in crop protection besides their support in the comprehension of the biological mechanisms orlandini et al 2018 predictions have a key role to play in integrated pest management ipm because they allow one to forecast pest outbreaks bellocchi et al 2011 pertot et al 2017 accordingly a projection of the insect pest population dynamics provides i a scenario of the risk of economic losses han et al 2019 and ii time to formulate the most efficient control strategy amo salas et al 2011 in agriculture several population dynamics models have been introduced in pursuit of this aim cappio borlino et al 1991 plant and mangel 1987 rebaudo and rabhi 2018 strona et al 2020 2018 to date the most appropriate models to describe insect populations are physiologically based models gilioli et al 2016 these models have the capacity to describe ectotherm populations considering the relationship between species growth and external environment gilbert et al 2004 a pioneering physiologically based model is the distributed delay model ddm introduced for the first time by manetsch 1976 and revised the subsequent year by vansickle 1977 the ddm in fact provided the possibility of linking external sub models usually defined as phenological models describing the relationship between species and environment quinn 2017 for the first time hence with the ddm phenological and population dynamics models were first considered as a unique block schaalje and van der vaart 1989 the ddm represents a valuable candidate to describe ectotherms life cycle typically in fields with homogeneous microclimatic conditions or controlled environments such as greenhouses under the aforementioned hypotheses the whole environment may be represented with a single point where ectotherm populations develop and this is the implicit assumption of all the applications of ddm available in literature in addition the recent implementations in gis systems combined with remote sensing is overcoming the issue of the spatialization in areas where the aforementioned assumptions are not respected as showed by gutierrez et al 2017 2012 the innovative idea behind the ddm was the possibility of representing an insect life cycle or part of it if there is a particular stage of interest as a series of non observable chained stages severini et al 1990 usually considered as the degree of delay or degree of stochasticity of the model limonta et al 2009 as a solution the ddm provides a distribution of the insects maturation flows gutierrez et al 1984 severini et al 1990 representing in other words the flow of individuals that complete their life cycle however the hypotheses behind its formulation manetsch 1976 vansickle 1977 allow to obtain a second mathematical form which at difference of the classical ddm provides as solution the count of individuals belonging to the last stage of their life cycle this second mathematical form was never tested but it is more similar from a conceptual point of view to the modern physiologically based models considering systems of ordinary differential equations di cola et al 1989 nance et al 2018 or partial differential equations ainseba and sebastian 2001 bellagamba et al 1987 gilbert et al 2004 gilioli et al 2016 he and ainseba 2014 pasquali et al 2019 rossini et al 2020b 2019a these models in fact describe the temporal variation of population s individuals and not their maturation flows a wide range of works highlight the reliability of the classical ddm in describing ectotherms such as plants and insects for example cotton gossypium hirsutum l cultivations were modelled by gutierrez and pizzamiglio 1984 then gutierrez et al 1984 successfully extended the study to bean tomatoes and cassava cultivations some years later severini et al 1990 used the ddm to describe the development of apricot flowers a slightly different application of the ddm in plant modelling was provided by wermelinger et al 1991 in this case the ddm was used to describe the allocation of carbon and nitrogen in grapevines dividing the single plant into sub populations of leaves shoots roots and fruits alongside plant modelling other successful applications of the ddm concern insect pest populations the case study of the european grapevine moth lobesia botrana denis schiffermüller was considered by severini et al 2005 and by gutierrez et al 2012 with successful results in particular the first work describes l botrana populations validating the model with field data while in the second work the ddm was used to predict european grapevine moth s populations in a climate change scenario other relevant applications are discussed by schaub et al 2017 with regard to the european corn borer ostrinia nubilalis hübner by limonta et al 2009 with regard to the rice moth corcyra cephalonica stainton and by baumgärtner and severini 1987 with regard to the case of phyllonorycter blancardella fabricius moreover allen and byrd 2000 extended the applicability of the ddm to forensic entomology the applications listed above compare experimental and simulated maturation flows of insect pest populations besides applications in agricultural and environmental sciences the ddm was employed also for flow forecasting by spolia et al 1980 and included in a sirns model to represent the spread of infectious diseases by jensen et al 2019 however from an experimental point of view it is difficult to directly measure the maturation flows or in other words the exact moment of life stage transitions during experimentations researchers usually count the number of individuals in each life stage by direct samplings or using monitoring traps at this point one may wonder if a novel mathematical form of ddm describing the count of individuals into the life stages and demonstrated starting from the same assumptions of the classical one is more suitable to represent ectotherm populations this question is reasonable since to date the ddm is still applied in simulating insect pest populations as some recent works show asplen et al 2015 gutierrez et al 2017 2012 the aim of this work hence is to show how to obtain the novel form of the ddm which describes the temporal variation of the number of individuals into each stage instead of the temporal variation of the maturation flows after the mathematical description a comparison between the two versions of the ddm was conducted investigating which of the two is the better and more effective form for entomological applications in this regard two applications were compared the case study of the european grapevine moth lobesia botrana and the case study of the pepper weevil anthonomus eugenii cano data about these insects population were retrieved from two already published works rossini et al 2020c 2020a this data was selected to investigate the behaviour of the two ddm versions in cases of different species and different development environments a eugenii populations were monitored in an experimental greenhouse while l botrana was monitored in open field conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 distributed delay model considering the scheme showed in fig 1 an ectotherm s life cycle can be represented with a series of h chained substages each ith substage is characterized by an entering flow of individuals denoted with r i 1 t an exit flow of matured individuals ri t and by a flux of dead mi t an additional function qi t describes the temporal variation of the individuals into the stage as reported by manetsch 1976 and vansickle 1977 a mathematical description of each substage consists in three equations the first one 1 is a balance equation which links the variation of the individuals into each substage with the entering and exit flows while the second 2 and the third 3 ones define the flows ri t and mi t in formulas 1 d d t q i t r i 1 t r i t m i t 2 r i t h d t q i t 3 m i t a r t q i t d t and h in the eq 2 represent the expected emergence time of the whole population and the number of substages respectively ar t in expression 3 is the mortality function according to the formulation of vansickle 1977 2 1 1 classical formulation ri t manetsch 1976 and vansickle 1977 obtained the generic ddm equation written with ri t variables substituting the expression 2 and 3 into the eq 1 4 d d t r i t h d t r i 1 t r i t 1 a r t d t h d d t d t h the scheme presented in fig 1 assumes that it is possible to represent a single observable stage or the whole life cycle just varying the number of the equations h of the system this is one of the major criticalities in applying the ddm since h itself is one of the unknown of the problem however even if there is not a direct correspondence between the observable life stages and the chained boxes described in fig 1 there are two possible ways to apply the ddm the first possibility is to consider a system of chained ddms where each system of equations represents a single observable stage gutierrez and baumgärtner 1984 the second possibility is to consider the whole life cycle as a single stage described by a single system of ddm equations at first sight the first proposal seems to be more realistic in representing the real situation but at the same time provides for the estimation of h for each system involved moreover it is more expensive from a computational point of view besides a more complicated validation the second possibility instead provokes loss of biological information but at the same time it is easier to manage and apply it is a good compromise when there is an interest in modelling only a particular life stage this second representation has been chosen for the case studies considered in the present work a common condition to both the aforementioned ways to apply the ddm is that although may not be a direct correspondence between observable and non observable stages alongside the life cycle represented surely the first and the last substage of the process in fig 1 can be directly associated with observable stages for the purpose of this work hence the first substage represents the cohort of eggs entering within the process while the last substage are the adults the hypotheses discussed above were maintained for both the classical ddm version 4 and the novel one that we are going to introduce in the following section 2 1 2 novel formulation qi t the qi t version of eq 4 can be obtained following an analogous logic scheme with a direct substitution of the expressions 2 and 3 expression 1 becomes 5 d d t q i t r i 1 t h d t q i t a r t q i t now let us consider a transformation of the term r i 1 t in the eq 5 with reference to fig 1 it is possible to say that each substage with i 1 can be described with their specific eqs 1 3 this means that even for the substage i 1 a triad of equations similar to the eqs 1 3 will exist rossini 2016 more specifically the r i 1 t term can be obtained considering the equivalent of the expression 2 referred to the substage i 1 6 r i 1 t h d t q i 1 t substituting the expression 6 into the eq 5 the qi t version of ddm is obtained 7 d d t q i t h d t q i 1 t q i t 1 d t h a r t the complete system finally is 8 d d t q 1 t h d t q 0 t q 1 t 1 d t h a r t d d t q 2 t h d t q 1 t q 2 t 1 d t h a r t d d t q h t h d t q h 1 t q h t 1 d t h a r t system 8 represents the main mathematical results of this work written in its most general form in the next sections aspects related to analytical and numerical solutions will be treated before a direct application to the cited case studies in fact the primary question of this paper now revolves around which ddm version is more appropriate for field applications and whether there are particular cases where no differences between the two models can be identified 2 2 analytical solutions 2 2 1 classical formulation ri t concerning the ri t version the classical one several works have faced this problem severini et al 1990 a particular case without mortality and with constant d t term was considered by manetsch 1976 while vansickle 1977 extended the calculation considering a more general case with constant mortality both cases lead to an analytical solution found through the use of laplace transform assuming that r 0 t the input function in the system is represented by a dirac delta function namely r 0 t δ t the analytical solution assuming the hypotheses described is the erlang probability density function erlang pdf 9 r h t h d h t h 1 h 1 exp a r h d t this special case means that in the general equation of the ri t version the eq 4 the term d d t d t h is equal to zero since the function d t is assumed to be a constant 2 2 2 novel formulation qi t it is the task of this section to show that with the same assumptions it is possible to find an analytical solution for the system 8 namely the qi t version of the ddm again through the use of laplace transform rossini 2016 it is possible to convert the system 8 into an algebraic system 10 l q 1 t h d 1 s h d ar l q 2 t h d 1 s h d ar l q 1 t l q h t h d 1 s h d ar l q h 1 t system 10 is solvable with a series of chained substitutions which lead to the following expression 11 l q h t h d h 1 s h d a r h now applying the inverse of the laplace transform to eq 11 it can be demonstrated that the solution of the qi t version of the ddm is again the erlang pdf if and only if the input function q 0 t δ t and d t and ar t are assumed to be constant 12 q h t h d h t h 1 h 1 exp a r h d t moreover the expression 11 can also be obtained considering that in the frequency domain the transfer function of the system is 13 q h s q 0 s h d h 1 s h d a r h where l q h t q h s and l δ t q 0 s the main result to be taken from this section concerns the similarity between the two versions of the ddm in particular conditions represented by the assumptions formulated at the beginning of the calculation they provide the same solution hence it is possible to assess that when the ddm is used in conditions of constant temperature namely with constant d t severini et al 1990 and with a constant mortality term there is no clear preference between the two versions of the model however this situation is not verified in the most general case where a numerical solution is needed to solve both the ddm versions in this case a comparison of the model response is required directly applying both ddm versions to the case studies 2 3 development rate functions biological parameters which clearly identify the species represented can be introduced in the ddm models through development rate functions in fact the mean development time d t included in the system 8 and in its related ri t version is connected to environmental parameters temperature in particular through the following mathematical relation damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 14 g t i 1 d t i the expression 14 connects the mean development time d ti related to a particular temperature to its corresponding development rate g ti moreover it is implicitly intended that there is time dependence in d ti and g ti in varying temperature conditions accordingly writing the mean development time as d t it usually means d t t before discussing the development rate expressions involved in the present work it is helpful to point out the meaning of constant temperature from the point of view of the ddm as detailed in the previous section one of the assumptions needed to calculate analytical solutions for both the ddm versions requires d t as time invariant expression 14 directly connects the mean development time with the daily average temperature a physical dimension subject to changes in the natural environment accordingly it is possible to consider d t as time invariant only in conditions of controlled temperature as for instance in a climatic chamber hence the application of the ddm in varying temperature environments implies a usage of the models in their general form requiring numerical solutions the literature concerning development rate functions has been enriched over the years and several authors have proposed expressions to connect insects stage duration with the temperature reviews on this argument were presented by damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 and ikemoto and kiritani 2019 these functions are formulated both on empirical and physical bases but a common feature between the various proposals is the need to estimate parameters with experimental data to pursue the aim of this work the logan and briére expressions will be considered mathematically speaking the logan expression logan et al 1976 is represented by the following formula 15 g t t ψ exp ρ t t exp ρ t m t m t t δ t where tm is the lower temperature threshold for insects growth δt is the temperature range between the maximum of the function and tm ψ and ρ are empirical parameters the briére development rate function briere et al 1999 instead is mathematically described as follows 16 g t t a t t t t t l t m t t 1 m with tl and tm being the lower and upper temperature thresholds and a and m empirical parameters the introduction of the development rate function completes the meaning of the ddm in fact in the light of the methodology presented in this section the general version of the system 8 and its corresponding classical version ri t can be rewritten as follows 17 d dt q 1 t h g t t q 0 t q 1 t 1 h g t t ar t d dt q 2 t h g t t q 1 t q 2 t 1 h g t t ar t d dt q h t h g t t q h 1 t q h t 1 h g t t ar t g t t in system 17 can be substituted with the expression 15 or 16 on the basis of the specific case study moreover the experimental data used to estimate the development rate function parameters defined as life tables in the entomological jargon harcourt 1969 contributes to choose the way of application of the ddm discussed in section 2 1 1 in fact if data about the average development time at different constant temperatures are provided for all the observable stages then it is possible to estimate the parameter of development rate function for each observable stage in this case a series of chained ddms is applicable on the other hand if data allow the estimation of a single development rate function for the whole life cycle egg adult the ddm application should be oriented towards a single ddm the species considered in this study lie in this latter case analysing the system 17 in greater depth it can be noted that there is no possibility to solve it analytically in the most general case in fact despite expressions 15 and 16 can be manageable from a mathematical point of view they contain the unknown function t t which in line of principle describes the variation of the daily average temperature this physical dimension can be measured directly with meteorological stations or data loggers and predicted for a few days after however there is not an analytical function which describes its trend throughout the year rossini et al 2020c 2019a for this purpose a numerical solution is required for the system 17 and for its analogous classical version ri t 2 4 numerical solutions of both the ddm versions the issues described in the previous section lead to the use of numerical algorithms to find solutions of both ddm versions before their application in case studies the simplest way to implement the systems in a calculation software is the application of the euler s finite difference scheme to each equation of 17 concerning the classical version ri t a numerical scheme of this type was provided by manetsch 1976 vansickle 1977 and alilla et al 2005 therefore in order to not distract the attention of the reader only a discrete version of system 17 will be discussed let us focus on the generic equation of the system 17 18 d d t q i t h g t t q i 1 t q i t 1 h g t t a r t the time variable t can be approximated with a sequence of values tn with the condition t n t n 1 rossini et al 2019a hence defining the discrete time step j t n 1 t n it is possible to apply the finite difference scheme to the eq 18 to distinguish the continuous variables from their discrete versions a change of notation will be adopted q i j g tj arj in the light of the assumptions discussed each equation of the system 17 can be transformed as follows 19 q i j 1 j h g t j q i 1 j q i j 1 j h g t j j a r j this numerical scheme and its respective r i j version were implemented in a specialised software detailed in the works of rossini et al 2019b 2020c this was used to carry out all the operations required to pursue the aims of this paper the last issue before the application of the numerical scheme 19 and of its corresponding classical version concerns the number of equations of the system namely h as stated in section 2 1 1 h represents one of the unknown of the problem needing field data for its estimation the ddm applications listed in the introduction of the present study usually assign a defined value to h but the reasons behind are often difficult to understand hence to overcome the problem a methodology was proposed by rossini et al 2019b 2020d their proposal was to solve a high number of eq 19 considering the h value such that the convergence of the numerical scheme is ensured then since the first and the last stages of the scheme in fig 1 are overlapped to the first and the last observable life stage it is possible to compare each numerical solution with field data in order to find which is the last equation of the system this comparison can be evaluated with the same χ 2 function 20 2 5 comparison between the ddm versions after the model description and discretization a methodology is needed to compare the results with field data in particular for each case study considered in the present work it is necessary to determine which ddm version is more appropriate for accurately representing the field data a methodology to compare simulation outputs and field data was discussed by rossini et al 2020a 2020c on the basis of considerations introduced by ikemoto and kiritani 2019 and mirhosseini et al 2017 the reliability of a simulation can be evaluated considering the χ 2 function with the meaning of indicator of the distance between n field data oi and simulations ei 20 χ 2 i 1 n o i e i 2 e i the coefficient of determination r 2 which provides an estimation of the reliability of the simulation in representing field data 21 r 2 1 i 1 n o i e i 2 i 1 n o i e i 2 coherently with the expression 20 oi in this case indicates the observed data and ei simulations according to this methodology defined as a posteriori analysis rossini et al 2020a the ddm version which provides the lower χ 2 value and an r 2 nearest to 1 is the most reliable to describe field data 2 6 case studies anthonomus eugenii cano and lobesia botrana denis schiffermüller 2 6 1 greenhouse scenario a eugenii the first comparison between the two ddm versions concerns the semi field case of the pepper weevil a eugenii in fact a semi controlled environment is fundamental to understand the response of the models because of the ability to manage factors affecting population development such as natural enemies or other source of stresses during the 2014 growing season a pepper weevil population was sampled in a greenhouse located in fondi lazio region italy these data have been published in the work of rossini et al 2020a to validate a different physiologically based model despite the data acquisition and the experimental scheme being well detailed in the cited literature it is opportune to mark in the present article some additionally fundamental information the a eugenii population was assessed using chromothropic sticky traps deployed along the diagonal of the greenhouse these were checked on a weekly basis an uncertainty of 3 5 days half of the time between two inspections was assumed for the experimental population moreover during the monitoring period the daily average temperature was recorded at a meteorological station these temperature data were then included in the calculation to estimate through the development rate function the corresponding value to insert in the discretized version of the system 17 and into its corresponding ri t version data about the biology and the different response to the external temperature were instead provided by toapanta et al 2005 and were fundamental to estimate the development rate function parameters since the work of rossini et al 2020a shows a better response of the logan function 15 in representing life tables this choice will be maintained for the application of the ddm in the first part of the experimentation the greenhouse was left open to promote the natural infestation by pepper weevil adults once ascertained the presence of the insect the greenhouse was isolated from the external environment with an anti aphid net the day of the greenhouse isolation was considered as day zero for simulations 20th of october assuming that the initial cohort of eggs was laid in that moment 2 6 2 open field scenario l botrana the second case study selected for this work concerns another insect pest of significant importance within agriculture specifically in grape production the european grapevine moth l botrana also in this case the choice was made to use data published in the work of rossini et al 2020c related to a three year survey 2014 2015 and 2016 seasons conducted in an experimental vineyard located in castelli romani area lazio region italy the investigation provided the three yearly generations which are usually reported in the area and for the three growing seasons surveyed adults were caught with pheromone delta traps biogard s r l 20834 nova milanese mb italy equipped with selure lb dispenser shin etsu chemical co ltd tokyo and checked weekly an uncertainty of 3 5 days half of the time between two inspections was assumed for the experimental population during the survey a meteorological station aws310 model vaisala company helsinki finland recorded 48 temperature values per day which were used to estimate the corresponding daily rate to insert into the discretized version of the model 8 and into its corresponding ri t version as regards the development rate functions the protocol followed by rossini et al 2020c was maintained in the present study more specifically the briére expression 16 was used in temperature ranges 6 7 13 c and 25 30 c while logan 15 in the ranges 13 25 c and 30 34 c since the damages usually reported are not relevant for this investigation the first generation of the year was not simulated vassiliou 2011 however the first generation is fundamental in driving the simulation of the second and third generations and accordingly can be used as an initial condition for both the ddm versions more specifically the day in which the peak of the first generation was ascertained by monitoring was considered as day zero for simulations hypothesising that a cohort of eggs was laid in that day in numbers 22nd may 24th april and 19th june were selected for 2014 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 anthonomus eugenii the logan function parameters were retrieved directly from the work of rossini et al 2020a and are listed in table 1 these parameters will be common to both the ddm versions as well as the daily average temperature recorded in the experimental greenhouse the other common value inserted as input in both the model versions is h 10 following the procedure described in section 2 4 for this specific case study simulations showed different responses describing the field population overlapping the numerical solution from both the models with field data it is possible to assess the different trends of the classical ri t and the novel qi t ddm versions in varying temperature conditions the population peaks were well described in both the models even if the qi t version had more reliable results in fact monitoring data indicated an experimental population peak occurring on 23rd november while the qi t and ri t ddm versions simulated the same on 22nd and 19th november respectively a graphical comparison of the results is provided in fig 2 a point to highlight is the higher variability of the classical ddm version ri t right plot on fig 2 which underlines the meaning at the basis of the model formulation the varying temperature conditions in fact provoke abrupt changes in the forecasted flow of emerging adults at first sight undetected by the field data available a more reliable description instead was provided by the novel ddm version qi t left plot in fig 2 which in general seems to better represent the experimental population a numerical estimation of the reliability of both the models was provided analysing the χ 2 and r 2 values listed in table 2 with this methodology in fact it is possible to determine which ddm version is the most effective for the experimental scheme adopted to retrieve the field population focusing on the values listed in table 2 it is possible to assess that the qi t version confirms its reliability with a lower χ 2 value and with a r 2 nearest to 1 respect to the ri t version the open field condition will be discussed in the following section 3 2 lobesia botrana as shown in the a eugenii case study the first step is the logan and briére development rate functions parameters estimation the values table 3 were estimated with life tables from moshtaghi maleki et al 2016 and used for both the ddm versions concerning the simulation for each year of survey the same development rate function parameters the same daily average temperature and the same values h were inserted more specifically h was estimated also for the present case study with the procedure described in section 2 4 values used for the simulations are listed in table 4 let us focus on the 2014 season simulations the second generation reported an experimental peak on 17th june well represented by both the ddm versions advancing by order the novel version qi t left plot on fig 3 forecasted a peak on 14th june while the classical version ri t right plot on fig 3 indicated the same on 15th june regarding the third generation of 2014 monitoring recorded a population peak on 19th august simulations provided a maximum peak on 18th august in the case of qi t version while the ri t provided a forecast for 19th august on the whole the values resulting from both the ddm versions are close to the field data showing their good response in representing a population developing in an open field scenario the results highlighted in the first season of survey were confirmed in the years after in 2015 the second generation occurred on 16th june as observed in the field survey simulations from both the models reported values close to the experimental population peak more specifically the novel version qi t left plot on fig 4 indicated a population peak on 15th june while the classical version ri t right plot on fig 4 on 18th june the third generation s population peak of 2015 season occurred on 19th august while both the ddm versions provided a forecasted value on 11th august as shown in fig 4 thus in this case both the models provided a reliable response in describing the field population the 2016 season was the last year of the survey for the l botrana case study the second generation s peak occurred on 11th august a value simulated on 10th august by the novel version qi t left plot on fig 5 and on 9th august by the classical version ri t concerning the third generation there was no possibility to determine exactly when the experimental population peak occurred since the same highest value was reported on two days namely 14th and 21st september simulations with qi t model indicated a population peak on 17th september left plot on fig 5 while ri t version provided the same on 16th september the values indicated by both ddm versions on the whole represented the experimental population well but it is difficult to determine the most reliable model version without using numerical indicators as already discussed in the case of a eugenii a cross check between χ 2 and r 2 values also answers to the main question of this article in the case study of l botrana referring to table 5 it is possible to notice that the lower χ 2 values and r 2 values nearest to 1 were reported by the qi t ddm version the only case where a higher r 2 value was reported in the case of ri t instead of qi t version occurred in the 2016 season despite the χ 2 value being higher than the qi t version this unusual result if compared to the others may be justified by the lack of a clearly identified experimental population peak in the third generation fig 5 probably located between the two higher values recorded by the monitoring on the other hand there is no significant difference between the two r 2 values and this makes the χ 2 values associated to each ddm version reasonable 4 conclusion results showed that the novel distributed delay model version qi t introduced in the present work is more reliable in representing insect pest populations the new implications of this paper contribute towards an improvement in the historical reliability of the ddm testing a second formulation never used before another important question contained in this work may concern the meaning of data acquired with traps the two ddm versions provide a conceptual distinction between flux and count of individuals although with the simple relation 2 however to explore thoroughly the differences ad hoc experiments at controlled conditions such as in climatic chambers should be conducted in this way it will be possible to control the life cycle of each individual obtaining more detailed information about the newly emerged individuals to simulate with both the ddm versions one of the concerns highlighted by the results of the present work moreover is the time range between two field samplings even if results are oriented towards a higher reliability of the novel ddm version qi t this cannot be stated with certainty in fact the high fluctuations of the classical ddm are not always appreciated by field data and one might wonder if fluctuations are wide as described by the simulations of the present work or not this question is reasonable since colinet et al 2015 assessed that the daily contribution received by ectotherms developing in fluctuating temperature conditions leads to an average temperature value tdt which can be calculated at the end of the life cycle hence it may be possible to assume that changes in development rates are not immediate and depend on the past history of insects living environment the results of the present work do not allow to investigate this aspect but given its importance future studies on ddm should be addressed towards this direction an investigation on ectotherms thermal inertia may provide not only clarifications about the questions raised in the present study but may also contribute to understand which is the optimal time scale to simulate ectotherms with physiologically based models in general although some questions are still open the present study contributed also to fill a theoretical gap of knowledge that is the connection between the classical ddm and the von foerster equation von foerster 1959 22 t n t a a n t a μ t a n t a n t 0 0 β t a n t a d a n 0 a n 0 a eq 22 describes the density of a population n t a developing over time t divided in continuous age classes a and with a mortality rate μ t a n 0 a is the initial condition indicating the distribution of the individuals in the age classes at t 0 while the boundary condition n t 0 provides the new born s profile on the basis of the population density n t a and the fertility rate function β t a plant and wilson 1986 showed that replacing the age variable a with a sequence of values an which respect the condition a n a n 1 it is possible to obtain a similar form of the ddm this discretization in fact leads to an approximation of the partial derivative in the a variable bellagamba et al 1987 gilbert et al 2004 rossini et al 2020d providing a system of ordinary differential equations similar to the ddm 23 d d t n 1 t 1 a n 0 t n 1 t 1 a μ 1 t d d t n 2 t 1 a n 1 t n 2 t 1 a μ 2 t d d t n i t 1 a n i 1 t n i t 1 a μ i t in the system 23 a a n a n 1 is the size of the discrete age classes which are by definition chained now let us assume that the discrete age classes have the same size and that they divide the average duration of the life cycle d t which can be assumed time dependent if the population develops under varying temperature conditions in h parts it follows that 1 a h d t and considering also μ 1 t μ i t a r t the system 23 is similar to the novel formulation of the ddm 8 introduced in the present study it is possible to show also that the system 23 provides an erlang pdf as analytical solution if the assumptions stated in section 2 2 2 are made rossini 2016 hence the discretization of the von foerster equation does not lead to the general form of the classical ddm 4 in the ri t variables but to the novel formulation introduced in the present study nevertheless the mathematical details discussed in section 2 clarify how to pass from qi t variables to ri t and vice versa the situation is different if the assumptions discussed in section 2 2 2 are made in fact in this case has been shown that the two ddm versions have the same behaviour and analytical solutions this may be confusing if connected with the von foerster s equation and needs a clarification the discretization of the eq 22 which leads to the system 23 does not have assumptions restrictive enough as in section 2 2 2 since the discretised mortality rate function μi t is still time dependent as well as the mean development time d t hence the discretization of the eq 22 with the method of the lines leads to the general form of the ddm if no assumptions of constant mean development time and mortality rate are made accordingly the mathematical aspects discussed in this work complete also the connection between the von foerster equation 1959 and the manetsch 1976 vansickle 1977 ddm

24739,the effects of a single trait on more than one ecological function is called ecological pleiotropy traits that exhibit ecological pleiotropy are relevant to eco evolutionary dynamics because the structure of interaction between the trait and its ecological functions alters how eco evolutionary feedback loops emerge density dependent selection dds assumes that a single trait affects both density independent and density dependent population growth through ecological pleiotropy and is one of the simplest routes for feedback loops the r k theory proposes a mechanism by which dds occurs but its predictions were poorly explored in an eco evolutionary context some assumptions of the r k theory seems to be relevant for the eco evolution of predator prey interactions however the relationship between these theories were poorly explored here we investigate how does the r k theory relates to the eco evolution of predator prey systems we seek to answer two questions 1 what are the system s parameters that affect the predominance of r and k selection 2 does system s qualitative behaviour depends on whether the predominant selection on prey population is an r or a k selection to answer these questions we built a model of differential equations describing the eco evolutionary dynamics of a predator prey system we assume that prey vulnerability to predation is an adaptive trait that affects preys density dependent growth rate through ecological pleiotropy then we partitioned the selection gradient in its r and k selection components and evaluate how their magnitude relates to systems behaviour we found that stable predator prey cycles only occurs when k selection is predominant when r selection is predominant cycles lead to a runaway dynamics furthermore the way predators parameters affect prey position in the r k continuum depends on how they affect predation risk while increasing predation risk increases k selection decreasing it increases r selection we discuss the relevance of the structure of ecological pleiotropy to our results and the perspectives that unifies the r k theory and eco evolutionary dynamics keywords prey adaptation rapid adaptation r k theory ecological pleiotropy population biology prey vulnerability 1 introduction some traits affect several ecological dimensions of fitness as a consequence the overall natural selection results from the net effect of the several selective pressures acting on that trait mcpeek 2017 the effect of one trait over more than one ecological function is called ecological pleiotropy strauss and irwin 2004 examples of traits that exhibit ecological pleiotropy are body mass and size delong and gibert 2016 delong and luhring 2018 phenology friberg et al 2008 colour patterns jiggins et al 2001 and attractive traits that increase the rate of encounter with both mutualists and antagonists strauss and irwin 2004 traits that exhibit ecological pleiotropy are particularly relevant to eco evolutionary dynamics at one hand its structure of interactions may suppress the ecological consequences of trait dynamics by cancelling out opposite selective pressures delong 2017 strauss and irwin 2004 on the other hand it may generate alternative solutions for trade offs when the ecological context changes promoting eco evolutionary dynamics abrams 2012 delong and gibert 2016 the assumptions of some theories in evolutionary ecology such as the r and k selection theory macarthur and wilson 1967a implicates in a specific structure of ecological pleiotropy studying them in the context of rapid evolution is one way to enhance the theory of eco evolutionary dynamics the eco evolutionary theory is based on the idea of reciprocity between ecology and evolution reznick 2013 reciprocity occurs when there is mutual effect of ecological and evolutionary dynamics and their time scales converge hairston et al 2005 the most common route for reciprocity is density dependent selection dds kokko and lópez sepulcre 2007 sæther et al 2016 travis et al 2013 which happens when some property of natural selection strength direction or shape changes due to shifts in population density clarke 1972 mueller 1997 dds is likely to occur if ecological pleiotropy generates a trade off between the optimum trait value for density independent and density dependent ecological functions mueller 1997 mueller et al 1991 one of the first theories in dds is the r and k selection theory hereafter r k theory in 1962 robert macarthur showed how fisher s theorem of natural selection behaves when individual fitness is assumed to vary with population density assuming the logistic population growth macarthur showed that the carrying capacity k always replaces the intrinsic growth rate r as a measure of fitness when population is crowded using such argument macarthur and wilson 1967b coined the term r and k selection to explain the variation in selective pressures that shapes populations in uncrowded r selection versus crowded k selection states reznick et al 2002 in uncrowded scenarios the measure of fitness is absolute and thus advantageous phenotypes are those producing the larger numbers of offspring when population is crowded fitness becomes a relative measure and selection favours phenotypes that produce more efficient offspring bertram and masel 2019 macarthur and wilson 1967b the r k theory predicts a trade off between r and k in a sense that phenotypes with high r have a low k and vice versa aleksic et al 1993 gadgil and solbrig 1972 macarthur 1962 mueller and ayala 1981 roughgarden 1971 sæther et al 2016 later the r k theory was used to explain the variation among the different patterns of life history pianka 1970 when r selection is predominant advantageous phenotypes are those that reproduce and develop faster when k selection is predominant the r k theory predicts that selection gives advantage to phenotypes with slow development and take longer to mature pianka 1970 reznick et al 2002 however the r k theory was built under the idea of density dependent selection which is not necessarily an explanatory theory for life history variation boyce 1984 despite the extensive discussion on the applicability of the r k theory to life history evolution boyce 1984 dańko et al 2018 gadgil and solbrig 1972 jeschke et al 2008 pianka 1970 reznick et al 2002 its predictions about the trade off between r and k were corroborated by several empirical studies studying the evolution of r and k parameters in populations of drosophila melanogaster mueller and ayala 1981 was able to show that adaptation does not maximize both parameters suggesting a trade off between them in another study nakamura et al 2006 found that cancer cells with mutations correlated with rapid cell proliferation were more successful when cultivated under r selection then those cultivated under k selection while cells without this mutation were more successfully under k selection in a field experiment sæther et al 2016 suggests that females of the song bird great tit that lays a larger number of eggs had a greater fitness in low population density and lower fitness at high population density when compared with females with smaller clutch size in despite of these evidences some studies shown that the trade off between population parameters r and k is always true luckinbill 1978 rueffler et al 2006 suggests that indeed the trade off is not necessary since k is a function of r interspecific interactions such as predation may also generate dds on prey populations farkas and montejo kovacevich 2014 and therefore may shift the position of prey population across an r k continuum reznick et al 2002 evidences suggest that the effect of predation in prey adaptation varies with how much density regulation occurs in prey population for instance reznick et al 2001 found life history differences between guppies poecilia reticulata occurring on environments with high and low predation rates given the differences in resource availability between these environments the authors argue that the effect of predators over guppies life history may depend on how density regulation emerges in guppy population moreover yoshida et al 2004 found a trade off between prey vulnerability to predation and its competitive ability in their study defended less vulnerable algae showed a lower competitive ability when compared with the non defended more vulnerable ones complex traits such as body size may affect aggressiveness logue et al 2011 and consequently sensitivity to density mougeot et al 2003 likewise body size may also affect reproduction and with predation pressure delong and luhring 2018 reznick et al 2001 because predators exerts strong selection over their prey prey adaptation may be relatively rapid if there is enough additive genetic variance abrams and matsuda 1997 reznick and endler 1982 rodd and reznick 1991 allowing the occurrence of eco evolutionary feedback loops cortez 2016 palkovacs and post 2008 reznick et al 2019 since that predators effect on prey adaptation may depend on prey s density dependence the r k theory may help to unravel the patterns of these dynamics however we are not aware of theoretical studies evaluating how predation relates to the position of preys across an r k continuum much of the population theory is written in terms of mean field equations case 2000 gotelli 2008 when using these equations we assume that all individuals within a population or a subpopulation e g groups of genotypes or phenotypes interact homogeneously with each other and with the environment morozov and poggiale 2012 in reality individual idiosyncrasies matter to generate the quantitative patterns of nature the qualitative behaviour of a dynamical system describes how trajectories of variables behaves in relation to systems attractor for example steady states occur when trajectories converge to an specific point attractor limit cycles another type of behaviour occur when trajectories rotate around values as time approaches infinite case 2000 otto and day 2007 strogatz 1994 vleck et al 1971 evaluating the qualitative behaviour of dynamical systems are relevant to understand the mechanism by which system parameters interplay boit et al 2012 bradbury et al 1985 in this paper our main goal is to investigate how does the r k theory relates to the eco evolutionary dynamics of a predator prey system we approached our goal by means of mean field equations derived from the theories of population ecology case 2000 gotelli 2008 and quantitative genetics abrams and matsuda 1997 abrams et al 1993 lande 1976 we assume that prey population s logistic growth depends on the value of a quantitative trait that also describes prey vulnerability to predation then we partitioned the selection gradient in its r and k selection components we aimed to describe the interplay between system s parameters these parameters represent universal predators and preys population parameters predator s efficiency conversion handling time and death rate and prey s innate and trait dependent intrinsic growth rate and sensitivity to density abrams 2019 our analyses were guided by two main questions 1 what are the system s parameters that affect the predominance of r and k selection 2 does system s qualitative behaviour depends on whether the predominant selection on prey population is an r or a k selection we found that both predator s and prey s parameters affects the predominance of r or k selection furthermore our results suggests that the occurrence of limit cycles and runaway dynamics depends on whether the predominant selection is an r or a k selection 2 methods we used a simple model of ordinary differential equations to describe the eco evolutionary dynamics of a predator prey system here predators and preys population densities are denoted by letters p and n respectively prey vulnerability to predation is represented by a quantitative trait z prey vulnerability has enough additive genetic variance to allow the population s average vulnerability z to evolve we assume that z also affects prey s intrinsic growth rate r z and sensitivity to density l z l z can be regarded as the strength of density regulation in prey population larger the sensitivity to density stronger the density regulation in this sense the evolutionary dynamics of z depends on the net effect generated by selective pressures driven by these functions in our model the evolutionary dynamics follows the quantitative genetics framework from lande 1976 the eco evolutionary feedback loop is generated by coupling the ordinary differential equations describing predators and prey densities dynamics with trait dynamics and allowing for relatively fast evolution our model is very similar to the one used in abrams and matsuda 1997 however we assume that prey sensitivity to density is also a function of prey vulnerability this allow us to unfold the interplay between the trade off between growth rate and vulnerability to predation and the trade off between the intrinsic growth rate and the carrying capacity 2 1 ecological dynamics we assume that prey population grows with its intrinsic growth rate r z as density increases prey growth is dampened by a function l z which describes its sensitivity to density average trait value z describes prey vulnerability to predation the attack rate of predators is entirely proportional to prey vulnerability this means that predator impetus to attack depends on how vulnerable the prey is thus predators attack rate is 1 z this assumption is the same used in abrams and matsuda 1997 predators exert a holling type ii functional response with handling time h holling 1959 predators numerical response the increase in predator density for each prey consumed is linear with conversion efficiency e predator population decreases with the intrinsic death rate d given these assumptions our ecological subsystem is described by the following set of ordinary differential equations 1a d n d t n r z l z n p z 1 h z n 1b d p d t p e z n 1 h z n d at the level of individual prey fitness do not depends on the performance of individual trait in the satiation function quantity 1 1 h z n in predator functional response in this sense prey individual fitness here defined as the per capita population growth is a function of both z and z such as in abrams and matsuda 1997 d n n d t r z l z n p z 1 h z n 2 2 evolutionary dynamics evolution is defined as the temporal change in the frequency of genotypes in a given population mcpeek 2017 this change can be tracked either by direct measures of alleles frequency or by the change of the average trait value of a population lion 2017 we assume the latter the rate of change in z is proportional to the additive genetic variance of that trait multiplied by the selection gradient abrams et al 1993 lande 1976 queller 2017 the selection gradient is calculated by taking the partial derivative of the mean population fitness in respect to individual trait value averaged over the trait distribution lande 1976 lion 2017 assuming that trait distribution is constant and relatively narrow around the mean the selection gradient can be approximated by the partial derivative of individual fitness with respect to individual trait and evaluated where z z abrams and matsuda 1997 lion 2017 the equation describing the evolutionary subsystem is 1c d z d t v χ z z d n n d t z z v χ z r l n p 1 h z n whenever a prime appears in this paper such as in r and l in eq 1c it denotes the partial derivative of the function in respect to individual trait value z and evaluated at the point where z z v is the constant additive genetic variance function χ z precludes trait value from trespassing biologically reasonable values and does not affect system s stability abrams et al 1993 we assume only a bottom limit to trait thus χ z e x p s z s where s is the bottom limit a biological interpretation of s may be genetic or trait correlations that are not explicitly considered this function is the same used in abrams and matsuda 1997 2 3 the r and k selection gradients eq 1a can be rewritten in its carrying capacity format 2 d n d t n r z 1 n k z p n z 1 h z n where k z r z l z see gotelli 2008 rueffler et al 2006 or ross 2009 for details on this equality under this format the gradient of selection becomes 3 z d n n d t z z r d n n d t r k d n n d t k p 1 h z n 1 n k z r r s e l n r z k z 2 k k s e l p 1 h z n again primes represent the partial derivative of a given function in respect to z and evaluated where z z the first and the second term in the right hand side of eq 3 stands for the r and k selection gradients rsel and ksel respectively these terms describe how natural selection acts on trait through the intrinsic growth rate r and through the carrying capacity k respectively these terms can be either negative or positive values in this sense a predominant r selection happens when rsel ksel and a predominant k selection happens when ksel rsel the problem with writing the selection gradient in the carrying capacity format eq 3 is that k is an emergent property of populations jeschke et al 2008 kokko and lópez sepulcre 2007 but evolutionary dynamics should be based on individual traits bourrat 2019 rueffler et al 2006 suber 1970 to give an interpretation at the level of individual we may replace k z in eq 3 by its individual process functions r z l z rueffler et al 2006 this leads to the following terms for the r and k selection gradients respectively 4a r s e l r 1 l z n r z 4b k s e l n r l z r z l note that increasing density also increases quantity r l z n r z in the above terms this quantity describes how population density shifts the overall selection from r to k selection if we replace eqs 4 in eq 3 and simplify it we get back to the gradient of selection in 1c this means that quantity r l z n r z does not affect trait evolution but allows us to track how shifts in density change the selective milieu experienced by the evolving population if l 0 the model in abrams and matsuda 1997 density still shifts the selective milieu from rsel ksel to ksel rsel however in such case despite shifting the type of selection density does not shift the direction of selection we simulate the scenario using the model and parameters of abrams and matsuda 1997 in the supplementary information this is because the trade off between r z and k z only occurs if l is also a function of z otherwise increasing z would increases both r and k since that k r l and therefore no trade off between r and k would occur there are two situations in which selection is neither a predominant r or k selection the first situation happens when 5a r s e l k s e l 0 at this point rsel and ksel cancel out and selection is driven only by predation pressure the second scenario happens when 5b r s e l k s e l which means that the differences between rsel and ksel vanishes and these two terms add to the same selective pressure 2 4 analysis the r k trade off in order to incorporate the trade off between the intrinsic growth rate and the carrying capacity we have to define functions r z and l z these functions affect prey growth rate eq 1a in opposite directions the first is positive and the second is negative because of this a trade off between them emerges if z affects both functions the in same direction both increases or decreases with trait value regarding to biological realism of the model presented functions such as the logistic or the quadratic would be a possible approach however since we are focusing on the interplay of trade offs and how system behaviour relates to the r k continuum a simple linear function is a parsimonious approach therefore we define functions r z and l z as 6a r z r 0 r z z and 6b l z l 0 l z z where r 0 and rz in eq 6a represent the innate growth rate and the trait dependent growth rate respectively parameters l 0 and lz in eq 6b represent the innate sensitivity to density and the trait dependent sensitivity to density respectively since that k r z l z the prey s carrying capacity becomes 7 k r 0 r z z l 0 l z z given eqs 6 and 7 the only requirement for the occurrence of the r k trade off is that l z contributes more to the k than r z otherwise if the effects of r z are more predominant z affects both r z and k in the same direction here the r k trade off is an emergent property of the trade off between r z and l z in this sense we set our parameters to evaluate the emergence of the trade off as we shift parameter values see table 1 approach to question 1 what are the predators and preys parameters that affect the predominance of r and k selection here an r k continuum describes the change in the predominance of r and k selection over the range of a given parameter of prey population each extremity of this continuum is dominated by either r or k selection for this reason it is reasonable to expect that at some point in this continuum r and k selection are equal in our model this point is described by the equality r s e l k s e l the point where the r and k selection gradients are equal eq 5b thus slight changes in parameter values that allows for this equality should produce predominance of either r or k selection inequalities rsel ksel and ksel rsel in this sense to evaluate which predators and preys parameters affects the r k continuum we first replace functions 6 into system 2 2 and calculate system s interior equilibrium then we evaluate expression 5b for these equilibrium values next we use numerical analysis to evaluate how the equilibrium value of rsel and ksel changes for a range of these parameters approach to question 2 does system s qualitative behaviour depends on whether the predominant selection on prey population is an r or a k selection to evaluate the relationship between the r k continuum and systems qualitative behaviour e g the occurrence of limit cycles steady states unstable dynamics we performed bifurcation diagrams for a range of each parameter the r k continuum can be generated by simply replacing the interior equilibrium in 4 as we propose in the approach for question 1 however this would omit the behaviour of the r and k selection gradients during the qualitative behaviour thus we replace the vectors of maximum and minimum acquired from the bifurcation diagrams into eq 4 this procedure associated with the previous may allow us to understand how systems qualitative behaviour associates with the r k continuum details of the numerical analysis all our numerical analysis were performed in r r development core team 2019 the bifurcation diagrams were performed as following for simulated the temporal dynamics of our model for a range of parameter values for each case we let the system run enough time steps to reach the equilibrium value whenever this equilibrium existed then we skip the transient dynamics and stored the last 5000 time steps then we built vectors of maximum and minimum values of each variable and plotted them against the range of the parameter that produced the dynamics table 1 show the default value of each parameter in our simulations the r code for the models analysis and figures of this paper is available at mendes and del bianco faria 2020 3 results 3 1 model stability the equilibrium densities and equilibrium trait value for preys predators and trait value are 8a n r 0 l 0 8b p e r z e d h 1 r 0 l z r z l 0 8c and z d l 0 e d h r 0 where superscript in the left hand side of eqs 8a 8c indicates equilibrium density or equilibrium trait value the interior equilibrium for the case where l z 0 is discussed in abrams and matsuda 1997 the jacobian matrix and the routh hurwitz conditions for the stability of equilibrium values 8 can be found in the supplementary information note that assuming lz 0 does not change prey equilibrium nor trait equilibrium however it reduces predator equilibrium density when 9a r z l 0 r 0 l z 0 trait contribution to individual fitness is so low that advantageous phenotypes are those less vulnerable and selection leads trait value to its minimum value z s the minimum trait value s is the parameter within function χ z e x p s z s in eq 1c if s is too small prey become so invulnerable to predation that predators are brought to extinction another condition that precludes predators persistence occurs when 9b e d h 0 this is because for parameters that satisfies condition 9b predators numerical response never overcome their death rate in this sense if inequality 9b holds predator cannot persist even if inequality 9a is reversed the point where e d h is marked with an empty triangle in figs 1 b 7 8 and 9 3 2 the r k continuum replacing the interior equilibrium eq 8 in the r and k selection gradients eq 4 yields to 10a r s e l r z 1 r 0 r 0 e d h l z d r 0 2 e d h r z l 0 d 10b k s e l r 0 r z r 0 e d h l z d r 0 2 e d h r z l 0 d l z l 0 if we evaluate the eq 10 at the point where r s e l k s e l 0 condition 5a we get 11a r 0 l z r z l 0 which is a specific case of inequality 9a thus this point preclude predators persistence in the environment this point is marked with a filled triangle in fig 1a evaluating eq 10 for the point where r s e l k s e l eq 5b yields the following balance between predators and prey parameters 11b e d h r z l 0 r 0 2 eq 11b means that the r k continuum is affected by all predator parameters conversion efficiency e handling time h and death rate d and by prey s innate growth rate r 0 innate sensitivity to density l 0 and trait dependent growth rate rz fig 1 shows how these parameters affects the r k continuum this figure shows that changes in parameter values from the point marked by the filled dots which represents the point where eq 11b holds that causes the left hand side of eq 11b to be greater then its right hand side e d h r z l 0 r 0 2 produces a predominant k selection there is increasing e or r 0 or decreasing d h rz or l 0 conversely if parameter values shift in a manner that causes the right hand side of eq 11b to be greater than its left hand side r z l 0 r 0 2 e d h system is subjected to a predominant r selection decreasing e or r 0 or increasing d h rz or l 0 prey trait dependent sensitivity to density lz does not affect the equality between r and k selection gradients see eq 11b however it does affects the magnitude of r s e l and k s e l this can be visualized in fig 2 3 3 systems qualitative behaviour across the r k continuum our results suggest that the occurrence of some system s qualitative behaviours depends on whether r or k selection is predominant the type of behaviour is shown as the areas ai runaway dynamics aii steady states aiii limit cycles and aiv predator extinction in figs 3 9 the time series for these dynamics are in the supplementary information both ai and aiv represent unstable dynamics however the processes that generate them are quite different ai runaway dynamics occurred as a property of predominant r selection figs 3 4 5 7 8 and 9 when the runaway dynamics is generated by prey parameters figs 3 5 it occurred as cycles in populations densities and trait value that continuously increase in amplitude until prey extinction when the runaway dynamics is generated by predators parameters figs 7 9 we found two types of runaway the first is similar to the one found for prey parameters as predator s parameter combination holds for eq 9b marked as the empty triangles in these figures predators cannot persist and prey population goes to its carrying capacity eq 7 we still characterize this behaviour as runaway because trait value continuously increases in figs 7 9 this second type of runaway seems to be driven by predominance of k selection however remember that ai is unstable and fig 1b show that systems attractor is a predominant r selection for these parameter intervals note the empty triangle in fig 1b and in figs 7 9 aiv predator extinction occurred as a property of predominant k selection this behaviour was only generated by prey s parameters figs 3 6 because it is the result of parameters holding for eq 9a in the figures the beginning of this behaviour is marked by the black filled triangles that represent the point that holds for eq 11a from this point adaptation leads trait value to its minimum value s which is not enough to permit predator persistence this behaviour occurred for all prey parameters including lz this is interesting because lz does not affect the equality between r and k selection as shown in fig 2 however this figure shows the r k continuum based on the equilibrium values which are not attained in aiv of fig 6 instead fig 6 shows that from the point where predator persistence is hindered filled triangle system is unstable and k selection is predominant this emphasize the correlation between k selection and aiv in our model for every parameter the point where r s e l k s e l black dots in the figures occurred within aii aii represent the stable state behaviour for all parameters that affect eq 11b aii appeared at both predominant r or k selection figs 3 4 5 7 8 and 9 this means that system stability is possible in either predominant selection in our model the occurrence of limit cycles appears to be a property of predominant k selection this behaviour was caused by r 0 fig 3 and predators conversion efficiency and death rate figs 7 and 9 in fig 3 the maximum value of r selection trespass k selection but the mean value of r selection still lower than the k selection now we scrutinize the numerical results of the bifurcation diagrams we start by the prey s parameters in fig 3 when r 0 occurs within the interval 0 r 0 0 29 system produces a runaway evolution of increasing z for the interval 0 3 r 0 1 37 system produces a stable state limit cycles happen within the interval 1 38 r 0 1 59 increasing r 0 within such interval also increases the period and the amplitude of these cycles when r 0 is equal or larger than 1 6 which occurs when r 0 solves r s e l k s e l 0 predators cannot persist because preys carrying capacity is reached so fast that selection leads trait value to its minimum value z s after this point ksel is negative but ksel is greater than rsel in fig 4 a stable state occurs within the interval 0 315 rz 1 57 predator extinction occurs below this interval while runaway occurs above the point where r s e l k s e l occurs when r z 0 79 for l 0 fig 5 a stable state occurs within the interval 0 19 l 0 1 64 predator extinction occurs below this interval while runaway occurs above the point where r s e l k s e l is when l 0 0 49 for lz fig 6 a stable state occurs for lz 0 63 predator extinction occurs above this interval for our set of parameters the equality r s e l k s e l occurs for all the stable lz range but the black dots that mark this equality is omitted in this figure for predator conversion efficiency e a runaway dynamics happens for the interval of values 0 e 0 58 however if e 0 5 predators cannot persist because their numerical response does not compensates their death rate when preys are free from predation pressure they go to their carrying capacity k then the runaway dynamics only increases z while keeping prey density at k eq 7 for the interval 0 57 e 5 01 system is a stable state with equality between rsel and ksel at the point where e 1 fig 7 limit cycles occur if 5 01 e for predators handling time h the runaway dynamics happens if 1 75 h stable state happens even if predators do not get satiated h 0 which implies in a holling type i functional response stable predominant r selection is generated at the interval 1 h 1 75 while stable k selection happens inside the interval 0 h 1 fig 8 for predators death rate d the runaway happens within the interval 0 88 d similarly to the conversion efficiency predators no longer persist from 1 d the stable state for predominant r and k selections happens at 0 5 d 0 89 and 0 2 d 0 5 respectively for 0 d 0 2 dynamics generate limit cycles fig 9 4 discussion we have shown that the predominance of r and k selection depends on both preys and predators parameters in regard to predators parameters our results shown that shifting parameter value in the direction that decreases predation risk reducing conversion efficiency e or augmenting death rate d or handling time h produced a predominant r selection conversely increasing predation risk augmenting e or reducing d or h produced a predominant k selection life history theory delong and luhring 2018 reznick et al 2002 2001 predicts the opposite pattern in populations under high extrinsic mortality risk advantageous phenotypes are thought to be those that reproduce faster and therefore increases population intrinsic growth rate r which is the proxy for fitness in r selected species alternately populations under low risk of extrinsic mortality would reach to their carrying k with relatively more ease when the carrying capacity is achieved it replaces r as a proxy for fitness macarthur 1962 macarthur and wilson 1967b these predictions make our results very counter intuitive however we argue that this counter intuitive property of our findings can be explained by exploring the convoluted nature of eco evolutionary dynamics when predators are present prey does not stabilize on their carrying capacity k r 0 r z z l 0 l z z instead prey equilibrium only depends on the innate values of growth and sensitivity to density n r 0 l 0 if the presence of predators does not represent high predation risk low e or high d or h selection increases preys average vulnerability and therefore the carrying capacity k under the default parameter values in table 1 in this sense low predation risk causes prey population to stabilize too far from its carrying capacity this increases the relevance of r to fitness and thus the predominance of r selection as predation risk increases and the advantageous phenotypes are those less vulnerable the carrying capacity decreases and consequently n gets closer to k this causes prey fitness to be more dependent on k than on r which increases the predominance of k selection interestingly the way prey parameters affect the r k continuum is also related to predation risk but in the opposite direction shifting prey parameters in the direction that increases predator equilibrium density p decreasing r 0 or increasing rz or l 0 produces a predominant r selection while changing them in the direction that decreases p increasing r 0 or decreasing rz or l 0 produces a predominant k selection furthermore as we increase r 0 n gets closer to k and therefore k selection increases as r selection decreases conversely increasing l 0 increases the difference between n and k which increases r selection and decreases k selection prey trait dependent sensitivity to density does not affect the equality between r and k selection eq 11b and therefore does not shift selection predominance in despite of its effects on predator equilibrium density all these complicate dynamics can be summarized by evaluating the point where r s e l k s e l and rearranging the terms in order to separate prey s and predator s parameters 11b at one hand turning equality 11b in an inequality in which the quantity described by the predator s parameters is larger will generate a predominant k selection on the other hand if the quantity described by prey s parameters is larger r selection becomes predominant we have shown that some qualitative behaviours steady states limit cycles and runaway dynamics of the eco evolutionary dynamics predator prey system depends on prey position across the r k continuum limit cycles occurred only when k selection is the predominant selection whether the cycles generated by population dynamics leads to limit cycles or to runaway dynamics depends on which predominant selection the systems attractor occurs limit cycles only occurred as properties of predominant k selection in our model these cycles emerges when the equilibrium value of prey vulnerability is low in such case trait contribution to intrinsic growth rate r z and to sensitivity to density l z is also low however because the attack rate of predators is directly proportional to z trait contribution to predators attack rate is constant in this sense adapting to become less vulnerable to predation has almost no fitness cost this corroborates with the findings of jones and ellner 2007 which suggests that in eco evolutionary models predator prey cycles may arise when the fitness cost in reducing vulnerability is low this also explains why limit cycles only occurs in predominant k selection due to the structure of ecological pleiotropy used in this paper low equilibrium values of z only occurs when k selection is predominant in the case where the interior equilibrium is locally unstable population cycles can generate runaway dynamics abrams and matsuda 1997 in our model this behaviour occurs as a property of predominant r selection runaway evolution consists of a continuous change in trait value matsuda and abrams 1994 in the direction of increasing fitness this causes the trajectories of the ecological subsystem to increase the amplitude of their oscillations leading to instability in the case where the runaway is produced by predators parameters there are critical values of predator parameters that precludes their numerical response from overcome their death rate hampering their persistence any combination of predators parameters values that causes e d h 0 in such scenario prey population is nearly constant while trait value increases indefinitely this is due to our trade off functions however even if a non linear trade off were used predator parameters that hinder predator persistence would lead prey to its carrying capacity it is important no note that runaway dynamics is more likely to be a feature of the chosen functions than a descriptive biological phenomenon abrams and matsuda 1997 nonetheless the fact the runaway dynamics may not be common observed in nature does not means that it does not drive ecological and evolutionary dynamics the reason is that in nature correlations e g phenotypic genotypic are expected to restraint trait values within boundaries that maintain biological functions in this sense such scenario would expose extreme trait values values in the boundaries to selective pressures possibly affecting eco evolutionary dynamics indeed our results indicates that the density of the evolving population can remain constant while the r and k selection gradients change their values figs 4 6 7 8 and 9 this may seems paradoxical because r k theory describes selection under crowded versus uncrowded environments however the paradoxical property of this behaviour vanishes if we properly differentiate the carrying capacity and the equilibrium density hui 2006 following the mechanistic derivation of the logistic equation gotelli 2008 ross 2009 rueffler et al 2006 the carrying capacity is the equilibrium density of a population in relation to its resources in this sense the carrying capacity depends on how population interacts with its lower trophic levels which accounts for the intraspecific competition interspecific interactions with the same trophic level or above levels does not get in the calculation of the carrying capacity gabriel et al 2005 ross 2009 in this sense once predation and adaptive traits are incorporated prey population density at the equilibrium is different from its carrying capacity because equilibrium density is calculated taking into account the whole system in our system the carrying capacity is k r 0 r z z l 0 l z z but prey equilibrium is n r 0 l 0 consequently the predominance of r or k selection depends on the distance between n and k if this distance is too long n occurs in the exponential phase of growth rate which is under r selection if the distance is too short n falls into the k selection domain in our model predators parameters does not affect n but it does affect k z therefore the r k continuum may move even when population density is kept constant in the model analysed here we did not explicitly assumed a trade off between the intrinsic growth rate r and the carrying capacity k instead we assumed that increasing prey vulnerability z increases both intrinsic growth rate and sensitivity to density l the logistic term while the intrinsic growth rate is the malthusian parameter grafen 2015 and can be interpreted as the difference between birth and death rates the interpretation of l is less clear the sensitivity to density l can represent either a decrease in birth rate due to crowding an increase in death rate due to crowding or an intra specific competition coefficient gotelli 2008 regardless of the ecological mechanism underlying the sensitivity to density l represents the phenomenological property of population s self regulation berryman et al 2002 gabriel et al 2005 in this sense a trade off between r z and l z means that populations with more vulnerable preys have larger intrinsic growth rate r but also have a stronger self regulation assuming the notion that k r z l z the constrained logistic model see gabriel et al 2005 implies that a trade off between r and the carrying capacity k occurs only if changes in k are dominated by changes in l z rather then by changes in r z because r z is in the numerator of k our analysis indicates that this happens when r s e l k s e l 0 outside of this interval changes in k are more guided by r then by l and therefore both r and k changes in the same direction this means that for the interval r s e l k s e l 0 no trade off between r and k emerges yet even in the absence of the r k trade off population growth shifts the selective milieu from r selection to k selection this perspective unifies two historical relevant properties of the r k theory the first is the fundamental notion that k replaces r as a measure of fitness in crowded contexts macarthur 1962 and the second is the variation in the empirical evidence for the trade off between parameters r and k luckinbill 1978 mueller and ayala 1981 density dependent selection dds can be seen as the simplest route for eco evolutionary feedback loops farkas and montejo kovacevich 2014 sæther et al 2016 travis et al 2013 often dds emerges from trait correlations and ecological pleiotropy govaert et al 2018 in the model presented here there are two routes for the emergence of dds the first is the correlation between intrinsic growth rate and the sensitivity to density r z and l z respectively given the structure of this correlation a trade off between r and k emerges ensuring that advantageous phenotypes differ depending on the distance between population size and the carrying capacity the second route is the correlation between intrinsic growth rate and the holling type ii functional response dds emerges from this type of pleiotropy because the saturation in predators functional response decreases predation risk as prey density increases govaert et al 2018 abrams and matsuda 1997 assumed only this type of pleiotropy because they assumed just this second type of pleiotropy there is no trade off between r and k because of this their model assumed that k increases linearly as r gets larger nonetheless the lack of the first trade off does not means that there is no k selection in their model k selection still occurs when population gets out of the exponential phase of growth the difference is that the direction of natural selection does not changes when selection shifts from r to k selection in the section applying the r k partitioning to abrams and matsuda 1997 of the supplementary information we show that even in their model limit cycles occurs under predominant k selection while runaway dynamics occurs under predominant r selection this type of pleiotropy prey growth rate and predator functional response is also the core in the model presented by velzen and gaedke 2017 however instead of assuming evolution on prey vulnerability evolution occurs in prey defence verbally this does not make much difference but it does mathematically this is because as defence increases vulnerability decreases thus the trade off is in the opposite direction probably runaway dynamics would not occur in such scenario because prey defence cannot be negative and therefore growth rate stops increasing when defence reaches 0 moreover velzen and gaedke 2017 assumes that the carrying capacity is independent of prey defence the free logistic model see gabriel et al 2005 even under the assumption that defence affects prey intrinsic growth rate following rueffler et al 2006 this assumption cannot be interpret at the individual level because k is a function of r k r and a property of populations jeschke et al 2008 kokko and lópez sepulcre 2007 our assumption of constant and narrow distribution of trait value facilitate the analysis but its relaxation may also increase biological realism rapid adaptations is likely to depend on and decrease the amount of additive genetic variation hendry 2013 lande and shannon 1996 retel et al 2019 with low additive genetic variance systems behaviour is guided basically by the ecological subsystem cortez 2016 which dampens eco evolutionary feedback loop furthermore quantitative traits usually have complex genetic control that generate several correlations among genes and phenotypes arnold 1992 lande 1979 1982 wagner 1989 such correlations are also expected to affect trait distribution and additive genetic variance arnold et al 2008 affecting the feedback loop spatial dynamics is likely to affect eco evolutionary dynamics of predator prey interactions using an individual based model colombo et al 2019 shown that prey and predator mobility affects the eco evolution of predators perceptual range because their model is spatially explicit density dependence is likely to play a main role in cases in which the populations are more aggregated than dispersed moreover our model could also be extended to incorporate co evolutionary dynamics this could be done by either assuming that predators evolve their attack rate at some fitness cost in response to prey vulnerability an unidirectional axis or assuming that predator s trait evolve to match prey trait a bidirectional axis yamamichi et al 2019 shows that the second case can be an emergent property of the co evolution of multidimensional traits in predator prey interactions multidimensionality of adaptive traits can be easily incorporated in our framework by assuming for example two correlated traits z 1 and z 2 that are genetically correlated by a correlation matrix g lande 1982 and generates trade off in their ecological meanings these extensions would be useful to study the intersection of r k theory and eco evolutionary dynamics taking the inherent complexity of eco evo feedbacks de meester et al 2019 dds and rapid evolution are the unifying perspectives bringing the r k theory and eco evolutionary dynamics together while dds does it by means of a specific structure of ecological pleiotropy rapid evolution converges the temporal dynamics of ecological and evolutionary processes hairston et al 2005 our model suggests that the occurrence of certain qualitative features in systems dynamics can help to predict the position of the evolving population across an r k continuum this is relevant because depending on populations position alternative ecological and evolutionary trajectories are expected chikatsu et al 2002 nakamura et al 2006 sæther et al 2016 this may be specially relevant for systems known to be influenced by eco evolutionary feedback loops such as predator prey interactions abrams and matsuda 1997 ellner and becks 2011 jones and ellner 2007 meyer et al 2006 yoshida et al 2003 despite several decades of incorporation of eco evolutionary feedback loops in theoretical models govaert et al 2018 we still lack a proper theoretical framework de meester et al 2019 hendry 2019 although much empirical and theoretical effort still must be done integrating different theories in ecology and evolution is a step forward in the direction to develop such framework here we argue that partitioning the r and k selection gradients is a simple way to unravel the

24739,the effects of a single trait on more than one ecological function is called ecological pleiotropy traits that exhibit ecological pleiotropy are relevant to eco evolutionary dynamics because the structure of interaction between the trait and its ecological functions alters how eco evolutionary feedback loops emerge density dependent selection dds assumes that a single trait affects both density independent and density dependent population growth through ecological pleiotropy and is one of the simplest routes for feedback loops the r k theory proposes a mechanism by which dds occurs but its predictions were poorly explored in an eco evolutionary context some assumptions of the r k theory seems to be relevant for the eco evolution of predator prey interactions however the relationship between these theories were poorly explored here we investigate how does the r k theory relates to the eco evolution of predator prey systems we seek to answer two questions 1 what are the system s parameters that affect the predominance of r and k selection 2 does system s qualitative behaviour depends on whether the predominant selection on prey population is an r or a k selection to answer these questions we built a model of differential equations describing the eco evolutionary dynamics of a predator prey system we assume that prey vulnerability to predation is an adaptive trait that affects preys density dependent growth rate through ecological pleiotropy then we partitioned the selection gradient in its r and k selection components and evaluate how their magnitude relates to systems behaviour we found that stable predator prey cycles only occurs when k selection is predominant when r selection is predominant cycles lead to a runaway dynamics furthermore the way predators parameters affect prey position in the r k continuum depends on how they affect predation risk while increasing predation risk increases k selection decreasing it increases r selection we discuss the relevance of the structure of ecological pleiotropy to our results and the perspectives that unifies the r k theory and eco evolutionary dynamics keywords prey adaptation rapid adaptation

2004 examples of traits that exhibit ecological pleiotropy are body mass and size delong and gibert 2016 delong and luhring 2018 phenology friberg et al 2008 colour patterns jiggins et al 2001 and attractive traits that increase the rate of encounter with both mutualists and antagonists strauss and irwin 2004 traits that exhibit ecological pleiotropy are particularly relevant to eco evolutionary dynamics at one hand its structure of interactions may suppress the ecological consequences of trait dynamics by cancelling out opposite selective pressures delong 2017 strauss and irwin 2004 on the other hand it may generate alternative solutions for trade offs when the ecological context changes promoting eco evolutionary dynamics abrams 2012 delong and gibert 2016 the assumptions of some theories in evolutionary ecology such as the r and k selection theory macarthur and wilson 1967a implicates in a specific structure of ecological pleiotropy studying them in the context of rapid evolution is one way to enhance the theory of eco evolutionary dynamics the eco evolutionary theory is based on the idea of reciprocity between ecology and evolution reznick 2013 reciprocity occurs when there is mutual effect of ecological and evolutionary dynamics and their time scales converge hairston et al 2005 the most common route for reciprocity is density dependent selection dds kokko and lópez sepulcre 2007 sæther et al 2016 travis et al 2013 which happens when some property of natural selection strength direction or shape changes due to shifts in population density clarke 1972 mueller 1997 dds is likely to occur if ecological pleiotropy generates a trade off between the optimum trait value for density independent and density dependent ecological functions mueller 1997 mueller et al 1991 one of the first theories in dds is the r and k selection theory hereafter r k theory in 1962 robert macarthur showed how fisher s theorem of natural selection behaves when individual fitness is assumed to vary with population density assuming the logistic population growth macarthur showed that the carrying capacity k always replaces the intrinsic growth rate r as a measure of fitness when population is crowded using such argument macarthur and wilson 1967b coined the term r and k selection to explain the variation in selective pressures that shapes populations in uncrowded r selection versus crowded k selection states reznick et al 2002 in uncrowded scenarios the measure of fitness is absolute and thus advantageous phenotypes are those producing the larger numbers of offspring when population is crowded fitness becomes a relative measure and selection favours phenotypes that produce more efficient offspring bertram and masel 2019 macarthur and wilson 1967b the r k theory predicts a trade off between r and k in a sense that phenotypes with high r have a low k and vice versa aleksic et al 1993 gadgil and solbrig 1972 macarthur 1962 mueller and ayala 1981 roughgarden 1971 sæther et al 2016 later the r k theory was used to explain the variation among the different patterns of life history pianka 1970 when r selection is predominant advantageous phenotypes are those that reproduce and develop faster when k selection is predominant the r k theory predicts that selection gives advantage to phenotypes with slow development and take longer to mature pianka 1970 reznick et al 2002 however the r k theory was built under the idea of density dependent selection which is not necessarily an explanatory theory for life history variation boyce 1984 despite the extensive discussion on the applicability of the r k theory to life history evolution boyce 1984 dańko et al 2018 gadgil and solbrig 1972 jeschke et al 2008 pianka 1970 reznick et al 2002 its predictions about the trade off between r and k were corroborated by several empirical studies studying the evolution of r and k parameters in populations of drosophila melanogaster mueller and ayala 1981 was able to show that adaptation does not maximize both parameters suggesting a trade off between them in another study nakamura et al 2006 found that cancer cells with mutations correlated with rapid cell proliferation were more successful when cultivated under r selection then those cultivated under k selection while cells without this mutation were more successfully under k selection in a field experiment sæther et al 2016 suggests that females of the song bird great tit that lays a larger number of eggs had a greater fitness in low population density and lower fitness at high population density when compared with females with smaller clutch size in despite of these evidences some studies shown that the trade off between population parameters r and k is always true luckinbill 1978 rueffler et al 2006 suggests that indeed the trade off is not necessary since k is a function of r interspecific interactions such as predation may also generate dds on prey populations farkas and montejo kovacevich 2014 and therefore may shift the position of prey population across an r k continuum reznick et al 2002 evidences suggest that the effect of predation in prey adaptation varies with how much density regulation occurs in prey population for instance reznick et al 2001 found life history differences between guppies poecilia reticulata occurring on environments with high and low predation rates given the differences in resource availability between these environments the authors argue that the effect of predators over guppies life history may depend on how density regulation emerges in guppy population moreover yoshida et al 2004 found a trade off between prey vulnerability to predation and its competitive ability in their study defended less vulnerable algae showed a lower competitive ability when compared with the non defended more vulnerable ones complex traits such as body size may affect aggressiveness logue et al 2011 and consequently sensitivity to density mougeot et al 2003 likewise body size may also affect reproduction and with predation pressure delong and luhring 2018 reznick et al 2001 because predators exerts strong selection over their prey prey adaptation may be relatively rapid if there is enough additive genetic variance abrams and matsuda 1997 reznick and endler 1982 rodd and reznick 1991 allowing the occurrence of eco evolutionary feedback loops cortez 2016 palkovacs and post 2008 reznick et al 2019 since that predators effect on prey adaptation may depend on prey s density dependence the r k theory may help to unravel the patterns of these dynamics however we are not aware of theoretical studies evaluating how predation relates to the position of preys across an r k continuum much of the population theory is written in terms of mean field equations case 2000 gotelli 2008 when using these equations we assume that all individuals within a population or a subpopulation e g groups of genotypes or phenotypes interact homogeneously with each other and with the environment morozov and poggiale 2012 in reality individual idiosyncrasies matter to generate the quantitative patterns of nature the qualitative behaviour of a dynamical system describes how trajectories of variables behaves in relation to systems attractor for example steady states occur when trajectories converge to an specific point attractor limit cycles another type of behaviour occur when trajectories rotate around values as time approaches infinite case 2000 otto and day 2007 strogatz 1994 vleck et al 1971 evaluating the qualitative behaviour of dynamical systems are relevant to understand the mechanism by which system parameters interplay boit et al 2012 bradbury et al 1985 in this paper our main goal is to investigate how does the r k theory relates to the eco evolutionary dynamics of a predator prey system we approached our goal by means of mean field equations derived from the theories of population ecology case 2000 gotelli 2008 and quantitative genetics abrams and matsuda 1997 abrams et al 1993 lande 1976 we assume that prey population s logistic growth depends on the value of a quantitative trait that also describes prey vulnerability to predation then we partitioned the selection gradient in its r and k selection components we aimed to describe the interplay between system s parameters these parameters represent universal predators and preys population parameters predator s efficiency conversion handling time and death rate and prey s innate and trait dependent intrinsic growth rate and sensitivity to density abrams 2019 our analyses were guided by two main questions 1 what are the system s parameters that affect the predominance of r and k selection 2 does system s qualitative behaviour depends on whether the predominant selection on prey population is an r or a k selection we found that both predator s and prey s parameters affects the predominance of r or k selection furthermore our results suggests that the occurrence of limit cycles and runaway dynamics depends on whether the predominant selection is an r or a k selection 2 methods we used a simple model of ordinary differential equations to describe the eco evolutionary dynamics of a predator prey system here predators and preys population densities are denoted by letters p and n respectively prey vulnerability to predation is represented by a quantitative trait z prey vulnerability has enough additive genetic variance to allow the population s average vulnerability z to evolve we assume that z also affects prey s intrinsic growth rate r z and sensitivity to density l z l z can be regarded as the strength of density regulation in prey population larger the sensitivity to density stronger the density regulation in this sense the evolutionary dynamics of z depends on the net effect generated by selective pressures driven by these functions in our model the evolutionary dynamics follows the quantitative genetics framework from lande 1976 the eco evolutionary feedback loop is generated by coupling the ordinary differential equations describing predators and prey densities dynamics with trait dynamics and allowing for relatively fast evolution our model is very similar to the one used in abrams and matsuda 1997 however we assume that prey sensitivity to density is also a function of prey vulnerability this allow us to unfold the interplay between the trade off between growth rate and vulnerability to predation and the trade off between the intrinsic growth rate and the carrying capacity 2 1 ecological dynamics we assume that prey population grows with its intrinsic growth rate r z as density increases prey growth is dampened by a function l z which describes its sensitivity to density average trait value z describes prey vulnerability to predation the attack rate of predators is entirely proportional to prey vulnerability this means that predator impetus to attack depends on how vulnerable the prey is thus predators attack rate is 1 z this assumption is the same used in abrams and matsuda 1997 predators exert a holling type ii functional response with handling time h holling 1959 predators numerical response the increase in predator density for each prey consumed is linear with conversion efficiency e predator population decreases with the intrinsic death rate d given these assumptions our ecological subsystem is described by the following set of ordinary differential equations 1a d n d t n r z l z n p z 1 h z n 1b d p d t p e z n 1 h z n d at the level of individual prey fitness do not depends on the performance of individual trait in the satiation function quantity 1 1 h z n in predator functional response in this sense prey individual fitness here defined as the per capita population growth is a function of both z and z such as in abrams and matsuda 1997 d n n d t r z l z n p z 1 h z n 2 2 evolutionary dynamics evolution is defined as the temporal change in the frequency of genotypes in a given population mcpeek 2017 this change can be tracked either by direct measures of alleles frequency or by the change of the average trait value of a population lion 2017 we assume the latter the rate of change in z is proportional to the additive genetic variance of that trait multiplied by the selection gradient abrams et al 1993 lande 1976 queller 2017 the selection gradient is calculated by taking the partial derivative of the mean population fitness in respect to individual trait value averaged over the trait distribution lande 1976 lion 2017 assuming that trait distribution is constant and relatively narrow around the mean the selection gradient can be approximated by the partial derivative of individual fitness with respect to individual trait and evaluated where z z abrams and matsuda 1997 lion 2017 the equation describing the evolutionary subsystem is 1c d z d t v χ z z d n n d t z z v χ z r l n p 1 h z n whenever a prime appears in this paper such as in r and l in eq 1c it denotes the partial derivative of the function in respect to individual trait value z and evaluated at the point where z z v is the constant additive genetic variance function χ z precludes trait value from trespassing biologically reasonable values and does not affect system s stability abrams et al 1993 we assume only a bottom limit to trait thus χ z e x p s z s where s is the bottom limit a biological interpretation of s may be genetic or trait correlations that are not explicitly considered this function is the same used in abrams and matsuda 1997 2 3 the r and k selection gradients eq 1a can be rewritten in its carrying capacity format 2 d n d t n r z 1 n k z p n z 1 h z n where k z r z l z see gotelli 2008 rueffler et al 2006 or ross 2009 for details on this equality under this format the gradient of selection becomes 3 z d n n d t z z r d n n d t r k d n n d t k p 1 h z n 1 n k z r r s e l n r z k z 2 k k s e l p 1 h z n again primes represent the partial derivative of a given function in respect to z and evaluated where z z the first and the second term in the right hand side of eq 3 stands for the r and k selection gradients rsel and ksel respectively these terms describe how natural selection acts on trait through the intrinsic growth rate r and through the carrying capacity k respectively these terms can be either negative or positive values in this sense a predominant r selection happens when rsel ksel and a predominant k selection happens when ksel rsel the problem with writing the selection gradient in the carrying capacity format eq 3 is that k is an emergent property of populations jeschke et al 2008 kokko and lópez sepulcre 2007 but evolutionary dynamics should be based on individual traits bourrat 2019 rueffler et al 2006 suber 1970 to give an interpretation at the level of individual we may replace k z in eq 3 by its individual process functions r z l z rueffler et al 2006 this leads to the following terms for the r and k selection gradients respectively 4a r s e l r 1 l z n r z 4b k s e l n r l z r z l note that increasing density also increases quantity r l z n r z in the above terms this quantity describes how population density shifts the overall selection from r to k selection if we replace eqs 4 in eq 3 and simplify it we get back to the gradient of selection in 1c this means that quantity r l z n r z does not affect trait evolution but allows us to track how shifts in density change the selective milieu experienced by the evolving population if l 0 the model in abrams and matsuda 1997 density still shifts the selective milieu from rsel ksel to ksel rsel however in such case despite shifting the type of selection density does not shift the direction of selection we simulate the scenario using the model and parameters of abrams and matsuda 1997 in the supplementary information this is because the trade off between r z and k z only occurs if l is also a function of z otherwise increasing z would increases both r and k since that k r l and therefore no trade off between r and k would occur there are two situations in which selection is neither a predominant r or k selection the first situation happens when 5a r s e l k s e l 0 at this point rsel and ksel cancel out and selection is driven only by predation pressure the second scenario happens when 5b r s e l k s e l which means that the differences between rsel and ksel vanishes and these two terms add to the same selective pressure 2 4 analysis the r k trade off in order to incorporate the trade off between the intrinsic growth rate and the carrying capacity we have to define functions r z and l z these functions affect prey growth rate eq 1a in opposite directions the first is positive and the second is negative because of this a trade off between them emerges if z affects both functions the in same direction both increases or decreases with trait value regarding to biological realism of the model presented functions such as the logistic or the quadratic would be a possible approach however since we are focusing on the interplay of trade offs and how system behaviour relates to the r k continuum a simple linear function is a parsimonious approach therefore we define functions r z and l z as 6a r z r 0 r z z and 6b l z l 0 l z z where r 0 and rz in eq 6a represent the innate growth rate and the trait dependent growth rate respectively parameters l 0 and lz in eq 6b represent the innate sensitivity to density and the trait dependent sensitivity to density respectively since that k r z l z the prey s carrying capacity becomes 7 k r 0 r z z l 0 l z z given eqs 6 and 7 the only requirement for the occurrence of the r k trade off is that l z contributes more to the k than r z otherwise if the effects of r z are more predominant z affects both r z and k in the same direction here the r k trade off is an emergent property of the trade off between r z and l z in this sense we set our parameters to evaluate the emergence of the trade off as we shift parameter values see table 1 approach to question 1 what are the predators and preys parameters that affect the predominance of r and k selection here an r k continuum describes the change in the predominance of r and k selection over the range of a given parameter of prey population each extremity of this continuum is dominated by either r or k selection for this reason it is reasonable to expect that at some point in this continuum r and k selection are equal in our model this point is described by the equality r s e l k s e l the point where the r and k selection gradients are equal eq 5b thus slight changes in parameter values that allows for this equality should produce predominance of either r or k selection inequalities rsel ksel and ksel rsel in this sense to evaluate which predators and preys parameters affects the r k continuum we first replace functions 6 into system 2 2 and calculate system s interior equilibrium then we evaluate expression 5b for these equilibrium values next we use numerical analysis to evaluate how the equilibrium value of rsel and ksel changes for a range of these parameters approach to question 2 does system s qualitative behaviour depends on whether the predominant selection on prey population is an r or a k selection to evaluate the relationship between the r k continuum and systems qualitative behaviour e g the occurrence of limit cycles steady states unstable dynamics we performed bifurcation diagrams for a range of each parameter the r k continuum can be generated by simply replacing the interior equilibrium in 4 as we propose in the approach for question 1 however this would omit the behaviour of the r and k selection gradients during the qualitative behaviour thus we replace the vectors of maximum and minimum acquired from the bifurcation diagrams into eq 4 this procedure associated with the previous may allow us to understand how systems qualitative behaviour associates with the r k continuum details of the numerical analysis all our numerical analysis were performed in r r development core team 2019 the bifurcation diagrams were performed as following for simulated the temporal dynamics of our model for a range of parameter values for each case we let the system run enough time steps to reach the equilibrium value whenever this equilibrium existed then we skip the transient dynamics and stored the last 5000 time steps then we built vectors of maximum and minimum values of each variable and plotted them against the range of the parameter that produced the dynamics table 1 show the default value of each parameter in our simulations the r code for the models analysis and figures of this paper is available at mendes and del bianco faria 2020 3 results 3 1 model stability the equilibrium densities and equilibrium trait value for preys predators and trait value are 8a n r 0 l 0 8b p e r z e d h 1 r 0 l z r z l 0 8c and z d l 0 e d h r 0 where superscript in the left hand side of eqs 8a 8c indicates equilibrium density or equilibrium trait value the interior equilibrium for the case where l z 0 is discussed in abrams and matsuda 1997 the jacobian matrix and the routh hurwitz conditions for the stability of equilibrium values 8 can be found in the supplementary information note that assuming lz 0 does not change prey equilibrium nor trait equilibrium however it reduces predator equilibrium density when 9a r z l 0 r 0 l z 0 trait contribution to individual fitness is so low that advantageous phenotypes are those less vulnerable and selection leads trait value to its minimum value z s the minimum trait value s is the parameter within function χ z e x p s z s in eq 1c if s is too small prey become so invulnerable to predation that predators are brought to extinction another condition that precludes predators persistence occurs when 9b e d h 0 this is because for parameters that satisfies condition 9b predators numerical response never overcome their death rate in this sense if inequality 9b holds predator cannot persist even if inequality 9a is reversed the point where e d h is marked with an empty triangle in figs 1 b 7 8 and 9 3 2 the r k continuum replacing the interior equilibrium eq 8 in the r and k selection gradients eq 4 yields to 10a r s e l r z 1 r 0 r 0 e d h l z d r 0 2 e d h r z l 0 d 10b k s e l r 0 r z r 0 e d h l z d r 0 2 e d h r z l 0 d l z l 0 if we evaluate the eq 10 at the point where r s e l k s e l 0 condition 5a we get 11a r 0 l z r z l 0 which is a specific case of inequality 9a thus this point preclude predators persistence in the environment this point is marked with a filled triangle in fig 1a evaluating eq 10 for the point where r s e l k s e l eq 5b yields the following balance between predators and prey parameters 11b e d h r z l 0 r 0 2 eq 11b means that the r k continuum is affected by all predator parameters conversion efficiency e handling time h and death rate d and by prey s innate growth rate r 0 innate sensitivity to density l 0 and trait dependent growth rate rz fig 1 shows how these parameters affects the r k continuum this figure shows that changes in parameter values from the point marked by the filled dots which represents the point where eq 11b holds that causes the left hand side of eq 11b to be greater then its right hand side e d h r z l 0 r 0 2 produces a predominant k selection there is increasing e or r 0 or decreasing d h rz or l 0 conversely if parameter values shift in a manner that causes the right hand side of eq 11b to be greater than its left hand side r z l 0 r 0 2 e d h system is subjected to a predominant r selection decreasing e or r 0 or increasing d h rz or l 0 prey trait dependent sensitivity to density lz does not affect the equality between r and k selection gradients see eq 11b however it does affects the magnitude of r s e l and k s e l this can be visualized in fig 2 3 3 systems qualitative behaviour across the r k continuum our results suggest that the occurrence of some system s qualitative behaviours depends on whether r or k selection is predominant the type of behaviour is shown as the areas ai runaway dynamics aii steady states aiii limit cycles and aiv predator extinction in figs 3 9 the time series for these dynamics are in the supplementary information both ai and aiv represent unstable dynamics however the processes that generate them are quite different ai runaway dynamics occurred as a property of predominant r selection figs 3 4 5 7 8 and 9 when the runaway dynamics is generated by prey parameters figs 3 5 it occurred as cycles in populations densities and trait value that continuously increase in amplitude until prey extinction when the runaway dynamics is generated by predators parameters figs 7 9 we found two types of runaway the first is similar to the one found for prey parameters as predator s parameter combination holds for eq 9b marked as the empty triangles in these figures predators cannot persist and prey population goes to its carrying capacity eq 7 we still characterize this behaviour as runaway because trait value continuously increases in figs 7 9 this second type of runaway seems to be driven by predominance of k selection however remember that ai is unstable and fig 1b show that systems attractor is a predominant r selection for these parameter intervals note the empty triangle in fig 1b and in figs 7 9 aiv predator extinction occurred as a property of predominant k selection this behaviour was only generated by prey s parameters figs 3 6 because it is the result of parameters holding for eq 9a in the figures the beginning of this behaviour is marked by the black filled triangles that represent the point that holds for eq 11a from this point adaptation leads trait value to its minimum value s which is not enough to permit predator persistence this behaviour occurred for all prey parameters including lz this is interesting because lz does not affect the equality between r and k selection as shown in fig 2 however this figure shows the r k continuum based on the equilibrium values which are not attained in aiv of fig 6 instead fig 6 shows that from the point where predator persistence is hindered filled triangle system is unstable and k selection is predominant this emphasize the correlation between k selection and aiv in our model for every parameter the point where r s e l k s e l black dots in the figures occurred within aii aii represent the stable state behaviour for all parameters that affect eq 11b aii appeared at both predominant r or k selection figs 3 4 5 7 8 and 9 this means that system stability is possible in either predominant selection in our model the occurrence of limit cycles appears to be a property of predominant k selection this behaviour was caused by r 0 fig 3 and predators conversion efficiency and death rate figs 7 and 9 in fig 3 the maximum value of r selection trespass k selection but the mean value of r selection still lower than the k selection now we scrutinize the numerical results of the bifurcation diagrams we start by the prey s parameters in fig 3 when r 0 occurs within the interval 0 r 0 0 29 system produces a runaway evolution of increasing z for the interval 0 3 r 0 1 37 system produces a stable state limit cycles happen within the interval 1 38 r 0 1 59 increasing r 0 within such interval also increases the period and the amplitude of these cycles when r 0 is equal or larger than 1 6 which occurs when r 0 solves r s e l k s e l 0 predators cannot persist because preys carrying capacity is reached so fast that selection leads trait value to its minimum value z s after this point ksel is negative but ksel is greater than rsel in fig 4 a stable state occurs within the interval 0 315 rz 1 57 predator extinction occurs below this interval while runaway occurs above the point where r s e l k s e l occurs when r z 0 79 for l 0 fig 5 a stable state occurs within the interval 0 19 l 0 1 64 predator extinction occurs below this interval while runaway occurs above the point where r s e l k s e l is when l 0 0 49 for lz fig 6 a stable state occurs for lz 0 63 predator extinction occurs above this interval for our set of parameters the equality r s e l k s e l occurs for all the stable lz range but the black dots that mark this equality is omitted in this figure for predator conversion efficiency e a runaway dynamics happens for the interval of values 0 e 0 58 however if e 0 5 predators cannot persist because their numerical response does not compensates their death rate when preys are free from predation pressure they go to their carrying capacity k then the runaway dynamics only increases z while keeping prey density at k eq 7 for the interval 0 57 e 5 01 system is a stable state with equality between rsel and ksel at the point where e 1 fig 7 limit cycles occur if 5 01 e for predators handling time h the runaway dynamics happens if 1 75 h stable state happens even if predators do not get satiated h 0 which implies in a holling type i functional response stable predominant r selection is generated at the interval 1 h 1 75 while stable k selection happens inside the interval 0 h 1 fig 8 for predators death rate d the runaway happens within the interval 0 88 d similarly to the conversion efficiency predators no longer persist from 1 d the stable state for predominant r and k selections happens at 0 5 d 0 89 and 0 2 d 0 5 respectively for 0 d 0 2 dynamics generate limit cycles fig 9 4 discussion we have shown that the predominance of r and k selection depends on both preys and predators parameters in regard to predators parameters our results shown that shifting parameter value in the direction that decreases predation risk reducing conversion efficiency e or augmenting death rate d or handling time h produced a predominant r selection conversely increasing predation risk augmenting e or reducing d or h produced a predominant k selection life history theory delong and luhring 2018 reznick et al 2002 2001 predicts the opposite pattern in populations under high extrinsic mortality risk advantageous phenotypes are thought to be those that reproduce faster and therefore increases population intrinsic growth rate r which is the proxy for fitness in r selected species alternately populations under low risk of extrinsic mortality would reach to their carrying k with relatively more ease when the carrying capacity is achieved it replaces r as a proxy for fitness macarthur 1962 macarthur and wilson 1967b these predictions make our results very counter intuitive however we argue that this counter intuitive property of our findings can be explained by exploring the convoluted nature of eco evolutionary dynamics when predators are present prey does not stabilize on their carrying capacity k r 0 r z z l 0 l z z instead prey equilibrium only depends on the innate values of growth and sensitivity to density n r 0 l 0 if the presence of predators does not represent high predation risk low e or high d or h selection increases preys average vulnerability and therefore the carrying capacity k under the default parameter values in table 1 in this sense low predation risk causes prey population to stabilize too far from its carrying capacity this increases the relevance of r to fitness and thus the predominance of r selection as predation risk increases and the advantageous phenotypes are those less vulnerable the carrying capacity decreases and consequently n gets closer to k this causes prey fitness to be more dependent on k than on r which increases the predominance of k selection interestingly the way prey parameters affect the r k continuum is also related to predation risk but in the opposite direction shifting prey parameters in the direction that increases predator equilibrium density p decreasing r 0 or increasing rz or l 0 produces a predominant r selection while changing them in the direction that decreases p increasing r 0 or decreasing rz or l 0 produces a predominant k selection furthermore as we increase r 0 n gets closer to k and therefore k selection increases as r selection decreases conversely increasing l 0 increases the difference between n and k which increases r selection and decreases k selection prey trait dependent sensitivity to density does not affect the equality between r and k selection eq 11b and therefore does not shift selection predominance in despite of its effects on predator equilibrium density all these complicate dynamics can be summarized by evaluating the point where r s e l k s e l and rearranging the terms in order to separate prey s and predator s parameters 11b at one hand turning equality 11b in an inequality in which the quantity described by the predator s parameters is larger will generate a predominant k selection on the other hand if the quantity described by prey s parameters is larger r selection becomes predominant we have shown that some qualitative behaviours steady states limit cycles and runaway dynamics of the eco evolutionary dynamics predator prey system depends on prey position across the r k continuum limit cycles occurred only when k selection is the predominant selection whether the cycles generated by population dynamics leads to limit cycles or to runaway dynamics depends on which predominant selection the systems attractor occurs limit cycles only occurred as properties of predominant k selection in our model these cycles emerges when the equilibrium value of prey vulnerability is low in such case trait contribution to intrinsic growth rate r z and to sensitivity to density l z is also low however because the attack rate of predators is directly proportional to z trait contribution to predators attack rate is constant in this sense adapting to become less vulnerable to predation has almost no fitness cost this corroborates with the findings of jones and ellner 2007 which suggests that in eco evolutionary models predator prey cycles may arise when the fitness cost in reducing vulnerability is low this also explains why limit cycles only occurs in predominant k selection due to the structure of ecological pleiotropy used in this paper low equilibrium values of z only occurs when k selection is predominant in the case where the interior equilibrium is locally unstable population cycles can generate runaway dynamics abrams and matsuda 1997 in our model this behaviour occurs as a property of predominant r selection runaway evolution consists of a continuous change in trait value matsuda and abrams 1994 in the direction of increasing fitness this causes the trajectories of the ecological subsystem to increase the amplitude of their oscillations leading to instability in the case where the runaway is produced by predators parameters there are critical values of predator parameters that precludes their numerical response from overcome their death rate hampering their persistence any combination of predators parameters values that causes e d h 0 in such scenario prey population is nearly constant while trait value increases indefinitely this is due to our trade off functions however even if a non linear trade off were used predator parameters that hinder predator persistence would lead prey to its carrying capacity it is important no note that runaway dynamics is more likely to be a feature of the chosen functions than a descriptive biological phenomenon abrams and matsuda 1997 nonetheless the fact the runaway dynamics may not be common observed in nature does not means that it does not drive ecological and evolutionary dynamics the reason is that in nature correlations e g phenotypic genotypic are expected to restraint trait values within boundaries that maintain biological functions in this sense such scenario would expose extreme trait values values in the boundaries to selective pressures possibly affecting eco evolutionary dynamics indeed our results indicates that the density of the evolving population can remain constant while the r and k selection gradients change their values figs 4 6 7 8 and 9 this may seems paradoxical because r k theory describes selection under crowded versus uncrowded environments however the paradoxical property of this behaviour vanishes if we properly differentiate the carrying capacity and the equilibrium density hui 2006 following the mechanistic derivation of the logistic equation gotelli 2008 ross 2009 rueffler et al 2006 the carrying capacity is the equilibrium density of a population in relation to its resources in this sense the carrying capacity depends on how population interacts with its lower trophic levels which accounts for the intraspecific competition interspecific interactions with the same trophic level or above levels does not get in the calculation of the carrying capacity gabriel et al 2005 ross 2009 in this sense once predation and adaptive traits are incorporated prey population density at the equilibrium is different from its carrying capacity because equilibrium density is calculated taking into account the whole system in our system the carrying capacity is k r 0 r z z l 0 l z z but prey equilibrium is n r 0 l 0 consequently the predominance of r or k selection depends on the distance between n and k if this distance is too long n occurs in the exponential phase of growth rate which is under r selection if the distance is too short n falls into the k selection domain in our model predators parameters does not affect n but it does affect k z therefore the r k continuum may move even when population density is kept constant in the model analysed here we did not explicitly assumed a trade off between the intrinsic growth rate r and the carrying capacity k instead we assumed that increasing prey vulnerability z increases both intrinsic growth rate and sensitivity to density l the logistic term while the intrinsic growth rate is the malthusian parameter grafen 2015 and can be interpreted as the difference between birth and death rates the interpretation of l is less clear the sensitivity to density l can represent either a decrease in birth rate due to crowding an increase in death rate due to crowding or an intra specific competition coefficient gotelli 2008 regardless of the ecological mechanism underlying the sensitivity to density l represents the phenomenological property of population s self regulation berryman et al 2002 gabriel et al 2005 in this sense a trade off between r z and l z means that populations with more vulnerable preys have larger intrinsic growth rate r but also have a stronger self regulation assuming the notion that k r z l z the constrained logistic model see gabriel et al 2005 implies that a trade off between r and the carrying capacity k occurs only if changes in k are dominated by changes in l z rather then by changes in r z because r z is in the numerator of k our analysis indicates that this happens when r s e l k s e l 0 outside of this interval changes in k are more guided by r then by l and therefore both r and k changes in the same direction this means that for the interval r s e l k s e l 0 no trade off between r and k emerges yet even in the absence of the r k trade off population growth shifts the selective milieu from r selection to k selection this perspective unifies two historical relevant properties of the r k theory the first is the fundamental notion that k replaces r as a measure of fitness in crowded contexts macarthur 1962 and the second is the variation in the empirical evidence for the trade off between parameters r and k luckinbill 1978 mueller and ayala 1981 density dependent selection dds can be seen as the simplest route for eco evolutionary feedback loops farkas and montejo kovacevich 2014 sæther et al 2016 travis et al 2013 often dds emerges from trait correlations and ecological pleiotropy govaert et al 2018 in the model presented here there are two routes for the emergence of dds the first is the correlation between intrinsic growth rate and the sensitivity to density r z and l z respectively given the structure of this correlation a trade off between r and k emerges ensuring that advantageous phenotypes differ depending on the distance between population size and the carrying capacity the second route is the correlation between intrinsic growth rate and the holling type ii functional response dds emerges from this type of pleiotropy because the saturation in predators functional response decreases predation risk as prey density increases govaert et al 2018 abrams and matsuda 1997 assumed only this type of pleiotropy because they assumed just this second type of pleiotropy there is no trade off between r and k because of this their model assumed that k increases linearly as r gets larger nonetheless the lack of the first trade off does not means that there is no k selection in their model k selection still occurs when population gets out of the exponential phase of growth the difference is that the direction of natural selection does not changes when selection shifts from r to k selection in the section applying the r k partitioning to abrams and matsuda 1997 of the supplementary information we show that even in their model limit cycles occurs under predominant k selection while runaway dynamics occurs under predominant r selection this type of pleiotropy prey growth rate and predator functional response is also the core in the model presented by velzen and gaedke 2017 however instead of assuming evolution on prey vulnerability evolution occurs in prey defence verbally this does not make much difference but it does mathematically this is because as defence increases vulnerability decreases thus the trade off is in the opposite direction probably runaway dynamics would not occur in such scenario because prey defence cannot be negative and therefore growth rate stops increasing when defence reaches 0 moreover velzen and gaedke 2017 assumes that the carrying capacity is independent of prey defence the free logistic model see gabriel et al 2005 even under the assumption that defence affects prey intrinsic growth rate following rueffler et al 2006 this assumption cannot be interpret at the individual level because k is a function of r k r and a property of populations jeschke et al 2008 kokko and lópez sepulcre 2007 our assumption of constant and narrow distribution of trait value facilitate the analysis but its relaxation may also increase biological realism rapid adaptations is likely to depend on and decrease the amount of additive genetic variation hendry 2013 lande and shannon 1996 retel et al 2019 with low additive genetic variance systems behaviour is guided basically by the ecological subsystem cortez 2016 which dampens eco evolutionary feedback loop furthermore quantitative traits usually have complex genetic control that generate several correlations among genes and phenotypes arnold 1992 lande 1979 1982 wagner 1989 such correlations are also expected to affect trait distribution and additive genetic variance arnold et al 2008 affecting the feedback loop spatial dynamics is likely to affect eco evolutionary dynamics of predator prey interactions using an individual based model colombo et al 2019 shown that prey and predator mobility affects the eco evolution of predators perceptual range because their model is spatially explicit density dependence is likely to play a main role in cases in which the populations are more aggregated than dispersed moreover our model could also be extended to incorporate co evolutionary dynamics this could be done by either assuming that predators evolve their attack rate at some fitness cost in response to prey vulnerability an unidirectional axis or assuming that predator s trait evolve to match prey trait a bidirectional axis yamamichi et al 2019 shows that the second case can be an emergent property of the co evolution of multidimensional traits in predator prey interactions multidimensionality of adaptive traits can be easily incorporated in our framework by assuming for example two correlated traits z 1 and z 2 that are genetically correlated by a correlation matrix g lande 1982 and generates trade off in their ecological meanings these extensions would be useful to study the intersection of r k theory and eco evolutionary dynamics taking the inherent complexity of eco evo feedbacks de meester et al 2019 dds and rapid evolution are the unifying perspectives bringing the r k theory and eco evolutionary dynamics together while dds does it by means of a specific structure of ecological pleiotropy rapid evolution converges the temporal dynamics of ecological and evolutionary processes hairston et al 2005 our model suggests that the occurrence of certain qualitative features in systems dynamics can help to predict the position of the evolving population across an r k continuum this is relevant because depending on populations position alternative ecological and evolutionary trajectories are expected chikatsu et al 2002 nakamura et al 2006 sæther et al 2016 this may be specially relevant for systems known to be influenced by eco evolutionary feedback loops such as predator prey interactions abrams and matsuda 1997 ellner and becks 2011 jones and ellner 2007 meyer et al 2006 yoshida et al 2003 despite several decades of incorporation of eco evolutionary feedback loops in theoretical models govaert et al 2018 we still lack a proper theoretical framework de meester et al 2019 hendry 2019 although much empirical and theoretical effort still must be done integrating different theories in ecology and evolution is a step forward in the direction to develop such framework here we argue that partitioning the r and k selection gradients is a simple way to unravel the
