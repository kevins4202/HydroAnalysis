13225,alginate based nanocomposite beads have been widely studied as adsorbents for heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions because of their low cost and superior adsorption performance additionally they can be reused after regeneration via desorption for increased sustainability this paper for the first time reports the environmental impacts of incorporating halloysite nanotubes hnts into blank alginate beads and the impacts of acid regeneration followed by reuse of these beads we assessed a total of 10 impacts through a life cycle assessment on alginate hnts nanocomposite beads for the removal of lead ii from aqueous solutions from our results the incorporation of hnts into blank alginate beads to improve their mechanical stability and adsorption performance posed insignificant burden to the environment to produce the beads the greatest contributor to all environmental impacts was found to be the large quantity of hcl used for the extraction of alginate from seaweed followed by truck transportation of the beads furthermore the regeneration and reuse of the spent beads reduced all environmental impact categories by at least 72 for the entire life cycle to improve the sustainability of the beads production it was suggested to reduce and reuse hcl and water throughout the process as well as to source for locally produced materials to reduce

examples of these materials include antibiotics 1 2 organic pollutants 3 5 drugs 6 dyes 7 8 and particularly of our interest heavy metals 9 11 the interest in the study of alginate based adsorbents for the removal of pollutants is primarily by reason of their relatively low cost and excellent adsorption capacity 12 13 furthermore alginate is widely used to adsorb hazardous pollutants from soil and wastewater owing to the abundantly available free carboxyl groups on its molecular chain 14 originating from seaweed alginate is renewable and safe 15 it easily forms beads by cross linking with calcium ions and most importantly the beads can be easily separated and reused 16 however alginate exhibits several drawbacks including its insufficient physical strength for long term use 17 as such various additives such as biomass and nanomaterials have been embedded to form alginate based composite beads to further improve their physicochemical properties and adsorption performance lead ii pb2 is one of the most widely scattered hazardous materials worldwide originating from industrial waste agriculture production mining metal based paints etc 18 19 even at low concentrations pb2 can cause serious toxicological effects to humans and the environment 20 24 thus direct disposal of wastewater containing pb2 to natural water bodies is harmful to the environment 25 hence it is crucial to capture the pb2 from wastewater before discharging it to the environment 26 in our previous study we incorporated halloysite nanotubes hnts into alginate beads for the removal of pb2 from wastewater 27 these nanocomposite beads showed high adsorption capacity and they outperformed conventional adsorbents such as zeolite 28 and ion exchange resins 29 we further found that the young s modulus of the beads was significantly improved after the incorporation of hnts while preserving the adsorption capacity hnts are naturally occurring non hazardous materials and are available inexpensively in thousands of tonnes from natural deposits 30 hence the use of alginate hnts can prove to be a potentially safe and sustainable approach for the removal of heavy metal pollutants from industrial wastewater typically adsorbents can be regenerated via desorption or be replaced when pollutant concentrations exceed the ecological thresholds after treatment process in our recent work we have shown that the alginate hnts nanocomposite beads can be reused for at least ten consecutive adsorption regeneration cycles without a significant loss of adsorption capacity and without signs of physical degradation 31 reusing the adsorbents not only reduces the cost of wastewater treatment but also minimizes the environmental pollution in a recent study jeswani et al 32 compared the environmental impacts between freshly prepared granulated activated carbon gac and regenerated spent gac for the removal of total organic carbon from decaying natural organic matter the results showed that reusing the regenerated spent gac reduces all the environmental impact categories by 20 to 95 when compared to using freshly prepared gac this is because the regeneration process is less energy intensive than the production of gac 33 nevertheless the gac regeneration results cannot be extended to alginate hnts nanocomposite beads due to the different regeneration method used regeneration of alginate hnts nanocomposite beads was achieved through an on site acid washing process while reactivation of gac was done through an off site heating process several studies on the life cycle assessment lca of adsorbents have been performed over the recent years yami et al 34 evaluated the environmental impacts of four adsorbents namely activated alumina aluminum oxide amended wood char bone char and treated alum waste for the treatment of fluoride from drinking water it was found that the magnitudes of the environmental impacts were inversely proportional to the adsorption capacity due to the reduced impacts from the processing of materials to produce more efficient adsorbents meanwhile nishikawa et al 35 compared between the life cycle impacts of activated carbon and alginate extraction waste when used as cadmium adsorbents the analysis revealed that alginate extraction waste resulted in lower environmental impacts due to the omittance of the activated carbon production step which consumes relatively larger amounts of electricity coal and natural gas on the other hand kazemi et al 36 compared between the environmental impacts of two mercury nanoadsorbents graphene based and fe3o4 based not only does this study reveal that graphene based nanoadsorbents result in lesser impacts it also serves as a useful guideline to estimate the impacts caused by similar adsorbents despite numerous past studies to our best knowledge the environmental assessment on the application of alginate based composite beads for the removal of pollutants has not been studied before considering the growing importance of developing sustainable processes and products there is a need to evaluate the environmental impacts caused by using and regenerating these alginate based composite beads to remove pollutants from wastewater in this paper we considered the alginate hnts nanocomposite beads from our previous work as a case study for the removal of pb2 from wastewater seeking to fill the gaps mentioned earlier we performed an lca to achieve two objectives firstly to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with the incorporation of hnts into alginate during the production of alginate hnts nanocomposite beads and compare them with those associated with the production of blank beads secondly to determine the impacts due to the acid regeneration of spent alginate hnts nanocomposite beads followed by reuse and compare them with the impacts caused by using fresh beads this would allow us to make sound decisions from an ecological standpoint as to whether it is more environmentally friendly to use and regenerate alginate hnts nanocomposite beads furthermore we have also identified how several key variables affected these environmental impacts through a sensitivity analysis finally possible improvements had been suggested to develop more environmentally friendly conditions for the application of alginate hnts nanocomposite beads in wastewater treatment 2 methodology 2 1 goal and scope the first goal of this lca was to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with the incorporation of hnts into alginate beads during the production stage of alginate hnts nanocomposite beads before it is transported to the treatment site and used in adsorption these impacts are compared to those caused by producing blank alginate beads without hnts secondly this study also intended to identify the environmental impacts accompanying the acid regeneration of spent alginate hnts nanocomposite beads followed by the reapplication of these regenerated beads in the adsorption process these impacts were compared to those caused by a single application of these beads in adsorption with no regeneration the system boundaries of this cradle to gate lca is shown schematically in fig 1 which includes i the cultivation of seaweed and extraction of alginate ii the mining of hnts iii the production of alginate hnts nanocomposite beads and their transportation to the wastewater treatment site iv the production of solvents used e g hcl and hno3 v the production of electricity and water vi the adsorption of pb2 and vii the acid regeneration process of the spent beads as the cyclic adsorption regeneration study results showed insignificant decrease in the adsorption capacity up to ten cycles it was assumed that only small quantities 10 needed to be added to replenish the losses after first desorption cycle 31 hence to study the environmental effect of recycling the beads for adsorption two scenarios were considered i e i replacing the spent beads with the fresh beads and ii regenerating the spent beads with 0 1 m hno3 and reusing 90 of them all the processes other than alginate extraction and hnts mining were assumed to be based in malaysia the raw materials i e alginate and hnts were assumed to be sourced from china and new zealand respectively thus allowing the estimation of the transportation distance the beads were produced in kuala lumpur malaysia and transported 485 km north to a lead acid battery manufacturer located in kedah malaysia furthermore the effects from infrastructure and machinery were excluded from this analysis 2 2 functional unit a functional unit quantifies the function provided by the analyzed system the functional unit of this study was defined as 96 removal of pb2 from 1 m3 of simulated wastewater effluent with an initial pb2 concentration of 100 mg l using 10 kg of alginate hnts nanocomposite beads 2 3 life cycle assessment simulation the analysis was performed using gabi one of the leading software programs used for lca studies 37 we chose to use this software owing to its reliable data sets as well as its user friendly and intuitive interface which allowed us to easily model our product system the software provides modular individual life cycle phases such as manufacturing use and disposal that can be grouped into categories and processed individually furthermore to model our product system gabi is equipped with a calculator which operates on values from the life cycle unit process and impact assessment databases in this study we used gabi lca software version 6 4 1 20 compilation with db version 6 108 pe international 2011 as a modeling platform 2 4 life cycle inventory all the life cycle inventory data used in this study were obtained from i the gabi databases ii literature and iii industrial scale calculations the inventory data for the production of raw materials i e alginate production of beads and the adsorption regeneration process of the beads are presented in table 1 these data corresponded to the functional unit of 96 of pb2 removal from 1 m3 of simulated wastewater effluent with an initial pb2 concentration of 100 mg l using 10 kg of alginate hnts nanocomposite beads the data for the cultivation of seaweed and extraction of alginate were taken from a literature by langlois et al 38 which was based on the algal species saccharina latissima when the required information was not available reasonable assumptions for the inventory were made for example since the data for hnts mining were not available we used the data for kaolin mining because almost every natural kaolin deposit has a fraction of halloysite 39 all the inputs were further categorized into electricity chemicals transportation and water when examining the total environmental impacts the inventory data could vary on different databases depending on the location technologies and emission level non country specific data were taken directly from the databases whereas country specific data were selected according to the suitability to the country conditions such as geographical similarities 2 5 life cycle impact assessment the centre of environmental studies cml 2001 method which was updated in november 2010 was used in this study cml 2001 is a problem oriented approach that models the effects of substances on the environment at an early stage which minimizes uncertainties 41 the chosen impact categories for this life cycle impact assessment along with their brief descriptions are summarized in table 2 each impact category was evaluated for each process stage and for the entire life cycle 2 6 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis examines global uncertainties from a what if perspective which models the outputs to extreme values based on the changes in several inputs 42 based on the results obtained from the life cycle impact assessment several key factors inputs which could influence the environmental impacts outputs were identified a variation of 10 from the base case was applied to each factor while the other factors remained unchanged the sensitivity was defined as the ratio of the variation between the results of a set scenario and the original scenario to the results of the original scenario 43 as given by eq 1 1 s n m m where s refers to the sensitivity of different variation ranges n refers to the results of the set scenario and m refers to the results of the original scenario 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of incorporation of halloysite nanotubes into blank alginate beads table 3 compares the characteristic values of each impact category arising from the production of blank alginate beads and alginate hnt nanocomposite beads the results corresponded to the functional unit of 10 kg of beads produced it is important to note that since the units for most categories differed e g kg co2 mj etc and can be expressed differently e g lb co2 kcal etc a larger magnitude in one category did not necessarily imply a stronger environmental impact than the other hence the comparison should only be made between the two types of beads produced within the same category to understand the impact of incorporating hnts into alginate beads as shown in table 3 there was little difference 0 3 observed in all of the environmental impacts examined indicating the incorporation of hnts had little effect on the environmental sustainability of the adsorbent this was because clay is considered as one of the most sustainable materials on earth due to their abundant supply and ease of excavation from the ground 44 since the incorporation of hnts showed little environmental impacts in the production of the alginate beads a further analysis on the preceding subsystems within the same system boundaries depicted in fig 1a was performed based on the blank alginate beads these subsystems included the alginate raw material acquisition encompassing seaweed production harvesting alginate extraction and transportation to the production facility as well as production of blank alginate beads 45 as such fig 2 was produced to compare the contributions of each subsystem to each environmental impact while fig 3 compares the individual contributions of different factors i e chemicals water transportation and electricity within the same system boundaries for subsequent discussions each impact category was normalized to 100 fig 2 shows that the production of alginate beads contributed far less to the various environmental impacts 14 of the total environmental impact compared to the acquisition of alginate this was because production process could be carried out at room temperature without requiring organic solvents or toxic crosslinking agents and thus making the production process environmentally friendly and less energy intensive 40 in contrast the extraction of alginate from seaweed which dominated the impact contribution by the acquisition of alginate involved high consumption of electricity during pressing blending and drying 46 this is consistent with the findings of a recent sustainability study by yami et al 34 on aluminum oxide amended wood char adsorbent in their study it was revealed that raw material acquisition contributed the most to the impact categories studied followed by the manufacturing of adsorbents on another note our process also generated a large quantity of effluent containing polluting acids additionally during extraction hcl was used for acid lixiviation and rectification 38 this resulted in very large contributions by the chemicals category ranging from 79 to 98 to each environmental impact see fig 3 for example the total gwp for the production of 10 kg alginate beads to treat 1 m3 of wastewater was estimated at 141 82 kg co2 eq and out of this the chemicals category contributed 81 fig 3 also shows that the chemicals category had the largest contribution in ade followed by maep and tep in most categories electricity was the second largest factor followed by water and lastly transportation generally the use of resources which is easily grown and maintained by mankind can be reasonably categorized as green chemistry 47 for example alginate is considered as a renewable material because it was extracted from algae that can reproduce rapidly and be harvested frequently 48 moreover the algae cultivated in the sea would not compete with other food crops that grew on arable land 49 however there was an inadvertent problem shifting as the extraction of alginate became a source of environmental pollution nevertheless the direct usage of raw algae as an adsorbent was not encouraged because of the difficulty in handling and recycling the algae materials as well as the leaching of organic compounds as high as a few hundred ppm of total organic carbon during adsorption 50 51 the leaching of organic compounds could lead to a loss of adsorption capacity of the algae and also potentially block the adsorption columns 52 therefore one possible way to reduce the environmental impacts is to improve the alginate extraction process particularly by reducing the amount of hcl used 3 2 impact of acid regeneration and reuse of alginate hnts nanocomposite beads fig 4 shows the comparison of environmental impacts of case i no regeneration normalized to 100 as the base case and case ii with regeneration expectedly the results showed at least 72 reductions in all the environmental impact categories except pocp in case ii compared to case i 34 case i required the use of fresh alginate hnts nanocomposite beads to replace the spent beads which necessitated the acquisition of new alginate raw material to produce these fresh beads for the replacement since the acquisition process was previously determined to be the major contributor of all the environmental impact categories case i would hence demonstrate larger magnitudes of these impacts for case ii since 90 of the regenerated beads were reused the alginate acquisition step would only need to be considered for the remaining 10 this explained the decrease in the impact magnitudes and justified the environmental advantages related to the regeneration process furthermore the findings aforementioned are in agreement with those of kozyatnyk et al 53 i e the regeneration and reuse of adsorbents activated carbon biochar and hydrochar was found to reduce the environmental impacts related to the production stage of these adsorbents a further analysis revealed that transportation by truck and chemicals mainly hcl were the two major contributors for all the environmental impacts in case i see fig 5 it was also found that the transportation of raw materials i e alginate and hnts by cargo ship or freighter had negligible effect as compared to the truck transportation of beads in this study this aligns to the findings of borken kleefeld et al 54 which highlighted that ship transportation was found to be less environmentally invasive compared to truck transportation for case ii electricity became the predominant contributor to gwp and adf transportation remained as the predominant contributor to ap ep htp and tep while water and chemicals were the predominant contributors to oz and ade respectively see fig 5 regeneration of beads reduced the environmental impacts caused by transportation since lesser fresh beads i e only 10 needed to be transported to the treatment site on the other hand the consumptions of electricity and water were higher because the regeneration process involved the use of pumps and water for washing purposes 31 the negative results demonstrated by pocp in figs 4 and 5 signified that there was an overall beneficial effect to the environment truck transportation which heavily emitted nox to the atmosphere 55 56 was found to reduce the pocp this could be attributed to the increased reactivity of ozone with no in areas with high nox emissions which lowered the concentrations of ozone and thus the formation of photochemical smog 57 case ii depicted a 92 increase in pocp i e 92 decrease in the beneficial effect compared to case i the reduction in this beneficial effect was due to the redusced transportation impact in case ii since only 10 of fresh beads needed to be replenished 3 3 sensitivity analysis in this study a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify how several factors influenced the environmental impacts as they were varied 42 this was guided by the findings from figs 3 and 5 which jointly suggested that the most prominent factors were chemical consumption transportation and electricity usage hence it was vital to examine activities that potentially had significant impacts on these factors within the system boundaries several studies have claimed that the algae species and extraction conditions would affect both the yield and the chemical composition i e mannuronic guluronic ratio of alginate 58 59 for example for the same species the chemical composition of alginate may differ when extracted from different parts of the algae e g the leaf or stipe 60 additionally the physicochemical properties of hnts can vary with geographical and geological environments 61 these variations may affect the amount of adsorbents required i e adsorbent dosage because the adsorption performance is strongly dependent on the mannuronic guluronic ratio of alginate 62 and the properties of hnts 61 changing the adsorbent dosage will thus impact the total consumption of chemicals for each functional unit 34 besides the modes of transportation see section 3 2 the total amount of fuel or energy used for transportation also varies with transport distance 63 less environmental impact is caused by shorter transport distance and vice versa 64 both the distance and modes of transportation in this study are based on a hypothetical case study hence the total contribution from transport is case specific and depends on the location of treatment site considering the above the key factors considered in this sensitivity analysis were the adsorbent dosage alginate extraction efficiency electricity usage efficiency and transportation distance the results of sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 6 as expected the magnitudes of environmental impacts decreased with an increase in the extraction yield and electricity usage efficiency 65 on the other hand the magnitudes of the environmental impacts were directly proportional to both the adsorbent dosage and transportation distance 34 nevertheless the environmental impacts were not strongly sensitive to either of the four factors this was clear as a 10 variation in either of these four factors resulted mostly in less than 10 change in the environmental impacts as compared to the original scenario with an exception to the effect of transportation distance on pocp in this case pocp decreased with increasing transportation distance due to the same reason as discussed in section 3 2 57 3 4 opportunities for future improvement based on this study several opportunities could be identified to improve the environmental profile of pb2 removal by alginate hnts nanocomposite beads firstly the use of chemicals particularly hcl for alginate extraction from seaweed should be reduced for example the high concentration of hcl 2 m used for rectification might be reusable for lixiviation where only a low concentration 0 1 m was required 38 however the effect of impurities introduced during the rectification on the lixiviation efficiency should be considered in addition the water consumption can be reduced through recycling for example a large amount of water was required to prepare the cacl2 solution required for gelling of the beads 40 the spent cacl2 solution can be reused by replenishing the solution with cacl2 salt without the need to prepare a new solution the water used to wash the beads before adsorption can be reused to wash the beads after adsorption and regeneration instead of using fresh water with these modifications the water consumption in the beads production and usage stages can be reduced by at least an estimated 50 apart from the consumptions of acid and water truck transportation was another major factor that elevated the overall environmental impacts the use of good quality diesel with ultra low sulfur and aromatic contents can be an efficient way to reduce the environmental impacts 66 67 furthermore the diesel fuel can also be blended with biodiesel prior to usage to further reduce the carbon footprint of the fuel 68 69 ghosh et al 70 found that transportation by ship reduced the impacts on climate change by 73 and 90 as compared to rail and truck transportations respectively although truck transportation of the beads was the dominant mode of delivery ship freight would be more ecofriendly if the treatment site were to be located nearer to the seaport in addition locally produced materials should be considered wherever possible to reduce the impacts due to transport distances 34 for example since hnts are chemically similar to kaolin 71 locally produced kaolin can be used to replace hnts lastly the use of efficient motors and pumps in the machinery can reduce the environmental impacts caused by electricity generation 65 furthermore according to the malaysian energy commission 72 fossil fuels make up approximately three quarters of the current electricity generation mix fossil fuel emissions account for more than half of the country s co2 emissions furthermore muis et al 73 estimated that the renewable energy based on the available sources in malaysia e g biomass electricity based on palm oil residues wood processing residues and rice processing residues can replace up to 9 of malaysian electricity and reduce up to 29 million tonnes of co2 eq annually compared to the current generation mix hence the substitution of natural gas for electricity with industrial or agricultural waste based biomass can further decrease the environmental impacts 74 4 conclusion this study presented an lca for alginate based nanocomposite beads for the removal of pb2 from aqueous solution a total of 10 impact categories were considered in this study the incorporation of hnts into alginate beads was found to not cause significant environmental burdens resulting in just 0 3 increase in each impact category instead the reusability of the beads was increased by raising their mechanical stability and adsorption performance besides to produce the beads an in depth analysis revealed that the hcl used for alginate lixiviation and rectification in the extraction process contributed to the largest impact to the environment this was followed by truck transportation of beads to the treatment sites while ship transportation emissions were insignificant compared to those of truck transportation affirming our intuition reusing 90 of the spent beads after acid regeneration led to a notable reduction in the environmental impact categories by at least 72 up to as high as 89 as lesser fresh beads i e only 10 had to be transported to the treatment site additional reductions in all these impacts could be expected by further cutting the usage of chemicals and by using less environmentally invasive modes of transportation furthermore the sensitivity analysis revealed that environmental impacts decreased with increasing alginate extraction yield and electricity usage efficiency while they were directly proportional to the transportation distance and adsorbent dosage all in all a complete sustainability assessment should consider not only the environmental performance but also the economic performance and social implications while we are optimistic of the outcomes future studies should scrutinize these latter two aspects to affirm the absence of any adverse hidden issues credit authorship contribution statement christine shu ching chiew conceptualization

process of the beads are presented in table 1 these data corresponded to the functional unit of 96 of pb2 removal from 1 m3 of simulated wastewater effluent with an initial pb2 concentration of 100 mg l using 10 kg of alginate hnts nanocomposite beads the data for the cultivation of seaweed and extraction of alginate were taken from a literature by langlois et al 38 which was based on the algal species saccharina latissima when the required information was not available reasonable assumptions for the inventory were made for example since the data for hnts mining were not available we used the data for kaolin mining because almost every natural kaolin deposit has a fraction of halloysite 39 all the inputs were further categorized into electricity chemicals transportation and water when examining the total environmental impacts the inventory data could vary on different databases depending on the location technologies and emission level non country specific data were taken directly from the databases whereas country specific data were selected according to the suitability to the country conditions such as geographical similarities 2 5 life cycle impact assessment the centre of environmental studies cml 2001 method which was updated in november 2010 was used in this study cml 2001 is a problem oriented approach that models the effects of substances on the environment at an early stage which minimizes uncertainties 41 the chosen impact categories for this life cycle impact assessment along with their brief descriptions are summarized in table 2 each impact category was evaluated for each process stage and for the entire life cycle 2 6 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis examines global uncertainties from a what if perspective which models the outputs to extreme values based on the changes in several inputs 42 based on the results obtained from the life cycle impact assessment several key factors inputs which could influence the environmental impacts outputs were identified a variation of 10 from the base case was applied to each factor while the other factors remained unchanged the sensitivity was defined as the ratio of the variation between the results of a set scenario and the original scenario to the results of the original scenario 43 as given by eq 1 1 s n m m where s refers to the sensitivity of different variation ranges n refers to the results of the set scenario and m refers to the results of the original scenario 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of incorporation of halloysite nanotubes into blank alginate beads table 3 compares the characteristic values of each impact category arising from the production of blank alginate beads and alginate hnt nanocomposite beads the results corresponded to the functional unit of 10 kg of beads produced it is important to note that since the units for most categories differed e g kg co2 mj etc and can be expressed differently e g lb co2 kcal etc a larger magnitude in one category did not necessarily imply a stronger environmental impact than the other hence the comparison should only be made between the two types of beads produced within the same category to understand the impact of incorporating hnts into alginate beads as shown in table 3 there was little difference 0 3 observed in all of the environmental impacts examined indicating the incorporation of hnts had little effect on the environmental sustainability of the adsorbent this was because clay is considered as one of the most sustainable materials on earth due to their abundant supply and ease of excavation from the ground 44 since the incorporation of hnts showed little environmental impacts in the production of the alginate beads a further analysis on the preceding subsystems within the same system boundaries depicted in fig 1a was performed based on the blank alginate beads these subsystems included the alginate raw material acquisition encompassing seaweed production harvesting alginate extraction and transportation to the production facility as well as production of blank alginate beads 45 as such fig 2 was produced to compare the contributions of each subsystem to each environmental impact while fig 3 compares the individual contributions of different factors i e chemicals water transportation and electricity within the same system boundaries for subsequent discussions each impact category was normalized to 100 fig 2 shows that the production of alginate beads contributed far less to the various environmental impacts 14 of the total environmental impact compared to the acquisition of alginate this was because production process could be carried out at room temperature without requiring organic solvents or toxic crosslinking agents and thus making the production process environmentally friendly and less energy intensive 40 in contrast the extraction of alginate from seaweed which dominated the impact contribution by the acquisition of alginate involved high consumption of electricity during pressing blending and drying 46 this is consistent with the findings of a recent sustainability study by yami et al 34 on aluminum oxide amended wood char adsorbent in their study it was revealed that raw material acquisition contributed the most to the impact categories studied followed by the manufacturing of adsorbents on another note our process also generated a large quantity of effluent containing polluting acids additionally during extraction hcl was used for acid lixiviation and rectification 38 this resulted in very large contributions by the chemicals category ranging from 79 to 98 to each environmental impact see fig 3 for example the total gwp for the production of 10 kg alginate beads to treat 1 m3 of wastewater was estimated at 141 82 kg co2 eq and out of this the chemicals category contributed 81 fig 3 also shows that the chemicals category had the largest contribution in ade followed by maep and tep in most categories electricity was the second largest factor followed by water and lastly transportation generally the use of resources which is easily grown and maintained by mankind can be reasonably categorized as green chemistry 47 for example alginate is considered as a renewable material because it was extracted from algae that can reproduce rapidly and be harvested frequently 48 moreover the algae cultivated in the sea would not compete with other food crops that grew on arable land 49 however there was an inadvertent problem shifting as the extraction of alginate became a source of environmental pollution nevertheless the direct usage of raw algae as an adsorbent was not encouraged because of the difficulty in handling and recycling the algae materials as well as the leaching of organic compounds as high as a few hundred ppm of total organic carbon during adsorption 50 51 the leaching of organic compounds could lead to a loss of adsorption capacity of the algae and also potentially block the adsorption columns 52 therefore one possible way to reduce the environmental impacts is to improve the alginate extraction process particularly by reducing the amount of hcl used 3 2 impact of acid regeneration and reuse of alginate hnts nanocomposite beads fig 4 shows the comparison of environmental impacts of case i no regeneration normalized to 100 as the base case and case ii with regeneration expectedly the results showed at least 72 reductions in all the environmental impact categories except pocp in case ii compared to case i 34 case i required the use of fresh alginate hnts nanocomposite beads to replace the spent beads which necessitated the acquisition of new alginate raw material to produce these fresh beads for the replacement since the acquisition process was previously determined to be the major contributor of all the environmental impact categories case i would hence demonstrate larger magnitudes of these impacts for case ii since 90 of the regenerated beads were reused the alginate acquisition step would only need to be considered for the remaining 10 this explained the decrease in the impact magnitudes and justified the environmental advantages related to the regeneration process furthermore the findings aforementioned are in agreement with those of kozyatnyk et al 53 i e the regeneration and reuse of adsorbents activated carbon biochar and hydrochar was found to reduce the environmental impacts related to the production stage of these adsorbents a further analysis revealed that transportation by truck and chemicals mainly hcl were the two major contributors for all the environmental impacts in case i see fig 5 it was also found that the transportation of raw materials i e alginate and hnts by cargo ship or freighter had negligible effect as compared to the truck transportation of beads in this study this aligns to the findings of borken kleefeld et al 54 which highlighted that ship transportation was found to be less environmentally invasive compared to truck transportation for case ii electricity became the predominant contributor to gwp and adf transportation remained as the predominant contributor to ap ep htp and tep while water and chemicals were the predominant contributors to oz and ade respectively see fig 5 regeneration of beads reduced the environmental impacts caused by transportation since lesser fresh beads i e only 10 needed to be transported to the treatment site on the other hand the consumptions of electricity and water were higher because the regeneration process involved the use of pumps and water for washing purposes 31 the negative results demonstrated by pocp in figs 4 and 5 signified that there was an overall beneficial effect to the environment truck transportation which heavily emitted nox to the atmosphere 55 56 was found to reduce the pocp this could be attributed to the increased reactivity of ozone with no in areas with high nox emissions which lowered the concentrations of ozone and thus the formation of photochemical smog 57 case ii depicted a 92 increase in pocp i e 92 decrease in the beneficial effect compared to case i the reduction in this beneficial effect was due to the redusced transportation impact in case ii since only 10 of fresh beads needed to be replenished 3 3 sensitivity analysis in this study a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify how several factors influenced the environmental impacts as they were varied 42 this was guided by the findings from figs 3 and 5 which jointly suggested that the most prominent factors were chemical consumption transportation and electricity usage hence it was vital to examine activities that potentially had significant impacts on these factors within the system boundaries several studies have claimed that the algae species and extraction conditions would affect both the yield and the chemical composition i e mannuronic guluronic ratio of alginate 58 59 for example for the same species the chemical composition of alginate may differ when extracted from different parts of the algae e g the leaf or stipe 60 additionally the physicochemical properties of hnts can vary with geographical and geological environments 61 these variations may affect the amount of adsorbents required i e adsorbent dosage because the adsorption performance is strongly dependent on the mannuronic guluronic ratio of alginate 62 and the properties of hnts 61 changing the adsorbent dosage will thus impact the total consumption of chemicals for each functional unit 34 besides the modes of transportation see section 3 2 the total amount of fuel or energy used for transportation also varies with transport distance 63 less environmental impact is caused by shorter transport distance and vice versa 64 both the distance and modes of transportation in this study are based on a hypothetical case study hence the total contribution from transport is case specific and depends on the location of treatment site considering the above the key factors considered in this sensitivity analysis were the adsorbent dosage alginate extraction efficiency electricity usage efficiency and transportation distance the results of sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 6 as expected the magnitudes of environmental impacts decreased with an increase in the extraction yield and electricity usage efficiency 65 on the other hand the magnitudes of the environmental impacts were directly proportional to both the adsorbent dosage and transportation distance 34 nevertheless the environmental impacts were not strongly sensitive to either of the four factors this was clear as a 10 variation in either of these four factors resulted mostly in less than 10 change in the environmental impacts as compared to the original scenario with an exception to the effect of transportation distance on pocp in this case pocp decreased with increasing transportation distance due to the same reason as discussed in section 3 2 57 3 4 opportunities for future improvement based on this study several opportunities could be identified to improve the environmental profile of pb2 removal by alginate hnts nanocomposite beads firstly the use of chemicals particularly hcl for alginate extraction from seaweed should be reduced for example the high concentration of hcl 2 m used for rectification might be reusable for lixiviation where only a low concentration 0 1 m was required 38 however the effect of impurities introduced during the rectification on the lixiviation efficiency should be considered in addition the water consumption can be reduced through recycling for example a large amount of water was required to prepare the cacl2 solution required for gelling of the beads 40 the spent cacl2 solution can be reused by replenishing the solution with cacl2 salt without the need to prepare a new solution the water used to wash the beads before adsorption can be reused to wash the beads after adsorption and regeneration instead of using fresh water with these modifications the water consumption in the beads production and usage stages can be reduced by at least an estimated 50 apart from the consumptions of acid and water truck transportation was another major factor that elevated the overall environmental impacts the use of good quality diesel with ultra low sulfur and aromatic contents can be an efficient way to reduce the environmental impacts 66 67 furthermore the diesel fuel can also be blended with biodiesel prior to usage to further reduce the carbon footprint of the fuel 68 69 ghosh et al 70 found that transportation by ship reduced the impacts on climate change by 73 and 90 as compared to rail and truck transportations respectively although truck transportation of the beads was the dominant mode of delivery ship freight would be more ecofriendly if the treatment site were to be located nearer to the seaport in addition locally produced materials should be considered wherever possible to reduce the impacts due to transport distances 34 for example since hnts are chemically similar to kaolin 71 locally produced kaolin can be used to replace hnts lastly the use of efficient motors and pumps in the machinery can reduce the environmental impacts caused by electricity generation 65 furthermore according to the malaysian energy commission 72 fossil fuels make up approximately three quarters of the current electricity generation mix fossil fuel emissions account for more than half of the country s co2 emissions furthermore muis et al 73 estimated that the renewable energy based on the available sources in malaysia e g biomass electricity based on palm oil residues wood processing residues and rice processing residues can replace up to 9 of malaysian electricity and reduce up to 29 million tonnes of co2 eq annually compared to the current generation mix hence the substitution of natural gas for electricity with industrial or agricultural waste based biomass can further decrease the environmental impacts 74 4 conclusion this study presented an lca for alginate based nanocomposite beads for the removal of pb2 from aqueous solution a total of 10 impact categories were considered in this study the incorporation of hnts into alginate beads was found to not cause significant environmental burdens resulting in just 0 3 increase in each impact category instead the reusability of the beads was increased by raising their mechanical stability and adsorption performance besides to produce the beads an in depth analysis revealed that the hcl used for alginate lixiviation and rectification in the extraction process contributed to the largest impact to the environment this was followed by truck transportation of beads to the treatment sites while ship transportation emissions were insignificant compared to those of truck transportation affirming our intuition reusing 90 of the spent beads after acid regeneration led to a notable reduction in the environmental impact categories by at least 72 up to as high as 89 as lesser fresh beads i e only 10 had to be transported to the treatment site additional reductions in all these impacts could be expected by further cutting the usage of chemicals and by using less environmentally invasive modes of transportation furthermore the sensitivity analysis revealed that environmental impacts decreased with increasing alginate extraction yield and electricity usage efficiency while they were directly proportional to the transportation distance and adsorbent dosage all in all a complete sustainability assessment should consider not only the environmental performance but also the economic performance and social implications while we are optimistic of the outcomes future studies should scrutinize these latter two aspects to affirm the absence of any adverse hidden issues credit authorship contribution statement christine shu ching chiew conceptualization

13226,cavitation damage to membranes is a major barrier for developing an ultrasound us assisted membrane water treatment process in this study us was integrated to a heterogeneous fenton membrane reactor for the treatment of pharmaceutical containing water with the aims of i fouling control ii enhancement of heterogeneous fenton oxidation in order to prevent membrane damages due to cavitation the stable and violent cavitation regions were identified by quantification and analysis of the cavitation activity axial along the ultrasound transducer via hydrophone measurements results showed the cavitation activities occur in both regions with us on while the cavitation damage to membrane materials was only observed when membranes were placed in the violent cavitation region on one hand cracking and physical erosion of the surface were observed on membrane samples when exposed to violent cavitation on the other hand no such erosion occurred in stable cavitation regions and membranes kept their mechanical chemical and morphological properties confirming that cavitation damage was controlled by placing membranes in the identified stable cavitation region based on these results a heterogeneous sono fenton membrane reactor was designed by placing a scalable hollow fibre membrane module in the stable cavitation region within this reactor the experiments confirmed that the oxidation of organics was enhanced thanks to the us assistance in the novel designed heterogeneous sono fenton membrane reactor however this study also showed that us accelerated membrane ageing and zeolite catalysts erosion leading to more severe fouling overall this paper introduces a method to control the cavitation damage to membranes and discusses the issues in us assisted membrane systems with practical insights keywords ultrasound microfiltration cavitation damage ultrasonic fouling control heterogeneous sono fenton oxidation 1 introduction the production and demand of pharmaceuticals has dramatically increased for high economic growth and better human health 1 however the discharge of pharmaceuticals contained wastewater from all kind of sources such as the pharmaceutical industry and hospital effluents has become a major challenge to the sustainability of the aquatic system most pharmaceuticals are partially or non biodegradable and resistant to the conventional activated sludge process of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp releasing into the environment 2 these refractory pharmaceuticals accumulate in the aquatic ecosystems and pose significant threats to the ecosystem s sustainability and drinking water safety 3 4 it is therefore crucial to develop new and advanced treatment systems in particular integrated treatment systems combining several techniques have recently become a very interesting approach providing additional options for treatments of harsh wastewater or high discharge standard 5 10 membrane based oxidation processes are increasingly attracting attention for water treatment as the integration of membrane filtration and advanced oxidation processes efficiently remove and eliminate refractory pollutants 5 7 11 14 in these processes the role of membranes can be applied to separate and concentrate pollutants 7 11 12 or complete an oxidation reactor by retention and reuse of the catalysts 5 14 however the process efficiency is limited by the membrane fouling induced by the components in wastewater matrix or catalysts in oxidation reactors to tackle fouling issues the integration of ultrasound us with membrane filtration has been widely studied during the last two decades 15 20 us enables to detach or loosen deposits particles from membrane surfaces by cavitation mechanism i e microjets and transport foulants away from the surface by acoustic streaming 19 indeed us enables to promote both physical and chemical processes 21 22 besides fouling control us furthermore promisingly improves oxidation efficiency in a membrane based oxidation process 10 23 for example us enhanced heterogeneous fenton oxidation sono fenton in multiple functions 8 24 26 us improving fe2 regeneration and subsequent formation of radicals in the heterogeneous fenton reactor has been proven moreover us assisted the mineralization of organic pollutants it was found that the mineralization degree of phenol by heterogeneous fenton oxidation was significantly enhanced with up to 90 of toc removal after us irradiation 27 this enhancement of the mineralization of organic pollutants can be associated to us preventing from the catalyst deactivation the formation of other reactive oxidant species and or thermal cleavage of volatile compounds contributing to the acoustic cavitation which gives rise to extreme conditions inside and around the collapsing bubble up to 5000 k and 500 bar the cavitation also contributes to the increase of accessible surface of catalysts by its mechanical effects the cavitation activities induced by us irradiation in the water potentially benefits both membrane fouling control and oxidation efficiency however the cavitation damage to membrane materials is a major concern for the integration of us into membrane based processes it was widely reported that cavitation and bubble implosion may induce physical and chemical erosion of membrane materials 28 31 indeed the damaging effects of us are highly related to the cavitation type and intensity 32 during acoustic cavitation gas bubbles appear due to acoustic waves depending on the bubble size and local acoustic pressure the oscillation of a bubble is variable schematically some bubbles violently collapse transient cavitation generating a very strong shock wave followed by the production of oh radicals responsible for mechanical and chemical damage to materials other types of bubbles slightly oscillate and are more stable with a relatively long lifetime stable cavitation 33 this latter type of cavitation is less active and so less destructive to materials therefore the cavitation damage to membranes can be potentially controlled by identifying the cavitation intensity and minimising the effects of violent cavitation activity to promote us assisted membranes and advanced oxidation processes for water treatment the present study integrated sonication with the heterogeneous fenton membrane reactor which was investigated in our previous study 14 a heterogeneous sono fenton membrane reactor hsofm was then developed for the degradation of pharmaceuticals in an aqueous solution the oxidation ability of this process is attributed to highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oh generated from fenton like reactions involving hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant and iron containing micro sized zeolites as catalysts 34 the role of membrane filtration in the hsofm reactor is to retain the zeolite catalysts in the effluent compartment during the continuous water treatment overcoming the issue of difficult iron recovery in the fenton oxidation process 35 the further integration of the sonication in this process is of great interest to control membrane fouling induced by the zeolite catalysts and to enhance the degradation of pharmaceuticals in this present paper the practical aspects of the coupling of us with membranes and advanced oxidation processes for water treatment have been discussed firstly a stable cavitation strategy for controlling cavitation damage to membrane materials was investigated secondly the violent and stable cavitation regions were identified by quantification and analysis of the cavitation activity axial along with an ultrasound transducer via hydrophone measurements the control of cavitation damage to membranes in the stable cavitation region was then verified following the analysis of the role of us on membrane ageing in a sono fenton aggressive media moreover since the chemical effects of ultrasound on membrane are rarely investigated in the literature 36 the impact of both the chemical and physical effects will be discussed in this study the model system a bench scale hsofm reactor with a scalable hollow fibre membrane module was then designed by placing the membrane module in a stable cavitation region two potential benefits of us in water treatment processes fouling control and oxidation enhancement were then evaluated in the hsofm reactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and membrane all aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized di water generated by a purelab maxima system elga labwater s uk ibuprofen ibp c13h18o2 purity 99 99 was purchased from basf corporation and used as received hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 w w sulphuric acid 1 mol l titanium tetrachloride solution 0 09 mol l in 20 hcl for h2o2 concentration analysis monopotassium phosphate kh2po4 and sodium phosphate dibasic dehydrate na2hpo4 2h2o for preparing the buffer solution were purchased from sigma aldrich a commercial iron containing zeolite of zsm 5 structure provided by clariant was used as fenton s reagents this zeolite exhibited a si al ratio of 13 and an iron content of 3 5 wt the average particle size of this catalyst is approximately 8 μm 35 mf0808xs polysulfone polyvinylpyrrolidone psu pvp hollow fibre membrane module provided by polymem was tested pvp was blended 5 w w into the psu matrix to increase the hydrophilicity of the membranes the membrane pore size was 0 1 μm microfiltration membrane in this study membrane filtration was only intended to maintain the catalyst approximately 8 μm in the oxidation reactor during the continuous treatment rather than to selectively reject the pharmaceutical and by products the membrane module for the hsofm reactor contained 200 fibres its total active membrane surface was approximately 0 07 m2 2 2 cavitation activity analysis method 2 2 1 cavitation activity and acoustic pressure the aim of cavitation activity analysis was to estimate the intensity of axial cavitation activity along the us transducer in the region where the major group of cavitation bubbles was transient the cavitation activity was intensive and violent the violent collapse of transient cavitation bubbles most likely led to membrane erosion conversely where the dominate cavitation bubbles was relatively stable or long lifetime the cavitation activity was considered stable and expectedly less destructive to membrane materials the intensity of cavitation activity can be related to the spectral components of the acoustic wave the us spectrum includes a ray at the fundamental frequency f emitted by the ultrasonic generator possibly harmonics of this fundamental frequency k f sub harmonics f n and ultra harmonics kf n between all the rays there is a broadband noise it was proposed that the fundamental frequency is associated with violent collapses of cavitation bubbles potentially transient cavitation that lead to mechanical and chemical damage to membranes conversely harmonics induce a relatively long lifetime of the cavitation bubble indeed the intensity of the cavitation activities is highly dependent on the acoustic pressure 37 for this reason the cavitation activity can be estimated by measuring the acoustic pressure by means of a hydrophone section 2 2 2 the hydrophone determines the frequency band for the majority of the signal power 38 therefore by analysing the acoustic pressure axial along us transducer the acoustic cavitation due to the fundamental frequency can be identified from the total us power a stable cavitation region is identified where the majority of the cavitation bubbles are relatively stable conversely in a violent cavitation region the cavitation activities are violent and intense in the stable cavitation region the cavitation activities expectedly remain but intensive cavitation due to the fundamental frequency is minimized 2 2 2 acoustic pressure measurements with hydrophone and data analysis the acoustic pressure measurements were performed using a hydrophone model 8103 provided by brüel kjᴂr the piezoelectric ceramic was encapsulated in a rubber cylinder 3 cm long and 0 7 cm in diameter it was calibrated by the manufacturer who provided the evolution of the sensitivity in volts versus the acoustic frequency this calibration curve relates the amplitude of the acoustic pressure to which the sensor is subjected to the resulting electric charge the measurement system then comprises three devices provided by brüel kjᴂr an amplifier model 1704 intended to simulate an infinite input impedance and whose gain is set to the unit value a signal converter model 2647 a connected upstream of the amplifier 1704 and finally a load attenuator model wb0779 connected to the hydrophone to remain in the voltage range compatible with the amplifier 1704 and thus avoid saturation at very high acoustic pressures at 20 khz this setup has a resulting sensitivity of 0 896 v bar it should be noted that this configuration had a cutoff frequency located at 50 khz for data acquisition the measurement system was connected to a digital oscilloscope pico technology this device makes it possible to measure and digitize the output voltage of the measuring device so a computer can register it the whole measurement system involved in this study is represented in fig 1 the signal is processed with matlab software after pretreatment of the signal a spectral analysis was performed by discrete fourier transform dft the data processing is already detailed in a previous article 38 thus a spectrum was obtained which determines the frequency bands where there is the majority of the power contained in the signal it is then possible to determine the contribution to the total us power of the different elements of the spectrum fundamental frequency harmonics and broadband noise by calculating the rms root mean square value pressure according to the discussion in section 2 1 the rms acoustic pressure contributions to the total us power and to the fundamental frequency were determined and analysed to estimate the stable and violent cavitation regions axial along the ultrasonic probe 2 3 experimental set up and protocol 2 3 1 ultrasound generator and identification of the stable cavitation region the ultrasound generator sinaptec nextgen inside 500 connected with a cup horn type transducer was used for both the membrane stability tests set up and hsofm reactors the operating ultrasound frequency is 20 khz which is commonly used for the integration of membrane based processes since lower frequencies had higher cleaning efficiencies than higher frequencies 19 the us power is fixed at 50 w because previous studies determined that membrane erosion was insignificant for us power less than 60 w 31 to analyse cavitation activity axial along the us transducer the acoustic pressure section 2 2 was measured every 0 5 cm along us transducer using the hydrophone in a water filled glassware the stable and violent cavitation regions were estimated by quantification and analysis of acoustic pressure due to fundamental frequency of the total us power 2 3 2 membrane stability and ageing tests under us the membrane stability under us was measured in a 1 l jacketed thermostat glassware shown in fig 2 the us transducer was located at the bottom of the glass reactor and membranes were fixed in a frame by moving this frame up or down the distance between membranes and the us transducer could be adjusted from 1 5 to 4 cm this axial distance between membranes and the transducer tip is referred to as tip height by adjusting the tip height membranes can be exposed to identified stable or violent cavitation region for us exposure the psu pvp membranes were immersed in di water in the glassware the tests were conducted for 10 h under continuous 50 w us power by placing membranes in both stable and violent cavitation regions then the membranes were sampled and characterized furthermore to understand the effect of us on membrane ageing while exposed to oxidative media psu pvp membranes were immersed into a heterogeneous fenton reactive suspension containing 4 8 g l 1 of zsm 5 zeolite and 6 4 mm h2o2 under stable cavitation the concentration of catalysts and h2o2 was chosen according to selected conditions in a previous study on the heterogeneous fenton membrane reactor 14 the h2o2 concentration in the suspension was maintained at 6 4 mm by continuous h2o2 injection using a syringe pump harvard phd 2000 the us power was maintained at 50 w for comparison other groups of psu pvp membranes were submerged into fenton reactive suspension with the same concentration of zsm 5 zeolite catalyst and h2o2 under silent conditions all the soaking tests were conducted for 30 h membrane samples were taken periodically during the experiment for analysis 2 3 3 heterogeneous sono fenton hollow fibre membrane reactor the hsofm reactor was designed by placing the membrane module in the identified stable cavitation region for the control of cavitation damage fig s1 in supplementary information the experimental solution was introduced in a 6 5 l thermo regulated glass reactor the membrane module reactor retains the catalyst in the glass reactor the filtrations were performed in the outside in filtration mode the permeate was recycled back into the reactor to simulate a continuous process from a hydrodynamic point of view the us transducer was located on the side wall of the reactor within the designed distance to the membrane module with on and off options the water treatment performance of hsofm reactor was assessed by the degradation of the pharmaceutical solution ibuprofen ibp a widely used drug was selected as the target pollutant for the reactor assessment because it was found in effluents from various wastewater treatment plants and groundwater up to 95 μg l 1 39 ibp was dissolved in deionized water with an initial concentration of 20 mg l 1 the stoichiometric amount of h2o2 6 4 mm was applied twice to avoid extensive scavenging of hydroxyl radicals for effective production of hydroxyl radicals the h2o2 fe molar ratio was maintained at 10 and the catalyst concentration at 4 8 g l 1 the concentration of h2o2 was maintained at 6 4 mm due to its continuous injection using a syringe pump harvard phd 2000 during oxidation the water treatment experiments were conducted at a controlled temperature of 25 2 c the rotation rate of the stirrer inside the reactor was 300 rpm in this preliminary test of hsofm reactor the objective was to understand the membrane fouling phenomenon and fenton oxidation under sonication therefore the water treatment process was conducted in two stages 2 3 3 1 stage one with us off filtration flux was maintained at 30 l h 1 m 2 for fouling development with us off and the variation of transmembrane pressure was monitored during the process the filtration was performed at 30 l h 1 m 2 because this flux value was above the critical flux value flux below which a decline of flux over time due to irreversible fouling does not occur and above which irreversible fouling is observed 14 oxidation was started by injecting h2o2 when the adsorption of ibp by catalysts and membranes had reached equilibrium 2 3 3 2 stage two with us on filtration and oxidation were conducted following the same protocol as in stage one while us was switched on in this stage since the hsofm reactor is a constant permeate flux system the development of fouling causes the increase in transmembrane pressure tmp in these two stages transmembrane pressure was monitored to investigate fouling development solution samples were taken at regular intervals in the reactor for analysis and immediately treated by phosphate buffer a mixture of kh2po4 0 05 m and na2hpo4 2h2o 0 05 m to reach a neutral ph after the removal of catalysts using a 0 45 μm rc syringe filter to stop the oxidation reaction 2 4 analysis 2 4 1 solution analysis to evaluate the water treatment efficiency the total organic carbon toc of solution samples from the reactor was analysed the toc value was calculated from the difference between total carbon tc and inorganic carbon ic measured by a toc l analyser shimadzu the tc of all samples was measured three times and the coefficient of variation was less than 2 calibration curves were established using commercially available standard solutions shimadzu 2 4 2 membrane characterization 2 4 2 1 sem edx scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy morphology and elemental information on the membrane surface were examined with a sem hitachi tabletop microscope tm 1000 interfaced with an edx spectroscopy system thermo fisher samples were coated with a thin layer of gold before sem analysis for better contrast edx analyses were carried out at the same time edx measurements were performed at different locations of the membrane surface to obtain a comprehensive elemental composition 2 4 2 2 atr ftir attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was obtained with a thermo nicolet nexus 670 apparatus usa the sample was placed on diamond crystal substrates and the analytical depth was approximately 2 μm membrane samples after soaking in the reactive medium were firstly dried at 40 c for 48 h then they were examined using atr ftir spectra to identify chemical membrane changes all the recorded psu pvp ir spectra were corrected by adjusting the 1587 cm 1 band to an arbitrary chosen absorbance value of 1 this band corresponds to an aromatic in plane ring bend stretching vibration of the psu and considered to be invariable during membrane degradation 14 the corrected absorbance is mentioned as relative absorbance to facilitate the reader s understanding when monitoring changes of specific ir bands upon degradation normalization by dividing the relative absorbance by the one of the pristine membranes was performed 2 4 2 3 tensile testing tensile tests were performed to obtain the stress strain curve reflexing membrane s mechanical property the measurements were performed on wet membranes using an instron 4281 series tensile apparatus tailor made grips for the hollow fibre geometry were fitted to the device to avoid stress concentration the initial distance between grips was fixed at 50 mm and samples were extended at a constant elongation rate of 100 mm min ultimate elongation at breakpoint was calculated from the experimental stress strain curves a set of five samples were analysed and averaged for each tested condition 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the stable cavitation region this section aims to determine a stable cavitation region where the cavitation bubbles are relatively stable or long lifetime and less violent to membrane materials as discussed in section 2 2 1 the fundamental frequency is usually associated with violent collapses of cavitation bubbles while harmonics induce the relatively long lifetime cavitation bubble 38 therefore by means of a hydrophone section 2 2 the fundamental frequency from the ultrasonic spectrum was identified and its associated cavitation activity characterized by the rms acoustic pressure was determined the stable cavitation region was identified in this region cavitation activities by rms acoustic pressure remain but rms acoustic pressure associated to the fundamental frequency are minimized to identify the frequencies of the ultrasonic wave the time frequency signal was measured by a hydrophone followed by a fourier transform spectral analysis the spectrum obtained from the signal measurement at 1 5 cm tip height is presented in fig 3a the frequencies were identified by indicating their amplitude two peaks were detected in fig 3a corresponding to the fundamental frequency 20 khz and the first harmonic 40 khz with the 50 khz frequency cut off of the measuring system fig 3b shows the rms acoustic pressure of fundamental frequency 20 khz and total power as a function of the axial distance to the transducer tip referred to as tip height each value in the graph is obtained from an average of 32 spectra one can observe that the rms acoustic pressure of fundamental frequency dramatically decreased from 0 2 bar with the increase in tip height until reached the lowest value 0 02 bar at 3 5 cm on the other hand rms acoustic pressure of total power was 0 28 bar at the initial point 1 5 cm tip height after approximately 50 decline its value relatively stabilized at around 0 15 bar from 2 cm to 4 cm tip height fig 3c highlights the ratio of rms acoustic pressure of fundamental frequency to total power it was found that the percentage of rms acoustic pressure of fundamental frequency decreases from 1 5 cm to 3 5 cm tip height then increases the estimation of the intensity of cavitation activity depends on both the magnitude of rms acoustic pressure induced by the fundamental frequency as well as its percentage in the rms acoustic pressure of total us power therefore for a tip height of 1 5 cm the rms acoustic pressure induced by the fundamental frequency is high 0 2 bar and accounts for 73 of the rms acoustic pressure of total power the violent collapse of the cavitation bubbles associated with fundamental frequency likely occurred there thus this region was referred as violent cavitation in contrast at 3 5 cm tip height the rms acoustic pressure of the fundamental frequency is much lower 0 02 bar 10 of that at 1 5 cm and only takes account for the 23 of rms acoustic pressure of total power considering the remaining 0 12 bar 40 of that at 1 5 cm of the rms acoustic pressure induced by total power this region remains the cavitation activity while most of the cavitation bubbles induced by the harmonics should be less violent to membranes this region was referred to as a stable cavitation where membrane rupture by us expectedly was minimized whist the cavitation cleaning capacity of us remains 3 2 membrane stability in water under violent and stable cavitation in this section membrane stability was compared in the determined stable cavitation region and in the violent cavitation region 3 5 cm and 1 5 cm to transducer tip respectively in this comparison objective membranes were placed in the test system section 2 3 2 filled with water the surface morphology as well as mechanical and chemical properties of membranes were monitored cracks were observed on the membranes exposed to violent cavitation for 10 h from sem images in fig 4b irregular section cracks were found the surface of the membranes was eroded fig 4d as demonstrated by the disappearance of the membrane selective skin by comparing to the surface of the pristine membrane fig 4a on the other hand no such crack and no significant changes in membrane micro surface morphology were found on the membranes exposed to stable cavitation fig 4c moreover the stress strain curve obtained by tensile tests on membrane samples subjected to stable cavitation is presented in fig s2 in supplementary information the curve shapes of these membranes remain the same as that of pristine membranes indicating that membranes mechanical strength is maintained the chemical changes of membranes in stable and violent cavitation regions were analysed by edx and ftir it s worth noting that the psu pvp membranes used in this study were made from psu blended with 5 pvp the fraction of pvp on the membrane material can be monitored by the n s atomic ratio because repeat units of psu and pvp carry only one sulphur atom s and one nitrogen atom n respectively from the edx analysis the n s atomic ratio of membranes submitted to stable cavitation maintained the same value of the pristine membrane n s atomic ration 4 53 0 6 while the ratio decreased from 4 53 0 6 to 1 88 0 4 upon exposure to violent cavitation moreover according to ftir analysis fig s3 in supplementary information of membranes exposed to both violent and stable cavitations no new absorbance band appears in their ftir spectra comparing to that of the pristine membrane the band at 1674 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of the amide unit of the pvp and the one at 1145 cm 1 associated with symmetric so2 stretching vibration of psu 40 were analysed the ratio of these two absorbance s n of pvp so2 of psu on membranes submitted to violent cavitation is around 0 08 which is below the ratio obtained for pristine membranes 0 18 and for membranes exposed to stable cavitation 0 16 these results are in accordance with the edx analysis they enable the conclusion that under violent cavitation the pvp fraction on the membrane material decreases mainly by pvp dislodgement from the membrane rather than by its chemical degradation no new band observed by ftir this is in accordance with meb observations the membranes exposed to violent cavitation dominantly suffered from physical erosion under 50 w ultrasonic irradiation when this erosion is negligible for membranes submitted to stable cavitation these results confirmed that the exposure of membranes to stable cavitation effectively controls their cavitation damage in these conditions membranes maintained their mechanical and chemical properties as well as their surface structure exposing membranes to violent cavitation although with a relatively low us power of 50 w led to severe damage or even cracking 3 3 role of us on membrane ageing during exposure to oxidative media membrane ageing the degradation of the membrane over time was evaluated during exposure to oxidative media resulting in performance decline or complete membrane failure 41 42 therefore besides the control of cavitation damage to membranes it is important to understand the membrane ageing process in the heterogeneous sono fenton reactor with this aim psu pvp hollow fibre membranes were placed under stable cavitation and submerged in fenton reactive medium 4 8 g l 1 catalyst and 6 4 mm h2o2 to identify the role of us on membrane ageing another group of membranes was soaked in a fenton reactive medium under silent conditions us off changes in mechanical and chemical properties of the membrane material were then monitored mechanical properties of membranes in sono fenton and fenton media were monitored as a macroscale view of changes in material performances by comparing the stress strain curves of membranes sampling at different exposure times it was found that the shapes of the elastic domain and early stages of the plastic domain were generally unchanged results not shown while the ultimate elongation value at break appeared to be affected the ultimate elongation therefore was the most sensitive parameter compared for example to young s modulus for this reason the ultimate elongation was presented to demonstrate the change in mechanical properties of the membranes the variation of ultimate elongation of membranes over exposure time is shown in fig 5a one can observe that without us ultimate elongation of membranes remained constant on the other hand when membranes were submitted to us their ultimate elongation slightly decreased before reaching a plateau at around 80 of the initial value after a 20 hour exposure at the same time sem images of these last membrane samples after a 30 hour exposure presented a similar surface to that of the pristine membrane indicating no significant change in membrane surface morphology fig s4 in supplementary information the change in chemical properties of 30 h aged membranes was then investigated by ftir and edx analysis ftir spectra of psu pvp membranes after 30 hour exposure to fenton us off and sono fenton under stable cavitation were presented in fig 5c the major distinction among the spectra appeared from 1700 to 1630 cm 1 the intensity of the ir band at 1674 cm 1 characteristic of pvp decreased in samples submitted to sono fenton medium compared to the pristine membranes at the same time a sharp absorbance peak appeared at 1735 cm 1 associated with the formation of non cyclic imide groups characteristic of degradation products of pvp resulting from hydroxyl radical attack 43 on one hand these results revealed that the chain scission of pvp occurred when membranes are submitted to sono fenton conditions furthermore the absorbance intensity at 1735 cm 1 increased with exposure time and then stabilized after a 20 hour exposure to sono fenton conditions panel of fig 5c it is likely that the pvp chain scission developed more quickly at the early stage of exposure then stabilized on the other hand previous studies 14 showed that the chain scission of psu evidenced with absorbance peaks at 1638 cm 1 caused a dramatic decrease in membrane mechanical properties herein no such peaks were observed in the ftir spectra of aged membranes these results show that us induced chain scission of the pvp additive when the psu is not oxidated the chemical properties stabilisation after a 20 hour exposure stabilized pvp chain scission and absence of psu chain scission is in accordance with the behaviour in mechanical properties decrease in ultimate elongation of aged membranes followed by stabilisation after a 20 hour exposure fig 5a as discussed in section 3 2 the n s atomic ratio from the edx analysis represents the fraction of pvp on the membrane surface fig 5b compares the n s atomic ratio of pristine membrane and samples exposed to fenton us off 10 30 hour exposure and sono fenton media 5 10 20 30 hour exposure one can find after a 5 hour exposure to sono fenton the n s atomic ratio on the surface of membranes decreases to 75 of the pristine value this ratio was then maintained until the end of the experimental period 30 hour exposure that is to say the release of pvp additive from the membranes mainly occurred at the early stage of exposure combining the ftir analysis spectra shown in fig 5c it was found that the membrane ageing in sono fenton began with the release of a certain amount 25 of pvp additive at the early stage 5 hour exposure after the further membrane ageing involved the chain scission of pvp chemical properties change until reaching stabilisation after a 20 hour exposure by comparing the ftir spectra and n s atomic ratio of aged membranes in fenton medium us off no significant change in ir absorbance was observed and the n s atomic ratio kept 90 of that of pristine membranes these results indicated that membrane ageing was accelerated under us radiation although the acceleration of membrane ageing by us radiation is likely to a controllable degree membranes properties stabilisation and no significant degradation of backbone material one can suggest the application of a pulsed mode ultrasound reducing the us exposure time in a us assisted membrane process for a sustainable system 3 4 hsofm reactor design and preliminary test for water treatment placement of membranes in a stable cavitation region is evident in order to prevent cavitation damage of membranes while keeping the cavitation cleaning capacity of us according to the study in section 3 1 a 6 5 l bench scale hsofm reactor fig s1 in supplementary information was designed where a scalable hollow fibre membrane module was placed in a stable cavitation region 3 5 cm to the transducer tip in this preliminary test of hsofm reactor the objective was to evaluate over time the oxidation of organic pollutants and the evolution of membrane fouling when us are applied therefore the heterogeneous fenton oxidation was conducted in the reactor in two stages section 2 3 3 stage one under silent conditions with us off to preform fouling induced by zeolite catalysts stage two with us on for treatment of membrane fouling the hsofm reactor was filled with 4 8 g l 1 zeolite catalysts the oxidation of ibuprofen in water was started by continuous injection of h2o2 fig 6a shows that the toc of the solution in the reactor decreased from the beginning of oxidation and reached a plateau from 180 min at stage one us off no significant decrease of toc was found from 180 min to 300 min of oxidation time these results indicate that the heterogeneous fenton oxidation us off contributed little to oxidate organic pollutants until total mineralization which is in accordance with other studies 44 45 since the fezsm 5 catalysts are stable over several sequential uses in oxidation reactions 44 the plateau of toc from 180 min oxidation is likely due to the formation of refractory oxidation intermediates with us on sono fenton oxidation stage two the toc value of the solution in the reactor decreased again in 40 min with statistical significance p 0 05 confirming that us integration enhanced the fenton oxidation in the hsofm reactor according to previous studies 8 27 the enhancement of mineralization degree by us toc decrease is probably attributed to 1 additional powerful oxidants oh radicals generated by water sonolysis us on 2 us improving fe2 regeneration and subsequent formation of radicals for the fouling control aspect since the hsofm reactor is a constant permeate flux system the development of fouling causes an increase in transmembrane pressure tmp a higher increase rate of tmp reflected a faster fouling rate fig 6b presents the evolution of tmp and the permeate flux from the beginning of oxidation treatment at stage one us off the operating flux is constant at 30 l h 1 m 2 according to the value of critical flux for irreversible fouling in the hsofm reactor 23 l h 1 m 2 the operating flux is above this threshold value 14 the fouling induced by the catalysts is then expected to be irreversible which means the foulants persisted on the membrane even if the tmp decreases 14 from fig 6b the tmp increased due to the fouling occurrence during a 3 hour filtration us off the irreversible fouling was further developed with an average rate of 8 7 10 5 bar min 1 thereafter the experiment turned into stage two with us on the tmp unexpectedly increased faster than for stage one with an average rate of 2 3 10 4 bar min 1 rather than mitigating fouling applying us likely led to a more rapid formation of fouling to understand this phenomenon membrane samples were taken from the module and sem analysis were performed from the sem images in fig 6c one can observe that many fine catalyst fragments were firmly adhesive to the membrane surface blocking the membrane pores the reduction of catalyst size under us was confirmed by particle size distribution test fig s5 in supplementary information the size decreases from d90 13 5 μm for initial zeolite catalysts to d90 11 4 μm and 6 51 μm for catalysts after 10 and 30 hour exposure to us respectively hence it appears that the catalysts were eroded under us the fine catalyst fragments leading to severe membrane fouling similar phenomena were reported in a study using us control of fouling by sludge flocs us radiation cracking the sludge flocs caused the deterioration of membrane fouling condition 16 in their study the performance of us for fouling control was improved by optimising the radiation length and by integrating a flush of the membrane in the process therefore applying the pulse mode us reducing the us exposure time and or integrating backwashing could be some solutions to this issue it s worth noting that the pulse mode us also benefits membrane stability under us as discussed before for these reasons it can be suggested that pulse mode radiation be used in a us assisted membrane and oxidation process and optimize the hsofm reactor with a pulse mode us in further study 4 conclusion this study discussed the practical aspects of the integration of ultrasound with membrane and advanced oxidation process for water treatment a model system integrating ultrasound with heterogeneous fenton membrane reactor was designed for pharmaceutical oxidation where a scalable hollow fibre membrane module was applied us was integrated in the system to potentially enhance heterogeneous fenton oxidation and control fouling induced by zeolite catalysts a stable cavitation strategy was first investigated for the control of cavitation damage to membranes a major concern for us assisted membrane based processes the intensity of cavitation activity axial along ultrasound transducer was quantified by hydrophone measurements and spectrally analysed the stable cavitation located at 3 5 cm to the transducer tips was identified where cavitation activities were in a minority generated by harmonics and so less violent to membrane materials after tests of membrane stability in both stable and violent cavitation regions confirmed that membranes placed in a stable cavitation region kept their mechanical and chemical properties and surface morphology exposing membranes to the violent cavitation region albeit with a relatively low us power of 50 w led to severe physical damage of the membranes and even cracking considering the sustainable aspect of the us membrane system the role of us on membrane ageing was then studied in a stable cavitation region us radiation was found to accelerate membrane ageing in the oxidative sono fenton medium but likely in a controllable degree on one hand the membrane ageing involved the decrease in pvp additive content 5 in the virgin membrane material partly by dislodgment from the membrane structure and partly by chain scission however this pvp degradation reached a stable state under the experimental period on the other hand absence of degradation of the backbone material psu of membranes was observed a heterogeneous sono fenton membrane hsofm reactor was designed by placing a hollow fibre membrane module in a stable cavitation region for bench scale testing the preliminary tests confirmed that us integration enhanced the heterogeneous fenton oxidation of organic pollutants in the hsofm reactor toc reduction by fenton oxidation in the reactor reached a plateau but when us applied toc value decreased again however us unexpectedly eroded the catalysts and the fine catalyst fragments caused severe fouling a pulsed mode us was proposed for further optimisation of hsofm reactor and control of the membrane ageing

13226,cavitation damage to membranes is a major barrier for developing an ultrasound us assisted membrane water treatment process in this study us was integrated to a heterogeneous fenton membrane reactor for the treatment of pharmaceutical containing water with the aims of i fouling control ii enhancement of heterogeneous fenton oxidation in order to prevent membrane damages due to cavitation the stable and violent cavitation regions were identified by quantification and analysis of the cavitation activity axial along the ultrasound transducer via hydrophone measurements results showed the cavitation activities occur in both regions with us on while the cavitation damage to membrane materials was only observed when membranes were placed in the violent cavitation region on one hand cracking and physical erosion of the surface were observed on membrane samples when exposed to violent cavitation on the other hand no such erosion occurred in stable cavitation regions and membranes kept their mechanical chemical and morphological properties confirming that cavitation damage was controlled by placing membranes in the identified stable cavitation region based on these results a heterogeneous sono fenton membrane reactor was designed by placing a scalable hollow fibre membrane module in the stable cavitation region within this reactor the experiments confirmed that the oxidation of organics was enhanced thanks to the us assistance in the novel designed heterogeneous sono fenton membrane reactor however this study also showed that us accelerated membrane ageing and zeolite catalysts erosion leading to more severe fouling overall this paper introduces a method to control the cavitation damage to membranes and discusses the issues in us assisted membrane systems with practical insights keywords ultrasound microfiltration cavitation damage ultrasonic fouling control heterogeneous sono fenton oxidation 1 introduction the production and demand of pharmaceuticals has dramatically increased for high economic growth and better human health 1 however the discharge of pharmaceuticals contained wastewater from all kind of sources such as the pharmaceutical industry and hospital effluents has become a major challenge to the sustainability of the aquatic system most pharmaceuticals are partially or non biodegradable and resistant to the conventional activated sludge process of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp releasing into the environment 2 these refractory pharmaceuticals accumulate in the aquatic ecosystems and pose significant threats to the ecosystem s sustainability and drinking water safety 3 4 it is therefore crucial to develop new and advanced treatment systems in particular integrated treatment systems combining several techniques have recently become a very interesting approach providing additional options for treatments of harsh wastewater or high discharge standard 5 10 membrane based oxidation processes are increasingly attracting attention for water treatment as the integration of membrane filtration and advanced oxidation processes efficiently remove and eliminate refractory pollutants 5 7 11 14 in these processes the role of membranes can be applied to separate and concentrate pollutants 7 11 12 or complete an oxidation reactor by retention and reuse of the catalysts 5 14 however the process efficiency is limited by the membrane fouling induced by the components in wastewater matrix or catalysts in oxidation reactors to tackle fouling issues the integration of ultrasound us with membrane filtration has been widely studied during the last two decades 15 20 us enables to detach or loosen deposits particles from membrane surfaces by cavitation mechanism i e microjets and transport foulants away from the surface by acoustic streaming 19 indeed us enables to promote both physical and chemical processes 21 22 besides fouling control us furthermore promisingly improves oxidation efficiency in a membrane based oxidation process 10 23 for example us enhanced heterogeneous fenton oxidation sono fenton in multiple functions 8 24 26 us improving fe2 regeneration and subsequent formation of radicals in the heterogeneous fenton reactor has been proven moreover us assisted the mineralization of organic pollutants it was found that the mineralization degree of phenol by heterogeneous fenton oxidation was significantly enhanced with up to 90 of toc removal after us irradiation 27 this enhancement of the mineralization of organic pollutants can be associated to us preventing from the catalyst deactivation the formation of other reactive oxidant species and or thermal cleavage of volatile compounds contributing to the acoustic cavitation which gives rise to extreme conditions inside and around the collapsing bubble up to 5000 k and 500 bar the cavitation also contributes to the increase of accessible surface of catalysts by its mechanical effects the cavitation activities induced by us irradiation in the water potentially benefits both membrane fouling control and oxidation efficiency however the cavitation damage to membrane materials is a major concern for the integration of us into membrane based processes it was widely reported that cavitation and bubble implosion may induce physical and chemical erosion of membrane materials 28 31 indeed the damaging effects of us are highly related to the cavitation type and intensity 32 during acoustic cavitation gas bubbles appear due to acoustic waves depending on the bubble size and local acoustic pressure the oscillation of a bubble is variable schematically some bubbles violently collapse transient cavitation generating a very strong shock wave followed by the production of oh radicals responsible for mechanical and chemical damage to materials other types of bubbles slightly oscillate and are more stable with a relatively long lifetime stable cavitation 33 this latter type of cavitation is less active and so less destructive to materials therefore the cavitation damage to membranes can be potentially controlled by identifying the cavitation intensity and minimising the effects of violent cavitation activity to promote us assisted membranes and advanced oxidation processes for water treatment the present study integrated sonication with the heterogeneous fenton membrane reactor which was investigated in our previous study 14 a heterogeneous sono fenton membrane reactor hsofm was then developed for the degradation of pharmaceuticals in an aqueous solution the oxidation ability of this process is attributed to highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oh generated from fenton like reactions involving hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant and iron containing micro sized zeolites as catalysts 34 the role of membrane filtration in the hsofm reactor is to retain the zeolite catalysts in the effluent compartment during the continuous water treatment overcoming the issue of difficult iron recovery in the fenton oxidation process 35 the further integration of the sonication in this process is of great interest to control membrane fouling induced by the zeolite catalysts and to enhance the degradation of pharmaceuticals in this present paper the practical aspects of the coupling of us with membranes and advanced oxidation processes for water treatment have been discussed firstly a stable cavitation strategy for controlling cavitation damage to membrane materials was investigated secondly the violent and stable cavitation regions were identified by quantification and analysis of the cavitation activity axial along with an ultrasound transducer via hydrophone measurements the control of cavitation damage to membranes in the stable cavitation region was then verified following the analysis of the role of us on membrane ageing in a sono fenton aggressive media moreover since the chemical effects of ultrasound on membrane are rarely investigated in the literature 36 the impact of both the chemical and physical effects will be discussed in this study the model system a bench scale hsofm reactor with a scalable hollow fibre membrane module was then designed by placing the membrane module in a stable cavitation region two potential benefits of us in water treatment processes fouling control and oxidation enhancement were then evaluated in the hsofm reactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and membrane all aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized di water generated by a purelab maxima system elga labwater s uk ibuprofen ibp c13h18o2 purity 99 99 was purchased from basf corporation and used as received hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 w w sulphuric acid 1 mol l titanium tetrachloride solution 0 09 mol l in 20 hcl for h2o2 concentration analysis monopotassium phosphate kh2po4 and sodium phosphate dibasic dehydrate na2hpo4 2h2o for preparing the buffer solution were purchased from sigma aldrich a commercial iron containing zeolite of zsm 5 structure provided by clariant was used as fenton s reagents this zeolite exhibited a si al ratio of 13 and an iron content of 3 5 wt the average particle size of this catalyst is approximately 8 μm 35 mf0808xs polysulfone polyvinylpyrrolidone psu pvp hollow fibre membrane module provided by polymem was tested pvp was blended 5 w w into the psu matrix to increase the hydrophilicity of the membranes the membrane pore size was 0 1 μm microfiltration membrane in this study membrane filtration was only intended to maintain the catalyst approximately 8 μm in the oxidation reactor during the continuous treatment rather than to selectively reject the pharmaceutical and by products the membrane module for the hsofm reactor contained 200 fibres its total active membrane surface was approximately 0 07 m2 2 2 cavitation activity analysis method 2 2 1 cavitation activity and acoustic pressure the aim of cavitation activity analysis was to estimate the intensity of axial cavitation activity along the us transducer in the region where the major group of cavitation bubbles was transient the cavitation activity was intensive and violent the violent collapse of transient cavitation bubbles most likely led to membrane erosion conversely where the dominate cavitation bubbles was relatively stable or long lifetime the cavitation activity was considered stable and expectedly less destructive to membrane materials the intensity of cavitation activity can be related to the spectral components of the acoustic wave the us spectrum includes a ray at the fundamental frequency f emitted by the ultrasonic generator possibly harmonics of this fundamental frequency k f sub harmonics f n and ultra harmonics kf n between all the rays there is a broadband noise it was proposed that the fundamental frequency is associated with violent collapses of cavitation bubbles potentially transient cavitation that lead to mechanical and chemical damage to membranes conversely harmonics induce a relatively long lifetime of the cavitation bubble indeed the intensity of the cavitation activities is highly dependent on the acoustic pressure 37 for this reason the cavitation activity can be estimated by measuring the acoustic pressure by means of a hydrophone section 2 2 2 the hydrophone determines the frequency band for the majority of the signal power 38 therefore by analysing the acoustic pressure axial along us transducer the acoustic cavitation due to the fundamental frequency can be identified from the total us power a stable cavitation region is identified where the majority of the cavitation bubbles are relatively stable conversely in a violent cavitation region the cavitation activities are violent and intense in the stable cavitation region the cavitation activities expectedly remain but intensive cavitation due to the fundamental frequency is minimized 2 2 2 acoustic pressure measurements with hydrophone and data analysis the acoustic pressure measurements were performed using a hydrophone model 8103 provided by brüel kjᴂr the piezoelectric ceramic was encapsulated in a rubber cylinder 3 cm long and 0 7 cm in diameter it was calibrated by the manufacturer who provided the evolution of the sensitivity in volts versus the acoustic frequency this calibration curve relates the amplitude of the acoustic pressure to which the sensor is subjected to the resulting electric charge the measurement system then comprises three devices provided by brüel kjᴂr an amplifier model 1704 intended to simulate an infinite input impedance and whose gain is set to the unit value a signal converter model 2647 a connected upstream of the amplifier 1704 and finally a load attenuator model wb0779 connected to the hydrophone to remain in the voltage range compatible with the amplifier 1704 and thus avoid saturation at very high acoustic pressures at 20 khz this setup has a resulting sensitivity of 0 896 v bar it should be noted that this configuration had a cutoff frequency located at 50 khz for data acquisition the measurement system was connected to a digital oscilloscope pico technology this device makes it possible to measure and digitize the output voltage of the measuring device so a computer can register it the whole measurement system involved in this study is represented in fig 1 the signal is processed with matlab software after pretreatment of the signal a spectral analysis was performed by discrete fourier transform dft the data processing is already detailed in a previous article 38 thus a spectrum was obtained which determines the frequency bands where there is the majority of the power contained in the signal it is then possible to determine the contribution to the total us power of the different elements of the spectrum fundamental frequency harmonics and broadband noise by calculating the rms root mean square value pressure according to the discussion in section 2 1 the rms acoustic pressure contributions to the total us power and to the fundamental frequency were determined and analysed to estimate the stable and violent cavitation regions axial along the ultrasonic probe 2 3 experimental set up and protocol 2 3 1 ultrasound generator and identification of the stable cavitation region the ultrasound generator sinaptec nextgen inside 500 connected with a cup horn type transducer was used for both the membrane stability tests set up and hsofm reactors the operating ultrasound frequency is 20 khz which is commonly used for the integration of membrane based processes since lower frequencies had higher cleaning efficiencies than higher frequencies 19 the us power is fixed at 50 w because previous studies determined that membrane erosion was insignificant for us power less than 60 w 31 to analyse cavitation activity axial along the us transducer the acoustic pressure section 2 2 was measured every 0 5 cm along us transducer using the hydrophone in a water filled glassware the stable and violent cavitation regions were estimated by quantification and analysis of acoustic pressure due to fundamental frequency of the total us power 2 3 2 membrane stability and ageing tests under us the membrane stability under us was measured in a 1 l jacketed thermostat glassware shown in fig 2 the us transducer was located at the bottom of the glass reactor and membranes were fixed in a frame by moving this frame up or down the distance between membranes and the us transducer could be adjusted from 1 5 to 4 cm this axial distance between membranes and the transducer tip is referred to as tip height by adjusting the tip height membranes can be exposed to identified stable or violent cavitation region for us exposure the psu pvp membranes were immersed in di water in the glassware the tests were conducted for 10 h under continuous 50 w us power by placing membranes in both stable and violent cavitation regions then the membranes were sampled and characterized furthermore to understand the effect of us on membrane ageing while exposed to oxidative media psu pvp membranes were immersed into a heterogeneous fenton reactive suspension containing 4 8 g l 1 of zsm 5 zeolite and 6 4 mm h2o2 under stable cavitation the concentration of catalysts and h2o2 was chosen according to selected conditions in a previous study on the heterogeneous fenton membrane reactor 14 the h2o2 concentration in the suspension was maintained at 6 4 mm by continuous h2o2 injection using a syringe pump harvard phd 2000 the us power was maintained at 50 w for comparison other groups of psu pvp membranes were submerged into fenton reactive suspension with the same concentration of zsm 5 zeolite catalyst and h2o2 under silent conditions all the soaking tests were conducted for 30 h membrane samples were taken periodically during the experiment for analysis 2 3 3 heterogeneous sono fenton hollow fibre membrane reactor the hsofm reactor was designed by placing the membrane module in the identified stable cavitation region for the control of cavitation damage fig s1 in supplementary information the experimental solution was introduced in a 6 5 l thermo regulated glass reactor the membrane module reactor retains the catalyst in the glass reactor the filtrations were performed in the outside in filtration mode the permeate was recycled back into the reactor to simulate a continuous process from a hydrodynamic point of view the us transducer was located on the side wall of the reactor within the designed distance to the membrane module with on and off options the water treatment performance of hsofm reactor was assessed by the degradation of the pharmaceutical solution ibuprofen ibp a widely used drug was selected as the target pollutant for the reactor assessment because it was found in effluents from various wastewater treatment plants and groundwater up to 95 μg l 1 39 ibp was dissolved in deionized water with an initial concentration of 20 mg l 1 the stoichiometric amount of h2o2 6 4 mm was applied twice to avoid extensive scavenging of hydroxyl radicals for effective production of hydroxyl radicals the h2o2 fe molar ratio was maintained at 10 and the catalyst concentration at 4 8 g l 1 the concentration of h2o2 was maintained at 6 4 mm due to its continuous injection using a syringe pump harvard phd 2000 during oxidation the water treatment experiments were conducted at a controlled temperature of 25 2 c the rotation rate of the stirrer inside the reactor was 300 rpm in this preliminary test of hsofm reactor the objective was to understand the membrane fouling phenomenon and fenton oxidation under sonication therefore the water treatment process was conducted in two stages 2 3 3 1 stage one with us off filtration flux was maintained at 30 l h 1 m 2 for fouling development with us off and the variation of transmembrane pressure was monitored during the process the filtration was performed at 30 l h 1 m 2 because this flux value was above the critical flux value flux below which a decline of flux over time due to irreversible fouling does not occur and above which irreversible fouling is observed 14 oxidation was started by injecting h2o2 when the adsorption of ibp by catalysts and membranes had reached equilibrium 2 3 3 2 stage two with us on filtration and oxidation were conducted following the same protocol as in stage one while us was switched on in this stage since the hsofm reactor is a constant permeate flux system the development of fouling causes the increase in transmembrane pressure tmp in these two stages transmembrane pressure was monitored to investigate fouling development solution samples were taken at regular intervals in the reactor for analysis and immediately treated by phosphate buffer a mixture of kh2po4 0 05 m and na2hpo4 2h2o 0 05 m to reach a neutral ph after the removal of catalysts using a 0 45 μm rc syringe filter to stop the oxidation reaction 2 4 analysis 2 4 1 solution analysis to evaluate the water treatment efficiency the total organic carbon toc of solution samples from the reactor was analysed the toc value was calculated from the difference between total carbon tc and inorganic carbon ic measured by a toc l analyser shimadzu the tc of all samples was measured three times and the coefficient of variation was less than 2 calibration curves were established using commercially available standard solutions shimadzu 2 4 2 membrane characterization 2 4 2 1 sem edx scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy morphology and elemental information on the membrane surface were examined with a sem hitachi tabletop microscope tm 1000 interfaced with an edx spectroscopy system thermo fisher samples were coated with a thin layer of gold before sem analysis for better contrast edx analyses were carried out at the same time edx measurements were performed at different locations of the membrane surface to obtain a comprehensive elemental composition 2 4 2 2 atr ftir attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was obtained with a thermo nicolet nexus 670 apparatus usa the sample was placed on diamond crystal substrates and the analytical depth was approximately 2 μm membrane samples after soaking in the reactive medium were firstly dried at 40 c for 48 h then they were examined using atr ftir spectra to identify chemical membrane changes all the recorded psu pvp ir spectra were corrected by adjusting the 1587 cm 1 band to an arbitrary chosen absorbance value of 1 this band corresponds to an aromatic in plane ring bend stretching vibration of the psu and considered to be invariable during membrane degradation 14 the corrected absorbance is mentioned as relative absorbance to facilitate the reader s understanding when monitoring changes of specific ir bands upon degradation normalization by dividing the relative absorbance by the one of the pristine membranes was performed 2 4 2 3 tensile testing tensile tests were performed to obtain the stress strain curve reflexing membrane s mechanical property the measurements were performed on wet membranes using an instron 4281 series tensile apparatus tailor made grips for the hollow fibre geometry were fitted to the device to avoid stress concentration the initial distance between grips was fixed at 50 mm and samples were extended at a constant elongation rate of 100 mm min ultimate elongation at breakpoint was calculated from the experimental stress strain curves a set of five samples were analysed and averaged for each tested condition 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the stable cavitation region this section aims to determine a stable cavitation region where the cavitation bubbles are relatively stable or long lifetime and less violent to membrane materials as discussed in section 2 2 1 the fundamental frequency is usually associated with violent collapses of cavitation bubbles while harmonics induce the relatively long lifetime cavitation bubble 38 therefore by means of a hydrophone section 2 2 the fundamental frequency from the ultrasonic spectrum was identified and its associated cavitation activity characterized by the rms acoustic pressure was determined the stable cavitation region was identified in this region cavitation activities by rms acoustic pressure remain but rms acoustic pressure associated to the fundamental frequency are minimized to identify the frequencies of the ultrasonic wave the time frequency signal was measured by a hydrophone followed by a fourier transform spectral analysis the spectrum obtained from the signal measurement at 1 5 cm tip height is presented in fig 3a the frequencies were identified by indicating their amplitude two peaks were detected in fig 3a corresponding to the fundamental frequency 20 khz and the first harmonic 40 khz with the 50 khz frequency cut off of the measuring system fig 3b shows the rms acoustic pressure of fundamental frequency 20 khz and total power as a function of the axial distance to the transducer tip referred to as tip height each value in the graph is obtained from an average of 32 spectra one can observe that the rms acoustic pressure of fundamental frequency dramatically decreased from 0 2 bar with the increase in tip height until reached the lowest value 0 02 bar at 3 5 cm on the other hand rms acoustic pressure of total power was 0 28 bar at the initial point 1 5 cm tip height after approximately 50 decline its value relatively stabilized at around 0 15 bar from 2 cm to 4 cm tip height fig 3c highlights the ratio of rms acoustic pressure of fundamental frequency to total power it was found that the percentage of rms acoustic pressure of fundamental frequency decreases from 1 5 cm to 3 5 cm tip height then increases the estimation of the intensity of cavitation activity depends on both the magnitude of rms acoustic pressure induced by the fundamental frequency as well as its percentage in the rms acoustic pressure of total us power therefore for a tip height of 1 5 cm the rms acoustic pressure induced by the fundamental frequency is high 0 2 bar and accounts for 73 of the rms acoustic pressure of total power the violent collapse of the cavitation bubbles associated with fundamental frequency likely occurred there thus this region was referred as violent cavitation in contrast at 3 5 cm tip height the rms acoustic pressure of the fundamental frequency is much lower 0 02 bar 10 of that at 1 5 cm and only takes account for the 23 of rms acoustic pressure of total power considering the remaining 0 12 bar 40 of that at 1 5 cm of the rms acoustic pressure induced by total power this region remains the cavitation activity while most of the cavitation bubbles induced by the harmonics should be less violent to membranes this region was referred to as a stable cavitation where membrane rupture by us expectedly was minimized whist the cavitation cleaning capacity of us remains 3 2 membrane stability in water under violent and stable cavitation in this section membrane stability was compared in the determined stable cavitation region and in the violent cavitation region 3 5 cm and 1 5 cm to transducer tip respectively in this comparison objective membranes were placed in the test system section 2 3 2 filled with water the surface morphology as well as mechanical and chemical properties of membranes were monitored cracks were observed on the membranes exposed to violent cavitation for 10 h from sem images in fig 4b irregular section cracks were found the surface of the membranes was eroded fig 4d as demonstrated by the disappearance of the membrane selective skin by comparing to the surface of the pristine membrane fig 4a on the other hand no such crack and no significant changes in membrane micro surface morphology were found on the membranes exposed to stable cavitation fig 4c moreover the stress strain curve obtained by tensile tests on membrane samples subjected to stable cavitation is presented in fig s2 in supplementary information the curve shapes of these membranes remain the same as that of pristine membranes indicating that membranes mechanical strength is maintained the chemical changes of membranes in stable and violent cavitation regions were analysed by edx and ftir it s worth noting that the psu pvp membranes used in this study were made from psu blended with 5 pvp the fraction of pvp on the membrane material can be monitored by the n s atomic ratio because repeat units of psu and pvp carry only one sulphur atom s and one nitrogen atom n respectively from the edx analysis the n s atomic ratio of membranes submitted to stable cavitation maintained the same value of the pristine membrane n s atomic ration 4 53 0 6 while the ratio decreased from 4 53 0 6 to 1 88 0 4 upon exposure to violent cavitation moreover according to ftir analysis fig s3 in supplementary information of membranes exposed to both violent and stable cavitations no new absorbance band appears in their ftir spectra comparing to that of the pristine membrane the band at 1674 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of the amide unit of the pvp and the one at 1145 cm 1 associated with symmetric so2 stretching vibration of psu 40 were analysed the ratio of these two absorbance s n of pvp so2 of psu on membranes submitted to violent cavitation is around 0 08 which is below the ratio obtained for pristine membranes 0 18 and for membranes exposed to stable cavitation 0 16 these results are in accordance with the edx analysis they enable the conclusion that under violent cavitation the pvp fraction on the membrane material decreases mainly by pvp dislodgement from the membrane rather than by its chemical degradation no new band observed by ftir this is in accordance with meb observations the membranes exposed to violent cavitation dominantly suffered from physical erosion under 50 w ultrasonic irradiation when this erosion is negligible for membranes submitted to stable cavitation these results confirmed that the exposure of membranes to stable cavitation effectively controls their cavitation damage in these conditions membranes maintained their mechanical and chemical properties as well as their surface structure exposing membranes to violent cavitation although with a relatively low us power of 50 w led to severe damage or even cracking 3 3 role of us on membrane ageing during exposure to oxidative media membrane ageing the degradation of the membrane over time was evaluated during exposure to oxidative media resulting in performance decline or complete membrane failure 41 42 therefore besides the control of cavitation damage to membranes it is important to understand the membrane ageing process in the heterogeneous sono fenton reactor with this aim psu pvp hollow fibre membranes were placed under stable cavitation and submerged in fenton reactive medium 4 8 g l 1 catalyst and 6 4 mm h2o2 to identify the role of us on membrane ageing another group of membranes was soaked in a fenton reactive medium under silent conditions us off changes in mechanical and chemical properties of the membrane material were then monitored mechanical properties of membranes in sono fenton and fenton media were monitored as a macroscale view of changes in material performances by comparing the stress strain curves of membranes sampling at different exposure times it was found that the shapes of the elastic domain and early stages of the plastic domain were generally unchanged results not shown while the ultimate elongation value at break appeared to be affected the ultimate elongation therefore was the most sensitive parameter compared for example to young s modulus for this reason the ultimate elongation was presented to demonstrate the change in mechanical properties of the membranes the variation of ultimate elongation of membranes over exposure time is shown in fig 5a one can observe that without us ultimate elongation of membranes remained constant on the other hand when membranes were submitted to us their ultimate elongation slightly decreased before reaching a plateau at around 80 of the initial value after a 20 hour exposure at the same time sem images of these last membrane samples after a 30 hour exposure presented a similar surface to that of the pristine membrane indicating no significant change in membrane surface morphology fig s4 in supplementary information the change in chemical properties of 30 h aged membranes was then investigated by ftir and edx analysis ftir spectra of psu pvp membranes after 30 hour exposure to fenton us off and sono fenton under stable cavitation were presented in fig 5c the major distinction among the spectra appeared from 1700 to 1630 cm 1 the intensity of the ir band at 1674 cm 1 characteristic of pvp decreased in samples submitted to sono fenton medium compared to the pristine membranes at the same time a sharp absorbance peak appeared at 1735 cm 1 associated with the formation of non cyclic imide groups characteristic of degradation products of pvp resulting from hydroxyl radical attack 43 on one hand these results revealed that the chain scission of pvp occurred when membranes are submitted to sono fenton conditions furthermore the absorbance intensity at 1735 cm 1 increased with exposure time and then stabilized after a 20 hour exposure to sono fenton conditions panel of fig 5c it is likely that the pvp chain scission developed more quickly at the early stage of exposure then stabilized on the other hand previous studies 14 showed that the chain scission of psu evidenced with absorbance peaks at 1638 cm 1 caused a dramatic decrease in membrane mechanical properties herein no such peaks were observed in the ftir spectra of aged membranes these results show that us induced chain scission of the pvp additive when the psu is not oxidated the chemical properties stabilisation after a 20 hour exposure stabilized pvp chain scission and absence of psu chain scission is in accordance with the behaviour in mechanical properties decrease in ultimate elongation of aged membranes followed by stabilisation after a 20 hour exposure fig 5a as discussed in section 3 2 the n s atomic ratio from the edx analysis represents the fraction of pvp on the membrane surface fig 5b compares the n s atomic ratio of pristine membrane and samples exposed to fenton us off 10 30 hour exposure and sono fenton media 5 10 20 30 hour exposure one can find after a 5 hour exposure to sono fenton the n s atomic ratio on the surface of membranes decreases to 75 of the pristine value this ratio was then maintained until the end of the experimental period 30 hour exposure that is to say the release of pvp additive from the membranes mainly occurred at the early stage of exposure combining the ftir analysis spectra shown in fig 5c it was found that the membrane ageing in sono fenton began with the release of a certain amount 25 of pvp additive at the early stage 5 hour exposure after the further membrane ageing involved the chain scission of pvp chemical properties change until reaching stabilisation after a 20 hour exposure by comparing the ftir spectra and n s atomic ratio of aged membranes in fenton medium us off no significant change in ir absorbance was observed and the n s atomic ratio kept 90 of that of pristine membranes these results indicated that membrane ageing was accelerated under us radiation although the acceleration of membrane ageing by us radiation is likely to a controllable degree membranes properties stabilisation and no significant degradation of backbone material one can suggest the application of a pulsed mode ultrasound reducing the us exposure time in a us assisted membrane process for a sustainable system 3 4 hsofm reactor design and preliminary test for water treatment placement of membranes in a stable cavitation region is evident in order to prevent cavitation damage of membranes while keeping the cavitation cleaning capacity of us according to the study in section 3 1 a 6 5 l bench scale hsofm reactor fig s1 in supplementary information was designed where a scalable hollow fibre membrane module was placed in a stable cavitation region 3 5 cm to the transducer tip in this preliminary test of hsofm reactor the objective was to evaluate over time the oxidation of organic pollutants and the evolution of membrane fouling when us are applied therefore the heterogeneous fenton oxidation was conducted in the reactor in two stages section 2 3 3 stage one under silent conditions with us off to preform fouling induced by zeolite catalysts stage two with us on for treatment of membrane fouling the hsofm reactor was filled with 4 8 g l 1 zeolite catalysts the oxidation of ibuprofen in water was started by continuous injection of h2o2 fig 6a shows that the toc of the solution in the reactor decreased from the beginning of oxidation and reached a plateau from 180 min at stage one us off no significant decrease of toc was found from 180 min to 300 min of oxidation time these results indicate that the heterogeneous fenton oxidation us off contributed little to oxidate organic pollutants until total mineralization which is in accordance with other studies 44 45 since the fezsm 5 catalysts are stable over several sequential uses in oxidation reactions 44 the plateau of toc from 180 min oxidation is likely due to the formation of refractory oxidation intermediates with us on sono fenton oxidation stage two the toc value of the solution in the reactor decreased again in 40 min with statistical significance p 0 05 confirming that us integration enhanced the fenton oxidation in the hsofm reactor according to previous studies 8 27 the enhancement of mineralization degree by us toc decrease is probably attributed to 1 additional powerful oxidants oh radicals generated by water sonolysis us on 2 us improving fe2 regeneration and subsequent formation of radicals for the fouling control aspect since the hsofm reactor is a constant permeate flux system the development of fouling causes an increase in transmembrane pressure tmp a higher increase rate of tmp reflected a faster fouling rate fig 6b presents the evolution of tmp and the permeate flux from the beginning of oxidation treatment at stage one us off the operating flux is constant at 30 l h 1 m 2 according to the value of critical flux for irreversible fouling in the hsofm reactor 23 l h 1 m 2 the operating flux is above this threshold value 14 the fouling induced by the catalysts is then expected to be irreversible which means the foulants persisted on the membrane even if the tmp decreases 14 from fig 6b the tmp increased due to the fouling occurrence during a 3 hour filtration us off the irreversible fouling was further developed with an average rate of 8 7 10 5 bar min 1 thereafter the experiment turned into stage two with us on the tmp unexpectedly increased faster than for stage one with an average rate of 2 3 10 4 bar min 1 rather than mitigating fouling applying us likely led to a more rapid formation of fouling to understand this phenomenon membrane samples were taken from the module and sem analysis were performed from the sem images in fig 6c one can observe that many fine catalyst fragments were firmly adhesive to the membrane surface blocking the membrane pores the reduction of catalyst size under us was confirmed by particle size distribution test fig s5 in supplementary information the size decreases from d90 13 5 μm for initial zeolite catalysts to d90 11 4 μm and 6 51 μm for catalysts after 10 and 30 hour exposure to us respectively hence it appears that the catalysts were eroded under us the fine catalyst fragments leading to severe membrane fouling similar phenomena were reported in a study using us control of fouling by sludge flocs us radiation cracking the sludge flocs caused the deterioration of membrane fouling condition 16 in their study the performance of us for fouling control was improved by optimising the radiation length and by integrating a flush of the membrane in the process therefore applying the pulse mode us reducing the us exposure time and or integrating backwashing could be some solutions to this issue it s worth noting that the pulse mode us also benefits membrane stability under us as discussed before for these reasons it can be suggested that pulse mode radiation be used in a us assisted membrane and oxidation process and optimize the hsofm reactor with a pulse mode us in further study 4 conclusion this study discussed the practical aspects of the integration of ultrasound with membrane and advanced oxidation process for water treatment a model system integrating ultrasound with heterogeneous fenton membrane reactor was designed for pharmaceutical oxidation where a scalable hollow fibre membrane module was applied us was integrated in the system to potentially enhance heterogeneous fenton oxidation and control fouling induced by zeolite catalysts a stable cavitation strategy was first investigated for the control of cavitation damage to membranes a major concern for us assisted membrane based processes the intensity of cavitation activity axial along ultrasound transducer was quantified by hydrophone measurements and spectrally analysed the stable cavitation located at 3 5 cm to the transducer tips was identified where cavitation activities were in a minority generated by harmonics and so less violent to membrane materials after tests of membrane stability in both stable and violent cavitation regions confirmed that membranes placed in a stable cavitation region kept their mechanical and chemical properties and surface morphology exposing membranes to the violent cavitation region albeit with a relatively low us power of 50 w led to severe physical damage of the membranes and even cracking considering the sustainable aspect of the us membrane system the role of us on membrane ageing was then studied in a stable cavitation region us radiation was found to accelerate membrane ageing in the oxidative sono fenton medium but likely in a controllable degree on one hand the membrane ageing involved the decrease in pvp additive content 5 in the virgin membrane material partly by dislodgment from the membrane structure and partly by chain scission however this pvp degradation reached a stable state under the experimental period on the other hand absence of degradation of the backbone material psu of membranes was observed a heterogeneous sono fenton membrane hsofm reactor was designed by placing a hollow fibre membrane module in a stable cavitation region for bench scale testing the preliminary tests confirmed that us integration enhanced the heterogeneous fenton oxidation of organic pollutants in the hsofm reactor toc reduction by fenton oxidation in the reactor reached a plateau but when us applied toc value decreased again however us unexpectedly eroded the catalysts and the fine catalyst fragments caused severe fouling a pulsed mode us was proposed for further optimisation of hsofm reactor and control of the membrane ageing

13227,in this study a stable and controllable poly p phenylene terephthamide polypyrrole ppta ppy composite organic solvent nanofiltration osn hollow fiber membrane was successfully prepared based on the robust chemical vapor deposition cvd method the structure and properties of the prepared ppta ppy osn membranes were studied in detail interestingly after modifying by ppy sem showed that the surface of the membrane formed a layer of turing like structure and evenly covered the surface of the membrane it was evident that the prepared ppta ppy osn membranes achieved good dye removal ability with a molecular weight cut off range from 200 to1000 da and the rejection of negative dyes was higher than 93 4 especially at high temperature 80 c and organic solvent n n dimethylacetamide dmac the ppta ppy osn membranes still exhibited excellent permeation and separation performance furthermore at room temperature the immersion experiment of the fabricated ppta ppy osn membranes in both ethanol and dmac for one month also proved the stability of long term organic solvents based on the above results this work offered a novel ppta based hollow fiber nanofiltration membrane which was expected to be applied in thermal and organic dye wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ppta osn hollow fiber membrane chemical vapor deposition high temperature 1 introduction organic solvent nanofiltration osn is a green and highly efficient process for separating organic substances from organic solvents and its molecular weight cut off range 200 to 1000 da 1 compared with traditional purification and separation technologies such as extraction distillation crystallization and chromatography it has the advantages of safety economy mild operating conditions and environmental friendliness 2 3 and it has great application prospects in food textile fine chemical petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries 4 6 however osn membranes still face many challenges in the aforementioned applications the key challenge in osn is the stability of membranes in organic solvents 7 the ceramic membranes have excellent thermal chemical and organic solvent resistance they do not swell or deform in organic solvents 8 among them the ceramic membranes of silica titanium dioxide and alumina have been successfully commercialized and they were used in separation and purification applications however the ceramic membrane market s growth and its application are currently limited by low processability low throughput complex manufacturing and high production costs compared with polymeric membranes 9 10 therefore most osn membranes reported in literatures or used commercially are made out of polymeric materials 11 at present most polymeric materials such as polyimide pi p84 9 polybenzimidazole pbi 12 polyacrylonitrile pan 13 poly ether ether ketone peek 14 and poly arylene sulfide sulfone pass 15 have been used to fabricate osn membranes by phase inversion method nevertheless these membranes have low permeability and selectivity as well as cannot withstand harsh environments such as n n dimethylformamide dmf or n methyl pyrrolidone nmp for these membranes to remain stable in applications using these solvents they generally need to be chemically crosslinking to improve their organic resistance 16 the crosslinking process will consume a mass of solvents and crosslinking chemicals resulting in high production costs and environmental pollution 17 other methods for preparing osn membranes include interfacial polymerization layer by layer assembly and increasing the concentration of polymer coating solution however these relatively complex processes also increase the cost of membrane preparation due to the use of various reactive chemicals and a mass of solvents 17 therefore developing new high performance membrane materials are required to combine the above advantages with a simplified preparation process which will focus on the preparation of osn membranes poly p phenylene terephthamide ppta kelvar is a typical liquid crystal polymer with superior hydrophilic solvent resistance mechanical and heat stability it has been widely used to prepare high performance fibers 18 19 however ppta has high crystallinity insoluble in most conventional solvents harsh preparation conditions and few related studies in the membrane industry 20 21 k nakura et al 22 and p zschocke and strathmann 23 fabricated a thermal and solvent resistant ppta ultrafiltration membrane the former explored the forming conditions and permeability of the ppta membrane while the latter studied the solvent resistance of the ppta membrane wang et al 21 developed ppta hollow fiber membrane through dry wet spinning technology the obtained membrane showed good thermal stability solvent resistance and anti fouling properties but its mechanical properties were poor moreover ppta hollow fiber membrane had low separation accuracy which was in the range of ultrafiltration the separation performance of dyes and small molecule sewage still needed to be further improved therefore to improve the separation accuracy of the membrane it is necessary to optimize the surface separation layer of the ppta porous membrane chemical vapor deposition cvd is a method of physical modification of membrane surface it can give the substrate membranes ideal properties by using a gas phase reaction without changing the composition of the substrate membranes 24 compared with some traditional membrane surface modification methods the thin layer formed through cvd method is dense and uniform and firmly bonded with the substrate membranes the deposition speed is fast and the composition is prone to control 25 26 polypyrrole ppy is characterized by hydrophilicity heat stability and insoluble in organic solvent 27 it is considered to be an ideal surface modification material 28 30 ppy has been reported as a selective layer for gas separation and pervaporation however there are few studies in the application of osn membranes li et al 27 developed novel ppy composite osn membranes with fecl3 as an oxidative initiator and studied the effects of different types support and pyrrole monomer concentration on the performance of the osn membranes compared with commercial osn membranes the obtained osn membranes showed a greater isopropyl alcohol ipa permeability 7 9 l m 2 h 1 mpa 1 and high rejection 96 for negatively charged dyes shao et al 31 developed a composite nanofiltration membrane through in situ polymerization of ppy on hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile panh support membrane with ammonium persulfate as an oxidant the obtained membrane exhibited constant permeability to ipa 12 1 l m 2 h 1 mpa 1 and the rejection of bengali rose was approximately 99 2 liu et al 32 developed polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf ppy composite nanofiltration membrane through cvd method the obtained membrane showed good anti fouling properties ji et al 33 fabricated pvdf graphene oxide go ppy hollow fiber membrane through cvd method the hydrophilicity of the obtained pvdf go ppy membrane was increased compared to the pristine pvdf membrane meanwhile the obtained membrane showed excellent dye rejection 98 5 for congo red acid orange 10 and direct yellow 24 in this research combined with mechanical enhancement excellent hydrophilic organic solvent resistance and thermostability ppta ppy osn membranes were prepared using the robust cvd method based on the principle of the polymer surface interfacial bonding a novel homogeneous braid reinforced br ppta hollow fiber membrane with ppta hollow fiber knitted tube as the reinforced matrix and ppta casting solution as the separation layer were prepared by dry wet spinning method then the ppy film was polymerized on the membrane surface through the robust cvd method to improve the charge and separation accuracy on the surface of the membrane further in addition nanofiltration performance was also evaluated with congo red under thermal and organic solvent conditions meanwhile the obtained membrane was statically soaked in organic solvent solution ethanol and dmac for one month and the results indicated that the novel ppta ppy osn membranes had great potential in thermal and organic dye solution treatment 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials poly p phenylene terephthamide resin ppta

of ppta membrane and ppta ppy osn membranes firstly ppta resin and sio2 particles were dried in a vacuum oven 0 1 mpa at 100 c for 12 h to remove moisture before use then at the temperature of 80 c a certain weight of ppta resin was uniformly mixed with h2so4 pore forming agents peg and sio2 particles under the high speed agitation when the dope solution was fully dissolved the fully dissolved dope solution was degassed for 1 h in a vacuum oven 0 1 mpa at 65 c a novel homogeneous reinforced ppta hollow fiber membrane with ppta hollow fiber knitted tube as the reinforced matrix and ppta casting solution as the separation layer was fabricated via dry wet spinning method spinning parameters were listed in table 2 fig 1a illustrated the fabrication process for the homogeneous reinforced ppta hollow fiber membrane specifically the homogeneous reinforced ppta hollow fiber membrane was prepared via co extruding ppta casting solution and ppta hollow fiber knitted tube via a home made spinneret the obtained membrane first passed through an air gap and then immersed into a coagulation bath after that they winded the winder with a diameter of 560 mm finally the pristine ppta membrane was stored in deionized water di until further use fig 1b illustrated the fabrication process for the ppta ppy osn membranes liquid phase py monomer solution quickly volatilized into gas phase molecules under vacuum ppy was synthesized by polymerization with gas phase py molecules using fecl3 as oxidation initiator 24 33 first of all the pristine ppta membrane was immersed into 50 fecl3 solution for 30 min then they were placed into a self made cvd reactor containing a reaction tank filled with gas phase py molecules under a dry vacuum environment to form loose ppy layer on the membrane surface the vapor phase polymerization of ppy on the membrane surface was carried out under vacuum for 30 min 60 min and 90 min respectively 24 subsequently the obtained membrane was heat treated at 80 c to further stabilize its structure the heat treatment time was 30 min 60 min and 90 min respectively fig 1c illustrated the reaction mechanism of ppy finally the obtained membrane was washed with deionized water to remove additional fecl3 solution and then dried in air preparation conditions for ppta ppy osn membranes were listed in table 3 2 3 characterization the surface and cross section morphologies of membranes were tested by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem phenom xl holland the membranes were freeze dried for approximately 12 h subsequently they were coated with a layer of gold before measurement the surface roughness of membranes was analyzed using an atomic force microscopy afm bruker dimension icon germany the static contact angle of dried membranes was measured with a goniometer model dsa100 kruss germany a droplet of 5 μl di water was delivered onto a membrane surface using a microsyringe and a static image of the droplet in equilibration with the membrane surface was taken the chemical structure of the membrane surfaces was observed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is50 thermo fisher usa the membranes were dried thoroughly in a vacuum oven at 40 c before measurements the spectra were recorded from 4000 to 400 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 the x ray diffraction xrd measurement of membranes was carried out with an x ray diffractometer rigaku smartlab japan using cu kα radiation the diffraction angles 2θ ranged from 12 to 44 the zeta potential of the membrane surfaces and the liquid samples cr ey mb were characterized by electrokinetic analyzer surpass anton paar austria and zetasizer nano zs90 malvern england respectively the mechanical performance of membranes was tested by electronic tensile tester jbdl 5kn yangzhou jingbo jiangsu china at room temperature 2 4 membrane performance tests the prepared ppta ppy osn membranes filtration process was tested by a cross flow devised the operating pressure and temperature were maintained at 0 6 mpa and 25 c respectively the homogeneous reinforced ppta hollow fiber membrane module was obtained by self preparation specifically we selected a single homogeneous reinforced ppta hollow fiber membrane with a length of 12 cm subsequently it was glued into a polytetrafluoroethylene tube with an outer diameter of 1 cm by a mixture of epoxy resin and hardener the effective length of the homogeneous reinforced ppta hollow fiber membrane was approximately 8 cm the separation performance of the obtained membranes was tested using 100 mg l dyes cr ey and mb in dmac solution moreover to further estimate the long term thermal and solvent resistance of ppta ppy osn membranes using 100 mg l cr in dmac solution as feed solutions to further evaluate the separation performance for continuous 30 h at 80 c meanwhile we conducted static immersion test in organic solution ethanol and dmac at room temperature for one month using 100 mg l cr solution as feed solutions moreover all the membranes were stabilized for at least 30 min with feed solution before testing meanwhile each membrane sample was carried out at least 3 times under the same conditions the concentrations of dyes were determined by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer the solvent flux j and permeance p were determined according to eqs 1 and 2 1 j v a t 2 p

and feed mg l solutions respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of morphological structure as shown in fig 2a the pristine ppta membrane exhibited a relatively thin and dense cortex tightly wrapped in ppta fiber knitted tubes this was due to the instantaneous liquid liquid phase separation when the casting solution was immersed in coagulation bath 34 meanwhile sulfuric acid etched the surface of ppta fiber knitted tubes in favor of interfacial bonding to improve the charge and separation accuracy on the surface of the membrane ppy layer was formed on the surface of the pristine ppta membrane via the robust chemical vapor deposition process fig 2d the membrane surface was relatively rough and uneven fig 2b c the membrane surface gradually formed similar to the turing structures studied by tan et al 35 and evenly distributed throughout the membrane surface with polymerization time increased fig 2e as shown in fig 2f the two structures usually consisted of spherical or strip network which existed alone or crosslinking together this phenomenon was different from the relatively homogeneous ppy layer studied by li et al 27 and ji et al 33 which showed spherical particles on the surface of the membrane fig s1 and fig s2 this may be mainly related to the hydrophilicity on the surface of the porous support membrane turing structures usually appear in reaction diffusion processes far from thermodynamic equilibrium the diffusion coefficient of the inhibitor must be greater than that of the activator leading to the local activation and lateral inhibition phenomenon 35 36 reaction diffusion is a process in which two or more chemicals diffuse over a surface and react with one another to generate stable patterns it can generate various spot and stripe patterns 37 39 in this study fecl3 aqueous solution and py monomer were the activator and the inhibitor respectively when the pristine ppta membrane surface containing the activator came into contact with the inhibitor the reaction initiated since the solubility of py monomer in water was very small the polymerization mainly occurred on the organic side of the interface initially the activator reacted with locally available inhibitors in the reaction zone subsequently it diffused to penetrate deeper into the reaction zone finally a crosslinking ppy layer was formed in the pore opening area of the pristine ppta membrane the systems met appropriate differences in the diffusion coefficients of the activator and inhibitor leading to a diffusion driven instability and generating spherical and strip network structures fig 3a in addition the meniscus of the activator was concave in the hydrophilic pores of the pristine ppta membrane fig 3b hence more ppy was formed deeper in the pores of the hydrophilic supporting membrane which would also extend the total path of the activator transportation 40 furthermore as the activator continuously erupted from the hydrophilic pores into the organic phase vacuum the ppy layer was formed on the pristine ppta membrane surface the ppy layer further delayed the diffusion rate of the activator fig 3b therefore the activator was limited to the nano sized pores on the surface of the pristine ppta membrane where physical obstruction slowed down the transport of the activator moreover polymerization time was an essential factor affecting the performance of ppta ppy osn membranes in the process of the cvd when the polymerization time was relatively short the cvd process cannot provide enough the activator resulting in a low crosslinking degree of the ppy layer therefore it is impossible to form complete spherical or strip network structures fig 2c more activators would be adsorbed in the pore and surface of the pristine ppta membrane with increasing the polymerization time thus a sufficient number of activators would diffuse to the aqueous organic phase interface reaction area resulting in a higher degree of cvd reaction and forming a spherical and strip network structure fig 2f afm measured the surface roughness of the pristine ppta membrane and ppta ppy osn membranes as shown in fig 2 it was clear that the surface of the pristine ppta membrane was relatively rough compared to ppta ppy osn membranes the surface separation layer of the pristine ppta membrane was tightly wrapped in ppta fiber knitted tubes resulting in uneven membrane surface fig 2g after modifying by ppy ppta 1 membrane surface was smoother and its roughness was decreased fig 2h as increasing the polymerization time the surface roughness of ppta 2 increased slightly due to spherical or strip network structures fig 2i this was consistent with the observation results of sem therefore the results further showed that the ppy layer was formed on the pristine ppta membrane 3 2 mechanical property in order to evaluate the mechanical properties of ppta ppy osn membranes we discussed tensile strength elongation at break and blasting pressure of ppta ppy osn membranes fig 4 showed that the tensile strength of pristine ppta membrane was 36 gpa and the biggest elongation at break was approximately 20 16 compared with the pristine ppta membrane the tensile strength of ppta ppy osn membranes increased and the biggest elongation at break decreased this was because more ppy was formed deeper in the pores of ppta membrane resulting in ppta ppy osn membranes becoming stiff and tough and it was possible that ppy would restrict the chain mobility of the ppta matrix to a certain extent by intruding between ppta chains 27 besides to evaluate the pressure resistance of the membrane we measured the blasting pressure of ppta ppy osn membranes as shown in fig 5 after modifying by ppy the pressure resistance of ppta ppy osn membranes was improved specifically blasting pressure increased obviously for ppta 2 compared with pristine ppta membrane heat treatment time had almost no effect on the blasting pressure of the prepared osn membranes this was mainly due to the crosslinking reaction was relatively fast meanwhile ppta 2 could reach high crosslinking degree in a short time it proved that the spherical or strip network structures combined closely with the pristine ppta membrane and was hard to deform 3 3 hydrophilicity it is known that the hydrophilicity of membrane was closely associated with membrane material and surface roughness the water contact angle was utilized to evaluate the hydrophilicity of membrane 41 42 as shown in fig 6 the water contact angle of the pristine ppta membrane was 48 exhibiting good hydrophilicity this was credited with the inherent characteristics of ppta and its more significant surface roughness 20 21 23 when the ppy layer was formed on the surface of the pristine ppta membrane the water contact angle of the fabricated osn membrane increased from 48 to 71 the surface of the ppta 1 membrane was smoother and the roughness decreased which reduced the hydrophilicity as increasing the polymerization time ppta 2 and ppta 3 exhibited a lower water contact angle because of their good hydrophilicity and larger surface area moreover the water contact angle of the fabricated osn membranes remained almost unchanged with increasing the heat treatment time it could be explained that the crosslinking reaction was relatively fast the fabricated osn membranes featured crosslinking structure with larger surface area in a short time therefore it also demonstrated that the crosslinking structure with spherical or strip network were beneficial for hydrophilicity 3 4 characterization of chemical structure ftir investigated chemical functional groups of the pristine ppta membrane and ppta 2 as shown in fig 7 the characteristic peaks of the pristine ppta membrane at 824 cm 1 1543 cm 1 1650 cm 1 and 3325 cm 1 were supposed to the para substituted benzene the co stretching vibrations the nh bending vibrations and the nh2 stretching vibrations of the amide group respectively they were typical adsorption peaks of aromatic polyamide 43 44 compared to the pristine ppta membrane when the ppy layer was deposited on the surface of the pristine ppta membrane ppta ppy osn membranes showed several novel characteristic peaks the typical bands could be assigned for cc stretching vibration of pyrrole ring at 1514 cm 1 and 1548 cm 1 ch in plane bending vibration at 1039 cm 1 cn stretching vibration at 1174 cm 1 and 1454 cm 1 ch out of plane bending vibration at 914 cm 1 and ch wagging vibration at 786 cm 1 this was consistent with the results reported in the literature 45 46 moreover because of the blocking of ppy layer the significant characteristic peaks of the pristine ppta membrane were not observed in the ppta ppy osn membranes to sum up the ppy layer was successfully formed on the surface of the pristine ppta membrane 3 5 characterization of xrd as shown in fig 8 the crystal structures of the pristine ppta membrane and ppta ppy osn membranes were further studied through xrd there were three peaks at 17 6 22 6 and 25 8 as increasing the polymerization time the peak intensity of ppta ppy osn membranes showed a downward trend due to the blocking of ppy layer the structure of ppta ppy osn membranes became more amorphous and thus the crystallinity decreased it was mainly attributed to the amorphous crystal structure and weak diffraction peaks of ppy 45 47 thus it illustrated that the ppy layer deposited on the pristine ppta membrane surface successfully 3 6 surface charge of membrane in general zeta potential is a vital factor for the separation of charged dye solutions for the nf process the nf membrane exhibited different surface charge characteristics at different ph values which affected the rejection efficiency of the membrane 48 fig 9 exhibited the zeta potentials at various ph values for pristine ppta membrane and ppta ppy osn membranes when the ph values ranged from 3 0 to 10 0 all the fabricated osn membranes possessed a negative zeta potential as the ph values increased the zeta potential decreased significantly for ppta ppy osn membranes compared to pristine ppta membrane this was consistent with the polymer membranes reported in the literature 49 50 it was mainly credited with the weak alkaline anion exchange group of the ppy with the increase of ph values the anion exchange group was deprotonated resulting in a significant negative value in the zeta potential of ppta ppy osn membranes 33 51 52 3 7 separation performance of the osn membranes the separation performance of the obtained ppta ppy osn membranes with different preparation parameters was shown in fig 10 the results exhibited that the ethanol permeance of the ppta 1 and ppta 2 was 18 08 and 16 44 l m 2 h 1 mpa 1 respectively meanwhile except for ppta 1 the cr rejection of the other four samples could reach more than 97 exhibiting an excellent separation performance when the polymerization time increased from 30 to 90 min the ethanol permeance of the obtained osn membranes decreased rapidly while the cr rejection increased when the polymerization time was relatively short the system could not provide sufficient activators fecl3 solution this would lead to a low crosslinking degree of the ppy layer the surface of the pristine ppta membrane was unable to form a well integrated spherical or strip network structures ppta 1 had a high permeance and low rejection when the polymerization time increased the system would provide more activator diffusing into the reaction zone and produce spherical and strip network structures ppta 2 had a high rejection and good ethanol permeance when the polymerization time was over 60 min the generated ppy layer would decelerate the further diffusion rate of the activator therefore when the polymerization time further increased the cr rejection of ppta 3 nearly stayed stable while the declination tendency of ethanol permeance slowed down moreover it was possible that ppy densified the pristine ppta membrane surface via intruding between ppta chains 27 the thickness of the ppy layer also increased greatly with increasing the polymerization time resulting in higher trans membrane resistance similarly heat treatment time played also a vital role in the permeation and separation performance of the fabricated osn membranes when the heat treatment time increased from 30 to 90 min the ethanol permeance of the obtained osn membranes decreased rapidly while the cr rejection remained almost constant this was mainly because the crosslinking reaction was relatively fast and ppta 2 could reach high crosslinking degree in a short time the degree of crosslinking of ppta 4 further increased with increasing the heat treatment time in particular after 90 min heat treatment the trans membrane resistance of ppta 5 increased significantly resulting in a significant decline in ethanol permeance it was mainly ascribed to the fact that heat treatment made the structure of the ppy functional layer more complete compared with the pristine ppta membrane the surface of ppta ppy osn membranes was denser and possessed a crosslinking structure with larger surface area therefore we selected ppta 2 to further evaluate permeance and rejection performance in this study in order to further evaluate the solvent permeance and rejection of the membranes we selected ppta 2 for an extended filtration test with three kinds of dyes in dmac solution fig 11 showed the structure of different dyes and the rejection of the obtained membranes on dyes with a molecular weight of less than 1000 da was investigated as shown in fig 12 and fig 13 ppta 2 exhibited the good rejection of cr 99 3 and ey 93 4 while the rejection of mb 84 5 was comparatively low the varied rejections were closely related to the separation mechanism of nf membranes such as the donnan effect and size sieving effect 48 fig 14 exhibited that ppta 2 could reject efficiently dyes due to the donnan effect and size sieving effect as shown in fig 15 the negative zeta potential of cr and ey dye solutions could be due to the negative groups in these two dye molecules based on the donnan effect ppta 2 membrane surface would produce a powerful repulsive force against these two dyes resulting in higher rejection of negative dyes 53 the mb dye showed a slight positive zeta potential which was due to the presence of a positive group in its molecule the membrane surface would provide poor repulsion forces to the mb molecular moreover the molecular weight of mb was small thus ppta ppy osn membranes exhibited the different rejection behavior for these three dyes which was realized by the synergistic effect between donnan effect and size sieving effect the surface charge of the membrane had a limited influence on the rejection of mb dyes besides due to the existence of positive groups in the mb molecules ppta 2 could partially absorb the mb molecules this would lead to an increase in transmembrane transport resistance and a relatively low solvent permeance 33 3 8 long term stability of the osn membranes in general the long term ability of the osn membranes were characterized by long term penetration test and static immersion test in organic solution at room temperature 54 we studied the long term ability of the fabricated ppta ppy osn membranes through continuous thermal and organic treatment experiment the experiment was carried out under 0 6 mpa at 80 c and the separation performance of ppta 2 for cr in dmac solution was investigated as shown in fig 16 ppta 2 could keep high rejection for cr and the rejection of cr was almost stable for a continuous 30 h meanwhile the dmac permeance of ppta 2 decreased during the initial 5 h and then it reached stable the decrease of initial dmac permeance could be credited with the compactness of membrane structure under 0 6 mpa the results demonstrated that ppta ppy osn membranes had the superior solvent resistance to dmac at high temperature moreover ppta 2 was statically soaked in both ethanol and dmac solution for one month respectively the long term immersion experiment was carried out at room temperature then we measured the ethanol permeance and cr rejection of the membrane as shown in fig 17 ppta 2 still possessed stable permeance and rejection after soaking in both ethanol and dmac for a long time the results further proved that ppta 2 had superior solvent resistance 3 9 benchmark table 4 illustrated the permeance and rejection of the osn membranes synthesized in this work and those of the literature works it was worth noting that the solvent permeance of osn membranes needed to be specified to certain solvent system solute type and molecular weight for comparison thus we selected some polar organic solvents such as ethanol ipa dmf it was clear that the ppta 2 we prepared not only showed superior solvent permeance but also showed a satisfying rejection for dyes with a molecular weight cut off range from 200 to1000 da 4 conclusion the ppta ppy osn membranes with turing like structure was successfully prepared using the robust cvd method to treat thermal and organic dye wastewater the chemical composition and morphology of the pristine ppta membrane and ppta ppy osn membranes were studied the results showed that two turing like structure thin layers of nanoscale spherical or strip network were successfully formed on the surface of ppta porous support membrane the obtained ppta ppy osn membranes were employed for dye removal with a molecular weight cut off range from 200 to1000 da and the results showed that the ppta ppy osn membranes had good separation performance for the removal of negative dyes 93 4 especially at high temperature 80 c and dmac the ppta ppy osn membranes still showed excellent permeation and separation performance besides at room temperature the immersion experiment of the obtained ppta ppy osn membranes in both ethanol and dmac also exhibited the stability of long term organic solvent in conclusion a new ppta ppy osn membrane suggested great potential for thermal and organic dye

13227,in this study a stable and controllable poly p phenylene terephthamide polypyrrole ppta ppy composite organic solvent nanofiltration osn hollow fiber membrane was successfully prepared based on the robust chemical vapor deposition cvd method the structure and properties of the prepared ppta ppy osn membranes were studied in detail interestingly after modifying by ppy sem showed that the surface of the membrane formed a layer of turing like structure and evenly covered the surface of the membrane it was evident that the prepared ppta ppy osn membranes achieved good dye removal ability with a molecular weight cut off range from 200 to1000 da and the rejection of negative dyes was higher than 93 4 especially at high temperature 80 c and organic solvent n n dimethylacetamide dmac the ppta ppy osn membranes still exhibited excellent permeation and separation performance furthermore at room temperature the immersion experiment of the fabricated ppta ppy osn membranes in both ethanol and dmac for one month also proved the stability of long term organic solvents based on the above results this work offered a novel ppta based hollow fiber nanofiltration membrane which was expected to be applied in thermal and organic dye wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ppta osn hollow fiber membrane chemical vapor deposition high temperature 1 introduction organic solvent nanofiltration osn is a green and highly efficient process for separating organic substances from organic solvents and its molecular weight cut off range 200 to 1000 da 1 compared with traditional purification and separation technologies such as extraction distillation crystallization and chromatography it has the advantages of safety economy mild operating conditions and environmental friendliness 2 3 and it has great application prospects in food textile fine chemical petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries 4 6 however osn membranes still face many challenges in the aforementioned applications the key challenge in osn is the stability of membranes in organic solvents 7 the ceramic membranes have excellent thermal chemical and organic solvent resistance they do not swell or deform in organic solvents 8 among them the ceramic membranes of silica titanium dioxide and alumina have been successfully commercialized and they were used in separation and purification applications however the ceramic membrane market s growth and its application are currently limited by low processability low throughput complex manufacturing and high production costs compared with polymeric membranes 9 10 therefore most osn membranes reported in literatures or used commercially are made out of polymeric materials 11 at present most polymeric materials such as polyimide pi p84 9 polybenzimidazole pbi 12 polyacrylonitrile pan 13 poly ether ether ketone peek 14 and poly arylene sulfide sulfone pass 15 have been used to fabricate osn membranes by phase inversion method nevertheless these membranes have low permeability and selectivity as well as cannot withstand harsh environments such as n n dimethylformamide dmf or n methyl pyrrolidone nmp for these membranes to remain stable in applications using these solvents they generally need to be chemically crosslinking to improve their organic resistance 16 the crosslinking process will consume a mass of solvents and crosslinking chemicals resulting in high production costs and environmental pollution 17 other methods for preparing osn membranes include interfacial polymerization layer by layer assembly and increasing the concentration of polymer coating solution however these relatively complex processes also increase the cost of membrane preparation due to the use of various reactive chemicals and a mass of solvents 17 therefore developing new high performance membrane materials are required to combine the above advantages with a simplified preparation process which will focus on the preparation of osn membranes poly p phenylene terephthamide ppta kelvar is a typical liquid crystal polymer with superior hydrophilic solvent resistance mechanical and heat stability it has been widely used to prepare high performance fibers 18 19 however ppta has high crystallinity insoluble in most conventional solvents harsh preparation conditions and few related studies in the membrane industry 20 21 k nakura et al 22 and p zschocke and strathmann 23 fabricated a thermal and solvent resistant ppta ultrafiltration membrane the former explored the forming conditions and permeability of the ppta membrane while the latter studied the solvent resistance of the ppta membrane wang et al 21 developed ppta hollow fiber membrane through dry wet spinning technology the obtained membrane showed good thermal stability solvent resistance and anti fouling properties but its mechanical properties were poor moreover ppta hollow fiber membrane had low separation accuracy which was in the range of ultrafiltration the separation performance of dyes and small molecule sewage still needed to be further improved therefore to improve the separation accuracy of the membrane it is necessary to optimize the surface separation layer of the ppta porous membrane chemical vapor deposition cvd is a method of physical modification of membrane surface it can give the substrate membranes ideal properties by using a gas phase reaction without changing the composition of the substrate membranes 24 compared with some traditional membrane surface modification methods the thin layer formed through cvd method is dense and uniform and firmly bonded with the substrate membranes the deposition speed is fast and the composition is prone to control 25 26 polypyrrole ppy is characterized by hydrophilicity heat stability and insoluble in organic solvent 27 it is considered to be an ideal surface modification material 28 30 ppy has been reported as a selective layer for gas separation and pervaporation however there are few studies in the application of osn membranes li et al 27 developed novel ppy composite osn membranes with fecl3 as an oxidative initiator and studied the effects of different types support and pyrrole monomer concentration on the performance of the osn membranes compared with commercial osn membranes the obtained osn membranes showed a greater isopropyl alcohol ipa permeability 7 9 l m 2 h 1 mpa 1 and high rejection 96 for negatively charged dyes shao et al 31 developed a composite nanofiltration membrane through in situ polymerization of ppy on hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile panh support membrane with ammonium persulfate as an oxidant the obtained membrane exhibited constant permeability to ipa 12 1 l m 2 h 1 mpa 1 and the rejection of bengali rose was approximately 99 2 liu et al 32 developed polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf ppy composite nanofiltration membrane through cvd method the obtained membrane showed good anti fouling properties ji et al 33 fabricated pvdf graphene oxide go ppy hollow fiber membrane through cvd method the hydrophilicity of the obtained pvdf go ppy membrane was increased compared to the pristine pvdf membrane meanwhile the obtained membrane showed excellent dye rejection 98 5 for congo red acid orange 10 and direct yellow 24 in this research combined with mechanical enhancement excellent hydrophilic organic solvent resistance and thermostability ppta ppy osn membranes were prepared using the robust cvd method based on the principle of the polymer surface interfacial bonding a novel homogeneous braid reinforced br ppta hollow fiber membrane with ppta hollow fiber knitted tube as the reinforced matrix and ppta casting solution as the separation layer were prepared by dry wet spinning method then the ppy film was polymerized on the membrane surface through the robust cvd method to improve the charge and separation accuracy on the surface of the membrane further in addition nanofiltration performance was also evaluated with congo red under thermal and organic solvent conditions meanwhile the obtained membrane was statically soaked in organic solvent solution ethanol and dmac for one month and the results indicated that the novel ppta ppy osn membranes had great potential in thermal and organic dye solution treatment 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials poly p phenylene terephthamide resin ppta

of ppta membrane and ppta ppy osn membranes firstly ppta resin and sio2 particles were dried in a vacuum oven 0 1 mpa at 100 c for 12 h to remove moisture before use then at the temperature of 80 c a certain weight of ppta resin was uniformly mixed with h2so4 pore forming agents peg and sio2 particles under the high speed agitation when the dope solution was fully dissolved the fully dissolved dope solution was degassed for 1 h in a vacuum oven 0 1 mpa at 65 c a novel homogeneous reinforced ppta hollow fiber membrane with ppta hollow fiber knitted tube as the reinforced matrix and ppta casting solution as the separation layer was fabricated via dry wet spinning method spinning parameters were listed in table 2 fig 1a illustrated the fabrication process for the homogeneous reinforced ppta hollow fiber membrane specifically the homogeneous reinforced ppta hollow fiber membrane was prepared via co extruding ppta casting solution and ppta hollow fiber knitted tube via a home made spinneret the obtained membrane first passed through an air gap and then immersed into a coagulation bath after that they winded the winder with a diameter of 560 mm finally the pristine ppta membrane was stored in deionized water di until further use fig 1b illustrated the fabrication process for the ppta ppy osn membranes liquid phase py monomer solution quickly volatilized into gas phase molecules under vacuum ppy was synthesized by polymerization with gas phase py molecules using fecl3 as oxidation initiator 24 33 first of all the pristine ppta membrane was immersed into 50 fecl3 solution for 30 min then they were placed into a self made cvd reactor containing a reaction tank filled with gas phase py molecules under a dry vacuum environment to form loose ppy layer on the membrane surface the vapor phase polymerization of ppy on the membrane surface was carried out under vacuum for 30 min 60 min and 90 min respectively 24 subsequently the obtained membrane was heat treated at 80 c to further stabilize its structure the heat treatment time was 30 min 60 min and 90 min respectively fig 1c illustrated the reaction mechanism of ppy finally the obtained membrane was washed with deionized water to remove additional fecl3 solution and then dried in air preparation conditions for ppta ppy osn membranes were listed in table 3 2 3 characterization the surface and cross section morphologies of membranes were tested by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem phenom xl holland the membranes were freeze dried for approximately 12 h subsequently they were coated with a layer of gold before measurement the surface roughness of membranes was analyzed using an atomic force microscopy afm bruker dimension icon germany the static contact angle of dried membranes was measured with a goniometer model dsa100 kruss germany a droplet of 5 μl di water was delivered onto a membrane surface using a microsyringe and a static image of the droplet in equilibration with the membrane surface was taken the chemical structure of the membrane surfaces was observed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is50 thermo fisher usa the membranes were dried thoroughly in a vacuum oven at 40 c before measurements the spectra were recorded from 4000 to 400 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 the x ray diffraction xrd measurement of membranes was carried out with an x ray diffractometer rigaku smartlab japan using cu kα radiation the diffraction angles 2θ ranged from 12 to 44 the zeta potential of the membrane surfaces and the liquid samples cr ey mb were characterized by electrokinetic analyzer surpass anton paar austria and zetasizer nano zs90 malvern england respectively the mechanical performance of membranes was tested by electronic tensile tester jbdl 5kn yangzhou jingbo jiangsu china at room temperature 2 4 membrane performance tests the prepared ppta ppy osn membranes filtration process was tested by a cross flow devised the operating pressure and temperature were maintained at 0 6 mpa and 25 c respectively the homogeneous reinforced ppta hollow fiber membrane module was obtained by self preparation specifically we selected a single homogeneous reinforced ppta hollow fiber membrane with a length of 12 cm subsequently it was glued into a polytetrafluoroethylene tube with an outer diameter of 1 cm by a mixture of epoxy resin and hardener the effective length of the homogeneous reinforced ppta hollow fiber membrane was approximately 8 cm the separation performance of the obtained membranes was tested using 100 mg l dyes cr ey and mb in dmac solution moreover to further estimate the long term thermal and solvent resistance of ppta ppy osn membranes using 100 mg l cr in dmac solution as feed solutions to further evaluate the separation performance for continuous 30 h at 80 c meanwhile we conducted static immersion test in organic solution ethanol and dmac at room temperature for one month using 100 mg l cr solution as feed solutions moreover all the membranes were stabilized for at least 30 min with feed solution before testing meanwhile each membrane sample was carried out at least 3 times under the same conditions the concentrations of dyes were determined by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer the solvent flux j and permeance p were determined according to eqs 1 and 2 1 j v a t 2 p

is trans membrane pressure mpa the solute rejections of the obtained membranes were calculated from eq 3 3 r 1 c p c f where r is the rejection c p and cf are the concentrations of the permeate mg l and feed mg l solutions respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of morphological structure as shown in fig 2a the pristine ppta membrane exhibited a relatively thin and dense cortex tightly wrapped in ppta fiber knitted tubes this was due to the instantaneous liquid liquid phase separation when the casting solution was immersed in coagulation bath 34 meanwhile sulfuric acid etched the surface of ppta fiber knitted tubes in favor of interfacial bonding to improve the charge and separation accuracy on the surface of the membrane ppy layer was formed on the surface of the pristine ppta membrane via the robust chemical vapor deposition process fig 2d the membrane surface was relatively rough and uneven fig 2b c the membrane surface gradually formed similar to the turing structures studied by tan et al 35 and evenly distributed throughout the membrane surface with polymerization time increased fig 2e as shown in fig 2f the two structures usually consisted of spherical or strip network which existed alone or crosslinking together this phenomenon was different from the relatively homogeneous ppy layer studied by li et al 27 and ji et al 33 which showed spherical particles on the surface of the membrane fig s1 and fig s2 this may be mainly related to the hydrophilicity on the surface of the porous support membrane turing structures usually appear in reaction diffusion processes far from thermodynamic equilibrium the diffusion coefficient of the inhibitor must be greater than that of the activator leading to the local activation and lateral inhibition phenomenon 35 36 reaction diffusion is a process in which two or more chemicals diffuse over a surface and react with one another to generate stable patterns it can generate various spot and stripe patterns 37 39 in this study fecl3 aqueous solution and py monomer were the activator and the inhibitor respectively when the pristine ppta membrane surface containing the activator came into contact with the inhibitor the reaction initiated since the solubility of py monomer in water was very small the polymerization mainly occurred on the organic side of the interface initially the activator reacted with locally available inhibitors in the reaction zone subsequently it diffused to penetrate deeper into the reaction zone finally a crosslinking ppy layer was formed in the pore opening area of the pristine ppta membrane the systems met appropriate differences in the diffusion coefficients of the activator and inhibitor leading to a diffusion driven instability and generating spherical and strip network structures fig 3a in addition the meniscus of the activator was concave in the hydrophilic pores of the pristine ppta membrane fig 3b hence more ppy was formed deeper in the pores of the hydrophilic supporting membrane which would also extend the total path of the activator transportation 40 furthermore as the activator continuously erupted from the hydrophilic pores into the organic phase vacuum the ppy layer was formed on the pristine ppta membrane surface the ppy layer further delayed the diffusion rate of the activator fig 3b therefore the activator was limited to the nano sized pores on the surface of the pristine ppta membrane where physical obstruction slowed down the transport of the activator moreover polymerization time was an essential factor affecting the performance of ppta ppy osn membranes in the process of the cvd when the polymerization time was relatively short the cvd process cannot provide enough the activator resulting in a low crosslinking degree of the ppy layer therefore it is impossible to form complete spherical or strip network structures fig 2c more activators would be adsorbed in the pore and surface of the pristine ppta membrane with increasing the polymerization time thus a sufficient number of activators would diffuse to the aqueous organic phase interface reaction area resulting in a higher degree of cvd reaction and forming a spherical and strip network structure fig 2f afm measured the surface roughness of the pristine ppta membrane and ppta ppy osn membranes as shown in fig 2 it was clear that the surface of the pristine ppta membrane was relatively rough compared to ppta ppy osn membranes the surface separation layer of the pristine ppta membrane was tightly wrapped in ppta fiber knitted tubes resulting in uneven membrane surface fig 2g after modifying by ppy ppta 1 membrane surface was smoother and its roughness was decreased fig 2h as increasing the polymerization time the surface roughness of ppta 2 increased slightly due to spherical or strip network structures fig 2i this was consistent with the observation results of sem therefore the results further showed that the ppy layer was formed on the pristine ppta membrane 3 2 mechanical property in order to evaluate the mechanical properties of ppta ppy osn membranes we discussed tensile strength elongation at break and blasting pressure of ppta ppy osn membranes fig 4 showed that the tensile strength of pristine ppta membrane was 36 gpa and the biggest elongation at break was approximately 20 16 compared with the pristine ppta membrane the tensile strength of ppta ppy osn membranes increased and the biggest elongation at break decreased this was because more ppy was formed deeper in the pores of ppta membrane resulting in ppta ppy osn membranes becoming stiff and tough and it was possible that ppy would restrict the chain mobility of the ppta matrix to a certain extent by intruding between ppta chains 27 besides to evaluate the pressure resistance of the membrane we measured the blasting pressure of ppta ppy osn membranes as shown in fig 5 after modifying by ppy the pressure resistance of ppta ppy osn membranes was improved specifically blasting pressure increased obviously for ppta 2 compared with pristine ppta membrane heat treatment time had almost no effect on the blasting pressure of the prepared osn membranes this was mainly due to the crosslinking reaction was relatively fast meanwhile ppta 2 could reach high crosslinking degree in a short time it proved that the spherical or strip network structures combined closely with the pristine ppta membrane and was hard to deform 3 3 hydrophilicity it is known that the hydrophilicity of membrane was closely associated with membrane material and surface roughness the water contact angle was utilized to evaluate the hydrophilicity of membrane 41 42 as shown in fig 6 the water contact angle of the pristine ppta membrane was 48 exhibiting good hydrophilicity this was credited with the inherent characteristics of ppta and its more significant surface roughness 20 21 23 when the ppy layer was formed on the surface of the pristine ppta membrane the water contact angle of the fabricated osn membrane increased from 48 to 71 the surface of the ppta 1 membrane was smoother and the roughness decreased which reduced the hydrophilicity as increasing the polymerization time ppta 2 and ppta 3 exhibited a lower water contact angle because of their good hydrophilicity and larger surface area moreover the water contact angle of the fabricated osn membranes remained almost unchanged with increasing the heat treatment time it could be explained that the crosslinking reaction was relatively fast the fabricated osn membranes featured crosslinking structure with larger surface area in a short time therefore it also demonstrated that the crosslinking structure with spherical or strip network were beneficial for hydrophilicity 3 4 characterization of chemical structure ftir investigated chemical functional groups of the pristine ppta membrane and ppta 2 as shown in fig 7 the characteristic peaks of the pristine ppta membrane at 824 cm 1 1543 cm 1 1650 cm 1 and 3325 cm 1 were supposed to the para substituted benzene the co stretching vibrations the nh bending vibrations and the nh2 stretching vibrations of the amide group respectively they were typical adsorption peaks of aromatic polyamide 43 44 compared to the pristine ppta membrane when the ppy layer was deposited on the surface of the pristine ppta membrane ppta ppy osn membranes showed several novel characteristic peaks the typical bands could be assigned for cc stretching vibration of pyrrole ring at 1514 cm 1 and 1548 cm 1 ch in plane bending vibration at 1039 cm 1 cn stretching vibration at 1174 cm 1 and 1454 cm 1 ch out of plane bending vibration at 914 cm 1 and ch wagging vibration at 786 cm 1 this was consistent with the results reported in the literature 45 46 moreover because of the blocking of ppy layer the significant characteristic peaks of the pristine ppta membrane were not observed in the ppta ppy osn membranes to sum up the ppy layer was successfully formed on the surface of the pristine ppta membrane 3 5 characterization of xrd as shown in fig 8 the crystal structures of the pristine ppta membrane and ppta ppy osn membranes were further studied through xrd there were three peaks at 17 6 22 6 and 25 8 as increasing the polymerization time the peak intensity of ppta ppy osn membranes showed a downward trend due to the blocking of ppy layer the structure of ppta ppy osn membranes became more amorphous and thus the crystallinity decreased it was mainly attributed to the amorphous crystal structure and weak diffraction peaks of ppy 45 47 thus it illustrated that the ppy layer deposited on the pristine ppta membrane surface successfully 3 6 surface charge of membrane in general zeta potential is a vital factor for the separation of charged dye solutions for the nf process the nf membrane exhibited different surface charge characteristics at different ph values which affected the rejection efficiency of the membrane 48 fig 9 exhibited the zeta potentials at various ph values for pristine ppta membrane and ppta ppy osn membranes when the ph values ranged from 3 0 to 10 0 all the fabricated osn membranes possessed a negative zeta potential as the ph values increased the zeta potential decreased significantly for ppta ppy osn membranes compared to pristine ppta membrane this was consistent with the polymer membranes reported in the literature 49 50 it was mainly credited with the weak alkaline anion exchange group of the ppy with the increase of ph values the anion exchange group was deprotonated resulting in a significant negative value in the zeta potential of ppta ppy osn membranes 33 51 52 3 7 separation performance of the osn membranes the separation performance of the obtained ppta ppy osn membranes with different preparation parameters was shown in fig 10 the results exhibited that the ethanol permeance of the ppta 1 and ppta 2 was 18 08 and 16 44 l m 2 h 1 mpa 1 respectively meanwhile except for ppta 1 the cr rejection of the other four samples could reach more than 97 exhibiting an excellent separation performance when the polymerization time increased from 30 to 90 min the ethanol permeance of the obtained osn membranes decreased rapidly while the cr rejection increased when the polymerization time was relatively short the system could not provide sufficient activators fecl3 solution this would lead to a low crosslinking degree of the ppy layer the surface of the pristine ppta membrane was unable to form a well integrated spherical or strip network structures ppta 1 had a high permeance and low rejection when the polymerization time increased the system would provide more activator diffusing into the reaction zone and produce spherical and strip network structures ppta 2 had a high rejection and good ethanol permeance when the polymerization time was over 60 min the generated ppy layer would decelerate the further diffusion rate of the activator therefore when the polymerization time further increased the cr rejection of ppta 3 nearly stayed stable while the declination tendency of ethanol permeance slowed down moreover it was possible that ppy densified the pristine ppta membrane surface via intruding between ppta chains 27 the thickness of the ppy layer also increased greatly with increasing the polymerization time resulting in higher trans membrane resistance similarly heat treatment time played also a vital role in the permeation and separation performance of the fabricated osn membranes when the heat treatment time increased from 30 to 90 min the ethanol permeance of the obtained osn membranes decreased rapidly while the cr rejection remained almost constant this was mainly because the crosslinking reaction was relatively fast and ppta 2 could reach high crosslinking degree in a short time the degree of crosslinking of ppta 4 further increased with increasing the heat treatment time in particular after 90 min heat treatment the trans membrane resistance of ppta 5 increased significantly resulting in a significant decline in ethanol permeance it was mainly ascribed to the fact that heat treatment made the structure of the ppy functional layer more complete compared with the pristine ppta membrane the surface of ppta ppy osn membranes was denser and possessed a crosslinking structure with larger surface area therefore we selected ppta 2 to further evaluate permeance and rejection performance in this study in order to further evaluate the solvent permeance and rejection of the membranes we selected ppta 2 for an extended filtration test with three kinds of dyes in dmac solution fig 11 showed the structure of different dyes and the rejection of the obtained membranes on dyes with a molecular weight of less than 1000 da was investigated as shown in fig 12 and fig 13 ppta 2 exhibited the good rejection of cr 99 3 and ey 93 4 while the rejection of mb 84 5 was comparatively low the varied rejections were closely related to the separation mechanism of nf membranes such as the donnan effect and size sieving effect 48 fig 14 exhibited that ppta 2 could reject efficiently dyes due to the donnan effect and size sieving effect as shown in fig 15 the negative zeta potential of cr and ey dye solutions could be due to the negative groups in these two dye molecules based on the donnan effect ppta 2 membrane surface would produce a powerful repulsive force against these two dyes resulting in higher rejection of negative dyes 53 the mb dye showed a slight positive zeta potential which was due to the presence of a positive group in its molecule the membrane surface would provide poor repulsion forces to the mb molecular moreover the molecular weight of mb was small thus ppta ppy osn membranes exhibited the different rejection behavior for these three dyes which was realized by the synergistic effect between donnan effect and size sieving effect the surface charge of the membrane had a limited influence on the rejection of mb dyes besides due to the existence of positive groups in the mb molecules ppta 2 could partially absorb the mb molecules this would lead to an increase in transmembrane transport resistance and a relatively low solvent permeance 33 3 8 long term stability of the osn membranes in general the long term ability of the osn membranes were characterized by long term penetration test and static immersion test in organic solution at room temperature 54 we studied the long term ability of the fabricated ppta ppy osn membranes through continuous thermal and organic treatment experiment the experiment was carried out under 0 6 mpa at 80 c and the separation performance of ppta 2 for cr in dmac solution was investigated as shown in fig 16 ppta 2 could keep high rejection for cr and the rejection of cr was almost stable for a continuous 30 h meanwhile the dmac permeance of ppta 2 decreased during the initial 5 h and then it reached stable the decrease of initial dmac permeance could be credited with the compactness of membrane structure under 0 6 mpa the results demonstrated that ppta ppy osn membranes had the superior solvent resistance to dmac at high temperature moreover ppta 2 was statically soaked in both ethanol and dmac solution for one month respectively the long term immersion experiment was carried out at room temperature then we measured the ethanol permeance and cr rejection of the membrane as shown in fig 17 ppta 2 still possessed stable permeance and rejection after soaking in both ethanol and dmac for a long time the results further proved that ppta 2 had superior solvent resistance 3 9 benchmark table 4 illustrated the permeance and rejection of the osn membranes synthesized in this work and those of the literature works it was worth noting that the solvent permeance of osn membranes needed to be specified to certain solvent system solute type and molecular weight for comparison thus we selected some polar organic solvents such as ethanol ipa dmf it was clear that the ppta 2 we prepared not only showed superior solvent permeance but also showed a satisfying rejection for dyes with a molecular weight cut off range from 200 to1000 da 4 conclusion the ppta ppy osn membranes with turing like structure was successfully prepared using the robust cvd method to treat thermal and organic dye wastewater the chemical composition and morphology of the pristine ppta membrane and ppta ppy osn membranes were studied the results showed that two turing like structure thin layers of nanoscale spherical or strip network were successfully formed on the surface of ppta porous support membrane the obtained ppta ppy osn membranes were employed for dye removal with a molecular weight cut off range from 200 to1000 da and the results showed that the ppta ppy osn membranes had good separation performance for the removal of negative dyes 93 4 especially at high temperature 80 c and dmac the ppta ppy osn membranes still showed excellent permeation and separation performance besides at room temperature the immersion experiment of the obtained ppta ppy osn membranes in both ethanol and dmac also exhibited the stability of long term organic solvent in conclusion a new ppta ppy osn membrane suggested great potential for thermal and organic dye

13228,membrane technology plays an important role in wastewater separation and purification however the problem of poor hydrophobicity of the membrane is a serious obstacle to its application with anti cancer prevention and control of cardiovascular diseases and other effects tea polyphenols tp the main component of tea stains have been widely studied in medical treatment food and biology here inspired by an interesting phenomenon that some tea stains are difficult to clean in the cup after brewing tea a facile tea polyphenols coating method was explored at the ambient condition to mitigate membrane fouling the modification method is not only environmental protection low cost but also safe and healthy the contact angle of the tp modified film is reduced to 39 and the pure water flux is up to 13 159 l m 2 h 1 indicating that the hydrophilicity is significantly improved in addition tp film also has excellent antifouling performance emulsion retention rate is 98 9 water flux recovery is about 99 7 meanwhile the tp modified membrane was stable in the acidic condition in the long term rinsing experiment in addition titanium ions were introduced to improve the stability of tp modified membranes under pure water or alkaline conditions since the tp coating imparts a binding side to bind metal ions in the pure water and alkaline condition the modified membrane showed outstanding stability after titanium ions have been complexed graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tea polyphenols titanium surface modification hydrophilicity 1 introduction nowadays water treatment has aroused broad attention because of the fresh water shortage and environmental pollution 1 therein many useful methods have been developed to deal with waste oily water 2 4 polymeric membrane as one of the common materials possessing many excellent properties has played a more and more important role in treating wastewater 5 7 however the application of membrane is limited due to their typically hydrophobic which will lead to severe contamination of organic matter and lead to a sharp decline in life 8 therefore many efforts including blending 9 10 grafting 11 13 co polymerization 14 and layer by layer assembly 15 16 can be used to improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane to make the process of purifying water more effective but these methods have some certain disadvantages such as needing special instruments or complicated conditions 6 17 nevertheless in recent decades because of its simplicity and environmental protection surface coating deposition has attracted more and more experts and scholars 18 19 so it is urgent for us to find some special coatings which possess robust material adhesion and easily transform the hydrophobic membrane into the hydrophilic one luckily nature gives us a wonderful reference to solve this problem in nature scientists have discovered that mussel foot proteins secreted by the marine mussel can help it achieve strong biological adhesion to various underwater surfaces they analyzed the structure of these secreting mussel foot proteins and synthesized similar adhesive materials 20 lee et al 21 found that dopamine could happen oxidative polymerization at alkaline ph and a coating can be formed on the surface of the material by dip coating however high cost and poor hydrophilicity are the disadvantages of dopamine 22 24 recently polyphenol compounds that contain abundant catechol pyrogallol moieties showed potential to replace dopamine 25 29 inspired by an interesting phenomenon that some tea stains are difficult to clean in the cup after brewing tea we speculate that these tea stains may be used as a coating to improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane with anti cancer prevention and control of cardiovascular diseases and other effects tea polyphenols the main component of tea stains have been widely studied in medical treatment food and biology 30 36 it is more healthy and safe to apply it to water treatment epigallocatechin gallate egcg epicatechin gallate ecg epigallocatechin egc and epicatechin ec are the major polyphenols present in green tea 37 the polymerization conditions of tea polyphenols are similar to those of dopamine which can be oxidized and polymerized at alkaline ph to form theaflavins and other substances 38 43 this provides a theoretical basis for our modification besides oxidized tea polyphenols are rich in catechol and pyrogallol structure so they can possess outstanding surface binding affinity and excellent hydrophilicity 24 44 45 compared with dopamine it is better to use tea polyphenols for surface modification because it is widely found in nature has a simple preparation process and a healthy composition which indicates potential applications in membrane modification however we found that the stability of tea polyphenols coating in the pure water and alkaline condition was unsatisfactory especially in alkaline conditions the value of pure water flux decreases obviously under alkaline condition within 20 min the coating may continue to undergo oxidation reaction in the pure water or alkaline condition 46 48 where it was not stable enough therefore titanium is introduced to react with tea polyphenols to form a cross linked structure 49 50 which can solve the problem of coating stability herein we propose a green and simple method for converting hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes into hydrophilic membranes by a simple dip coating process through tea polyphenols the tea polyphenols were abundant existence in green tea solution and the pvdf membrane is just needed to put in the green tea solution to complete the modification the chemical mechanism is shown in fig 1 the surface morphology chemical composition and wettability of the membranes were studied at different deposition times after modification with tea polyphenols an excellent hydrophilic and anti pollution membrane was obtained moreover long term rinsing experiments were conducted in order to analyze the stability of the tp membrane and the performance was unsatisfactory in the pure water and alkaline condition so titanium is used to react with tea polyphenols to improve the stability of coating which endows the modified membrane to be used in the ph range of 3 11 this simple and green strategy that the membrane was modified by tea polyphenols coating has broad application prospects in the surface modification due to its convenience safety and low cost 2 experiments 2 1 materials polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf microfiltration membranes with the average pore diameter of 0 22 μm and diameter of 5 cm were obtained from shanghai feiyue biotechnology co ltd green tea was obtained from a local market titanium ethoxide 33 35 was obtained from aladdin tween 80 toluene isopropyl alcohol ethanol tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris acetic acid and hydrochloric acid hcl were brought from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china deionized water was obtained from a rx 108 xinrui laboratory ultrapure water machine all chemicals were used without further purification 2 2 the tea polyphenols coating on the pvdf membrane the detailed protocol process is presented in fig 2 first a certain amount of green tea 4 g mixed with deionized water 120 milliliter ph 3 adjusted by hcl was shocked 130 r min in the oscillator at 60 c for 50 min then the clarified green tea solution was obtained by filtration through a büchner funnel next tris was added until the ph of the green tea solution increased from 3 to 7 8 tea polyphenols have excellent acid resistance and are stable under acidic conditions after adjusting the ph to alkaline tea polyphenols become unstable and can undergo oxidation reactions to precipitate gradually from the solution and deposit on the membrane by their own gravity and adhere firmly to the membrane surface more information is available in fig s7 after soaking the membrane in isopropanol for 30 min the membrane surface was washed repeatedly with deionized water to obtain the pretreated membrane then the membranes were soaked with green tea solution for 6 h 12 h 24 h and the final modified membranes obtained were named as tp 6 tp 12 tp 24 the control group was obtained by soaking the pretreated membranes with deionized water for 12 h 2 3 the titanium decorated tea polyphenols coating membrane the ethanol acetic acid and pure water v v v 10 3 1 were mixed in a beaker then slowly drop 0 5 ml of tetraethyl titanate into the beaker and stir vigorously after half an hour the tp 12 membrane was put into the beaker for 5 min to obtain the titanium modified membrane and the membrane can be named tp 12 tiiv 2 4 characterization the microscopic morphology of the membranes was distinguished using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem zeiss ultra plus germany accelerating voltage 5 0 kv x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab250xi uk and attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir nicolet 6700 usa were used to characterize the elemental composition and group changes of the different membranes the atomic force microscope afm nanoscope iv veeco usa was used to detect the membrane surface roughness the porosity of the membrane material is calculated using imagej 2 5 membrane property and filtration performance the contact angle test system jc2000c centron china is used to test the contact angle of the membrane at room temperature for at least three positions per membrane the water contact angle wca characterizes the hydrophilicity of the membranes and the underwater oil contact angle oca characterizes the oleophobicity of the membrane each sample was measured three times through a vacuum filtration system jinteng china at 0 1mpa pressure and room temperature to obtain its pure water flux and emulsion flux which are important indicators to evaluate its filtration performance toluene water v v 1 99 was vigorously mixed with tween 80 2 mg 99 ml and stirred for 3 h to prepare oil in water emulsion and the pure water flux and oil water emulsion flux was calculated by the following equation 1 j v a t where v a and t are the permeate volume l the effective membrane area m2 and the filtration time h respectively water flux recovery rate frr indicates the water flux recovery of the membrane after treating emulsions total fouling ratio rt indicates the degree of flux reduction caused by contamination of the membrane when treating emulsions reversible fouling ratio rr indicates the contamination of the membrane surface due to the concentration polarization of toluene oil droplets when treating emulsions and rir indicates the permanent contamination of the membrane surface or membrane pores caused by the adsorption and aggregation of contaminants such as toluene oil droplets they are important indicators to characterize the membrane s ability to resist contamination the test procedure is to let the membrane filter 200 ml of pure water and calculate its flux jw1 then let the membrane treat 50 ml of toluene emulsion and calculate its flux je then wash the membrane repeatedly with pure water and finally let the membrane filter 200 ml of pure water and calculate its flux jw2 the equations for frr rt rr and rir are as follows 2 f rr j ω 2 j ω 1 100 3 r t 1 j e j ω 1 100 4 r r j ω 2 j e j ω 1 100 5 r ir 1 j ω 2 j ω 1 100 2 6 owens wendt rabel kaelble owrk method according to the method proposed by owens wendt rable and kaelble the interfacial tension of each phase can be divided into two parts the polar component γp and the non polar component dispersion component γd the relationship between the interface free energy γsl of solid and liquid phases and the polar components nonpolar components of the solid liquid surface free energy can be expressed by the owrk method as follows 6 γ sl γ l γ s 2 γ l d γ s d 2 γ l p γ s p in the above equation γd and γp are the non polar components and polar components of the surface free energy subscripts l and s signify liquid and solid respectively the young equation reveals the relationship between the interfacial free energy of solid gas solid liquid liquid gas and the contact angle and the relationship can be expressed by the following equation 7 cos θ γ s γ sl γ l in the above equation θ is the average contact angle between liquid and membrane surface γl γs and γsl represents the interfacial free energy of liquid gas solid gas solid liquid respectively to solve the above equation and obtain the two unknown components γs d and γs p distilled water and ethylene glycol with known polar and disperse components table 1 were used 2 7 long term stability rinsing experiment fill beakers with 0 001 mol l hydrochloric acid pure water highly concentrated salt solution and 0 001 mol l sodium hydroxide respectively the modified membrane was fixed on the inner wall of the beaker and the solution was stirred to test the long term stability of the membranes under strong acid strong base or high concentration salt conditions in addition the modified membrane was also placed in an ultrasonic cleaner for 10 min to test its stability under ultrasonic conditions to reflect the stability of the modified membrane after the rinsing experiment the pure water flux and underwater oil contact angle were tested every 24 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization the surface geometry difference of pristine and modified membranes was analyzed by using fesem fig 3 the pristine membrane surface fig 3a possessed many homogeneous pores and sharp edges however as the modification time extended the surface porosity of modified membranes fig 3b c d fig s8 decreased this is because as more and more tea polyphenols are deposited on the membrane surface its modified coating is gradually becoming thicker and slowly covering part of the membrane pores moreover the surface roughness of the tp modified membranes is obviously improved and has a hierarchical structure this is because tea polyphenols can be oxidized to form quinones and the phenol quinone can react with another tea polyphenol therefore many hydrogen bond interaction sites in the polymeric tea polyphenols chain interact to form a hybrid network which can enhance the hydrophilicity and water absorption of the modified tp membrane this mechanism can also be demonstrated in uv vis spectra in fig s1 the maximum absorbance at 273 nm was catechol groups and the broad absorbance at 325 nm was quinine groups 24 in the original tea polyphenols solution there only existed catechol groups in 273 nm but there formed many phenol quinones in the alkaline condition in tp 0 just adjust the ph of the solution to 7 8 and the phenol quinone decreased in the tp 12 because the phenol quinone reacted with other tea polyphenols in addition three dimension afm images of various membranes were also given in fig 4 the average roughness of the original membrane is only 13 4 nm obviously the average roughness of the modified membrane is higher and changed with the deposition time increasing from 16 8 nm to 34 3 nm due to the coating layer addition the hydrophilicity of the tp membrane is increased since the rough surface of the film will make it easier to form a hydration layer 51 atr ftir and xps spectra revealed the chemical composition differences on the membrane surface in atr ftir it can be seen from fig s2 that the tea polyphenols have a co stretching vibration peak at 1691 cm 1 1611 cm 1 1518 cm 1 are the characteristic peaks of the benzene ring in tea polyphenols and the modified membrane shown in fig s2 shows several new weak absorption peaks at 1688 cm 1 1510 cm 1 and 1610 cm 1 these peaks indicate that the tea polyphenol coating was successfully immobilized on the membrane 52 these peaks implied that the tea polyphenols coating was fixed on the membrane successfully the atr ftir spectra of tp 12 ti were shown in fig s3 in the original membrane the stretching vibration peak of co was 1688 cm 1 and the substituted benzene ring vibration peak was 1610 cm 1 after the modification of tea polyphenols and titanium ions pyrogallol tiiv chelate rings are formed which makes the two stretching vibration peaks move to the direction of low wavenumber meanwhile xps can be used to analyze the specific elements on the surface for more information fig 5 table 2 a great deal of f 1s was shown in the unmodified membranes however for modified membranes the f 1s decreased with the increase of deposition time besides the extract of green tea is mainly phenolic substances with high content of c and o elements the peak intensity of o 1s increased dramatically as well as c 1s indicating that tea polyphenols coating had been deposited on the membrane the reason for the large difference in the chemical composition of the membranes could also be explicated by the phenomenon of layered sediments on the membrane surface which was shown in fig 3 table 2 shows the specific differences in the composition of the elements on the surface of the different samples the o f ratio can be used as an indicator to characterize the affinity of the membrane to water 53 with the increase of modification time the o f ratio increased gradually indicating the increasing hydrophilicity of the membrane surface in addition from fig 6 two new peaks at 464 7 ev and 457 8 ev are assigned to ti 2p1 2 and ti 2p3 2 respectively the physical photo of the modified membrane was also shown in fig 6 the tp 12 tiiv membrane showed the typical color of orange which confirmed the existence of titanium 3 2 membrane wettability the hydrophilicity of membranes was measured by water contact angle wca and pure water flux tea polyphenols can be oxidized and polymerized at alkaline ph to form substances such as theaflavin which is similar to the polymerization coating conditions of dopamine polymerization in addition oxidized tea polyphenols contain rich catechol and catechol structure so they can firmly adhere to the surface of various substrates and there are hydrogen bonds and π π interaction between tea polyphenols polymers which can form a large number of stacking bodies and greatly increase the hydrophilicity of the surface of the modified materials from fig 7 a the pristine membrane showed the typical hydrophobicity and the wca was around 110 as for the modified membranes the wca were 49 46 and 39 respectively which were obviously smaller than the pristine membrane in addition when improving the modification time the hydrophilicity of the membrane increased as well as the infiltration ability of water drop in fig 7 b for pristine membrane the wca decreased slowly and remained constantly at 92 however the wca of tp 6 tp 12 and tp 24 decreased rapidly and remained 0 in 3 s 3 s and 2 s respectively exhibiting excellent wettability of modified membranes the benign hydrophilicity and permeability of the membrane are the important basis to judge whether water can enter and transport through the filtration channel quickly as can be seen from fig 7 a the water flux of the modified membrane is higher than that of the unmodified membrane the water flux of tp 24 even reaches 13 159 l m 2 h 1 which is about twice as much as the original membrane in addition surface free energy has an impact on the hydrophilicity of the membrane and high surface free energy improves the membrane s resistance to contamination this is because high surface free energy makes it easier for water molecules to aggregate and form a hydrated layer over the membrane scaffold the hydrated layer will provide the membrane with good resistance to oil contamination the surface free energy was calculated by owrk method and it was listed in table 3 the pristine membrane has surface free energy of 31 mn m found in the lecture 45 nevertheless the surface free energy of tp 6 tp 12 and tp 24 were 52 9 mn m 56 4 mn m and 62 7 mn m respectively which were all higher than pristine membrane particularly the tp 24 had the highest surface free energy meaning it possessed the best performance of hydrophilicity and anti fouling this conclusion was consistent with the results of our test 3 3 anti fouling performance of membrane the underwater oil contact angle oca of different membranes is shown in fig 8 a which indicates the specific underwater oil repellency of the membrane the underwater oca value of the tea polyphenol modified membrane 153 156 and 158 was higher than that of the original membrane 128 indicating that the modified membrane had super oleophobicity the dynamic underwater oca was exhibited in fig s4 as can be seen from the figure the oil droplets always keep spherical and rise slowly and the flatness of the membrane hardly changes indicating that the adhesion of the modified pvdf membrane to the underwater oil droplets is low the emulsion flux and emulsion rejection was shown in fig 8 b and c the emulsion flux of tp 6 tp 12 and tp 24 were 3375 l m 2 h 1 3751 l m 2 h 1 and 4189 l m 2 h 1 respectively it is worth noting that the emulsion value of the membrane coated with tea polyphenol coating can reach twice that of the original film 2255 l m 2 h 1 indicating that tea polyphenol coating is beneficial to improve the separation efficiency in addition the emulsion rejection of modified membranes was more than 97 and even reached 98 9 for tp 24 as has been mentioned above the high surface free energy makes the membrane surface easy to form hydration which endowed the membrane a better oil resistance property the water flux recovery rate frr total contamination rate rt reversible contamination rate rr and irreversible contamination rate rir of the original and modified membranes were measured these tests can be used to characterize the anti pollution performance of modified pvdf membrane as shown in fig 8 d rt of the original pvdf membrane was 76 8 and rir of it was 22 the rir of modified pvdf membrane were all below pristine pvdf membrane the values were 1 2 0 5 and 0 3 the frr of the pristine membrane was only 78 on this basis the frr of modified membranes all exceeded 98 and the frr of tp 24 membrane was even as high as 99 7 3 4 stability of modified membrane the coating must be very stable if the membrane is to be put into production therefore rinse tests were carried out to explore the stability of the membrane the experimental device was shown in fig s5 and the results were shown in fig 9 rinsed by 0 001 mol l hcl for seven days the underwater oca of tp 12 was almost unchanged which was approximately 153 the pure water flux had a little change from 11 171 l m 2 h 1 to 10 565 l m 2 h 1 decreased by about 5 which mean tp 12 membrane was stable in the acidic condition in fig 9 a under the acid condition there is no electrostatic repulsion between the coatings therefore the coating can keep stable the mechanism can be seen in fig 10 a however when rinsed in pure water or 0 001 mol l naoh the stability of tp 12 was not optimistic in fig 9 b and c the underwater oca of tp 12 was changed a little in pure water while the pure water flux decreased obviously from 12 441 l m 2 h 1 to 10 161 l m 2 h 1 decreased by approximately about 18 nevertheless when rinsed in 0 001 mol l naoh the pure water flux and the underwater oca of tp 12 decreased dramatically within an hour meaning the tea polyphenols coating was very unstable in the alkaline condition this is because the tea polyphenols coating will continue to oxidize under neutral or alkaline conditions forming some semi quinone structures as shown in fig 1 the interaction between tp coatings includes hydrogen bond interaction and π π interaction when the negative charge in tp coating increases the electrostatic repulsion force increases and destroys the interaction between the coating and finally causes the disintegration of tp coating in order to improve the stability of tp 12 membrane in the pure water and alkaline condition titanium was introduced to make a cross link with tea polyphenols increasing the stability of the coating in fig 9 e and f the underwater oca and pure water flux of tp 12 tiiv in the pure water and 0 001 mol l naoh were very stable within seven days especially showing excellent performance in the alkaline condition this benign stability is related to the structure of tp tiiv coating in fig s6 and fig 10 b in the ph range of 3 11 it can be seen that the titanium ions added to the coating form coordination interaction with phenolic hydroxyl groups in the coating enhancing the interaction between the films and protecting the tea polyphenols from further oxidation in the alkaline condition interestingly compared with tp 12 the initial water flux of tp 12 tiiv became smaller this is due to the cross linking of titanium and tea polyphenols makes the surface coating denser thus resulting in some membrane holes blocked by the tp tiiv complexes the stability of the membrane under high concentration salt and ultrasound environment has also been tested a high concentration of salt can simulate the stability of the membrane in seawater and ultrasound can simulate the mechanical stability of the coating the result was shown in fig 11 and fig 12 the pure water flux and underwater oca remained unchanged in 30 g l nacl na2so4 kcl cacl2 and mgso4 for 24 h proving that the modified membrane can be used normally in the environment of seawater the pure water flux was increased a little after sonication this may be caused by ultrasound damage to the membrane matrix but the coating on the membrane surface was very stable because the underwater oil contact angle had not changed in summary the stability of tp 12 tiiv membrane is excellent in various complex environments 4 conclusions a facile tea polyphenols coating method was explored at the ambient condition to mitigate membrane fouling the deposition procedure was environmental and cost effective the modified membrane exhibited excellent hydrophilicity the wca decreased from 110 the original membrane to 39 tp 24 while the pure water flux increased from 7508 l m 2 h 1 to 13 159 l m 2 h 1 tp 24 in addition the modified membrane possessed benign anti fouling property the emulsion flux reached 4189 l m 2 h 1 and the oil rejection even reached 98 9 moreover the tea polyphenols coated membrane was stable in acidic conditions but relatively unstable in pure water and alkaline condition however after the addition of titanium ions the tp tiiv modified membrane was very stable in pure water and alkaline condition these results indicate that tea polyphenols are a promising material for developing high performance water purification membranes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

polymerization 14 and layer by layer assembly 15 16 can be used to improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane to make the process of purifying water more effective but these methods have some certain disadvantages such as needing special instruments or complicated conditions 6 17 nevertheless in recent decades because of its simplicity and environmental protection surface coating deposition has attracted more and more experts and scholars 18 19 so it is urgent for us to find some special coatings which possess robust material adhesion and easily transform the hydrophobic membrane into the hydrophilic one luckily nature gives us a wonderful reference to solve this problem in nature scientists have discovered that mussel foot proteins secreted by the marine mussel can help it achieve strong biological adhesion to various underwater surfaces they analyzed the structure of these secreting mussel foot proteins and synthesized similar adhesive materials 20 lee et al 21 found that dopamine could happen oxidative polymerization at alkaline ph and a coating can be formed on the surface of the material by dip coating however high cost and poor hydrophilicity are the disadvantages of dopamine 22 24 recently polyphenol compounds that contain abundant catechol pyrogallol moieties showed potential to replace dopamine 25 29 inspired by an interesting phenomenon that some tea stains are difficult to clean in the cup after brewing tea we speculate that these tea stains may be used as a coating to improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane with anti cancer prevention and control of cardiovascular diseases and other effects tea polyphenols the main component of tea stains have been widely studied in medical treatment food and biology 30 36 it is more healthy and safe to apply it to water treatment epigallocatechin gallate egcg epicatechin gallate ecg epigallocatechin egc and epicatechin ec are the major polyphenols present in green tea 37 the polymerization conditions of tea polyphenols are similar to those of dopamine which can be oxidized and polymerized at alkaline ph to form theaflavins and other substances 38 43 this provides a theoretical basis for our modification besides oxidized tea polyphenols are rich in catechol and pyrogallol structure so they can possess outstanding surface binding affinity and excellent hydrophilicity 24 44 45 compared with dopamine it is better to use tea polyphenols for surface modification because it is widely found in nature has a simple preparation process and a healthy composition which indicates potential applications in membrane modification however we found that the stability of tea polyphenols coating in the pure water and alkaline condition was unsatisfactory especially in alkaline conditions the value of pure water flux decreases obviously under alkaline condition within 20 min the coating may continue to undergo oxidation reaction in the pure water or alkaline condition 46 48 where it was not stable enough therefore titanium is introduced to react with tea polyphenols to form a cross linked structure 49 50 which can solve the problem of coating stability herein we propose a green and simple method for converting hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes into hydrophilic membranes by a simple dip coating process through tea polyphenols the tea polyphenols were abundant existence in green tea solution and the pvdf membrane is just needed to put in the green tea solution to complete the modification the chemical mechanism is shown in fig 1 the surface morphology chemical composition and wettability of the membranes were studied at different deposition times after modification with tea polyphenols an excellent hydrophilic and anti pollution membrane was obtained moreover long term rinsing experiments were conducted in order to analyze the stability of the tp membrane and the performance was unsatisfactory in the pure water and alkaline condition so titanium is used to react with tea polyphenols to improve the stability of coating which endows the modified membrane to be used in the ph range of 3 11 this simple and green strategy that the membrane was modified by tea polyphenols coating has broad application prospects in the surface modification due to its convenience safety and low cost 2 experiments 2 1 materials polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf microfiltration membranes with the average pore diameter of 0 22 μm and diameter of 5 cm were obtained from shanghai feiyue biotechnology co ltd green tea was obtained from a local market titanium ethoxide 33 35 was obtained from aladdin tween 80 toluene isopropyl alcohol ethanol tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris acetic acid and hydrochloric acid hcl were brought from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china deionized water was obtained from a rx 108 xinrui laboratory ultrapure water machine all chemicals were used without further purification 2 2 the tea polyphenols coating on the pvdf membrane the detailed protocol process is presented in fig 2 first a certain amount of green tea 4 g mixed with deionized water 120 milliliter ph 3 adjusted by hcl was shocked 130 r min in the oscillator at 60 c for 50 min then the clarified green tea solution was obtained by filtration through a büchner funnel next tris was added until the ph of the green tea solution increased from 3 to 7 8 tea polyphenols have excellent acid resistance and are stable under acidic conditions after adjusting the ph to alkaline tea polyphenols become unstable and can undergo oxidation reactions to precipitate gradually from the solution and deposit on the membrane by their own gravity and adhere firmly to the membrane surface more information is available in fig s7 after soaking the membrane in isopropanol for 30 min the membrane surface was washed repeatedly with deionized water to obtain the pretreated membrane then the membranes were soaked with green tea solution for 6 h 12 h 24 h and the final modified membranes obtained were named as tp 6 tp 12 tp 24 the control group was obtained by soaking the pretreated membranes with deionized water for 12 h 2 3 the titanium decorated tea polyphenols coating membrane the ethanol acetic acid and pure water v v v 10 3 1 were mixed in a beaker then slowly drop 0 5 ml of tetraethyl titanate into the beaker and stir vigorously after half an hour the tp 12 membrane was put into the beaker for 5 min to obtain the titanium modified membrane and the membrane can be named tp 12 tiiv 2 4 characterization the microscopic morphology of the membranes was distinguished using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem zeiss ultra plus germany accelerating voltage 5 0 kv x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab250xi uk and attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir nicolet 6700 usa were used to characterize the elemental composition and group changes of the different membranes the atomic force microscope afm nanoscope iv veeco usa was used to detect the membrane surface roughness the porosity of the membrane material is calculated using imagej 2 5 membrane property and filtration performance the contact angle test system jc2000c centron china is used to test the contact angle of the membrane at room temperature for at least three positions per membrane the water contact angle wca characterizes the hydrophilicity of the membranes and the underwater oil contact angle oca characterizes the oleophobicity of the membrane each sample was measured three times through a vacuum filtration system jinteng china at 0 1mpa pressure and room temperature to obtain its pure water flux and emulsion flux which are important indicators to evaluate its filtration performance toluene water v v 1 99 was vigorously mixed with tween 80 2 mg 99 ml and stirred for 3 h to prepare oil in water emulsion and the pure water flux and oil water emulsion flux was calculated by the following equation 1 j v a t where v a and t are the permeate volume l the effective membrane area m2 and the filtration time h respectively water flux recovery rate frr indicates the water flux recovery of the membrane after treating emulsions total fouling ratio rt indicates the degree of flux reduction caused by contamination of the membrane when treating emulsions reversible fouling ratio rr indicates the contamination of the membrane surface due to the concentration polarization of toluene oil droplets when treating emulsions and rir indicates the permanent contamination of the membrane surface or membrane pores caused by the adsorption and aggregation of contaminants such as toluene oil droplets they are important indicators to characterize the membrane s ability to resist contamination the test procedure is to let the membrane filter 200 ml of pure water and calculate its flux jw1 then let the membrane treat 50 ml of toluene emulsion and calculate its flux je then wash the membrane repeatedly with pure water and finally let the membrane filter 200 ml of pure water and calculate its flux jw2 the equations for frr rt rr and rir are as follows 2 f rr j ω 2 j ω 1 100 3 r t 1 j e j ω 1 100 4 r r j ω 2 j e j ω 1 100 5 r ir 1 j ω 2 j ω 1 100 2 6 owens wendt rabel kaelble owrk method according to the method proposed by owens wendt rable and kaelble the interfacial tension of each phase can be divided into two parts the polar component γp and the non polar component dispersion component γd the relationship between the interface free energy γsl of solid and liquid phases and the polar components nonpolar components of the solid liquid surface free energy can be expressed by the owrk method as follows 6 γ sl γ l γ s 2 γ l d γ s d 2 γ l p γ s p in the above equation γd and γp are the non polar components and polar components of the surface free energy subscripts l and s signify liquid and solid respectively the young equation reveals the relationship between the interfacial free energy of solid gas solid liquid liquid gas and the contact angle and the relationship can be expressed by the following equation 7 cos θ γ s γ sl γ l in the above equation θ is the average contact angle between liquid and membrane surface γl γs and γsl represents the interfacial free energy of liquid gas solid gas solid liquid respectively to solve the above equation and obtain the two unknown components γs d and γs p distilled water and ethylene glycol with known polar and disperse components table 1 were used 2 7 long term stability rinsing experiment fill beakers with 0 001 mol l hydrochloric acid pure water highly concentrated salt solution and 0 001 mol l sodium hydroxide respectively the modified membrane was fixed on the inner wall of the beaker and the solution was stirred to test the long term stability of the membranes under strong acid strong base or high concentration salt conditions in addition the modified membrane was also placed in an ultrasonic cleaner for 10 min to test its stability under ultrasonic conditions to reflect the stability of the modified membrane after the rinsing experiment the pure water flux and underwater oil contact angle were tested every 24 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization the surface geometry difference of pristine and modified membranes was analyzed by using fesem fig 3 the pristine membrane surface fig 3a possessed many homogeneous pores and sharp edges however as the modification time extended the surface porosity of modified membranes fig 3b c d fig s8 decreased this is because as more and more tea polyphenols are deposited on the membrane surface its modified coating is gradually becoming thicker and slowly covering part of the membrane pores moreover the surface roughness of the tp modified membranes is obviously improved and has a hierarchical structure this is because tea polyphenols can be oxidized to form quinones and the phenol quinone can react with another tea polyphenol therefore many hydrogen bond interaction sites in the polymeric tea polyphenols chain interact to form a hybrid network which can enhance the hydrophilicity and water absorption of the modified tp membrane this mechanism can also be demonstrated in uv vis spectra in fig s1 the maximum absorbance at 273 nm was catechol groups and the broad absorbance at 325 nm was quinine groups 24 in the original tea polyphenols solution there only existed catechol groups in 273 nm but there formed many phenol quinones in the alkaline condition in tp 0 just adjust the ph of the solution to 7 8 and the phenol quinone decreased in the tp 12 because the phenol quinone reacted with other tea polyphenols in addition three dimension afm images of various membranes were also given in fig 4 the average roughness of the original membrane is only 13 4 nm obviously the average roughness of the modified membrane is higher and changed with the deposition time increasing from 16 8 nm to 34 3 nm due to the coating layer addition the hydrophilicity of the tp membrane is increased since the rough surface of the film will make it easier to form a hydration layer 51 atr ftir and xps spectra revealed the chemical composition differences on the membrane surface in atr ftir it can be seen from fig s2 that the tea polyphenols have a co stretching vibration peak at 1691 cm 1 1611 cm 1 1518 cm 1 are the characteristic peaks of the benzene ring in tea polyphenols and the modified membrane shown in fig s2 shows several new weak absorption peaks at 1688 cm 1 1510 cm 1 and 1610 cm 1 these peaks indicate that the tea polyphenol coating was successfully immobilized on the membrane 52 these peaks implied that the tea polyphenols coating was fixed on the membrane successfully the atr ftir spectra of tp 12 ti were shown in fig s3 in the original membrane the stretching vibration peak of co was 1688 cm 1 and the substituted benzene ring vibration peak was 1610 cm 1 after the modification of tea polyphenols and titanium ions pyrogallol tiiv chelate rings are formed which makes the two stretching vibration peaks move to the direction of low wavenumber meanwhile xps can be used to analyze the specific elements on the surface for more information fig 5 table 2 a great deal of f 1s was shown in the unmodified membranes however for modified membranes the f 1s decreased with the increase of deposition time besides the extract of green tea is mainly phenolic substances with high content of c and o elements the peak intensity of o 1s increased dramatically as well as c 1s indicating that tea polyphenols coating had been deposited on the membrane the reason for the large difference in the chemical composition of the membranes could also be explicated by the phenomenon of layered sediments on the membrane surface which was shown in fig 3 table 2 shows the specific differences in the composition of the elements on the surface of the different samples the o f ratio can be used as an indicator to characterize the affinity of the membrane to water 53 with the increase of modification time the o f ratio increased gradually indicating the increasing hydrophilicity of the membrane surface in addition from fig 6 two new peaks at 464 7 ev and 457 8 ev are assigned to ti 2p1 2 and ti 2p3 2 respectively the physical photo of the modified membrane was also shown in fig 6 the tp 12 tiiv membrane showed the typical color of orange which confirmed the existence of titanium 3 2 membrane wettability the hydrophilicity of membranes was measured by water contact angle wca and pure water flux tea polyphenols can be oxidized and polymerized at alkaline ph to form substances such as theaflavin which is similar to the polymerization coating conditions of dopamine polymerization in addition oxidized tea polyphenols contain rich catechol and catechol structure so they can firmly adhere to the surface of various substrates and there are hydrogen bonds and π π interaction between tea polyphenols polymers which can form a large number of stacking bodies and greatly increase the hydrophilicity of the surface of the modified materials from fig 7 a the pristine membrane showed the typical hydrophobicity and the wca was around 110 as for the modified membranes the wca were 49 46 and 39 respectively which were obviously smaller than the pristine membrane in addition when improving the modification time the hydrophilicity of the membrane increased as well as the infiltration ability of water drop in fig 7 b for pristine membrane the wca decreased slowly and remained constantly at 92 however the wca of tp 6 tp 12 and tp 24 decreased rapidly and remained 0 in 3 s 3 s and 2 s respectively exhibiting excellent wettability of modified membranes the benign hydrophilicity and permeability of the membrane are the important basis to judge whether water can enter and transport through the filtration channel quickly as can be seen from fig 7 a the water flux of the modified membrane is higher than that of the unmodified membrane the water flux of tp 24 even reaches 13 159 l m 2 h 1 which is about twice as much as the original membrane in addition surface free energy has an impact on the hydrophilicity of the membrane and high surface free energy improves the membrane s resistance to contamination this is because high surface free energy makes it easier for water molecules to aggregate and form a hydrated layer over the membrane scaffold the hydrated layer will provide the membrane with good resistance to oil contamination the surface free energy was calculated by owrk method and it was listed in table 3 the pristine membrane has surface free energy of 31 mn m found in the lecture 45 nevertheless the surface free energy of tp 6 tp 12 and tp 24 were 52 9 mn m 56 4 mn m and 62 7 mn m respectively which were all higher than pristine membrane particularly the tp 24 had the highest surface free energy meaning it possessed the best performance of hydrophilicity and anti fouling this conclusion was consistent with the results of our test 3 3 anti fouling performance of membrane the underwater oil contact angle oca of different membranes is shown in fig 8 a which indicates the specific underwater oil repellency of the membrane the underwater oca value of the tea polyphenol modified membrane 153 156 and 158 was higher than that of the original membrane 128 indicating that the modified membrane had super oleophobicity the dynamic underwater oca was exhibited in fig s4 as can be seen from the figure the oil droplets always keep spherical and rise slowly and the flatness of the membrane hardly changes indicating that the adhesion of the modified pvdf membrane to the underwater oil droplets is low the emulsion flux and emulsion rejection was shown in fig 8 b and c the emulsion flux of tp 6 tp 12 and tp 24 were 3375 l m 2 h 1 3751 l m 2 h 1 and 4189 l m 2 h 1 respectively it is worth noting that the emulsion value of the membrane coated with tea polyphenol coating can reach twice that of the original film 2255 l m 2 h 1 indicating that tea polyphenol coating is beneficial to improve the separation efficiency in addition the emulsion rejection of modified membranes was more than 97 and even reached 98 9 for tp 24 as has been mentioned above the high surface free energy makes the membrane surface easy to form hydration which endowed the membrane a better oil resistance property the water flux recovery rate frr total contamination rate rt reversible contamination rate rr and irreversible contamination rate rir of the original and modified membranes were measured these tests can be used to characterize the anti pollution performance of modified pvdf membrane as shown in fig 8 d rt of the original pvdf membrane was 76 8 and rir of it was 22 the rir of modified pvdf membrane were all below pristine pvdf membrane the values were 1 2 0 5 and 0 3 the frr of the pristine membrane was only 78 on this basis the frr of modified membranes all exceeded 98 and the frr of tp 24 membrane was even as high as 99 7 3 4 stability of modified membrane the coating must be very stable if the membrane is to be put into production therefore rinse tests were carried out to explore the stability of the membrane the experimental device was shown in fig s5 and the results were shown in fig 9 rinsed by 0 001 mol l hcl for seven days the underwater oca of tp 12 was almost unchanged which was approximately 153 the pure water flux had a little change from 11 171 l m 2 h 1 to 10 565 l m 2 h 1 decreased by about 5 which mean tp 12 membrane was stable in the acidic condition in fig 9 a under the acid condition there is no electrostatic repulsion between the coatings therefore the coating can keep stable the mechanism can be seen in fig 10 a however when rinsed in pure water or 0 001 mol l naoh the stability of tp 12 was not optimistic in fig 9 b and c the underwater oca of tp 12 was changed a little in pure water while the pure water flux decreased obviously from 12 441 l m 2 h 1 to 10 161 l m 2 h 1 decreased by approximately about 18 nevertheless when rinsed in 0 001 mol l naoh the pure water flux and the underwater oca of tp 12 decreased dramatically within an hour meaning the tea polyphenols coating was very unstable in the alkaline condition this is because the tea polyphenols coating will continue to oxidize under neutral or alkaline conditions forming some semi quinone structures as shown in fig 1 the interaction between tp coatings includes hydrogen bond interaction and π π interaction when the negative charge in tp coating increases the electrostatic repulsion force increases and destroys the interaction between the coating and finally causes the disintegration of tp coating in order to improve the stability of tp 12 membrane in the pure water and alkaline condition titanium was introduced to make a cross link with tea polyphenols increasing the stability of the coating in fig 9 e and f the underwater oca and pure water flux of tp 12 tiiv in the pure water and 0 001 mol l naoh were very stable within seven days especially showing excellent performance in the alkaline condition this benign stability is related to the structure of tp tiiv coating in fig s6 and fig 10 b in the ph range of 3 11 it can be seen that the titanium ions added to the coating form coordination interaction with phenolic hydroxyl groups in the coating enhancing the interaction between the films and protecting the tea polyphenols from further oxidation in the alkaline condition interestingly compared with tp 12 the initial water flux of tp 12 tiiv became smaller this is due to the cross linking of titanium and tea polyphenols makes the surface coating denser thus resulting in some membrane holes blocked by the tp tiiv complexes the stability of the membrane under high concentration salt and ultrasound environment has also been tested a high concentration of salt can simulate the stability of the membrane in seawater and ultrasound can simulate the mechanical stability of the coating the result was shown in fig 11 and fig 12 the pure water flux and underwater oca remained unchanged in 30 g l nacl na2so4 kcl cacl2 and mgso4 for 24 h proving that the modified membrane can be used normally in the environment of seawater the pure water flux was increased a little after sonication this may be caused by ultrasound damage to the membrane matrix but the coating on the membrane surface was very stable because the underwater oil contact angle had not changed in summary the stability of tp 12 tiiv membrane is excellent in various complex environments 4 conclusions a facile tea polyphenols coating method was explored at the ambient condition to mitigate membrane fouling the deposition procedure was environmental and cost effective the modified membrane exhibited excellent hydrophilicity the wca decreased from 110 the original membrane to 39 tp 24 while the pure water flux increased from 7508 l m 2 h 1 to 13 159 l m 2 h 1 tp 24 in addition the modified membrane possessed benign anti fouling property the emulsion flux reached 4189 l m 2 h 1 and the oil rejection even reached 98 9 moreover the tea polyphenols coated membrane was stable in acidic conditions but relatively unstable in pure water and alkaline condition however after the addition of titanium ions the tp tiiv modified membrane was very stable in pure water and alkaline condition these results indicate that tea polyphenols are a promising material for developing high performance water purification membranes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

lakes ministry of education hohai university nanjing 210098 china key laboratory of integrated regulation and resource development on shallow lakes ministry of education hohai university nanjing 210098 china induced crystallization softening technology has been widely used in applied drinking water treatment projects the application mode needs to be optimized to achieve the complete utilization of induced crystallization particles therefore a series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the change in induced crystallization particles water hardness removal and effluent characteristics subsequently the main determinants and the corresponding optimal operating mode were discussed the results showed an increase in particle size reaction time and a decrease in solution ph reduced the water hardness removal efficiency of reactor more likely bigger crystallization particles slow down the water turbulence cause uneven mixing of softening agents decline the solution ph and eventually softening reaction stop until ref rep decreases to 1 the particles will completely lose the ability to remove hardness the initial particle size and the dosage of softening agents as well as accelerating the up flow velocity employed in the system were found to be key factor for the time particles take to reach a critical size and terminal velocity that stops the reaction therefore filling the smaller particles and gradually increasing the up flow velocity of the system could prolong the lifetime of the particles in practical applications improving the utilization efficiency of the unit volume furthermore it optimizes the sand discharge cycle and produces safer waste residues graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords induced crystallization softening fluidization induced crystallization particles failure up flow velocity hardness drinking water 1 introduction groundwater is the main source of drinking water in more than 30 of the world the quality of groundwater is being deteriorated particularly due to water hardness owing to soluble minerals 1 2 water hardness demonstrates significant health hazards most countries set a threshold hardness level of caco3 concentration as 50 150 mg l of drinking water 3 however groundwater at most places has a hardness content of more than 200 mg l caco3 which is required to be treated for its consumption as drinking water 4 numerous water hardness removal approaches including pellet softening 5 adsorption 6 ion exchange 7 nanofiltration 8 reverse osmosis 9 electrolysis 10 electrodialysis 11 12 electrochemical softening 13 14 have been proposed so far however chemical softening and its derivative process has been proven effective by large scale engineering practices and more efficient in maintaining the long term stable operation 15 in the traditional chemical softening process the precipitation of caco3 usually depends on the traditional coagulation sedimentation process 16 this process exhibits low mixing efficiency of softening agents prolong precipitation reaction time 1 5 3 h and high sludge moisture content 70 98 17 besides the dehydration process of high water content sludge itself a problem and restrict the sludge disposal and operation management 18 on the other hand in derivative process in chemical softening induced crystallization softening technology 19 and improved induced crystallization softening technology 20 21 are more common the technology can improve the mixing and precipitation separation rates 22 and has successfully been used in various countries e g netherlands and denmark 23 24 a lot of research has been done on the establishment of the fluidized bed reactor model 25 and the description of reactor model 26 barghi et al 27 stated that the mixing coefficient and mixing index of the fluidized bed increased with the increase of the increase in up flow velocity and the overall circulation of the particles led to the mixing of the particles tai et al 28 showed that the density of fluidized bed particles was proportional to the treatment efficiency and the growth rate of particles was proportional to particle size and surface reaction coefficient according to escudier et al 29 the properties of fluidized carriers change with the extension of service time and spontaneous separation is carried out in a fluidized bed reactor van schagen et al 30 suggested that the increase in the total pressure drop of the fluidized bed could be used to judge the time of particle replacement in the reactor schetters et al 31 showed that the particle replacement time was related to the minimum porosity and pressure gradient at the same time in the large scale operation the crystallization filler is usually discharged regularly by controlling the total pressure drop of the bed with the particle size of 0 8 1 2 mm discharged and the cycle is 3 5 times a week 32 induced crystallization softening technology has been widely used however previous studies only described the particle state in the fluidized bed and determined the particle replacement time according to the total pressure drop mode of the bed but did not establish the relationship between the hardness removal effect and the fluidized particle state therefore by describing the failure process of particles in the reactor this paper establishes the relationship between the removal effect of hardness and the fluidization state of particles and defines the operating parameters affecting the fluidization state of particles finally practice implication of reactor modification in maintaining particle size the working life of particles simplification of water plant operation efficiency and purity of crystals in sediments and harmless disposal of waste residue were also discussed in detail 2 materials and methods 2 1 material drink water was obtained from an urban residential area located in p county of north china the water quality of the experimental area in the last 3 years is as follows total hardness is 478 496 mg l among which calcium and magnesium hardness are 332 346 mg l and 141 150 mg l total alkalinity only contains bicarbonate alkalinity the content is 332 5 350 mg l the total dissolved solids tds ph and turbidity are 8 26 c 7 32 7 38 and 0 18 0 25 ntu respectively the chemicals and reagents used in this study were obtained from chronchem china and were analytical grade or better quartz sand particles of different sizes 0 15 0 20 0 20 0 30 0 30 0 40 and 0 40 0 50 mm were used as induced crystallization particles the supporting layer of induced crystallization particles was gravel with a particle size range of 1 0 2 0 cm freshly prepared sodium hydroxide solution of 0 2 mol l concentration was prepared every day and used as softener 2 2 reactor design and specification the main test device was a plexiglass column and had an inner diameter of 4 cm and a height of 2 m the testing water was transported to the reactor through the bottom inlet of the reactor using a centrifugal pump a 20 l plastic bucket containing a softening agent naoh was attached to the reactor the softening agent was supplied to the reactor by using a peristaltic pump due to the smaller diameter of the reactor only one dosing inlet was formed located at 5 cm above the bottom of the reactor the inner diameter of the dosing inlet pipe was 8 mm and it entered the reactor horizontally from the side wall and the final dosing inlet was located in the center of the reactor the reactor had four outlets for sampling 10 60 110 and 160 cm above the bottom which were all located on the side wall of the reactor the reactor packing was divided into gravel and induced crystallization particles the gravel was packed in the lower part of the induced crystallization particles the packing height of gravel was 5 cm and the packing height of induced crystallization particles was 50 cm the test device diagram is shown in fig 1 2 3 experimental method 2 3 1 induced crystallization softening process two devices were established to evaluate the softening performance of induced crystallization particles at two dosages 120 and 500 mg l separately the operating parameters in each device were set as up flow velocity 25 m h induced crystallization particles size 0 15 0 20 mm and quartz sand particles expansion rate 100 two sets of reactors were used for continuous operation for 15 days water and sand samples 500 ml and 15 ml respectively were taken out at 10 60 110 and 160 cm of the height of the reactor for twice a day water samples were evaluated to determine various parameters while sand samples were extracted to analyze particle size change 2 3 2 influencing factors the effectiveness of particle hardness removal was investigated under varying 1 dosages of softening agents 2 the up flow velocity and 3 the filling induced crystallization particle size firstly the dosage of softening agent was studied by setting 6 levels of softening agent dosage and using 6 sets of reactors to run synchronously secondly the up flow velocity was studied by setting 2 levels of softening agent dosage and 3 levels of rising flow rate using 6 sets of reactors to run simultaneously thirdly the filling induced crystallization particle size was studied by setting 2 levels of softening agent dosage and 4 levels of filling induced crystallization particle size using 8 sets of reactors to operate simultaneously in order to obtain more accurate data the reactor was operated continuously for 15 days under each test condition and samples were taken twice a day the specific operation parameters are shown in table 1 the sample analysis process was similar to that discussed in section 2 3 1 2 3 3 the properties of induced crystallization particles the 15 ml samples of the stratified particle used in the reactor with 500 mg l dosage of softening agents were obtained from fluidized bed height of 10 110 and 160 cm on 1st 5th and 12th day of the experiment and tested for characteristics of particles the collected samples were dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h and observed their morphology the sample collected on 5th day was selected to test the crystallization properties of particles 2 3 4 application of changing the up flow velocity the up flow velocity influence on induced crystallization particles water softening performance was tested using three reactor devices operating at three up flow velocity levels 8 25 and 50 m h separately the other operating parameters in each device was set as softening agent 120 mg l induced crystallization particle size 0 15 0 20 mm induced crystallization particles filling height 50 cm and quartz sand particles expansion rate 100 the reactor operating time sampling procedures and sample analysis process was similar to that discussed in section 2 3 1 2 3 5 influence of gradually increasing up flow velocity the initial up flow velocity 8 m h was gradually increased and tested to influence induced crystallization particles water softening performance for this a set of devices was established and the operating parameters in each device were set as softening agent 500 mg l crystallization particle size 0 15 0 20 mm and induced crystallization particles filling height 50 cm water and sand samples 500 ml and 15 ml respectively were taken out at 110 cm of the height of the reactor for twice a day and tested for effluent properties and variation in size respectively the sample analysis process was similar to that discussed in section 2 3 1 2 4 analytical method the chemical characterization of water samples was performed within 10 min of sampling while induced crystallization particles were placed in an oven after sampling and dried at 105 c for 24 h then tested for particle size analyses the total hardness and alkalinity of the water were determined by the chemical titration method 33 the ph value was analyzed using the glass electrode method pb 10 sartorius the average particle size of induced crystallization particles was determined by the standard sample separation and screening method the morphology and crystalline structure of a particle was determined by scanning electron microscopy sem nova nanosem npe218 fei and x ray diffraction xrd d8advance buker 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of water softening process in fig 2 a1 and b1 the influence of softening agent dosage on water hardness removal was studied while keeping other parameters constant at 120 mg l dosage level the particles removed water hardness for longer time but the removal rate remained irregular during the whole experimental duration with ongoing run time water hardness removal decreased steadily a similar irregular but higher removal of water hardness was obtained at a softening agent dosage of 500 mg l however the removal efficiency of the total hardness of water changed faster fig 2 b1 since a higher dose of softening agent causes retain system ph for a short time which accelerates the particles reach reaching critical size the resultant ratio of deactivated to active parties remained higher 34 35 consistent with water hardness removal trends the ph of the reactor also decreases with increasing running time at both dosage levels fig 2 a2 and b2 however at a higher dosage 500 mg l the ph changed faster than the total hardness removal efficiency of the reactor it can be perceived by comparing ph and water hardness trends that the water hardness removal rate was decreased with a decline in ph the ph of the reactor plays an important role in the calcium carbonate crystallization process and improves the water hardness removal process hereby decrease in reactor ph reduce the water hardness removal efficiency of the reactor 36 in fig 2 a3 and b3 the influence of softening agent dosages on alkalinity was studied at a 110 cm fluidized bed height while keeping other parameters constant as shown in fig 2 a3 the bicarbonate alkalinity of effluent rapidly increased from the 10th day and reached a raw water level after 2 weeks the changing trend in alkalinity with reaction time was the same as those found in ph and water hardness removal however at a higher dosage 500 mg l the alkalinity of the system became stable after the first week of the experiment in fig 2 a4 and b4 finally particle size tends to increase with experimental time and showed a similar increasing trend to those found in the other three factors i e water hardness removal ph alkalinity 3 2 factors affecting the effectiveness of induced crystallization particles 3 2 1 softening agent dosage in fig 3 a the influence of softening agents on induced crystallization particle performance was studied by changing the dosage of softening agents from 100 to 600 mg l while maintaining the same values for other parameters the samples were obtained from 110 cm fluidized bed height and test to determine the water hardness removal ph and particle size with an increase in residence time ph and water hardness removal efficiency of particles decreased while the size of particles increases 37 the falling of ph and removal efficiency showed similar decline speed at corresponding softening agent dosages it can be perceived from fig 3 a and b the increase in ph of the reactor is a function of the softening agent which in turn determines the water hardness removal 37 moreover the particle takes about 5 days to reach 0 9 mm in 600 mg l compared to 13 days at 100 mg l dosage of the softening agent fig 3 c this shows particles attain the critical size and lost efficiency more rapidly at high softening agent dosage than lower 3 2 2 up flow velocity the samples were obtained from 160 cm fluidized bed height and tested for up flow velocity influence on reactor performance at 120 and 500 mg l dosages of a softening agent while maintaining the same values for other parameters fig 4 results showed that the increase in up flow velocity reduces the system ph 38 negatively impacting the water hardness removal efficiency of the reactor and the increase in softening agent dosages further worsens fig 4a and b an increase in up flow velocity did not change the relationship between ph and water hardness removal i e a decline in ph decreased water hardness removal trend noticeably increase in up flow velocity from 8 to 25 m h has negligible effects up to 12 days at lower dosages while a further increase in up flow velocity from 25 to 50 m h remarkedly declines reactor performance increased up flow velocity from 25 to 50 m h shortens the affective duration of particles from 10 to 8 days but enhanced the quantity of treated water from 7 5 m3 to 12 1 m3 3 2 3 the filling induced crystallization particle size in fig 5 the influence of the induced crystallization particle size on reactor performance was studied using different sizes of induced crystallization particles the particle size impacts were studied at 120 and 500 mg l dosages of softening agent and the samples were obtained from 160 cm fluidized bed height while values for other parameters were kept constant the working lifetime of particles was found to be size dependent i e the size of particle shortened will be the hardening removal ability of particles 37 39 moreover discrepancies of reactor attributes i e water hardness removal a decline in ph and growth of particle size between different sized particles reduced with increased softening dosages so far induce crystallization particles showed promising effects in removing water hardness and alkalinity and contributed to maintaining ph and effective particle size in the reactor however with an increase in residence time the induced crystallization particles expand in size ph and water hardness removal efficiency of the system reduced hence to maintain the efficiency of the system the study of morphological changes in particle over time the working principle of induced crystallization softening reaction and the fluidized state of particles and the function of induced crystallization particles in removing water hardness could be of significant importance which are discussed in section 3 3 3 3 analysis of the role of induced crystallization particles in removing hardness 3 3 1 the physical properties of the induced crystallization particles it can be perceived from figs 6 and 2 b that the particle size gradually increased and reached a maximum size of 1 mm with ongoing run time morphological studies of particle showed the surface of particles which lose water hardness ability turned smooth and flat and tended to be spherical or ellipsoid in appearance in contrast those particles that did not remove hardness contained irregular surface projections with obvious edges and corners similar to those reported in the literature 37 the sem observation of induced crystallization particles from different angles showed protrusions and cavities on the surface of the particles at the initial adhesion stage offers binding site of a large specific surface area for the subsequent adhesion of the crystallization products once the particle reached its maturity the concave surface developed by protrusions and cavities disappeared basically during removing hardness the particles developed obvious surface protrusion and crystallization on the surface of the particles produced adhesion and agglomeration the crystallization products adhere continuously on the surface filling out the concave sites the surface layer of the induced crystallization particles presents smooth and flat spherical or ellipsoid and particles lose adhesion capacity 37 40 the xrd diffractogram fig 7 for the change in induce crystallization particles at the fluidized bed height of 160 cm suggested the peaks of induced crystallization particles and sio2 were parallel positioned at 26 636 after 5 days of the experiment moving to lower heights the characteristics peaks of sio2 reduced while peeks belong to induced crystallization particles were consistent with peaks of caco3 moreover the peaks of caco3 gradually inclined with the maturation of particles and the decline of their water hardness removal rate the sem micrographs fig 6 and xrd diffractogram fig 7 were jointly revealed the concentration of caco3 increased on the surface of particles that smoother the surface of particles with the passage of experimental time the smooth surface loses its reactivity and finely resulted in a decline in the water hardness removal process 37 3 3 2 the process of the induced crystallization softening reaction it is generally acknowledged that the induced crystallization softening mechanism is a combination of the chemical softening process and fluidized bed induced crystallization process 41 induce crystallization particles mixed with raw water in reactor where caco3 adheres on the surface of particles and removed by precipitation the mechanism can be divided into three phases 1 introduction and mixing of softening agent with raw water in the reactor 2 the alkali solution reacts with bicarbonate ions to form carbonate ions as shown in eq 1 3 carbonate ions react with calcium ions to form calcium carbonate precipitates as shown in eq 2 1 hc o 3 o h c o 3 2 h 2 o 2 c a 2 c o 3 2 cac o 3 in the first phase of the fluidized bed induced crystallization softening technology the mixing of the agent and the raw water depends on the collision of the induced crystallization particles in the fluidized state 21 the turbulent flow enhanced collision and facilitated faster and full mixing of softening agents with raw water where the mixing process developed precipitation in the reactor 34 35 thus the turbulent flow in the reactor directly affects the mixing rate of the softening agent and the raw water it is evident that a decline in the softening reaction rate reduces the water hardness removal efficiency and ph of the reactor so in the present experiment the first phase mixing of agents was blocked which inhibit the fully mixing of softening agents with raw water since ph is synchronous with the increase of particle size it can be further inferred that the uneven mixing of agents and the decrease of ph due to particle growth eventually lead to the stop of softening reaction and reduced the total hardness removal efficiency 39 3 3 3 the fluidized state of the particles in the reactor the fluids reynolds number is known as an excellent marker of fluid turbulence intensity 39 therefore the ratio of the actual reynolds number of the fluidized bed to the critical reynolds number of the particles was calculated to explained the degree of fluidization of the particles and clarified the diffusion mechanism of the softening agent the actual reynolds number ref and the critical reynolds number rep of the fluidized bed can be calculated by using eqs 3 and 4 3 re f d p u ρ g μ 4 re p d p u mf ρ g μ 5 u mf d p 2 ρ p ρ g g 1650 μ where dp is the particle diameter m u is the empty bed velocity m s umf is the critical fluidization velocity m s ρp is the particle density kg m3 ρg is the fluid density kg m3 μ is the hydrodynamic viscosity n s m 2 combining fig 2 and fig 8 a b it can be seen that when the induced crystallization particle size increases the ref rep of the layer will rapidly decrease from 35 to below 1 at the same time the total hardness of the water sample in the layer will rise and the ph will drop and the total hardness will be lost ability the actual reynolds number of the failed particle layer is not enough to meet the critical reynolds number of the particles and the fluidization state stops 42 therefore it can be assumed that the layer of particles grown to critical particle size resides in a non fluidization state subsequently when the fluid flows through the particle layer the fluid will be in the transition zone reducing mixing efficiency resultantly the blockage of softening agent diffusion reduced the water hardness treatment efficiency of particles as shown in fig 8 c with the extension of the operating time the bed expansion rate in the fluidized bed induced crystallization softening reactor decreased rapidly and after increasing the dosage of the softening agent the rate of decrease of the bed expansion rate increases this phenomenon can further verify that when the induced crystallization particle size increases the bed expansion rate decreases the particle fluidization degree decreases and the removal ability of the total hardness is lost 3 3 4 operation mechanism of inducing crystallization particles on hardness removal efficiency in the crystallization softening process the induced crystallization particles worked as crystallization carriers keeping the caco3 precipitation in sediments and facilitating softening response by accelerating the diffusion of softening agents in turbulent flow 19 however with increasing residence time the induced crystallization particles gradually grow in size leading to the uneven mixing of softening agents and a decline in the turbulence intensity of particles in the reactor our results agree with kramer et al 37 who also found smaller size partial and low up flow velocity are among the most critical factors for a successful water softening process subsequently uneven mixing of softening agents reduced the ph of the system and finally hindered the first step of the softening reaction the addition of softening agent and the size of inducing particle used in reactor determine the time of particles to reach the critical particle size while the up flow velocity of particles affects the critical fluidization velocity 38 3 4 practical implications induce crystallization particles mixing and diffusion of softening agents affect water hardness removal while the turbulent state of particles determines mixing the softening agents adjusting the design of the induce crystallization particles softening process and where it is applied in the water softening train would affect induce crystallization particle characteristics and the overall water treatment process 36 the working life of induced crystallization particles can increase by increasing fluid up flow velocity increasing the up flow velocity speed up the time particles take to reached critical size and lose the water hardness removal effectiveness which can be a disadvantage for the water softening process fig 9 a b and c however the actual water amount processed by the induced crystallization particles per unit volume increased fig 9 d which can be favorable from an operational point of view 22 40 besides an increase in flow rate could also drain out the smaller sized particles from the reactor with water flow therefore operation mode with a variable flow rate can promise improved utilization efficiency of induced crystallization particles similarly an increase in the degree of turbulence of particles and ref rep as a function of increased up flow velocity can recharge those particles that lose their water hardness removal capacity at regular up flow velocity and increased working life of particles fig 10 therefore the up flow velocity can be increased step by step in the actual operation process to ensure that the particles always have hard removal efficiency overall the proposed optimal design of the induce crystals particles softening process offers the following advantages 1 it can effectively maintain long time particle size 2 it can prolong the service time of inducted particles 3 it can enhance the adhesive amount of calcium carbonate 4 improved the proportion and purity of calcium carbonate in the waste residue 5 facilitate the operation and maintenance of reactor and 6 can provide a prerequisite guarantee of safer disposal of the waste residue 4 conclusion the induced crystallization particle characteristics and the factors affecting performance including softening agent dosage up flow velocity and filling induced crystallization particles were evaluated the water hardness removal performance of particles varied with residence time ph particles size up flow velocity and it was concluded that the results of particle characterization and reynolds number calculation of present pilot scale study suggest that the induced crystallization particles in a fluidized state facilitate the first step of the softening reaction by improving the diffusion rate of the softening agent thus particles in a fluidized state are mandatory for the water hardness removal process which otherwise unable to carry out the diffusion of the softening agent in the reactor the dosage of softening agents degree of softening the up flow velocity and the size of the inducted inducing particles directly affect the effective working life of the inducing particles the up flow velocity determines the critical particle size of the maximum particle that can be pushed under the corresponding flow rate while the degree of softening and the filling particle size of the inducing particles determine the time when the particles reach the critical particle size the hardness removal ability of induced crystallization particles showed an irregular decreasing trend with service time however the reactor efficiency can be optimized by changing the operation parameters resultantly improved water hardness removal potential enhanced the water amount and efficiency of induced crystallization particles optimized the sand discharge cycle

210098 china induced crystallization softening technology has been widely used in applied drinking water treatment projects the application mode needs to be optimized to achieve the complete utilization of induced crystallization particles therefore a series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the change in induced crystallization particles water hardness removal and effluent characteristics subsequently the main determinants and the corresponding optimal operating mode were discussed the results showed an increase in particle size reaction time and a decrease in solution ph reduced the water hardness removal efficiency of reactor more likely bigger crystallization particles slow down the water turbulence cause uneven mixing of softening agents decline the solution ph and eventually softening reaction stop until ref rep decreases to 1 the particles will completely lose the ability to remove hardness the initial particle size and the dosage of softening agents as well as accelerating the up flow velocity employed in the system were found to be key factor for the time particles take to reach a critical size and terminal velocity that stops the reaction therefore filling the smaller particles and gradually increasing the up flow velocity of the system could prolong the lifetime of the particles in practical applications improving the utilization efficiency of the unit volume furthermore it optimizes the sand discharge cycle and produces safer waste residues graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords induced crystallization softening fluidization induced crystallization particles failure up flow velocity hardness drinking water 1 introduction groundwater is the main source of drinking water in more than 30 of the world the quality of groundwater is being deteriorated particularly due to water hardness owing to soluble minerals 1 2 water hardness demonstrates significant health hazards most countries set a threshold hardness level of caco3 concentration as 50 150 mg l of drinking water 3 however groundwater at most places has a hardness content of more than 200 mg l caco3 which is required to be treated for its consumption as drinking water 4 numerous water hardness removal approaches including pellet softening 5 adsorption 6 ion exchange 7 nanofiltration 8 reverse osmosis 9 electrolysis 10 electrodialysis 11 12 electrochemical softening 13 14 have been proposed so far however chemical softening and its derivative process has been proven effective by large scale engineering practices and more efficient in maintaining the long term stable operation 15 in the traditional chemical softening process the precipitation of caco3 usually depends on the traditional coagulation sedimentation process 16 this process exhibits low mixing efficiency of softening agents prolong precipitation reaction time 1 5 3 h and high sludge moisture content 70 98 17 besides the dehydration process of high water content sludge itself a problem and restrict the sludge disposal and operation management 18 on the other hand in derivative process in chemical softening induced crystallization softening technology 19 and improved induced crystallization softening technology 20 21 are more common the technology can improve the mixing and precipitation separation rates 22 and has successfully been used in various countries e g netherlands and denmark 23 24 a lot of research has been done on the establishment of the fluidized bed reactor model 25 and the description of reactor model 26 barghi et al 27 stated that the mixing coefficient and mixing index of the fluidized bed increased with the increase of the increase in up flow velocity and the overall circulation of the particles led to the mixing of the particles tai et al 28 showed that the density of fluidized bed particles was proportional to the treatment efficiency and the growth rate of particles was proportional to particle size and surface reaction coefficient according to escudier et al 29 the properties of fluidized carriers change with the extension of service time and spontaneous separation is carried out in a fluidized bed reactor van schagen et al 30 suggested that the increase in the total pressure drop of the fluidized bed could be used to judge the time of particle replacement in the reactor schetters et al 31 showed that the particle replacement time was related to the minimum porosity and pressure gradient at the same time in the large scale operation the crystallization filler is usually discharged regularly by controlling the total pressure drop of the bed with the particle size of 0 8 1 2 mm discharged and the cycle is 3 5 times a week 32 induced crystallization softening technology has been widely used however previous studies only described the particle state in the fluidized bed and determined the particle replacement time according to the total pressure drop mode of the bed but did not establish the relationship between the hardness removal effect and the fluidized particle state therefore by describing the failure process of particles in the reactor this paper establishes the relationship between the removal effect of hardness and the fluidization state of particles and defines the operating parameters affecting the fluidization state of particles finally practice implication of reactor modification in maintaining particle size the working life of particles simplification of water plant operation efficiency and purity of crystals in sediments and harmless disposal of waste residue were also discussed in detail 2 materials and methods 2 1 material drink water was obtained from an urban residential area located in p county of north china the water quality of the experimental area in the last 3 years is as follows total hardness is 478 496 mg l among which calcium and magnesium hardness are 332 346 mg l and 141 150 mg l total alkalinity only contains bicarbonate alkalinity the content is 332 5 350 mg l the total dissolved solids tds ph and turbidity are 8 26 c 7 32 7 38 and 0 18 0 25 ntu respectively the chemicals and reagents used in this study were obtained from chronchem china and were analytical grade or better quartz sand particles of different sizes 0 15 0 20 0 20 0 30 0 30 0 40 and 0 40 0 50 mm were used as induced crystallization particles the supporting layer of induced crystallization particles was gravel with a particle size range of 1 0 2 0 cm freshly prepared sodium hydroxide solution of 0 2 mol l concentration was prepared every day and used as softener 2 2 reactor design and specification the main test device was a plexiglass column and had an inner diameter of 4 cm and a height of 2 m the testing water was transported to the reactor through the bottom inlet of the reactor using a centrifugal pump a 20 l plastic bucket containing a softening agent naoh was attached to the reactor the softening agent was supplied to the reactor by using a peristaltic pump due to the smaller diameter of the reactor only one dosing inlet was formed located at 5 cm above the bottom of the reactor the inner diameter of the dosing inlet pipe was 8 mm and it entered the reactor horizontally from the side wall and the final dosing inlet was located in the center of the reactor the reactor had four outlets for sampling 10 60 110 and 160 cm above the bottom which were all located on the side wall of the reactor the reactor packing was divided into gravel and induced crystallization particles the gravel was packed in the lower part of the induced crystallization particles the packing height of gravel was 5 cm and the packing height of induced crystallization particles was 50 cm the test device diagram is shown in fig 1 2 3 experimental method 2 3 1 induced crystallization softening process two devices were established to evaluate the softening performance of induced crystallization particles at two dosages 120 and 500 mg l separately the operating parameters in each device were set as up flow velocity 25 m h induced crystallization particles size 0 15 0 20 mm and quartz sand particles expansion rate 100 two sets of reactors were used for continuous operation for 15 days water and sand samples 500 ml and 15 ml respectively were taken out at 10 60 110 and 160 cm of the height of the reactor for twice a day water samples were evaluated to determine various parameters while sand samples were extracted to analyze particle size change 2 3 2 influencing factors the effectiveness of particle hardness removal was investigated under varying 1 dosages of softening agents 2 the up flow velocity and 3 the filling induced crystallization particle size firstly the dosage of softening agent was studied by setting 6 levels of softening agent dosage and using 6 sets of reactors to run synchronously secondly the up flow velocity was studied by setting 2 levels of softening agent dosage and 3 levels of rising flow rate using 6 sets of reactors to run simultaneously thirdly the filling induced crystallization particle size was studied by setting 2 levels of softening agent dosage and 4 levels of filling induced crystallization particle size using 8 sets of reactors to operate simultaneously in order to obtain more accurate data the reactor was operated continuously for 15 days under each test condition and samples were taken twice a day the specific operation parameters are shown in table 1 the sample analysis process was similar to that discussed in section 2 3 1 2 3 3 the properties of induced crystallization particles the 15 ml samples of the stratified particle used in the reactor with 500 mg l dosage of softening agents were obtained from fluidized bed height of 10 110 and 160 cm on 1st 5th and 12th day of the experiment and tested for characteristics of particles the collected samples were dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h and observed their morphology the sample collected on 5th day was selected to test the crystallization properties of particles 2 3 4 application of changing the up flow velocity the up flow velocity influence on induced crystallization particles water softening performance was tested using three reactor devices operating at three up flow velocity levels 8 25 and 50 m h separately the other operating parameters in each device was set as softening agent 120 mg l induced crystallization particle size 0 15 0 20 mm induced crystallization particles filling height 50 cm and quartz sand particles expansion rate 100 the reactor operating time sampling procedures and sample analysis process was similar to that discussed in section 2 3 1 2 3 5 influence of gradually increasing up flow velocity the initial up flow velocity 8 m h was gradually increased and tested to influence induced crystallization particles water softening performance for this a set of devices was established and the operating parameters in each device were set as softening agent 500 mg l crystallization particle size 0 15 0 20 mm and induced crystallization particles filling height 50 cm water and sand samples 500 ml and 15 ml respectively were taken out at 110 cm of the height of the reactor for twice a day and tested for effluent properties and variation in size respectively the sample analysis process was similar to that discussed in section 2 3 1 2 4 analytical method the chemical characterization of water samples was performed within 10 min of sampling while induced crystallization particles were placed in an oven after sampling and dried at 105 c for 24 h then tested for particle size analyses the total hardness and alkalinity of the water were determined by the chemical titration method 33 the ph value was analyzed using the glass electrode method pb 10 sartorius the average particle size of induced crystallization particles was determined by the standard sample separation and screening method the morphology and crystalline structure of a particle was determined by scanning electron microscopy sem nova nanosem npe218 fei and x ray diffraction xrd d8advance buker 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of water softening process in fig 2 a1 and b1 the influence of softening agent dosage on water hardness removal was studied while keeping other parameters constant at 120 mg l dosage level the particles removed water hardness for longer time but the removal rate remained irregular during the whole experimental duration with ongoing run time water hardness removal decreased steadily a similar irregular but higher removal of water hardness was obtained at a softening agent dosage of 500 mg l however the removal efficiency of the total hardness of water changed faster fig 2 b1 since a higher dose of softening agent causes retain system ph for a short time which accelerates the particles reach reaching critical size the resultant ratio of deactivated to active parties remained higher 34 35 consistent with water hardness removal trends the ph of the reactor also decreases with increasing running time at both dosage levels fig 2 a2 and b2 however at a higher dosage 500 mg l the ph changed faster than the total hardness removal efficiency of the reactor it can be perceived by comparing ph and water hardness trends that the water hardness removal rate was decreased with a decline in ph the ph of the reactor plays an important role in the calcium carbonate crystallization process and improves the water hardness removal process hereby decrease in reactor ph reduce the water hardness removal efficiency of the reactor 36 in fig 2 a3 and b3 the influence of softening agent dosages on alkalinity was studied at a 110 cm fluidized bed height while keeping other parameters constant as shown in fig 2 a3 the bicarbonate alkalinity of effluent rapidly increased from the 10th day and reached a raw water level after 2 weeks the changing trend in alkalinity with reaction time was the same as those found in ph and water hardness removal however at a higher dosage 500 mg l the alkalinity of the system became stable after the first week of the experiment in fig 2 a4 and b4 finally particle size tends to increase with experimental time and showed a similar increasing trend to those found in the other three factors i e water hardness removal ph alkalinity 3 2 factors affecting the effectiveness of induced crystallization particles 3 2 1 softening agent dosage in fig 3 a the influence of softening agents on induced crystallization particle performance was studied by changing the dosage of softening agents from 100 to 600 mg l while maintaining the same values for other parameters the samples were obtained from 110 cm fluidized bed height and test to determine the water hardness removal ph and particle size with an increase in residence time ph and water hardness removal efficiency of particles decreased while the size of particles increases 37 the falling of ph and removal efficiency showed similar decline speed at corresponding softening agent dosages it can be perceived from fig 3 a and b the increase in ph of the reactor is a function of the softening agent which in turn determines the water hardness removal 37 moreover the particle takes about 5 days to reach 0 9 mm in 600 mg l compared to 13 days at 100 mg l dosage of the softening agent fig 3 c this shows particles attain the critical size and lost efficiency more rapidly at high softening agent dosage than lower 3 2 2 up flow velocity the samples were obtained from 160 cm fluidized bed height and tested for up flow velocity influence on reactor performance at 120 and 500 mg l dosages of a softening agent while maintaining the same values for other parameters fig 4 results showed that the increase in up flow velocity reduces the system ph 38 negatively impacting the water hardness removal efficiency of the reactor and the increase in softening agent dosages further worsens fig 4a and b an increase in up flow velocity did not change the relationship between ph and water hardness removal i e a decline in ph decreased water hardness removal trend noticeably increase in up flow velocity from 8 to 25 m h has negligible effects up to 12 days at lower dosages while a further increase in up flow velocity from 25 to 50 m h remarkedly declines reactor performance increased up flow velocity from 25 to 50 m h shortens the affective duration of particles from 10 to 8 days but enhanced the quantity of treated water from 7 5 m3 to 12 1 m3 3 2 3 the filling induced crystallization particle size in fig 5 the influence of the induced crystallization particle size on reactor performance was studied using different sizes of induced crystallization particles the particle size impacts were studied at 120 and 500 mg l dosages of softening agent and the samples were obtained from 160 cm fluidized bed height while values for other parameters were kept constant the working lifetime of particles was found to be size dependent i e the size of particle shortened will be the hardening removal ability of particles 37 39 moreover discrepancies of reactor attributes i e water hardness removal a decline in ph and growth of particle size between different sized particles reduced with increased softening dosages so far induce crystallization particles showed promising effects in removing water hardness and alkalinity and contributed to maintaining ph and effective particle size in the reactor however with an increase in residence time the induced crystallization particles expand in size ph and water hardness removal efficiency of the system reduced hence to maintain the efficiency of the system the study of morphological changes in particle over time the working principle of induced crystallization softening reaction and the fluidized state of particles and the function of induced crystallization particles in removing water hardness could be of significant importance which are discussed in section 3 3 3 3 analysis of the role of induced crystallization particles in removing hardness 3 3 1 the physical properties of the induced crystallization particles it can be perceived from figs 6 and 2 b that the particle size gradually increased and reached a maximum size of 1 mm with ongoing run time morphological studies of particle showed the surface of particles which lose water hardness ability turned smooth and flat and tended to be spherical or ellipsoid in appearance in contrast those particles that did not remove hardness contained irregular surface projections with obvious edges and corners similar to those reported in the literature 37 the sem observation of induced crystallization particles from different angles showed protrusions and cavities on the surface of the particles at the initial adhesion stage offers binding site of a large specific surface area for the subsequent adhesion of the crystallization products once the particle reached its maturity the concave surface developed by protrusions and cavities disappeared basically during removing hardness the particles developed obvious surface protrusion and crystallization on the surface of the particles produced adhesion and agglomeration the crystallization products adhere continuously on the surface filling out the concave sites the surface layer of the induced crystallization particles presents smooth and flat spherical or ellipsoid and particles lose adhesion capacity 37 40 the xrd diffractogram fig 7 for the change in induce crystallization particles at the fluidized bed height of 160 cm suggested the peaks of induced crystallization particles and sio2 were parallel positioned at 26 636 after 5 days of the experiment moving to lower heights the characteristics peaks of sio2 reduced while peeks belong to induced crystallization particles were consistent with peaks of caco3 moreover the peaks of caco3 gradually inclined with the maturation of particles and the decline of their water hardness removal rate the sem micrographs fig 6 and xrd diffractogram fig 7 were jointly revealed the concentration of caco3 increased on the surface of particles that smoother the surface of particles with the passage of experimental time the smooth surface loses its reactivity and finely resulted in a decline in the water hardness removal process 37 3 3 2 the process of the induced crystallization softening reaction it is generally acknowledged that the induced crystallization softening mechanism is a combination of the chemical softening process and fluidized bed induced crystallization process 41 induce crystallization particles mixed with raw water in reactor where caco3 adheres on the surface of particles and removed by precipitation the mechanism can be divided into three phases 1 introduction and mixing of softening agent with raw water in the reactor 2 the alkali solution reacts with bicarbonate ions to form carbonate ions as shown in eq 1 3 carbonate ions react with calcium ions to form calcium carbonate precipitates as shown in eq 2 1 hc o 3 o h c o 3 2 h 2 o 2 c a 2 c o 3 2 cac o 3 in the first phase of the fluidized bed induced crystallization softening technology the mixing of the agent and the raw water depends on the collision of the induced crystallization particles in the fluidized state 21 the turbulent flow enhanced collision and facilitated faster and full mixing of softening agents with raw water where the mixing process developed precipitation in the reactor 34 35 thus the turbulent flow in the reactor directly affects the mixing rate of the softening agent and the raw water it is evident that a decline in the softening reaction rate reduces the water hardness removal efficiency and ph of the reactor so in the present experiment the first phase mixing of agents was blocked which inhibit the fully mixing of softening agents with raw water since ph is synchronous with the increase of particle size it can be further inferred that the uneven mixing of agents and the decrease of ph due to particle growth eventually lead to the stop of softening reaction and reduced the total hardness removal efficiency 39 3 3 3 the fluidized state of the particles in the reactor the fluids reynolds number is known as an excellent marker of fluid turbulence intensity 39 therefore the ratio of the actual reynolds number of the fluidized bed to the critical reynolds number of the particles was calculated to explained the degree of fluidization of the particles and clarified the diffusion mechanism of the softening agent the actual reynolds number ref and the critical reynolds number rep of the fluidized bed can be calculated by using eqs 3 and 4 3 re f d p u ρ g μ 4 re p d p u mf ρ g μ 5 u mf d p 2 ρ p ρ g g 1650 μ where dp is the particle diameter m u is the empty bed velocity m s umf is the critical fluidization velocity m s ρp is the particle density kg m3 ρg is the fluid density kg m3 μ is the hydrodynamic viscosity n s m 2 combining fig 2 and fig 8 a b it can be seen that when the induced crystallization particle size increases the ref rep of the layer will rapidly decrease from 35 to below 1 at the same time the total hardness of the water sample in the layer will rise and the ph will drop and the total hardness will be lost ability the actual reynolds number of the failed particle layer is not enough to meet the critical reynolds number of the particles and the fluidization state stops 42 therefore it can be assumed that the layer of particles grown to critical particle size resides in a non fluidization state subsequently when the fluid flows through the particle layer the fluid will be in the transition zone reducing mixing efficiency resultantly the blockage of softening agent diffusion reduced the water hardness treatment efficiency of particles as shown in fig 8 c with the extension of the operating time the bed expansion rate in the fluidized bed induced crystallization softening reactor decreased rapidly and after increasing the dosage of the softening agent the rate of decrease of the bed expansion rate increases this phenomenon can further verify that when the induced crystallization particle size increases the bed expansion rate decreases the particle fluidization degree decreases and the removal ability of the total hardness is lost 3 3 4 operation mechanism of inducing crystallization particles on hardness removal efficiency in the crystallization softening process the induced crystallization particles worked as crystallization carriers keeping the caco3 precipitation in sediments and facilitating softening response by accelerating the diffusion of softening agents in turbulent flow 19 however with increasing residence time the induced crystallization particles gradually grow in size leading to the uneven mixing of softening agents and a decline in the turbulence intensity of particles in the reactor our results agree with kramer et al 37 who also found smaller size partial and low up flow velocity are among the most critical factors for a successful water softening process subsequently uneven mixing of softening agents reduced the ph of the system and finally hindered the first step of the softening reaction the addition of softening agent and the size of inducing particle used in reactor determine the time of particles to reach the critical particle size while the up flow velocity of particles affects the critical fluidization velocity 38 3 4 practical implications induce crystallization particles mixing and diffusion of softening agents affect water hardness removal while the turbulent state of particles determines mixing the softening agents adjusting the design of the induce crystallization particles softening process and where it is applied in the water softening train would affect induce crystallization particle characteristics and the overall water treatment process 36 the working life of induced crystallization particles can increase by increasing fluid up flow velocity increasing the up flow velocity speed up the time particles take to reached critical size and lose the water hardness removal effectiveness which can be a disadvantage for the water softening process fig 9 a b and c however the actual water amount processed by the induced crystallization particles per unit volume increased fig 9 d which can be favorable from an operational point of view 22 40 besides an increase in flow rate could also drain out the smaller sized particles from the reactor with water flow therefore operation mode with a variable flow rate can promise improved utilization efficiency of induced crystallization particles similarly an increase in the degree of turbulence of particles and ref rep as a function of increased up flow velocity can recharge those particles that lose their water hardness removal capacity at regular up flow velocity and increased working life of particles fig 10 therefore the up flow velocity can be increased step by step in the actual operation process to ensure that the particles always have hard removal efficiency overall the proposed optimal design of the induce crystals particles softening process offers the following advantages 1 it can effectively maintain long time particle size 2 it can prolong the service time of inducted particles 3 it can enhance the adhesive amount of calcium carbonate 4 improved the proportion and purity of calcium carbonate in the waste residue 5 facilitate the operation and maintenance of reactor and 6 can provide a prerequisite guarantee of safer disposal of the waste residue 4 conclusion the induced crystallization particle characteristics and the factors affecting performance including softening agent dosage up flow velocity and filling induced crystallization particles were evaluated the water hardness removal performance of particles varied with residence time ph particles size up flow velocity and it was concluded that the results of particle characterization and reynolds number calculation of present pilot scale study suggest that the induced crystallization particles in a fluidized state facilitate the first step of the softening reaction by improving the diffusion rate of the softening agent thus particles in a fluidized state are mandatory for the water hardness removal process which otherwise unable to carry out the diffusion of the softening agent in the reactor the dosage of softening agents degree of softening the up flow velocity and the size of the inducted inducing particles directly affect the effective working life of the inducing particles the up flow velocity determines the critical particle size of the maximum particle that can be pushed under the corresponding flow rate while the degree of softening and the filling particle size of the inducing particles determine the time when the particles reach the critical particle size the hardness removal ability of induced crystallization particles showed an irregular decreasing trend with service time however the reactor efficiency can be optimized by changing the operation parameters resultantly improved water hardness removal potential enhanced the water amount and efficiency of induced crystallization particles optimized the sand discharge cycle and improved the purity of waste residue thus providing theoretical support for the subsequent management and operation of the system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
