16415,most reservoirs in subtropical areas experience periodic variations in the thermal structure of their water columns with times of strong thermal stratification being succeeded by periods of mixing over the course of the year understanding of the transport and transformation of dissolved inorganic carbon over such thermal cycles in artificial reservoirs remains poor to address this problem this study examined the spatiotemporal behavior of dissolved inorganic carbon dic the partial pressure of co2 pco2 carbon isotope ratios δ13cdic and co2 emission fco2 from 2014 to 2018 in a subtropical groundwater fed reservoir in southern china it was found that co2 emissions during mixing periods are much higher than in thermally stratified periods particularly during transition from stratified to mixing as a result of upwelling and release of dissolved co2 co2aq accumulated in the hypolimnion co2 emission fluxes at the water gas interface accounted for only a small proportion of the dic in the reservoir the relationships between of dic and δ13cdic displayed two distinct modes due to spatial differences in water depths and to strong thermal stratification during warmer seasons 1 dic concentrations increase and δ13cdic values decrease from epilimnion to hypolimnion and 2 δ13cdic values decrease with increasing dic concentrations but δ13cdic is progressively enriched near the bottom during periods of thermal stratification in addition this study found three distinct processes of dic accumulation and consumption in the reservoir 1 dic accumulated in the hypolimnion during thermal stratification periods due to carbon retention but 2 dic was substantially consumed in the epilimnion during such periods and 3 average dic concentrations and pco2 increased significantly from upstream to downstream along the reservoir while average δ13cdic values became lighter these results highlight that carbon behavior in groundwater fed reservoirs is often controlled by a combination of biogeochemical processes and seasonal variations in thermal structure sampling and monitoring strategies should consider these factors in order to accurately estimate carbon budgets in reservoirs

fed reservoir south china 1 introduction balancing carbon budgets is very important when studying regional carbon cycling processes and establishing carbon neutrality targets inland waters lakes reservoirs creeks rivers etc play a key role in carbon transport storage and inner transformation cole et al 1994 reservoirs are now very common in many regions of the world and have become an important somewhat different type of lake wen et al 2008 according to the 2018 national statistics bulletin of water development there were 98 822 reservoirs in china that year most being located in the provinces of yunnan guizhou and guangxi where the total storage capacity of 8953 billion m3 http www mwr gov cn sj was located chiefly in typical karst areas such as the wujiang hongshui and panjiang river basins the effect of damming on the carbon cycle has attracted much attention from the scientific and wider communities myrbo and shapley 2006 rudd et al 1993 when a river is intercepted flow rates become slower and water residence times increase permitting internal biological processes to become key controlling factors in the carbon biogeochemical cycle especially during warm seasons han et al 2018 for example dic in reservoirs displays significant diurnal seasonal and annual variations due to phytoplankton growth and metabolism peng et al 2014 li et al 2019 dam construction extends water surface areas regulating their greenhouse gas ghgs emissions via gas diffusion and or ebullition bubbling raymond et al 2013 rudd et al 1993 additionally thermal structural variations in reservoirs caused by seasonal air temperature fluctuations also change the carbon cycle mode which differs from conditions applying in free flowing rivers myrbo and shapley 2006 wen et al 2008 park and chung 2018 wang et al 2019b dissolved inorganic carbon dic largely as dissolved carbon dioxide and bicarbonate is one of the important constituents in natural freshwater systems serving as the foundation for organic productivity wetzel 2001 dic constituents may control water quality properties such as acidity hardness and related other characteristics bellanger et al 2004 talling 2006 in addition the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in water is an important control factor for co2 exchanges between atmosphere and water many studies suggest that pco2 in the surface water layer in most lakes worldwide 87 are supersaturated with respect to the ambient air cole et al 1994 creating a positive co2 gradient into atmosphere thus it is essential that the rudiments of dic reactivity be evaluated in freshwater systems myrbo and shapley 2006 qin et al 2019 wang et al 2019b 2021a it is well known that the dic concentration in rivers draining karst areas is significantly higher than that in non karst areas due to the dissolution of carbonate rocks wang et al 2019b pu et al 2020 wang et al al 2021b thousands of reservoirs have been built in karst areas for water supply flood control and hydroelectric power since 1900s milanović 2011 dic loading is an important determinant of co2 fluxes across the air water interface invers et al 2001 mcdonald et al 2013 wang et al 2019b liu and han 2021 2021a endogenous organic carbon formation wang et al 2021b yi et al 2021 and carbon burial wang et al 2019a b maavara et al 2020 in the majority reservoirs numerous researchers have studied carbon transformation processes in karst reservoirs e g myrbo and shapley 2006 peng et al 2014 han et al 2018 wang et al 2019a b maavara et al 2020 however reservoirs have two principal recharge mode of water surface channel flows in rivers and creeks surface fed reservoirs and groundwaters groundwater fed reservoirs the latter has received little attention while its hydrochemical characteristics may be very different lupon et al 2019 many studies have shown that groundwaters contain larger amounts of carbon containing gasses co2 and ch4 plus dic and doc originating from soils which leads to supersaturation of dissolved co2 worrall and lancaster 2005 jahangir et al 2012 khadka et al 2014 chmiel et al 2015 lupon et al 2019 in contrast surface waters have comparatively lower c containing gasses or equilibrium with the atmosphere before entering the reservoir marcé et al 2015 thus if a reservoir is recharged predominantly by groundwater its carbon cycle will show distinctly different characteristics than that of a surface water fed reservoir notably flowing surface water is often rare in karst areas but groundwater is abundant despite increased awareness the complex internal transformations of carbon in dic rich groundwater fed reservoirs is still not fully understood previous studies have shown that varying thermal structure controls the dynamics of co2 emissions pu et al 2020 but data on the interactions among physical chemical and biological processes in the water column are still lacking this study presents a database from 90 vertical profiles taken over 30 different months between july 2014 and december 2018 a total of 535 samples in a groundwater fed reservoir in south china it improves understanding of the seasonal vertical and spatial variations and controlling mechanisms of the dic system the results emphasize the need to understand the distinct mechanisms of dic cycling in groundwater fed reservoir systems and will be conducive to balancing regional carbon budgets 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the dalongdong dld reservoir 23 30 01 23 40 08 n 108 30 02 108 36 04 e fig 1 a it is a typical

dic concentration pco2 δ13cdic and fco2 are presented in fig 2 all four parameters showed significant variations along the line of flow dic concentrations were in the range 67 37 368 90 mg l 1 with the maximum and the minimum values both being found at d3 site during the monitoring period 2014 2018 the average concentration of dic increased significantly from upstream 207 48 59 88 mg l 1 at d1 to downstream 233 46 57 56 mg l 1 at d3 fig 2a this trend was also observed in pco2 and fco2 fig 2b d average pco2 and fco2 increased from d1 pco2 6176 17 6013 21 μatm fco2 34 61 65 65 mg m 2 h 1 to downstream d3 pco2 7519 39 6612 96 μatm fco2 85 32 250 93 mg m 2 h 1 in contrast the average δ13cdic turned significantly negative from upstream 9 5 3 2 at d1 to downstream 10 8 2 6 at d3 fig 2c 3 2 stratification characteristics of the dld reservoir 3 2 1 thermal stratification the ssi depth of the thermocline and rtrm of the dld reservoir are shown in figs 3 and 4 which intuitively reveal obvious thermal stratification and mixing patterns as seen in fig 3a the average ssi of all the three sites d1 d2 d3 is 244 45 197 81 kg m m 2 with a range from 24 45 to 664 99 kg m m 2 the higher ssi values always occurred between april and november and lower values from december to the following march indicating that the stratification was strongly seasonal the dld reservoir belongs to the warm monomictic class of lakes boehrer and schultze 2008 li et al 2019 peak ssi values always occurred in july and august indicating that the reservoir has strongest thermal stratification then negative ssi values always occurred in december january and february indicating that this was the chief mixing period some hydrochemical parameters ph do spc eh and chla also showed corresponding seasonal variation fig 5 with the exception of site d3 in november and october 2018 the depth of the thermocline generally ranged between 1 50 to 7 50 m being mostly 2 50 5 00 m below the water surface however there was no obvious seasonal variation in thermocline depth fig 3 this behavior was also evident in the profiles of the local stratified strength indicator rtrm fig 4 the average rtrm was 27 29 15 61 with a range from 7 08 to 166 05 the higher rtrm values always occurred at 2 5 5 0 m below the water surface during the well stratified period imberger and patterson 1990 thus we define 0 2 50 m depth as the epilimnion 2 50 7 50 m as the thermocline and depth 7 50 m as the hypolimnion in this reservoir based on the characteristics of the ssi depth of the thermocline and the rtrm the period from mid march to mid november is defined as the period of stable thermal stratification and the others as mixing periods 3 2 2 water quality stratification all water quality parameters showed significant spatiotemporal variations in the dld reservoir in the vertical profiles the ph do and chla values decreased with water depth figs 5b c and f but spc values increased with depth during the thermal stratification period fig 5d the vertical profile of eh values was distinctive rising to an obvious maximum near the upper edge of the hypolimnion before suddenly became negative near the bottom fig 5e strong vertical gradients in ph sometimes exceeding two units were evident during the thermal stratification period fig 5b do depletion appeared in and below the thermocline region during the stratification period and throughout the entire water column during the mixing period interestingly some do values rose slightly to maxima in the thermocline during the thermal stratification period before declining with increasing depth fig 5c anoxic conditions do 15 bellanger et al 2004 encinas fernández et al 2014 were observed in the hypolimnion every month during the stratification period the water chemical parameters showed weaker variation in the water column during the mixing period 3 2 3 dic parameter stratification throughout the study period the dic parameters in the reservoir including dic concentrations pco2 δ13cdic and sic all displayed clear vertical variations fig 6 during the stratified period dic concentration and pco2 generally increases with depth being much higher in the hypolimnion than in the epilimnion maximum pco2 differences between bottom and surface water can reach 36 640 66 µatm in the mixing period dic concentration and pco2 profiles showed few differences throughout the water column fig 6a and 6b in addition it is worth noting the proportion of dic species also showed significant seasonal and vertical spatial variations in the reservoir hco3 concentrations were highly variable ranging from 67 37 mg l 1 to 354 54 mg l 1 with a mean of 221 38 58 89 mg l 1 and accounting for 78 71 98 05 of the dic species co2aq concentrations had yet higher variability from 0 07 mg l 1 to 67 32 mg l 1 with a mean of 18 80 14 57 mg l 1 and accounting for 0 12 27 33 of the dic species the co3 2 concentrations were the least 0 09 mg l 1 to 5 76 mg l 1 and accounting for 0 03 8 55 of dic species in the thermal stratification period the concentration of hco3 and co2aq generally increased with water depth while the concentration of co3 2 generally decreased however the proportion of hco3 in the dic species generally decreased with water depth while that of co2aq generally increased fig 7 during the mixing period the proportions of hco3 and co2aq were 90 89 96 19 and 3 54 9 16 respectively displaying relatively stable characteristics throughout the water column fig 7 the δ13cdic and sic values showed differing variations with dic concentrations figs 6c and 6d overall there were decreasing trends in δ13cdic and sic with increasing depth during the stratified period however there were two slightly different modes in vertical distribution of δ13cdic during this period in mode one δ13cdic values continuously decrease with depth e g sampling dates 2016 4 7 2017 8 31 2017 10 27 and 2018 11 6 in mode two δ13cdic values first decrease with depth but increase again at bottom e g sampling dates 2014 7 12 2018 8 18 and 2016 8 17 in the mixing period the δ13cdic values displayed smaller differences throughout the vertical profile fig 6c sic values ranged from 0 60 to 1 26 with a mean of 0 35 0 33 most of them 86 94 were greater than zero indicating that the majority of water samples taken in the reservoir were saturated with calcite for most of the study period fig 6d 3 3 seasonal characteristics of the dic parameters a dic heat map not only shows the vertical variations of dic but also seasonal variations occurring at a given water depth the dic concentration and pco2 in the epilimnion 0 5 m were lower in the thermal stratification period than in the mixing period while sic and δ13cdic were higher this is in contrast to behavior in the thermocline and hypolimnion fig 6 pco2 values in the surface layer water were often undersaturated relative to the atmosphere during the stratified period which led to direct atmospheric co2 loss into the reservoir contributing to co2 sequestration in contrast pco2 values in the surface layer were all supersaturated relative to the atmosphere during the mixing period leading to rapid degassing fig 8 e shows the significant differences in co2 evasive fluxes between the thermal stratified and mixing periods anova p 0 05 with lower average values 15 39 49 43 mg m 2 h 1 in the stratified period and higher 153 61 213 43 mg m 2 h 1 in the mixing period notably there were some negative values of co2 flux during the stratified period indicating that surface waters can absorb atmospheric co2 extremely high co2 evasive fluxes can be found in november when there is the transition from thermal stratification to mixing conditions which is consistent with pco2 spikes observed in the epilimnion figs 8b and 8e integrating all vertical profile data from the three sites this study found that the monthly dic and pco2 means also exhibited pronounced monthly variations anova p 0 05 fig 8 monthly mean dic and pco2 in winter and spring were lower than in summer and autumn figs 8a and 8b in contrast to the mean monthly δ13cdic and sic values fig 8c and 8d interestingly there has been a slight increase in the mean monthly dic and pco2 values during the stratification period in which their two peaks almost correspond to the peaks in thermal stratification intensity ssi fig 3 these results suggest that the accumulation and consumption of dic in the dld reservoir are closely related to the changes in thermal structure 4 discussion 4 1 processes and patterns of co2 evasion in many karst regions of the world dissolved co2 in karst water is typically supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere because of high concentrations of soil co2 cause abundant dissolution of the carbonate rocks kessler and harvey 2001 drysdale et al 2002 pu et al 2017 much recent work has shown that there is generally significant co2 degassing when karst groundwaters emerge at the surface or discharge into stream channels determining the sources and patterns of degassing from these flowing waters drysdale et al 2002 schelker et al 2016 pu et al 2017 wang et al 2021b due to the high pco2 gradient between water and the open atmosphere aqueous co2 can easily escape into the air short distances from the groundwater discharge points particularly in reaches with abrupt changes in streambed morphology such as cascades or waterfalls herman and lorah 1987 hoffer french and herman 1989 drysdale et al 2002 pu et al 2017 wang et al 2021b the results of this study showed that the co2 evasion fluxes of the dld reservoir mean 34 61 65 65 mg m 2 h 1 upstream 50 63 113 36 mg m 2 h 1 midstream and 85 32 250 93 mg m 2 h 1 downstream were much less than those of some other groundwater fed streams that have been studied intensively e g 1801 mg m 2 h 1 at the springs and 458 mg m 2 h 1 1 3 km downstream in guancun streams pu et al 2017 surface fed karst reservoirs e g ranging from 16 50 to 4160 38 mg m 2 h 1 with an average of 476 85 mg m 2 h 1 in eight karst reservoirs on the wujiang river wang et al 2021a and large karst river reservoirs e g ranging from 70 77 to 2896 30 mg m 2 h 1 with an average of 1053 8 mg m 2 h 1 in xijiang wujiang river liu and han 2021 concurrently we were surprised to find that there was no large co2 evasion across the water air interface near the groundwater discharge outlet instead co2 evasion tends to increase along the direction of flow in the reservoir fig 2d co2 evasion at the water air interface in the dld reservoir was not controlled by groundwater inflows as it is in other groundwater fed streams or rivers many studies have shown that when groundwater emerges pco2 in the river or stream will seek to rapidly equilibrate with the atmospheric partial pressure through co2 degassing a process which is enhanced by hydrological agitation hoffer french and herman 1989 drysdale et al 2002 wang et al 2021b however groundwater discharging into the bottom of a reservoir is in a different situation reservoirs are deeper than rivers or streams so the groundwater will not degas co2 due to a sudden drop in pressure the average water depth at the upstream part of the dld reservoir is 6 0 m which is 1 58 higher pressure than in the atmosphere above restraining the physical degassing in addition the velocity of flow is much less than in rivers or streams reducing degassing due to hydrological agitation most reservoirs display thermal stratification which can limit co2 emission by preventing upward mixing of water and nutrients in the deeper water column elçi 2008 pu et al 2020 in addition phytoplankton photosynthesis in the epilimnion during the thermal stratification period can assimilate inorganic carbon fig 6a and restrain co2 emission fig 8e however over the whole water column there was accumulation of dic during the thermal stratification period because co2aq was continuously increasing in the hypolimnion due to the thermal stratification barrier respiration and degradation of organic material figs 7 and 8a park and chung 2018 previous studies have demonstrated that turnover events during the mixing period can stimulate large amounts of co2 emission elçi 2008 park and chung 2018 pu et al 2020 the results of this study confirms that co2 emissions during the mixing period are much higher than in the stratification period especially during the transition from stratified to mixed columns fig 8e due to the hypolimnion co2aq accumulation over the thermal stratification period 4 2 modes of water column δ13cdic variability according to plots of δ13cdic values vs concentrations myrbo and shapley 2006 the vertical distribution behavior of the values in a reservoir can be divided into three groups 1 δ13cdic values are higher and dic concentrations are lower in the epilimnion than in the hypolimnion mode a 2 the epilimnion has lower δ13cdic and dic concentrations than the hypolimnion mode b and 3 dic concentrations increase from the epilimnion to hypolimnion while the δ13cdic values first decrease but then increase if when the dic concentration is 300 mg l 1 mode c myrbo and shapley 2006 as shown in fig 9 δ13cdic values at the d1 site fig 9a belong to mode a but at the midstream d2 fig 9b and downstream d3 fig 9c sites they place in mode c in fig 9 dic concentrations and δ13cdic values display statistically significant negative correlations most in the hypolimnion fall in bottom right corner with high dic concentrations and low δ13cdic this phenomenon can be explained by three factors 1 solar illumination water temperature and phytoplankton density generally decrease with depth resulting in less dic consumption due to the gradually weakening photosynthesis 2 there is continuous anaerobic degradation of organic matter in the hypolimnion as evidenced by previous findings that doc concentrations decrease with depth huang et al 2018 resulting in a proportional dic increase and δ13cdic decrease bellanger et al 2004 myrbo and shapley 2006 and 3 the dld reservoir is recharged from its bottom by karst groundwater with high dic content and depleted δ13cdic which is conducive to dic accumulation in particular during the thermal stratification period water exchanges between the hypolimnion and epilimnion in the reservoir were poor resulting in storage of δ13cdic depleted dic in the hypolimnion mode a is the textbook mode of lacustrine water column dic behavior being dominated by photosynthesis and decomposition myrbo and shapley 2006 in the fig 9 most data from the epilimnion plot top left with lower dic concentrations and higher δ13cdic values this phenomenon can be explained by 1 photosynthesis of phytoplankton taking up aqueous dic in the epilimnion resulting in decreased dic photosynthesis can increase the proportion of aqueous 13c because of preferential utilization of 12c szaran 1998 smyntek et al 2012 mcdonald et al 2013 wang et al 2019b 2 co2 degassing can decrease dic concentrations but enrich the δ13cdic component because the lighter 12c is more volatile grootes et al 1969 doctor et al 2008 it is worth noting that co2 exchanges at the water air interface in the dld reservoir included both absorption and emissions during the thermal stratification periods absorption of atmospheric co2 can increase dic concentrations and enrich δ13cdic grootes et al 1969 mook et al 1974 however as mentioned above dic concentration in the surface water was still low in enriched 13c fig 6a and 6c during the thermal stratification periods indicating that co2 absorption did not offset dic consumption by phytoplankton photosynthesis in the epilimnion and 3 natural precipitation falling into the reservoir water can also dilute dic concentrations resulting in δ13cdic increases pu et al 2018 the difference between mode a and mode c is that δ13cdic values near the bottom become progressively higher in the latter during the thermal stratification period fig 9 this appears to be due to by remineralization of organic matter which is evidently accompanied by carbonate dissolution and or methanogenesis occurring at rates high enough to provide a net positive δ13cdic trend with the increasing dic concentrations myrbo and shapley 2006 the impact of remineralization of organic matter will be analyzed in detail in sections 4 3 and 4 4 δ13cdic in lakes or reservoirs is an important ecological and paleoenvironmental proxy although further conceptual modes of dic and δ13cdic evolution and distribution have been described in other lakes our new findings emphasize that different conceptual modes of dic and δ13cdic may co exist in the same reservoir due to differing depths of water and thermal stratification effects 4 3 the relative importance of the processes affecting dic accumulation and consumption the statistically significant spatial variations of dic parameters reported in this study show that processes of dic accumulation and consumption in the dld reservoir display some obvious regularities first dic accumulates during the periods of thermal stratification due to carbon retention below the epilimnion and decreases during mixing periods due to abundant co2 release fig 8 second in the vertical profiles during stratification periods dic was clearly accumulated in the hypolimnion and consumed in the epilimnion fig 6 third the average dic concentration and pco2 increased significantly from upstream to downstream figs 2a and 2b but average δ13cdic values became significantly negative fig 2d these phenomena were often caused by a combination of biogeochemical and physical processes including 1 co2 exchange across the water air interface 2 phytoplankton photosynthesis 3 respiration and degradation of organic material and 4 dissolution and precipitation of calcium carbonate myrbo and shapley 2006 park and chung 2018 pu et al 2018 wang et al 2021b in this section we attempt to evaluate the relative importance of these biogeochemical and physical processes previous studies have shown that the relative importance of co2 exchange fluxes mainly depends on the size of the c reserves in the dic in the surface water layer herczeg 1987 stiller and kirshenbaum 1999 here dic concentration and co2 exchange flux were used to calculate c reserves t c in the epilimnion 0 2 5 m eq 3 and the daily c emission t c at the water air interface eq 4 3 c 1 dic h s m c f 1 f 2 m dic 4 c 2 fc o 2 s m c f 3 f 2 m co 2 where c1 is the c reserve t c in the epilimnion dic is dic concentration mg l 1 h is the thickness of the epilimnion 2 5 m s is the average surface area of the dld reservoir 8 79 106 m2 mc is molecular weight of c 12 g mol 1 mdic is molecular weight of hco3 61 g mol 1 f1 is the transformation coefficient between l and m3 1000 f2 is the transformation coefficient between mg and t 1 t 109 mg c2 is daily c emission flux t c at water air interface fco2 is co2 flux mg m 2 h 1 f3 is the transformation coefficient between hour and day 24 and mco2 is the molecular weight of co2 44 g mol 1 the results of this study showed that average daily c emissions 0 089 t c in the reservoir during the stratification periods were only 0 14 of the total inorganic carbon 62 15 t c in the epilimnion during the mixing periods the average daily c emissions 0 88 t c were 0 95 of total dic 92 96 t in the epilimnion table 1 thus this study found that co2 emission fluxes at the water gas interface in the reservoir accounted for only a small proportion of the dissolved inorganic carbon content no matter whether in the stratification periods or the mixing periods this suggests that the contribution of co2 exchanges to the accumulation or consumption of dic in the dld reservoir is secondary after eliminating any dominating role for the co2 exchange flux the remaining physical processes dissolution and precipitation of calcium carbonate and biological processes photosynthesis respiration and degradation of organic materials should be the cause of dic changes measured in the dld reservoir similar to other karst reservoirs wang et al 2021a the average ca2 concentration in dld reservoir increased ca2 by 83 23 0 25 mmol l 1 to 1 73 mmol l 1 from epilimnion to hypolimnion during the stratification periods fig 10 proving that carbonate dissolution occurs in the hypolimnion of dld reservoir however the values of dic mmol l 1 versus ca2 mmol l 1 in dld reservoir during stratification periods ranged from 1 93 to 7 58 with a mean of 3 01 which is much higher than the theoretical value 2 of carbonate dissolution fig 10 this proved that the dissolution of carbonate was an important process in the hypolimnion but not the dominant factor in dic accumulation in the hypolimnion moreover fig 6d shows that the sic values ranged only from 0 60 to 1 26 mean value 0 35 0 33 which does not allow for large amounts of carbonate being precipitated the relative importance of the physical and biologic processes can be also judged by their fractionation coefficients gu et al 2004 showed that the fractionation between dic and caco3 is less than that between dic co2 or hco3 and organic matter about 3 for diccaco3 vs 20 for dic om this means that 1 mol organic carbon decomposition can offset the effect of the precipitation of 6 7 mol carbonate in the dic pool myrbo and shapley 2006 therefore the results of this study imply that the contribution of caco3 dissolution and or precipitation in situ to dic accumulation or consumption processes in the dld reservoir are inconsequential during the stratification periods there was a significant negative relationship between do and dic concentration r 2 0 58 p 0 001 and a significant positive relationship between do and δ13cdic r 2 0 58 p 0 001 figs 11 a and 11b however these relationships were not statistically significant in the mixing periods figs 11c and 11d these findings indicate that seasonal variations in the thermal structure and biogeochemical processes photosynthesis respiration and degradation of organic matter in the water column are the dominant controls of the accumulation or consumption of dic and the kinetic carbon isotope fractionation in the remaining dic the water column dic and δ13cdic distributions were dominated by photosynthesis of phytoplankton and decomposition of organic materials through preferential uptake of 12c from the epilimnion and its release in the hypolimnion myrbo and shapley 2006 4 4 assessing the effect of redox environment on degradation of organic matter in the hypolimnion previous studies wang et al 2019b pu et al 2020 and our analyses in 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 above all showed that co2 emissions during the mixing periods are much higher than those in the thermal stratified periods especially at the transitional stage fig 8e when there is discharge of the co2aq accumulated in the hypolimnion during thermal stratification however the organic carbon decomposition processes in redox systems are significantly different in the hypolimnion fig 9 due to the thermal stratification the hypolimnion in a reservoir is effectively separated from the atmosphere boehrer and schultze 2008 qin et al 2019 wang et al 2019b since the contribution of dissolution and or precipitation of carbonate calcium to the dic accumulation and consumption processes in the dld reservoir were inconsequential we suppose that dic in the hypolimnion can be regarded as a mixture of that existed at the beginning of a stratification period and that produced by the decomposition of organic matter in the hypolimnion and underlying sediments during that period using the δ13c values of co2 produced by decomposition miyajima et al 1997 the ratio of dic produced in anoxic reduction conditions do 15 eh 0 to that in oxidizing conditions do 15 eh 0 can be calculated using a mass balance model setting dic concentration and δ13cdic in the hypolimnion at the beginning of a stratification period as dic i and δ13c i the dic concentration and δ13cdic at a selected point in the stratification period are respectively set as dic j and δ13c j and dic and δ13cdic produced by organic respiration after the beginning of stratification as dic r and δ13c r the relationship between these variables can be expressed as miyajima et al 1997 6 dic j dic i dic r 7 δ 13 c j dic i δ 13 c i dic r δ 13 c r dic i dic r if δ13c r is assumed to be a fixed value dic r can be eliminated and eq 6 re expressed as 8 δ 13 c j δ 13 c r dic i δ 13 c i δ 13 c r dic j by convention the relationship δ13cdic vs 1 dic is used to make a keeling plot to obtain a regression equation in which the intercept represents the δ13c r value of dic generated by organic decomposition miyajima et al 1997 the dld data for oxidizing and reducing environments differ greatly on keeling plots figs 12 this is in agreement with the modes of δ13cdic variation in the water columns fig 9 due to greater water depths and thermal stratification strength at the midstream site d2 and downstream site d3 hypoxic to anoxic reduction conditions are found near the bottoms there do 15 eh 0 bellanger et al 2004 encinas fernández et al 2014 during stratification average δ13c r values in the hypolimnion at d2 and d3 were 6 51 and 6 64 respectively table 2 because anaerobic respiration produces 13c rich co2 bellanger et al 2004 in oxidizing conditions do 15 eh 0 bellanger et al 2004 the average δ13c r values of the hypolimnion in the three monitoring sites ranged from 21 56 to 20 38 in the order d1 site d2 site d3 site table 2 analysis of our monitoring data for dic concentration and δ13cdic in the hypolimnion at the beginning of the stratification periods dic i δ13c i and the average during stratification dic j δ13c j are shown in table 2 if the δ13cdic produced in reducing conditions is set as δ13c red and in oxidizing conditions as δ13c oxi the isotope mixing model based on mass balance equations can be expressed as huang et al 2018 9 δ 13 c j f 1 δ 13 c i f 2 δ 13 c o x i f 2 δ 13 c r e d 10 f 1 f 2 f 3 1 11 f 1 dic i dic j where f 1 is the proportion of dic in the hypolimnion at the beginning of stratification f 2 is the proportion of dic produced in oxidizing conditions f 3 is the proportion of dic produced in reducing conditions although the upstream d1 site has a low depth mean of 9 80 m it also formed stable thermal stratification like d2 mean of 12 34 m and d3 mean of 15 18 m during stratification periods figs 3 and 4 therefore organic matter decomposition also occurred in the hypolimnion at d1 site the results of this mixing model determined that 30 63 33 58 of dic in the stratified hypolimnion in the dld were produced by organic respiration after stratification began table 2 however in the upstream site d1 because of the shallow water and lack of reducing conditions do 15 eh 0 there was no anoxic dic table 2 in contrast 6 68 and 6 78 of dic in the hypolimnion in midstream site d2 and downstream site d3 respectively were produced by respiration of organic matter in reducing conditions do 15 eh 0 during stratification periods table 2 these results indicate that the thermal structure and water depth influence organic degradation in the hypolimnion thereby controlling the distribution transport and transformation of dic in a karst reservoir 5 conclusions this study has demonstrated that reservoirs in karst terrains are generally rich in dic and provide well defined natural systems to study aquatic carbon behavior our results provide more evidences that groundwater recharge modes variations of thermal structure and biogeochemical processes photosynthesis respiration and degradation of organic matter control dic transport and transformation processes in reservoirs such as the dld our data emphasize that co2 emission processes and patterns in a groundwater fed reservoir are very different from those in streams or rivers also recharged by groundwater in summary the following processes and patterns of co2 emission are typical in a groundwater fed reservoir 1 damming reservoir restrains natural co2 degassing after groundwater emergence in the reservoir bottom 2 thermal stratification above the bottom determines the direction and flux of co2 at the water gas interface and 3 in autumn and winter co2 degassing increases explosively primarily controlled by the physical process of reservoir overturning water column dic and δ13cdic distributions appear to be dominated by phytoplankton photosynthesis in the epilimnion and by decomposition of organic materials in the hypolimnion during periods of thermal stratification in contrast during mixing periods dic produced by decomposition of organic matter in the hypolimnion and underlying sediments during thermally stratified conditions will be transferred to the surface during mixing periods increasing co2 degassing daily emissions of dic sourced carbon in the dld reservoir during stratification periods is only 0 14 of that stored as dic in the epilimnion and daily c emissions during mixing periods is 0 95 of the storage suggesting that the contribution of co2 exchange to processes of dic accumulation or consumption in the reservoir are secondary the results of this study indicate that seasonal variations in the thermal structure of the water column and biogeochemical processes photosynthesis respiration degradation of organic matter

16415,most reservoirs in subtropical areas experience periodic variations in the thermal structure of their water columns with times of strong thermal stratification being succeeded by periods of mixing over the course of the year understanding of the transport and transformation of dissolved inorganic carbon over such thermal cycles in artificial reservoirs remains poor to address this problem this study examined the spatiotemporal behavior of dissolved inorganic carbon dic the partial pressure of co2 pco2 carbon isotope ratios δ13cdic and co2 emission fco2 from 2014 to 2018 in a subtropical groundwater fed reservoir in southern china it was found that co2 emissions during mixing periods are much higher than in thermally stratified periods particularly during transition from stratified to mixing as a result of upwelling and release of dissolved co2 co2aq accumulated in the hypolimnion co2 emission fluxes at the water gas interface accounted for only a small proportion of the dic in the reservoir the relationships between of dic and δ13cdic displayed two distinct modes due to spatial differences in water depths and to strong thermal stratification during warmer seasons 1 dic concentrations increase and δ13cdic values decrease from epilimnion to hypolimnion and 2 δ13cdic values decrease with increasing dic concentrations but δ13cdic is progressively enriched near the bottom during periods of thermal stratification in addition this study found three distinct processes of dic accumulation and consumption in the reservoir 1 dic accumulated in the hypolimnion during thermal stratification periods due to carbon retention but 2 dic was substantially consumed in the epilimnion during such periods and 3 average dic concentrations and pco2 increased significantly from upstream to downstream along the reservoir while average δ13cdic values became lighter these results highlight that carbon behavior in groundwater fed reservoirs is often controlled by a combination of biogeochemical processes and seasonal variations in thermal structure sampling and monitoring strategies should consider these factors in order to accurately estimate carbon budgets in reservoirs

fed reservoir south china 1 introduction balancing carbon budgets is very important when studying regional carbon cycling processes and establishing carbon neutrality targets inland waters lakes reservoirs creeks rivers etc play a key role in carbon transport storage and inner transformation cole et al 1994 reservoirs are now very common in many regions of the world and have become an important somewhat different type of lake wen et al 2008 according to the 2018 national statistics bulletin of water development there were 98 822 reservoirs in china that year most being located in the provinces of yunnan guizhou and guangxi where the total storage capacity of 8953 billion m3 http www mwr gov cn sj was located chiefly in typical karst areas such as the wujiang hongshui and panjiang river basins the effect of damming on the carbon cycle has attracted much attention from the scientific and wider communities myrbo and shapley 2006 rudd et al 1993 when a river is intercepted flow rates become slower and water residence times increase permitting internal biological processes to become key controlling factors in the carbon biogeochemical cycle especially during warm seasons han et al 2018 for example dic in reservoirs displays significant diurnal seasonal and annual variations due to phytoplankton growth and metabolism peng et al 2014 li et al 2019 dam construction extends water surface areas regulating their greenhouse gas ghgs emissions via gas diffusion and or ebullition bubbling raymond et al 2013 rudd et al 1993 additionally thermal structural variations in reservoirs caused by seasonal air temperature fluctuations also change the carbon cycle mode which differs from conditions applying in free flowing rivers myrbo and shapley 2006 wen et al 2008 park and chung 2018 wang et al 2019b dissolved inorganic carbon dic largely as dissolved carbon dioxide and bicarbonate is one of the important constituents in natural freshwater systems serving as the foundation for organic productivity wetzel 2001 dic constituents may control water quality properties such as acidity hardness and related other characteristics bellanger et al 2004 talling 2006 in addition the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in water is an important control factor for co2 exchanges between atmosphere and water many studies suggest that pco2 in the surface water layer in most lakes worldwide 87 are supersaturated with respect to the ambient air cole et al 1994 creating a positive co2 gradient into atmosphere thus it is essential that the rudiments of dic reactivity be evaluated in freshwater systems myrbo and shapley 2006 qin et al 2019 wang et al 2019b 2021a it is well known that the dic concentration in rivers draining karst areas is significantly higher than that in non karst areas due to the dissolution of carbonate rocks wang et al 2019b pu et al 2020 wang et al al 2021b thousands of reservoirs have been built in karst areas for water supply flood control and hydroelectric power since 1900s milanović 2011 dic loading is an important determinant of co2 fluxes across the air water interface invers et al 2001 mcdonald et al 2013 wang et al 2019b liu and han 2021 2021a endogenous organic carbon formation wang et al 2021b yi et al 2021 and carbon burial wang et al 2019a b maavara et al 2020 in the majority reservoirs numerous researchers have studied carbon transformation processes in karst reservoirs e g myrbo and shapley 2006 peng et al 2014 han et al 2018 wang et al 2019a b maavara et al 2020 however reservoirs have two principal recharge mode of water surface channel flows in rivers and creeks surface fed reservoirs and groundwaters groundwater fed reservoirs the latter has received little attention while its hydrochemical characteristics may be very different lupon et al 2019 many studies have shown that groundwaters contain larger amounts of carbon containing gasses co2 and ch4 plus dic and doc originating from soils which leads to supersaturation of dissolved co2 worrall and lancaster 2005 jahangir et al 2012 khadka et al 2014 chmiel et al 2015 lupon et al 2019 in contrast surface waters have comparatively lower c containing gasses or equilibrium with the atmosphere before entering the reservoir marcé et al 2015 thus if a reservoir is recharged predominantly by groundwater its carbon cycle will show distinctly different characteristics than that of a surface water fed reservoir notably flowing surface water is often rare in karst areas but groundwater is abundant despite increased awareness the complex internal transformations of carbon in dic rich groundwater fed reservoirs is still not fully understood previous studies have shown that varying thermal structure controls the dynamics of co2 emissions pu et al 2020 but data on the interactions among physical chemical and biological processes in the water column are still lacking this study presents a database from 90 vertical profiles taken over 30 different months between july 2014 and december 2018 a total of 535 samples in a groundwater fed reservoir in south china it improves understanding of the seasonal vertical and spatial variations and controlling mechanisms of the dic system the results emphasize the need to understand the distinct mechanisms of dic cycling in groundwater fed reservoir systems and will be conducive to balancing regional carbon budgets 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the dalongdong dld reservoir 23 30 01 23 40 08 n 108 30 02 108 36 04 e fig 1 a it is a typical

dic concentration pco2 δ13cdic and fco2 are presented in fig 2 all four parameters showed significant variations along the line of flow dic concentrations were in the range 67 37 368 90 mg l 1 with the maximum and the minimum values both being found at d3 site during the monitoring period 2014 2018 the average concentration of dic increased significantly from upstream 207 48 59 88 mg l 1 at d1 to downstream 233 46 57 56 mg l 1 at d3 fig 2a this trend was also observed in pco2 and fco2 fig 2b d average pco2 and fco2 increased from d1 pco2 6176 17 6013 21 μatm fco2 34 61 65 65 mg m 2 h 1 to downstream d3 pco2 7519 39 6612 96 μatm fco2 85 32 250 93 mg m 2 h 1 in contrast the average δ13cdic turned significantly negative from upstream 9 5 3 2 at d1 to downstream 10 8 2 6 at d3 fig 2c 3 2 stratification characteristics of the dld reservoir 3 2 1 thermal stratification the ssi depth of the thermocline and rtrm of the dld reservoir are shown in figs 3 and 4 which intuitively reveal obvious thermal stratification and mixing patterns as seen in fig 3a the average ssi of all the three sites d1 d2 d3 is 244 45 197 81 kg m m 2 with a range from 24 45 to 664 99 kg m m 2 the higher ssi values always occurred between april and november and lower values from december to the following march indicating that the stratification was strongly seasonal the dld reservoir belongs to the warm monomictic class of lakes boehrer and schultze 2008 li et al 2019 peak ssi values always occurred in july and august indicating that the reservoir has strongest thermal stratification then negative ssi values always occurred in december january and february indicating that this was the chief mixing period some hydrochemical parameters ph do spc eh and chla also showed corresponding seasonal variation fig 5 with the exception of site d3 in november and october 2018 the depth of the thermocline generally ranged between 1 50 to 7 50 m being mostly 2 50 5 00 m below the water surface however there was no obvious seasonal variation in thermocline depth fig 3 this behavior was also evident in the profiles of the local stratified strength indicator rtrm fig 4 the average rtrm was 27 29 15 61 with a range from 7 08 to 166 05 the higher rtrm values always occurred at 2 5 5 0 m below the water surface during the well stratified period imberger and patterson 1990 thus we define 0 2 50 m depth as the epilimnion 2 50 7 50 m as the thermocline and depth 7 50 m as the hypolimnion in this reservoir based on the characteristics of the ssi depth of the thermocline and the rtrm the period from mid march to mid november is defined as the period of stable thermal stratification and the others as mixing periods 3 2 2 water quality stratification all water quality parameters showed significant spatiotemporal variations in the dld reservoir in the vertical profiles the ph do and chla values decreased with water depth figs 5b c and f but spc values increased with depth during the thermal stratification period fig 5d the vertical profile of eh values was distinctive rising to an obvious maximum near the upper edge of the hypolimnion before suddenly became negative near the bottom fig 5e strong vertical gradients in ph sometimes exceeding two units were evident during the thermal stratification period fig 5b do depletion appeared in and below the thermocline region during the stratification period and throughout the entire water column during the mixing period interestingly some do values rose slightly to maxima in the thermocline during the thermal stratification period before declining with increasing depth fig 5c anoxic conditions do 15 bellanger et al 2004 encinas fernández et al 2014 were observed in the hypolimnion every month during the stratification period the water chemical parameters showed weaker variation in the water column during the mixing period 3 2 3 dic parameter stratification throughout the study period the dic parameters in the reservoir including dic concentrations pco2 δ13cdic and sic all displayed clear vertical variations fig 6 during the stratified period dic concentration and pco2 generally increases with depth being much higher in the hypolimnion than in the epilimnion maximum pco2 differences between bottom and surface water can reach 36 640 66 µatm in the mixing period dic concentration and pco2 profiles showed few differences throughout the water column fig 6a and 6b in addition it is worth noting the proportion of dic species also showed significant seasonal and vertical spatial variations in the reservoir hco3 concentrations were highly variable ranging from 67 37 mg l 1 to 354 54 mg l 1 with a mean of 221 38 58 89 mg l 1 and accounting for 78 71 98 05 of the dic species co2aq concentrations had yet higher variability from 0 07 mg l 1 to 67 32 mg l 1 with a mean of 18 80 14 57 mg l 1 and accounting for 0 12 27 33 of the dic species the co3 2 concentrations were the least 0 09 mg l 1 to 5 76 mg l 1 and accounting for 0 03 8 55 of dic species in the thermal stratification period the concentration of hco3 and co2aq generally increased with water depth while the concentration of co3 2 generally decreased however the proportion of hco3 in the dic species generally decreased with water depth while that of co2aq generally increased fig 7 during the mixing period the proportions of hco3 and co2aq were 90 89 96 19 and 3 54 9 16 respectively displaying relatively stable characteristics throughout the water column fig 7 the δ13cdic and sic values showed differing variations with dic concentrations figs 6c and 6d overall there were decreasing trends in δ13cdic and sic with increasing depth during the stratified period however there were two slightly different modes in vertical distribution of δ13cdic during this period in mode one δ13cdic values continuously decrease with depth e g sampling dates 2016 4 7 2017 8 31 2017 10 27 and 2018 11 6 in mode two δ13cdic values first decrease with depth but increase again at bottom e g sampling dates 2014 7 12 2018 8 18 and 2016 8 17 in the mixing period the δ13cdic values displayed smaller differences throughout the vertical profile fig 6c sic values ranged from 0 60 to 1 26 with a mean of 0 35 0 33 most of them 86 94 were greater than zero indicating that the majority of water samples taken in the reservoir were saturated with calcite for most of the study period fig 6d 3 3 seasonal characteristics of the dic parameters a dic heat map not only shows the vertical variations of dic but also seasonal variations occurring at a given water depth the dic concentration and pco2 in the epilimnion 0 5 m were lower in the thermal stratification period than in the mixing period while sic and δ13cdic were higher this is in contrast to behavior in the thermocline and hypolimnion fig 6 pco2 values in the surface layer water were often undersaturated relative to the atmosphere during the stratified period which led to direct atmospheric co2 loss into the reservoir contributing to co2 sequestration in contrast pco2 values in the surface layer were all supersaturated relative to the atmosphere during the mixing period leading to rapid degassing fig 8 e shows the significant differences in co2 evasive fluxes between the thermal stratified and mixing periods anova p 0 05 with lower average values 15 39 49 43 mg m 2 h 1 in the stratified period and higher 153 61 213 43 mg m 2 h 1 in the mixing period notably there were some negative values of co2 flux during the stratified period indicating that surface waters can absorb atmospheric co2 extremely high co2 evasive fluxes can be found in november when there is the transition from thermal stratification to mixing conditions which is consistent with pco2 spikes observed in the epilimnion figs 8b and 8e integrating all vertical profile data from the three sites this study found that the monthly dic and pco2 means also exhibited pronounced monthly variations anova p 0 05 fig 8 monthly mean dic and pco2 in winter and spring were lower than in summer and autumn figs 8a and 8b in contrast to the mean monthly δ13cdic and sic values fig 8c and 8d interestingly there has been a slight increase in the mean monthly dic and pco2 values during the stratification period in which their two peaks almost correspond to the peaks in thermal stratification intensity ssi fig 3 these results suggest that the accumulation and consumption of dic in the dld reservoir are closely related to the changes in thermal structure 4 discussion 4 1 processes and patterns of co2 evasion in many karst regions of the world dissolved co2 in karst water is typically supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere because of high concentrations of soil co2 cause abundant dissolution of the carbonate rocks kessler and harvey 2001 drysdale et al 2002 pu et al 2017 much recent work has shown that there is generally significant co2 degassing when karst groundwaters emerge at the surface or discharge into stream channels determining the sources and patterns of degassing from these flowing waters drysdale et al 2002 schelker et al 2016 pu et al 2017 wang et al 2021b due to the high pco2 gradient between water and the open atmosphere aqueous co2 can easily escape into the air short distances from the groundwater discharge points particularly in reaches with abrupt changes in streambed morphology such as cascades or waterfalls herman and lorah 1987 hoffer french and herman 1989 drysdale et al 2002 pu et al 2017 wang et al 2021b the results of this study showed that the co2 evasion fluxes of the dld reservoir mean 34 61 65 65 mg m 2 h 1 upstream 50 63 113 36 mg m 2 h 1 midstream and 85 32 250 93 mg m 2 h 1 downstream were much less than those of some other groundwater fed streams that have been studied intensively e g 1801 mg m 2 h 1 at the springs and 458 mg m 2 h 1 1 3 km downstream in guancun streams pu et al 2017 surface fed karst reservoirs e g ranging from 16 50 to 4160 38 mg m 2 h 1 with an average of 476 85 mg m 2 h 1 in eight karst reservoirs on the wujiang river wang et al 2021a and large karst river reservoirs e g ranging from 70 77 to 2896 30 mg m 2 h 1 with an average of 1053 8 mg m 2 h 1 in xijiang wujiang river liu and han 2021 concurrently we were surprised to find that there was no large co2 evasion across the water air interface near the groundwater discharge outlet instead co2 evasion tends to increase along the direction of flow in the reservoir fig 2d co2 evasion at the water air interface in the dld reservoir was not controlled by groundwater inflows as it is in other groundwater fed streams or rivers many studies have shown that when groundwater emerges pco2 in the river or stream will seek to rapidly equilibrate with the atmospheric partial pressure through co2 degassing a process which is enhanced by hydrological agitation hoffer french and herman 1989 drysdale et al 2002 wang et al 2021b however groundwater discharging into the bottom of a reservoir is in a different situation reservoirs are deeper than rivers or streams so the groundwater will not degas co2 due to a sudden drop in pressure the average water depth at the upstream part of the dld reservoir is 6 0 m which is 1 58 higher pressure than in the atmosphere above restraining the physical degassing in addition the velocity of flow is much less than in rivers or streams reducing degassing due to hydrological agitation most reservoirs display thermal stratification which can limit co2 emission by preventing upward mixing of water and nutrients in the deeper water column elçi 2008 pu et al 2020 in addition phytoplankton photosynthesis in the epilimnion during the thermal stratification period can assimilate inorganic carbon fig 6a and restrain co2 emission fig 8e however over the whole water column there was accumulation of dic during the thermal stratification period because co2aq was continuously increasing in the hypolimnion due to the thermal stratification barrier respiration and degradation of organic material figs 7 and 8a park and chung 2018 previous studies have demonstrated that turnover events during the mixing period can stimulate large amounts of co2 emission elçi 2008 park and chung 2018 pu et al 2020 the results of this study confirms that co2 emissions during the mixing period are much higher than in the stratification period especially during the transition from stratified to mixed columns fig 8e due to the hypolimnion co2aq accumulation over the thermal stratification period 4 2 modes of water column δ13cdic variability according to plots of δ13cdic values vs concentrations myrbo and shapley 2006 the vertical distribution behavior of the values in a reservoir can be divided into three groups 1 δ13cdic values are higher and dic concentrations are lower in the epilimnion than in the hypolimnion mode a 2 the epilimnion has lower δ13cdic and dic concentrations than the hypolimnion mode b and 3 dic concentrations increase from the epilimnion to hypolimnion while the δ13cdic values first decrease but then increase if when the dic concentration is 300 mg l 1 mode c myrbo and shapley 2006 as shown in fig 9 δ13cdic values at the d1 site fig 9a belong to mode a but at the midstream d2 fig 9b and downstream d3 fig 9c sites they place in mode c in fig 9 dic concentrations and δ13cdic values display statistically significant negative correlations most in the hypolimnion fall in bottom right corner with high dic concentrations and low δ13cdic this phenomenon can be explained by three factors 1 solar illumination water temperature and phytoplankton density generally decrease with depth resulting in less dic consumption due to the gradually weakening photosynthesis 2 there is continuous anaerobic degradation of organic matter in the hypolimnion as evidenced by previous findings that doc concentrations decrease with depth huang et al 2018 resulting in a proportional dic increase and δ13cdic decrease bellanger et al 2004 myrbo and shapley 2006 and 3 the dld reservoir is recharged from its bottom by karst groundwater with high dic content and depleted δ13cdic which is conducive to dic accumulation in particular during the thermal stratification period water exchanges between the hypolimnion and epilimnion in the reservoir were poor resulting in storage of δ13cdic depleted dic in the hypolimnion mode a is the textbook mode of lacustrine water column dic behavior being dominated by photosynthesis and decomposition myrbo and shapley 2006 in the fig 9 most data from the epilimnion plot top left with lower dic concentrations and higher δ13cdic values this phenomenon can be explained by 1 photosynthesis of phytoplankton taking up aqueous dic in the epilimnion resulting in decreased dic photosynthesis can increase the proportion of aqueous 13c because of preferential utilization of 12c szaran 1998 smyntek et al 2012 mcdonald et al 2013 wang et al 2019b 2 co2 degassing can decrease dic concentrations but enrich the δ13cdic component because the lighter 12c is more volatile grootes et al 1969 doctor et al 2008 it is worth noting that co2 exchanges at the water air interface in the dld reservoir included both absorption and emissions during the thermal stratification periods absorption of atmospheric co2 can increase dic concentrations and enrich δ13cdic grootes et al 1969 mook et al 1974 however as mentioned above dic concentration in the surface water was still low in enriched 13c fig 6a and 6c during the thermal stratification periods indicating that co2 absorption did not offset dic consumption by phytoplankton photosynthesis in the epilimnion and 3 natural precipitation falling into the reservoir water can also dilute dic concentrations resulting in δ13cdic increases pu et al 2018 the difference between mode a and mode c is that δ13cdic values near the bottom become progressively higher in the latter during the thermal stratification period fig 9 this appears to be due to by remineralization of organic matter which is evidently accompanied by carbonate dissolution and or methanogenesis occurring at rates high enough to provide a net positive δ13cdic trend with the increasing dic concentrations myrbo and shapley 2006 the impact of remineralization of organic matter will be analyzed in detail in sections 4 3 and 4 4 δ13cdic in lakes or reservoirs is an important ecological and paleoenvironmental proxy although further conceptual modes of dic and δ13cdic evolution and distribution have been described in other lakes our new findings emphasize that different conceptual modes of dic and δ13cdic may co exist in the same reservoir due to differing depths of water and thermal stratification effects 4 3 the relative importance of the processes affecting dic accumulation and consumption the statistically significant spatial variations of dic parameters reported in this study show that processes of dic accumulation and consumption in the dld reservoir display some obvious regularities first dic accumulates during the periods of thermal stratification due to carbon retention below the epilimnion and decreases during mixing periods due to abundant co2 release fig 8 second in the vertical profiles during stratification periods dic was clearly accumulated in the hypolimnion and consumed in the epilimnion fig 6 third the average dic concentration and pco2 increased significantly from upstream to downstream figs 2a and 2b but average δ13cdic values became significantly negative fig 2d these phenomena were often caused by a combination of biogeochemical and physical processes including 1 co2 exchange across the water air interface 2 phytoplankton photosynthesis 3 respiration and degradation of organic material and 4 dissolution and precipitation of calcium carbonate myrbo and shapley 2006 park and chung 2018 pu et al 2018 wang et al 2021b in this section we attempt to evaluate the relative importance of these biogeochemical and physical processes previous studies have shown that the relative importance of co2 exchange fluxes mainly depends on the size of the c reserves in the dic in the surface water layer herczeg 1987 stiller and kirshenbaum 1999 here dic concentration and co2 exchange flux were used to calculate c reserves t c in the epilimnion 0 2 5 m eq 3 and the daily c emission t c at the water air interface eq 4 3 c 1 dic h s m c f 1 f 2 m dic 4 c 2 fc o 2 s m c f 3 f 2 m co 2 where c1 is the c reserve t c in the epilimnion dic is dic concentration mg l 1 h is the thickness of the epilimnion 2 5 m s is the average surface area of the dld reservoir 8 79 106 m2 mc is molecular weight of c 12 g mol 1 mdic is molecular weight of hco3 61 g mol 1 f1 is the transformation coefficient between l and m3 1000 f2 is the transformation coefficient between mg and t 1 t 109 mg c2 is daily c emission flux t c at water air interface fco2 is co2 flux mg m 2 h 1 f3 is the transformation coefficient between hour and day 24 and mco2 is the molecular weight of co2 44 g mol 1 the results of this study showed that average daily c emissions 0 089 t c in the reservoir during the stratification periods were only 0 14 of the total inorganic carbon 62 15 t c in the epilimnion during the mixing periods the average daily c emissions 0 88 t c were 0 95 of total dic 92 96 t in the epilimnion table 1 thus this study found that co2 emission fluxes at the water gas interface in the reservoir accounted for only a small proportion of the dissolved inorganic carbon content no matter whether in the stratification periods or the mixing periods this suggests that the contribution of co2 exchanges to the accumulation or consumption of dic in the dld reservoir is secondary after eliminating any dominating role for the co2 exchange flux the remaining physical processes dissolution and precipitation of calcium carbonate and biological processes photosynthesis respiration and degradation of organic materials should be the cause of dic changes measured in the dld reservoir similar to other karst reservoirs wang et al 2021a the average ca2 concentration in dld reservoir increased ca2 by 83 23 0 25 mmol l 1 to 1 73 mmol l 1 from epilimnion to hypolimnion during the stratification periods fig 10 proving that carbonate dissolution occurs in the hypolimnion of dld reservoir however the values of dic mmol l 1 versus ca2 mmol l 1 in dld reservoir during stratification periods ranged from 1 93 to 7 58 with a mean of 3 01 which is much higher than the theoretical value 2 of carbonate dissolution fig 10 this proved that the dissolution of carbonate was an important process in the hypolimnion but not the dominant factor in dic accumulation in the hypolimnion moreover fig 6d shows that the sic values ranged only from 0 60 to 1 26 mean value 0 35 0 33 which does not allow for large amounts of carbonate being precipitated the relative importance of the physical and biologic processes can be also judged by their fractionation coefficients gu et al 2004 showed that the fractionation between dic and caco3 is less than that between dic co2 or hco3 and organic matter about 3 for diccaco3 vs 20 for dic om this means that 1 mol organic carbon decomposition can offset the effect of the precipitation of 6 7 mol carbonate in the dic pool myrbo and shapley 2006 therefore the results of this study imply that the contribution of caco3 dissolution and or precipitation in situ to dic accumulation or consumption processes in the dld reservoir are inconsequential during the stratification periods there was a significant negative relationship between do and dic concentration r 2 0 58 p 0 001 and a significant positive relationship between do and δ13cdic r 2 0 58 p 0 001 figs 11 a and 11b however these relationships were not statistically significant in the mixing periods figs 11c and 11d these findings indicate that seasonal variations in the thermal structure and biogeochemical processes photosynthesis respiration and degradation of organic matter in the water column are the dominant controls of the accumulation or consumption of dic and the kinetic carbon isotope fractionation in the remaining dic the water column dic and δ13cdic distributions were dominated by photosynthesis of phytoplankton and decomposition of organic materials through preferential uptake of 12c from the epilimnion and its release in the hypolimnion myrbo and shapley 2006 4 4 assessing the effect of redox environment on degradation of organic matter in the hypolimnion previous studies wang et al 2019b pu et al 2020 and our analyses in 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 above all showed that co2 emissions during the mixing periods are much higher than those in the thermal stratified periods especially at the transitional stage fig 8e when there is discharge of the co2aq accumulated in the hypolimnion during thermal stratification however the organic carbon decomposition processes in redox systems are significantly different in the hypolimnion fig 9 due to the thermal stratification the hypolimnion in a reservoir is effectively separated from the atmosphere boehrer and schultze 2008 qin et al 2019 wang et al 2019b since the contribution of dissolution and or precipitation of carbonate calcium to the dic accumulation and consumption processes in the dld reservoir were inconsequential we suppose that dic in the hypolimnion can be regarded as a mixture of that existed at the beginning of a stratification period and that produced by the decomposition of organic matter in the hypolimnion and underlying sediments during that period using the δ13c values of co2 produced by decomposition miyajima et al 1997 the ratio of dic produced in anoxic reduction conditions do 15 eh 0 to that in oxidizing conditions do 15 eh 0 can be calculated using a mass balance model setting dic concentration and δ13cdic in the hypolimnion at the beginning of a stratification period as dic i and δ13c i the dic concentration and δ13cdic at a selected point in the stratification period are respectively set as dic j and δ13c j and dic and δ13cdic produced by organic respiration after the beginning of stratification as dic r and δ13c r the relationship between these variables can be expressed as miyajima et al 1997 6 dic j dic i dic r 7 δ 13 c j dic i δ 13 c i dic r δ 13 c r dic i dic r if δ13c r is assumed to be a fixed value dic r can be eliminated and eq 6 re expressed as 8 δ 13 c j δ 13 c r dic i δ 13 c i δ 13 c r dic j by convention the relationship δ13cdic vs 1 dic is used to make a keeling plot to obtain a regression equation in which the intercept represents the δ13c r value of dic generated by organic decomposition miyajima et al 1997 the dld data for oxidizing and reducing environments differ greatly on keeling plots figs 12 this is in agreement with the modes of δ13cdic variation in the water columns fig 9 due to greater water depths and thermal stratification strength at the midstream site d2 and downstream site d3 hypoxic to anoxic reduction conditions are found near the bottoms there do 15 eh 0 bellanger et al 2004 encinas fernández et al 2014 during stratification average δ13c r values in the hypolimnion at d2 and d3 were 6 51 and 6 64 respectively table 2 because anaerobic respiration produces 13c rich co2 bellanger et al 2004 in oxidizing conditions do 15 eh 0 bellanger et al 2004 the average δ13c r values of the hypolimnion in the three monitoring sites ranged from 21 56 to 20 38 in the order d1 site d2 site d3 site table 2 analysis of our monitoring data for dic concentration and δ13cdic in the hypolimnion at the beginning of the stratification periods dic i δ13c i and the average during stratification dic j δ13c j are shown in table 2 if the δ13cdic produced in reducing conditions is set as δ13c red and in oxidizing conditions as δ13c oxi the isotope mixing model based on mass balance equations can be expressed as huang et al 2018 9 δ 13 c j f 1 δ 13 c i f 2 δ 13 c o x i f 2 δ 13 c r e d 10 f 1 f 2 f 3 1 11 f 1 dic i dic j where f 1 is the proportion of dic in the hypolimnion at the beginning of stratification f 2 is the proportion of dic produced in oxidizing conditions f 3 is the proportion of dic produced in reducing conditions although the upstream d1 site has a low depth mean of 9 80 m it also formed stable thermal stratification like d2 mean of 12 34 m and d3 mean of 15 18 m during stratification periods figs 3 and 4 therefore organic matter decomposition also occurred in the hypolimnion at d1 site the results of this mixing model determined that 30 63 33 58 of dic in the stratified hypolimnion in the dld were produced by organic respiration after stratification began table 2 however in the upstream site d1 because of the shallow water and lack of reducing conditions do 15 eh 0 there was no anoxic dic table 2 in contrast 6 68 and 6 78 of dic in the hypolimnion in midstream site d2 and downstream site d3 respectively were produced by respiration of organic matter in reducing conditions do 15 eh 0 during stratification periods table 2 these results indicate that the thermal structure and water depth influence organic degradation in the hypolimnion thereby controlling the distribution transport and transformation of dic in a karst reservoir 5 conclusions this study has demonstrated that reservoirs in karst terrains are generally rich in dic and provide well defined natural systems to study aquatic carbon behavior our results provide more evidences that groundwater recharge modes variations of thermal structure and biogeochemical processes photosynthesis respiration and degradation of organic matter control dic transport and transformation processes in reservoirs such as the dld our data emphasize that co2 emission processes and patterns in a groundwater fed reservoir are very different from those in streams or rivers also recharged by groundwater in summary the following processes and patterns of co2 emission are typical in a groundwater fed reservoir 1 damming reservoir restrains natural co2 degassing after groundwater emergence in the reservoir bottom 2 thermal stratification above the bottom determines the direction and flux of co2 at the water gas interface and 3 in autumn and winter co2 degassing increases explosively primarily controlled by the physical process of reservoir overturning water column dic and δ13cdic distributions appear to be dominated by phytoplankton photosynthesis in the epilimnion and by decomposition of organic materials in the hypolimnion during periods of thermal stratification in contrast during mixing periods dic produced by decomposition of organic matter in the hypolimnion and underlying sediments during thermally stratified conditions will be transferred to the surface during mixing periods increasing co2 degassing daily emissions of dic sourced carbon in the dld reservoir during stratification periods is only 0 14 of that stored as dic in the epilimnion and daily c emissions during mixing periods is 0 95 of the storage suggesting that the contribution of co2 exchange to processes of dic accumulation or consumption in the reservoir are secondary the results of this study indicate that seasonal variations in the thermal structure of the water column and biogeochemical processes photosynthesis respiration degradation of organic matter

16416,drinking water must be sufficiently biostable to avoid excessive microbial and invertebrate growth in disinfectant free distribution systems the production of biologically stable drinking water is challenging for conventional surface water treatment plants using reservoirs as feed water due to the presence of slowly biodegradable particulate and high molecular weight biopolymeric organic carbon high mw oc which increases the microbial growth potential mgp in the feed water and produced drinking water the study presented here provides new insights in the relationship between high mw oc and mgp for a full scale surface water treatment plant controlled conditions addition series experiments showed that mgp increases linearly with the high mw oc concentration with a seasonally variable ratio laboratory filtration indicated that mgp is mainly attributable to the high mw oc subfraction of 0 12 µm particle size coinciding with microbial biomass intensive field monitoring revealed clear seasonal patterns in the plant s feed water and treated water levels of high mw oc biomass and mgp these parameters reach maximum levels in the periods of high water temperature with the notable exception of the treated water s high mw oc concentration which exhibits an opposite seasonal pattern reflecting seasonally variable removal in the treatment moreover the field monitoring showed that mgp correlates well with the concentrations of biodegradable biopolymeric oc and with microbial biomass measured as atp adenosine triphosphate and cell counts but not with the total high mw oc concentration in the treated water theoretical estimations showed that the oc quantities present in and consumed by the microbial biomass are in the same order of magnitude as slowly biodegradable biopolymers from these results it is concluded that specifically the microbial biomass associated and biodegradable biopolymeric oc subfraction of the totally present high mw oc is important for mgp finally the mgp assay results and theoretical calculations showed for the high mw oc matrix that the microbial biomass oc consumption for maintenance is significant vis á vis that for growth and that

enhances the water s quality by reducing byproduct formation and improving odor and taste and is therefore increasingly being implemented in e g the netherlands scandinavia switzerland and germany a critically important condition to enable such disinfectant free distribution is that the produced drinking water is biostable and excess abundance of microbial and invertebrate biomass in the distribution network is avoided rittman and snoeyink 1984 van der kooij et al 1999 van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 such excessive biomass regrowth may result in the violation of regulatory limits on

studies on water treatment and distribution these studies demonstrated that it is challenging to produce adequately biostable drinking water from eutrophic lake and reservoir water bysurface water treatment trains which typically comprise conventional pretreatment coagulation separation rapid media filtration main disinfection ultraviolet ozonation or advanced oxidation and biological activated carbon filtration bacf commonly easily biodegradable low mw compounds measured as aoc p17 nox have traditionally been considered as the main parameter for biostability van der kooij et al 1982 lechevallier et al 1993 however several studies have proved that the presence of especially slowly biodegradable biopolymeric high molecular weight mw organic carbon high mw oc which originates from the source surface water negatively affects the mgp and biological stability of the produced drinking water volk et al 1997 park et al 2016 schurer et al 2019 and causes regrowth in the distribution network van der kooij et al 2015 hijnen et al 2018 this high mw oc fraction comprises the respective subfractions of colloidal biopolymeric substances polysaccharides long chain fatty acids and proteins submicron to micron 0 1 1 0 µm sized particulates in the form of bacterial biomass van der kooij et al 2015 and larger sized invertebrates 1 2 gaps in the understanding of the relationships between high mw oc and mgp in biostability assessment in surface water treatment the biological stability of drinking water can be enhanced by implementation of water treatment processes which target the reduction of high mw oc and aoc levels such as river bank and dune infiltration slow sand filtration and membrane filtration ultrafiltration nanofiltration or reversed osmosis escobar et al 2000 hammes et al 2010 van der kooij et al 2017 schurer et al 2019 however such processes entail significant treatment costs spatial footprint demand infiltration slow sand filtration and or energy consumption water losses and concentrate disposal challenges membrane filtration selection of the optimal surface water treatment approach to produce biostable drinking water thus necessitates a solid understanding of the relationship between high mw oc and biostability the particular importance of high mw oc for biostability of drinking water produced from eutrophic reservoir water as presented in literature is based on correlations with various mgp bio assay methods and observed regrowth in distribution systems however the understanding of the relationship between the mgp parameters as measured in produced water and the overall biostability in the disinfectant free distribution network is still in development prévost et al 1998 van der kooij et al 1999 van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 prest et al 2016 hijnen et al 2018 schurer et al 2019 the latter two studies revealed that mgp as bpp correlated well with the concentration of high mw oc and not with the concentration of easily assimilable oc in drinking water where mgp was oc limited but also that this relationship showed a considerable statistical uncertainty the main complicating factor here is that the broad and changing composition and thus biodegradability of the aoc pool present in field samples inherently induces a variability in the responses of the mgp assays and thus affects the mgp high mw oc relationship in addition the respective importances of the subfractions encompassed by the totally present bulk high mw oc for biostability is currently not fully clear schurer et al 2019 showed that ultrafiltration of bacf filtrate reduced mgp by 50 to 90 depending on the specific parameter which demonstrated the importance of the high mw oc fraction for mgp but did not yet provide further discrimination for the 0 12 µm particle size high mw oc subfraction therefore a more detailed differentiation between the respective contributions of the biopolymeric microbial and invertebrate biomass subfractions on mgp is desired to clarify their impact on biostability furthermore surface water treatment in temperate climates is subjected to seasonal variations of several abiotic and biotic factors seasonal variations apply in the plant feed water s temperature and concentration and composition of biomass and algal originated high mw oc but also in the treatment s removal efficiency of these compoundsated water van der kooij et al 2015 park et al 2016 such seasonal factors likely impact the produced water s biostability but their effects have not yet been reported in detail finally the impact of the slowly biodegradable high mw oc matrix on the levels of microbial biomass which can be sustained under oligotrophic conditions in drinking water requires attention using bpp data van der kooij et al 2015 2017 qualitatively showed that the available aoc is used not only for growth assimilation but also for maintenance dissimilation of the microbial biomass in the water sample a dominance of biomass maintenance over growth could lead to the presence of stable and high levels of biomass for prolonged periods which potentially has important implications for biostability and regrowth in disinfectant free distribution networks 1 3 objective of this study the objective of the present study is to investigate in detail the relationship between high mw oc and biostability measured as mgp in the same drinking water produced from surface water as studied before by hijnen et al 2018 and schurer et al 2019 by specifically addressing i their quantitative relationship under controlled conditions ii the respective importances of the submicron particulate and biomass high mw oc s subfractions for mgp iii their seasonal variations and parameter correlations in the plant s feed water pretreated water and produced drinking water and iv the impact of a high mw oc matrix on the balance between biomass growth and maintenance and its implication for biostability in the distribution network these objectives were approached by a combination of extensive field monitoring at a full scale surface water treatment plant laboratory experimentation under controlled conditions and theoretical calculations using approximated conversion and yield factors 2 methods and materials 2 1 research outline and test site the relationship between mgp and high mw oc and its subfractions was investigated for the treated water represented by bacf filtrate of a surface water treatment plant by a combination of laboratory experiments field data monitoring and evaluation and theoretical calculations of which the respective approach and objectives are presented in table 1 the main analytical parameters applied in the addition series laboratory filtration and field

biodegradable low mw oc by aoc p17 nox on slowly biodegradable biopolymers by aoc a3 and total mgp by bpp the laboratory experiments and field monitoring involved a full scale surface water treatment plant of evides water company in the south western area of the netherlands which was the same site for previous studies on biostability by hijnen et al 2018 and schurer et al 2019 the plant uses reservoir water as raw water source feed water which contains seasonally high concentrations of high mw oc the produced water features comparatively high levels of high mw oc and mgp as bpp and aoc a3 and regrowth is observed in the disinfectant free distribution network the configuration of the treatment plant and its feed water source is described in short as follows abstracted river water is stored in open reservoirs four month detention period and subsequently conveyed to the treatment plant after low dose chlorination to prevent clamshell growth in the transport mains 0 5 mg l cl2 no

no residual left after clear water storge and at the distribution pumping and aeration and ph correction before clear water storage and distribution pumping the periodical application of the starch based coagulant aid in the pretreatment did not measurably affect the concentrations of the lc ocd biopolymer and phmoc concentrations data not shown 2 2 analytical methods organic carbon high mw oc was determined as the biopolymer fraction in liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lcocd huber et al 2011 20 kda mw and as particulate and or high molecular weight organic carbon phmoc van der kooij et al 2015 hijnen et al 2018 based on their earlier good correlation for bacf filtrate schurer et al 2019 in brief the phmoc was the total organic carbon toc by shimadzu v content of the concentrate obtained after crossflow ultrafiltration of 100 l freshly sampled water over a 30 kda membrane hf80s fresenius medical care van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 the concentrate encompassing all colloidal oc 30 kda 0 01 µm and particulate oc including all microbial and invertebrate biomass the standard lcocd method included 0 45 µm prefiltration and therefore any larger particulate organic material was excluded from the analytical results lcocd was also used to quantify other oc fractions humic compounds building blocks low mw neutral and acidic compounds 2 3 analytical methods microbial growth potential mgp the microbial growth potential mgp of the water was assessed with the well defined pure culture bioassays aoc p17 nox for easily assimilable low mw oc and aoc a3 for biodegradable biopolymer oc and with the autochthonous bacteria based biomass production potential bpp bioassay for the totally present biodegradable oc pool van der kooij et al 1992 sack et al 2010 2011 and van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 all analyses were conducted in duplicate in aoc free glassware erlenmeyer flasks and processed within 24 h after sampling and storage at 4 c to prevent decay of the oc or biomass matrix the aoc concentrations were determined from the maximum growth as colony count of selected pure bacterial cultures in water samples after pasteurization addition of phosphate and nitrate to ensure growth limitation on oc and incubation in the dark at 15 c using yield factors available for strains p17 and nox on acetate c and for a3 on a mix of poly saccharides and proteins fructose maltose laminarin amylopectin xyloglucan proline and gelatin the bpp assay involved the monitoring of the autochthonous biomass concentration as atp adenosine triphosphate in unpasteurized water samples during incubation in dark 25 c after phosphate and nitrate addition and after inoculation with 1 ml bacf filtrate in the experiments described in sections 2 5 and 2 6 to re introduce the original autochthonous consortium the cumulative atp concentration during the bpp14 day incubation period bpc14 ng atp d l represented the combined response of biomass growth and maintenance van der kooij et al 2015 2 4 analytical methods biomass and other parameters microbial biomass in the water phase was monitored as total atp adenosine triphosphate for active biomass and total and membrane intact cell counts for bacterial numbers total atp was determined spectrophotometrically celsis method with luminex reagentia charles river at 10 s incubation van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 total and intact cell counts were enumerated by flow cytometry according to the protocol and equipment bd accuri c6 described by prest et al 2013 invertebrate and invertebrate detritus speciation density and biovolume were determined by visual microscopic inspection of 100 to 500 ml water samples using a dissection microscope leica mz apo magnification up to 100 and the bacchus automated size measurement system carpentier et al 1999 and were expressed as total fresh weight biomass obtained by multiplying the biovolume with an assumed density of 1 µg µm3 chlorophyll a determined according to the applicable nen 2006 standard was used as indicator for density of algae 2 5 determination of the quantitative relationship between high mw oc and mgp parameters by addition series experiments to verify the assumed importance of high mw oc for mgp the quantitative relationship between the concentration of high mw oc and ensuing responses in mgp parameters was investigated under controlled conditions by addition series experiments in the laboratory hereto a high mw oc concentrate was isolated from bacf filtrate by 30 kda ultrafiltration as described for the phmoc method section 2 2 and subsequently added in increasing amounts by pipetting to 600 ml blank water in aoc free erlenmeyer flasks the blank water was an aerobic groundwater with a low oc content and a high biological stability van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 next all flasks were pasteurized and inoculated with 1 ml bacf filtrate to establish the same natural microbial consortium in all samples and then further processed as aoc a3 aoc p17 nox for control purposes and bpp assays the experiments were conducted once in summer and once in winter to assess seasonal differences 2 6 particle size distribution of high mw oc and mgp by laboratory filtration experiments the distribution of high mw oc biomass and mgp parameters according to particle size was investigated by laboratory filtration of bacf filtrate bacf filtrate was filtered under gravity over flat sheet membranes with pores sizes of respectively 0 1 0 22 0 4 and 3 µm millipore isopore polycarbonate 47 mm diameter types vctp04700 gttp04700 http04700 and tstp04700 respectively filter holders thermofisher scientific nalgene were autoclaved and the complete filtration setup including membranes was flushed with 6 l milli q water in advance of the actual filtration runs with bacf filtrate the obtained laboratory filtrates collected in 1 l aoc free glass schott duran bottles were poured over in aoc free erlenmeyer flasks and further analyzed on atp cell count lcocd aoc a3 and bpc14 the 0 1 µm laboratory filtration exhibited rapid filter clogging which necessitated frequent change of filter membrane whereas their bpp incubation curves featured a deviating shape and a significant spread between their duplicates these results were therefore considered to be unreliable and were excluded from further evaluation ultrafiltration results from schurer et al 2019 using the same water bacf filtrate and filtration principle size exclusion as the laboratory filtration were used to compare the effect of smaller membrane pore sizes 0 02 and 0 12 µm 2 7 seasonal variations and parameter correlations in high mw oc and mgp by field monitoring in the full scale surface water treatment plant the field monitoring study involved sampling on the parameters described in sections 2 2 to 2 4 in the full scale treatment plant s feed water pretreated water after rapid filtration or uv disinfection and bacf filtrate considered to be representative for distributed drinking water without interference of the clo2 post disinfection in the biomass and biostability analysis notably atp and intact cell count the monitoring period encompassed a four year period to cover multiple season alternations the field monitoring data set was evaluated on parameter correlations using realstats in ms excel for office 365 most of the data proved not normally distributed checked by shapiro wilk and were assessed by spearman rho correlation coefficient rs data with a normal distribution after log transformation were additionally assessed by pearson correlation coefficient rp correlations were classified as moderate good and strong for values of rp and rs ranging between 0 40 and 0 60 0 60 and 0 80 and 0 80 respectively all correlations with rp and rs 0 40 featured a p value of 0 02 meeting the significance criterion p 0 05 the results of the addition series experiments were evaluated on linearity by least square regression analysis and trend line fitting in ms excel for office 365 where the coefficient of determination r2 described the goodness of the fit 2 8 theoretical estimation of biomass oc content and oc consumptions for growth and maintenance the quantity of oc in the bacterial and invertebrate biomass in the bacf filtrate was calculated using conversion factors available from literature for atp 250 ng c ng atp karl 1980 and total cell count 10 to 120 fg c µm3 cell volume bratbak and dundas 1984 nagata 1986 fagerbakke et al 1996 khachikyan et al 2019 and 0 05 µg c µg fresh weight invertebrate biomass winberg et al 1971 and assuming that 25 of biomass is carbon for the waters studied here oc was considered to be the substrate most relevant as energy source for mgp as the concentrations of other potential energy sources were very low iron and manganese 5 µg l ammonia 10 µg l the oc consumption by the microbial biomass present in the water samples was estimated here from the bpp incubation curves including its distribution over respectively biomass growth and biomass maintenance the distinction between biomass growth and biomass maintenance was manifest in the bpp incubation curves typical for bacf filtrate as shown in fig 1 a and 1b as follows firstly atp i e biomass levels drop rapidly from the initial level at sampling atp0 to a stabilized minimum level atpmin in the lag phase where the biomass adapts to the incubation environment the subsequent increase from atpmin to atpmax indicates the production of biomass in the growth phase at the maximum reached level atpmax biomass concentrations remain constant stationary phase where the available oc is used for the maintenance of the cells membrane integrity osmotic condition and protein renewal the bpc14 value indicated in fig 1a thus encompasses both maintenance and growth of the biomass oc consumptions by the microbial biomass present in the water samples were estimated from the bpp incubation curves using theoretically derived yield factors unlike the aoc methods a3 and p17 nox the bpp assay cannot provide an exact and well defined aoc quantification as the variability in oc compounds autochthonous biomass consortia and initial biomass concentrations inherent to the bpp assay rule out the existence of a fixed and uniform biomass to oc yield factor van der wielen and hijnen 2016 using acetate as model substrate furthermore pirt 1982 demonstrated that the oc to biomass yield correlates positively with the biomass growth rate i e is not constant under oligotrophic conditions and slowly biodegradable oc nevertheless adopting theoretical approximations allows estimations on the order of magnitude level as follows the 14 day bpp incubation results of the field monitoring and filtration experiments were therefore used here to estimate the respective oc consumptions for biomass growth cg from the biomass increase in the growth phase for maintenance cm from the minimal biomass concentration atpmin assuming for simplification reasons a constant oc consumption for maintenance throughout the whole incubation and the total oc consumption cg cm by the by the following theoretical calculations main parameters are also indicated in fig 1a cg atpmax atpmin 250 2 and cm atpmin 250 md 14 the factors 250 2 and 14 respectively represent the c µg l to atp ng l conversion factor karl et al 1981 the commonly applied ratio between dissimilation and assimilation biomass production heijnen and van dijken 1992 and the duration of the bpp incubation days for the biomass specific maintenance rate md a value of 0 29 0 06 µg c µg biomass c day at the bpp incubation temperature of 25 c was adopted here based on data by tijhuis et al 1993 their eq 21 as the average for six organic compounds under aerobic conditions as listed in table s1 and following their conclusion that md was significantly impacted by the temperature but not by the electron donor receptor system in analogy to the approach of blokker and van der wielen 2018 3 results 3 1 quantitative relationship between bacf filtrate high mw oc and mgp the impact of high mw oc on mgp was verified under controlled conditions in the laboratory by the addition of increasing amounts of a high mw oc concentrate isolated from bacf filtrate to a blank water water quality data of the bacf filtrate and blank water in table s2 as shown in figs 2 a and 2b aoc a3 and bpc14 increased linearly as function of the high mw oc concentration r2 0 89 at concentrations above 25 µg l whereas aoc p17 nox remained low in all samples the clear increase of aoc a3 vis á vis aoc p17 nox demonstrated the responsiveness of aoc a3 to the high mw oc compounds present in drinking water in line with the nutritional characteristics of the pure cultures applied in the respective mgp assays section 2 3 moreover bpc14 correlated well with aoc a3 r2 0 88 but not with aoc p17 nox similar to findings later presented in section 3 2 laboratory filtration and sections 3 3 and 3 4 field monitoring in addition the observed bpp incubations typically featured stable and low atp levels without any distinct sharp spikes in the first seven days followed by a gradual increase up to eventual stabilization in the second week this curve shape is representative for mgp being dominated by slowly biodegradable high mw compounds van der kooij et al 2015 whereas bpp curves in waters with high concentrations of easily assimilable oc after advanced oxidation van der kooij et al 2015 and 2017 or by acetate addition van der wielen and hijnen 2016 show a steep increase of atp during the first few days followed by a decline the slopes of the linear trend lines in figs 2a and 2b were used to determine the ratio between mgp and the high mw oc concentration the obtained values of the respective ratio s for bpc14 and aoc a3 were higher in summer 1 2 ng d µg and 0 06 µg µg than in winter 0 6 ng d µg and 0 04 µg µg which suggested the presence of a seasonal difference concluding the experimental data thus clearly demonstrate the potency of high mw oc to induce mgp in bacf filtrate according to a linear relationship of which the mgp to high mw oc concentration ratio is seasonally variable how the individual subfractions encompassed by the total high mw oc contribute to mgp and how this explains the variability of their ratio will be addressed in the following sections 3 2 relationships between high mw oc particle size and mgp for bacf filtrate based on the results presented by schurer et al 2019 the importance of the sub micron particle size subfraction of the high mw oc for mgp was further verified by laboratory filtration experiments here bacf filtrate water quality data in table s3 was filtered through membranes with pore sizes of 0 22 0 45 and 3 0 µm with results as shown in fig 3 which for comparison also includes data of the same bacf filtrate after ultrafiltration with membrane pores sizes of 0 02 and 0 12 µm schurer et al 2019 the relative passages of bpc14 aoc a3 atp and cell counts all showed a marked change in the 0 12 to 0 45 µm pore size range whereas the change in lcocd biopolymer passage remained comparatively small this suggests that the large change in mgp is caused by only a small fraction of the totally present high mw oc the concentrations of the other lcocd fractions remained unaltered by the filtrations implying that bpc14 and aoc a3 were not significantly affected by these oc fractions although the hydrodynamic conditions partially differ between the laboratory filtrations and ultrafiltration the respective retentions of the various oc fractions were clearly distinguishable and in agreement with expectations based on their mw the applied membrane pore sizes and the size exclusion filtration mechanism furthermore the samples bpc14 curves in figure s4 correlated well with aoc a3 r2 0 92 as well as with atp and cell count r2 0 80 in a similar way as the addition series and the bacf filtrate field monitoring later discussed in section 3 4 based on these results it is thus concluded that mgp as bpc14 and aoc a3 in bacf filtrate is mostly attributable to the sub micron 0 12 0 45 µm particle size which coincides with the microbial biomass subfraction of the total high mw oc the validity of this principle finding under laboratory conditions for practice water treatment conditions will be explored in the next section 3 3 seasonal variability of high mw oc biomass and mgp in feed water and treated water the water quality data of the feed water pretreated water and bacf filtrate obtained during the field monitoring of the full scale treatment plant are summarized in table 2 water temperature high mw oc biomass and mgp parameters all exhibited clear seasonal variabilities in feed water pretreated water and bacf filtrate as shown in figs 4 a f the observed average levels and reductions of the field monitoring parameters were in the same range as reported in literature for similar treatment trains and feed waters van der kooij et al 2015 park et al 2016 hijnen et al 2018 the water temperature ranged between 5 and 22 c and was above 10 13 c in the period between april to october which is henceforth designated as summer here high mw oc biomass and mgp in the feed water and pretreated water all reached maximum levels in summer algal density in the feed water cyanobacteria and diatoms was also the highest in summer the concentrations of high mw oc in bacf filtrate fig 4c were mostly higher and more irregular in winter 100 150 µg l than in summer 50 µg l this seasonal pattern was thus contrary to that of the feed water removal of high mw oc in the pretreatment and bacf filtration was thus seasonally variable and appreciably higher 60 in summer than in winter where reductions dropped to negligible or even negative amounts i e release mgp and biomass were mainly removed in the pretreatment average reduction 70 to 90 whereas additional reduction in the bacf filtration was only small less than 10 bpc14 aoc a3 atp and cell count exhibited a similar seasonal pattern in bacf filtrate as in the feed and pretreated water i e with maximum levels occurring in the summer period figs 4d f cell count data not shown atp was cell bound free atp 1 ng l and correlated well with intact rp 0 87 n 28 and total cell count rs 0 71 n 36 microbial and invertebrate activity in the bacf filters was also the highest in summer as indicated by the increases in oxygen consumption in the filter beds and in the concentrations of invertebrate biomass and their detritus fig 4e concentrations of aoc p17 nox in bacf filtrate table 2 were without any obvious seasonal pattern data not shown and remained on average around the 10 µg l considered as upper level to avoid regrowth by low mw oc compounds van der kooij et al 1992 the absence of possible p phosphorus limitation was verified by the observed similarity of bpp incubation curves with and without the assays s standard p addition schurer et al 2019 3 4 relationships between high mw oc biomass and mgp in the field monitoring study the treatment plant monitoring data were investigated on correlations between mgp oc and biomass parameters with results shown in table 3 the aggregated data set of feed water pretreated water and bacf filtrate showed that mgp as bpc14 and aoc a3 correlated well with the high mw oc concentration phmoc and lcocd biopolymer and not significantly with aoc p17 nox the observed bpp incubation curve shape fig 1b was typical for mgp dominated by slowly biodegradable high mw oc compounds as described in section 3 1 these results confirmed the general importance of high mw oc for mgp in line with the approach and results by hijnen et al 2018 for similar surface water treatment conditions the current study showed furthermore that bpc14 and aoc a3 correlated strongly with biomass measured as atp which was newly included as additional parameter here the strong correlation observed between phmoc and lcocd biopolymer concentrations was in line with schurer et al 2019 additionally parameter correlations were evaluated separately for bacf filtrate alone since its seasonal pattern of high mw oc concentrations was different i e opposite from that in the other water types section 3 3 for bacf filtrate the correlation between bpc14 and aoc a3 was strong as shown in table 3 and fig 5 a both mgp parameters correlated poorly with aoc p17 nox lcocd low mw oc concentrations and only moderately with invertebrate biomass and detritus correlation with the lcocd humic substances concentration was moderately well but the existence of a strong causal relationship was rejected by the results of the laboratory filtration experiments previously described the observed good correlations between total mgp as bpc14 and the biodegradable biopolymer concentration aoc a3 the typical bpp incubation curve shapes the linearity observed in the high mw oc addition series and the importance of the 0 12 µm particle size fraction observed in the filtration experiments all pointed consistently to a strong connection between mgp and the presence of slowly biodegradable high mw oc compounds however despite these indications that mgp was dominated by high mw oc no significant correlation was observed between mgp and the high mw oc concentration in bacf filtrate therefore their relationship was investigated on the presence of temporal systematic trends by assessing the ratios of bpc14 and aoc a3 to the high mw oc concentration in bacf filtrate calculated from the paired field monitoring data as shown in fig 6 the ratios exhibited a clear seasonal pattern with minima and maxima in winter and summer respectively in the range of 0 5 to 4 0 ng d µg bpc14 and of 0 02 to 0 3 µg µg aoc a3 these values agree well with the seasonal ranking and order of magnitude obtained in the addition series experiment assuming that mgp remains linear to the high mw oc concentration and independent from aoc p17 nox the observed pattern in the mgp high mw oc concentration ratio thus indicates that the overall biodegradability of totally present high mw oc is seasonally variable in addition the field monitoring data importantly showed that mgp as bpc14 and aoc a3 correlated well to strongly with the biomass parameters cell count and atp for bacf filtrate as shown in table 3 and fig 5b this demonstrates that the importance of the biomass associated high mw oc subfraction for mgp as suggested by the filtration experiments outcome is also valid under the practical conditions of full scale bacf filtration the particular importance of the biomass associated high mw oc subfraction also explains the aforementioned seasonal variability of the total high mw oc s biodegradability the results thus show that mgp in bacf filtrate is not governed exclusively by the totally present quantity of high mw oc but instead is predominantly determined by the microbial biomass associated subfraction of the high mw oc 3 5 biomass oc content and consumption for maintenance and growth to provide a theoretical understanding of the role of biomass in mgp the oc quantities present in the biomass as well as the oc quantities consumed by the biomass were estimated for bacf filtrate using field monitoring data table 2 bpp incubation curves and literature conversion factors by the approach described in section 2 8 assuming a cell volume range between 0 15 and 1 0 µm3 and a c content of 10 to 100 fg per µm3 the average total cell count of 0 6 106 ml amounts to a biomass oc content of 10 60 µg c l using a c atp ratio of 250 the average 12 ng l atp in bacf filtrate which accounts for 50 of the totally present bacterial biomass based on the ratio between intact and total cell counts amounts to a significantly lower 6 µg biomass c l the invertebrate biomass c was estimated at a low 1 µg l 5 of the average 21 µg l fresh weight seeing the good correlations of bpc14 and aoc a3 with atp the biomass theoretical total oc consumption during the 14 day bpp incubations cm cg was calculated based on the biomass concentration present at the moment of sample collection atp0 for field sampled and laboratory filtered bacf filtrate as shown in fig 7 a the calculated total oc consumption increased as function of atp0 and ranged from 5 to 20 µg l which was in the same order of magnitude as the aoc a3 concentrations measured in bacf filtrate the share of cm of the total oc consumption was 30 to 80 and this proportion increased for higher atp0 levels fig 7b the impact of the initial biomass concentration in shifting the oc consumption from biomass growth towards biomass maintenance is also qualitatively observable in the shape of the bpp incubation curves of bacf filtrate fig 1b samples with higher levels of atp0 showed flatter curves with a smaller atp increase in the growth phase but also a persistence of stable and high atp levels throughout the latter half of the incubation period overall these results emphasize the importance of biomass maintenance vis á vis growth in the growth potential assessment of disinfectant free drinking water produced from eutrophic reservoir water containing significant levels of initial biomass and a slowly biodegradable oc nutrient matrix 4 discussion 4 1 the impact of feed water quality on treated water high mw oc biomass and mgp the detailed monitoring conducted in the current study enables a more detailed evaluation of the impact of the feed water quality and treatment efficiency on the produced drinking water represented by bacf filtrate high mw oc biomass and mgp than hitherto available the simultaneity of algal abundance in the reservoirs and increased concentrations of high mw oc in the plant s feed water points to a seasonal summerly production of high mw oc by the reservoir ecosystem a mixture of biopolymeric substances such as carbohydrates amino acids amino sugars proteins lipids and fatty acids can be produced by algae depending on their abundance speciation and growth phase nguyen et al 2005 pivokonsky et al 2006 pivokonsky et al 2014 the high proportion of carbohydrates 55 supports the high mw oc s algal origin pivokonsky et al 2014 hijnen et al 2018 the results thus show that algal activity can be a major and variable source of high mw oc in surface water treatment the opposite seasonal trends in the feed water and bacf filtrate high mw oc concentrations show that the impact of the feed water s quality on the produced drinking water s mgp is more complex than a straightforward direct and constant passage through the treatment steps the observed pretreatment s seasonally variable removal efficiency for high mw oc at unchanged coagulant dose suggests that its coagulability is affected by the ambient water temperature and the high mw oc concentration and composition e g the ratio between proteinous and polysaccharidic substances pivokonsky et al 2006 further removal by the bacf filtration correlates with water temperature and biological activity in the filters which suggests a major but only seasonally present role of biodegradation in line with siembida lösch et al 2015 biomass is largely but not completely removed in the conventional pretreatment whereas removal in bacf filtration is seasonally variable servais et al 1991 furthermore the pretreatment and bacf filtration steps can induce appreciable shifts in the biomass microbiome lautenschlager et al 2014 park et al 2016 with seasonal variability in biomass density in bacf filtration servais et al 1991 which suggests that only a minor part of the bacf filtrate biomass originates from the feed water further understanding of the fate and interactions between high mw oc and biomass throughout the treatment and their eventual impact on the drinking water s mgp is of interest e g by detailed characterization of the high mw oc s chemistry e g nguyen et al 2005 villacorte et al 2015 and biomass microbiome in addition revealing the biomass metabolic activity and pathways by novel metagenomic and proteomic methods is potentially promising in clarifying the relationship between aoc compounds biomass and mgp although they are still in an experimental phase of application 4 2 the significances of the high mw oc subfractions for mgp the results obtained by the addition series filtration experiments and field monitoring in this study all point to the new insight of the specific importance of the biomass associated sub micron fraction of the high mw oc for mgp as bpc14 and aoc a3 in bacf filtrate thus mgp is impacted by not only the concentration but also by the composition of the high mw oc especially the biomass associated subfraction as a result mgp can be high despite low concentrations of high mw oc as witnessed here for summer conditions in the bacf filtrate investigated here this explains the spread observed in the correlation between bpc14 and the high mw oc concentration observed for similar water types by hijnen et al 2018 r2 0 71 for the aggregated data set of raw water pretreated water and bacf filtrate in addition to the aforementioned major importance of the sub micron biomass associated high mw oc subfraction for mgp also the residual biodegradable oc fractions of a smaller particle size may still be relevant for mgp and biostability the observation that the 0 12 µm pore size ultrafiltrates and laboratory filtrates featured a comparatively low but still measurable level of bpc14 despite being devoid of bacterial biomass and aoc a3 type compounds section 3 2 of this paper and schurer et al 2019 shows that also the oc fractions which are not retained by the filtrations can still serve as nutrient source but induce a lower level of mgp fig 3 this residual oc contains smaller biopolymers humic substances and lower mw oc the latter fraction is to some extent biodegradable as reflected by the aoc p17 nox values however the bpp incubation curve shapes of the laboratory filtrations still suggest prevalence of slowly biodegradable oc possibly being the residual non filterable biopolymers or an association with humic compounds volk et al 1997 4 3 theoretical comparison of biomass oc content and consumptions to further substantiate the importance of the high mw oc subfractions for mgp observed in the field monitoring and laboratory experiments the respective contributions of the various high mw oc subfractions to the aoc pool as well as the consumption of oc by the microbial biomass are evaluated and compared as follows based on the theoretical approach and its background described in section 2 8 the estimated oc quantity in invertebrates is very low 1 µg c l compared to that of microbial biomass as well as aoc p17 nox and aoc a3 and is therefore most likely irrelevant for mgp the estimated average microbial biomass oc content in the bacf filtrate is in the range 10 60 µg c l the estimated oc consumption by the microbial biomass in bacf filtrate during the 14 day bpp incubation cm cg of 12 4 µg l was in the same order of magnitude as the estimated microbial biomass oc content but also similar to the measured aoc a3 concentrations 9 4 μ g l the similarity in biomass oc and aoc a3 quantities is further supported by using data of growth experiments of the aoc a3 s test strain a3 f johnsoniae on biomass substrates of pure p17 and nox cultures performed by sack et al 2009 from their original data a3 yield factors of 0 29 and 0 10 cfu cfu were derivable under the assumption that these values are representative for the growth of a3 on bacf filtrate microbial biomass and using the aoc a3 assays calibration factor of 1 3 104 cfu µg c sack et al 2011 the average bacf filtrate total cell count of 0 6 106 cells ml is equivalent to an aoc a3 content of 5 13 µg c l this value also corresponds well to the aoc a3 levels measured in the bacf filtrate the similarity in the respective estimated quantities of the oc consumption cm cg the oc present in the biomass subfraction and the aoc a3 concentrations shows that the observed importance of the microbial biomass high mw oc subfraction for mgp is also realistic from a theoretical viewpoint a possible mechanism for growth and maintenance associated with cell biomass of which the principle was shown by sack et al 2010 for a3 is the reuse of soluble organic carbon material released by intact cells and or particulate cellular debris after solubilization cryptic growth banks and bryers 1990 on the other hand cm cg is well below the totally present high mw oc concentration 15 to 30 of the 100 50 µg l lcocd biopolymer table 2 this suggests that part of the high mw oc is potentially still available for further assimilation by the biomass also after the 14 day period used as evaluation basis here 4 4 the importance of biomass maintenance in drinking water with a slowly biodegradable high mw oc nutrient matrix the evaluations of the bacf filtrate bpp incubations in section 3 5 show that the presence of significant amounts of initial biomass in a slowly biodegradable aoc pool results in the shift of oc consumption from biomass growth towards maintenance the potential importance of biomass maintenance is further emphasized by extending the bpp incubations to 28 days as incidentally performed for the laboratory filtrations curves in figure s4 these curves show that biomass levels remain stable and high also after the initial 14 day bpp incubation period this demonstrates the capability of the bacf filtrate aoc matrix to support biomass maintenance at a significant biomass level for an extended period for an assumed prolongation of biomass maintenance at the level of atpmax by a second 14 days a total oc consumption of 30 11 µg l is calculated of which 85 for maintenance cm this oc consumption exceeds the available aoc a3 quantity but is still below the total high mw oc quantity present as lcocd biopolymer and phmoc and might thus be supported by that other aoc e g the residual biopolymers humic substances and or recycled cellular material summarizing the bpp results and theoretical oc estimations obtained in this study highlight the relative importance of biomass maintenance over biomass growth in drinking water dominated by slowly biodegradable high mw oc compounds and the ensuing potential to sustain prolonged stable biomass levels in that drinking water van der kooij et al 2017 4 5 implications of the findings for biostability during treatment and distribution this paper demonstrates the specific relevance of the microbial high mw oc subfraction for biostability as assessed by mgp bioassays for the investigated treated surface water type mgp is thus not only dependent on the totally present high mw oc s quantity but also and predominantly on its ambient biomass content therefore treated water mgp levels can be high even at low high mw oc concentrations and vice versa the results thus support that thorough removal of microbial biomass and simultaneously other inorganic particulates in the water treatment may be promising in reducing the drinking water s mgp schurer et al 2019 however also the other non biomass associated oc fractions still contribute to mgp e g at situations of high aoc p17 nox levels and should therefore be included in monitoring and evaluations this study also highlights the potential of drinking water containing slowly degradable high mw oc to maintain stable and high biomass levels the findings made here for the produced treated water have potentially important implications for the biostability conditions in the supplied distribution network similar to the treated water the slowly biodegradable oc matrix may enable a sustained presence of stable and high levels of biomass bacteria protozoa and invertebrates in biofilm and suspended state in the distribution network and thus negatively affects regrowth and biostability boe hansen et al 2003 van der kooij et al 2017 hijnen et al 2018 the importance of biomass maintenance in the produced drinking water as discussed in the current study raises the question whether this parameter might serve as predictor for regrowth in the distribution network and if so which threshold level applies the prolonged biomass maintenance in oligotrophic treated water bacf filtrate observed here is in line with similar findings for slow sand filtrate by van der kooij et al 2017 data from that study indicate that regrowth defined here as the abundance of the indicator organism aeromonas in the distribution network is low for maintenance levels of 3 4 ng atp l in the produced drinking water and increases for 15 ng atp l maintenance levels to which the levels observed in the current study were similar however further interpretation must be made with caution as the respective produced waters also differed in other water quality aspects such as aoc furthermore the relationship between produced water mgp and the biostability and regrowth in the distribution network is complex seen the variety in nutrient uptake paths and physical environments the aoc compounds may contribute to regrowth conditions by direct and slow but long term uptake in biofilms on the pipe wall and loose deposits in the distribution system and further onto higher trophic levels such as invertebrates van lieverloo et al 2012 sack et al 2014 also bio physical agglomeration of oc compounds onto iron and manganese hydroxide particles may accelerate formation of loose deposits and biofilm camper 2004 ginige et al 2011 furthermore physical conditions such as temperature flow velocity residence time network configuration presence of sediments pipe wall roughness and piping and plumbing materials affect biostability and regrowth in the distribution network camper 2004 prévost et al 1998 liu et al 2014 prest et al 2016 the used mgp and oc characterization methods showed their value in elucidating the relationship between high mw oc and mgp and the relevance of biomass maintenance in detail in oligotrophic drinking water it is recommended that future studies include biological parameters atp flow cytometry based cell count volume and growth assays bgp as well as microbiome fingerprinting proteomics and metagenomics to further understand this relationship additional work on the effects and interactions of various conditions of the concentrations and types of high mw oc biomass and iron and manganese particulates on regrowth and biomass presence in full scale distribution networks and controllable model networks e g recirculation pipe simulators and annular or disk reactors biofilm monitors will further foster this understanding 5 conclusions the relationship between microbial growth potential mgp and high molecular weight organic carbon high mw oc comprising biopolymers invertebrates and microbial biomass was investigated for a surface water treatment plant using eutrophic reservoir water and disinfectant free distribution leading to the following conclusions i mgp of the treated water is determined by high mw oc and is mainly attributable to the microbial biomass associated 0 12 µm particle size subfraction of the high mw oc the other residual high mw oc and oc fractions of lower mw induce a minor but still measurable mgp ii treated water mgp increases linearly as function of the high mw oc s concentration with a ratio which is seasonally variable depending on the ambient biomass quantity in the high mw oc iii levels of high mw oc biomass and mgp feature clear seasonal patterns in feed water and treated water all show maximum levels in summer except the treated water s high mw oc concentration which has an opposite seasonal pattern due to seasonally variable removal in the treatment steps iv for the slowly biodegradable high mw oc nutrient matrix microbial biomass maintenance dominates over growth resulting in prolonged stable and high levels of microbial biomass v the levels of mgp and high mw oc including biomass are both important for biostability assessment the importance of biomass maintenance by a slowly biodegradable oc matrix derived here for produced water implies that similar conditions potentially affect regrowth and biostability in the distribution network in a negative way future research is to focus on the relationship between the oc matrix and mgp of the produced drinking water and the ensuing microbial and invertebrate activity in the distribution network eventually leading to the establishment of threshold values for these oc

16416,drinking water must be sufficiently biostable to avoid excessive microbial and invertebrate growth in disinfectant free distribution systems the production of biologically stable drinking water is challenging for conventional surface water treatment plants using reservoirs as feed water due to the presence of slowly biodegradable particulate and high molecular weight biopolymeric organic carbon high mw oc which increases the microbial growth potential mgp in the feed water and produced drinking water the study presented here provides new insights in the relationship between high mw oc and mgp for a full scale surface water treatment plant controlled conditions addition series experiments showed that mgp increases linearly with the high mw oc concentration with a seasonally variable ratio laboratory filtration indicated that mgp is mainly attributable to the high mw oc subfraction of 0 12 µm particle size coinciding with microbial biomass intensive field monitoring revealed clear seasonal patterns in the plant s feed water and treated water levels of high mw oc biomass and mgp these parameters reach maximum levels in the periods of high water temperature with the notable exception of the treated water s high mw oc concentration which exhibits an opposite seasonal pattern reflecting seasonally variable removal in the treatment moreover the field monitoring showed that mgp correlates well with the concentrations of biodegradable biopolymeric oc and with microbial biomass measured as atp adenosine triphosphate and cell counts but not with the total high mw oc concentration in the treated water theoretical estimations showed that the oc quantities present in and consumed by the microbial biomass are in the same order of magnitude as slowly biodegradable biopolymers from these results it is concluded that specifically the microbial biomass associated and biodegradable biopolymeric oc subfraction of the totally present high mw oc is important for mgp finally the mgp assay results and theoretical calculations showed for the high mw oc matrix that the microbial biomass oc consumption for maintenance is significant vis á vis that for growth and that

enhances the water s quality by reducing byproduct formation and improving odor and taste and is therefore increasingly being implemented in e g the netherlands scandinavia switzerland and germany a critically important condition to enable such disinfectant free distribution is that the produced drinking water is biostable and excess abundance of microbial and invertebrate biomass in the distribution network is avoided rittman and snoeyink 1984 van der kooij et al 1999 van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 such excessive biomass regrowth may result in the violation of regulatory limits on

veenendaal 2013 liu et al 2014 hijnen et al 2018 a biologically stable drinking water is characterized by low concentrations of assimilable biodegradable organic carbon aoc and ensuing low levels of microbial growth potential mgp van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 several in vitro bio assay methods have become available to quantify the mgp ofdrinking water as compound specific assimilable oc aoc aoc p17 nox aoc a3 and overall growth potential bpp biomass production potential bgp bacterial growth potential van der kooij et al 1982 hammes and egli 2005 van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 sack et al 2010 2011 these methods have been applied amongst other biostability parameters such as doc biomass biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc and biofilm formation rate bfr in multiple case studies on water treatment and distribution these studies demonstrated that it is challenging to produce adequately biostable drinking water from eutrophic lake and reservoir water bysurface water treatment trains which typically comprise conventional pretreatment coagulation separation rapid media filtration main disinfection ultraviolet ozonation or advanced oxidation and biological activated carbon filtration bacf commonly easily biodegradable low mw compounds measured as aoc p17 nox have traditionally been considered as the main parameter for biostability van der kooij et al 1982 lechevallier et al 1993 however several studies have proved that the presence of especially slowly biodegradable biopolymeric high molecular weight mw organic carbon high mw oc which originates from the source surface water negatively affects the mgp and biological stability of the produced drinking water volk et al 1997 park et al 2016 schurer et al 2019 and causes regrowth in the distribution network van der kooij et al 2015 hijnen et al 2018 this high mw oc fraction comprises the respective subfractions of colloidal biopolymeric substances polysaccharides long chain fatty acids and proteins submicron to micron 0 1 1 0 µm sized particulates in the form of bacterial biomass van der kooij et al 2015 and larger sized invertebrates 1 2 gaps in the understanding of the relationships between high mw oc and mgp in biostability assessment in surface water treatment the biological stability of drinking water can be enhanced by implementation of water treatment processes which target the reduction of high mw oc and aoc levels such as river bank and dune infiltration slow sand filtration and membrane filtration ultrafiltration nanofiltration or reversed osmosis escobar et al 2000 hammes et al 2010 van der kooij et al 2017 schurer et al 2019 however such processes entail significant treatment costs spatial footprint demand infiltration slow sand filtration and or energy consumption water losses and concentrate disposal challenges membrane filtration selection of the optimal surface water treatment approach to produce biostable drinking water thus necessitates a solid understanding of the relationship between high mw oc and biostability the particular importance of high mw oc for biostability of drinking water produced from eutrophic reservoir water as presented in literature is based on correlations with various mgp bio assay methods and observed regrowth in distribution systems however the understanding of the relationship between the mgp parameters as measured in produced water and the overall biostability in the disinfectant free distribution network is still in development prévost et al 1998 van der kooij et al 1999 van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 prest et al 2016 hijnen et al 2018 schurer et al 2019 the latter two studies revealed that mgp as bpp correlated well with the concentration of high mw oc and not with the concentration of easily assimilable oc in drinking water where mgp was oc limited but also that this relationship showed a considerable statistical uncertainty the main complicating factor here is that the broad and changing composition and thus biodegradability of the aoc pool present in field samples inherently induces a variability in the responses of the mgp assays and thus affects the mgp high mw oc relationship in addition the respective importances of the subfractions encompassed by the totally present bulk high mw oc for biostability is currently not fully clear schurer et al 2019 showed that ultrafiltration of bacf filtrate reduced mgp by 50 to 90 depending on the specific parameter which demonstrated the importance of the high mw oc fraction for mgp but did not yet provide further discrimination for the 0 12 µm particle size high mw oc subfraction therefore a more detailed differentiation between the respective contributions of the biopolymeric microbial and invertebrate biomass subfractions on mgp is desired to clarify their impact on biostability furthermore surface water treatment in temperate climates is subjected to seasonal variations of several abiotic and biotic factors seasonal variations apply in the plant feed water s temperature and concentration and composition of biomass and algal originated high mw oc but also in the treatment s removal efficiency of these compoundsated water van der kooij et al 2015 park et al 2016 such seasonal factors likely impact the produced water s biostability but their effects have not yet been reported in detail finally the impact of the slowly biodegradable high mw oc matrix on the levels of microbial biomass which can be sustained under oligotrophic conditions in drinking water requires attention using bpp data van der kooij et al 2015 2017 qualitatively showed that the available aoc is used not only for growth assimilation but also for maintenance dissimilation of the microbial biomass in the water sample a dominance of biomass maintenance over growth could lead to the presence of stable and high levels of biomass for prolonged periods which potentially has important implications for biostability and regrowth in disinfectant free distribution networks 1 3 objective of this study the objective of the present study is to investigate in detail the relationship between high mw oc and biostability measured as mgp in the same drinking water produced from surface water as studied before by hijnen et al 2018 and schurer et al 2019 by specifically addressing i their quantitative relationship under controlled conditions ii the respective importances of the submicron particulate and biomass high mw oc s subfractions for mgp iii their seasonal variations and parameter correlations in the plant s feed water pretreated water and produced drinking water and iv the impact of a high mw oc matrix on the balance between biomass growth and maintenance and its implication for biostability in the distribution network these objectives were approached by a combination of extensive field monitoring at a full scale surface water treatment plant laboratory experimentation under controlled conditions and theoretical calculations using approximated conversion and yield factors 2 methods and materials 2 1 research outline and test site the relationship between mgp and high mw oc and its subfractions was investigated for the treated water represented by bacf filtrate of a surface water treatment plant by a combination of laboratory experiments field data monitoring and evaluation and

monitoring encompassed method details are provided in sections 2 2 to 2 4 high mw oc lcocd biopolymer and phmoc biomass atp cell count and invertebrate count microbial growth potential mgp on easily biodegradable low mw oc by aoc p17 nox on slowly biodegradable biopolymers by aoc a3 and total mgp by bpp the laboratory experiments and field monitoring involved a full scale surface water treatment plant of evides water company in the south western area of the netherlands which was the same site for previous studies on biostability by hijnen et al 2018 and schurer et al 2019 the plant uses reservoir water as raw water source feed water which contains seasonally high concentrations of high mw oc the produced water features comparatively high levels of high mw oc and mgp as bpp and aoc a3 and regrowth is observed in the disinfectant free distribution network the configuration of the treatment plant and its feed water source is described in short as follows abstracted river water is stored in open reservoirs four month detention period and subsequently conveyed to the treatment plant after low dose chlorination to prevent clamshell growth in the transport mains 0 5 mg l cl2 no

was determined as the biopolymer fraction in liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lcocd huber et al 2011 20 kda mw and as particulate and or high molecular weight organic carbon phmoc van der kooij et al 2015 hijnen et al 2018 based on their earlier good correlation for bacf filtrate schurer et al 2019 in brief the phmoc was the total organic carbon toc by shimadzu v content of the concentrate obtained after crossflow ultrafiltration of 100 l freshly sampled water over a 30 kda membrane hf80s fresenius medical care van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 the concentrate encompassing all colloidal oc 30 kda 0 01 µm and particulate oc including all microbial and invertebrate biomass the standard lcocd method included 0 45 µm prefiltration and therefore any larger particulate organic material was excluded from the analytical results lcocd was also used to quantify other oc fractions humic compounds building blocks low mw neutral and acidic compounds 2 3 analytical methods microbial growth potential mgp the microbial growth potential mgp of the water was assessed with the well defined pure culture bioassays aoc p17 nox for easily assimilable low mw oc and aoc a3 for biodegradable biopolymer oc and with the autochthonous bacteria based biomass production potential bpp bioassay for the totally present biodegradable oc pool van der kooij et al 1992 sack et al 2010 2011 and van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 all analyses were conducted in duplicate in aoc free glassware erlenmeyer flasks and processed within 24 h after sampling and storage at 4 c to prevent decay of the oc or biomass matrix the aoc concentrations were determined from the maximum growth as colony count of selected pure bacterial cultures in water samples after pasteurization addition of phosphate and nitrate to ensure growth limitation on oc and incubation in the dark at 15 c using yield factors available for strains p17 and nox on acetate c and for a3 on a mix of poly saccharides and proteins fructose maltose laminarin amylopectin xyloglucan proline and gelatin the bpp assay involved the monitoring of the autochthonous biomass concentration as atp adenosine triphosphate in unpasteurized water samples during incubation in dark 25 c after phosphate and nitrate addition and after inoculation with 1 ml bacf filtrate in the experiments described in sections 2 5 and 2 6 to re introduce the original autochthonous consortium the cumulative atp concentration during the bpp14 day incubation period bpc14 ng atp d l represented the combined response of biomass growth and maintenance van der kooij et al 2015 2 4 analytical methods biomass and other parameters microbial biomass in the water phase was monitored as total atp adenosine triphosphate for active biomass and total and membrane intact cell counts for bacterial numbers total atp was determined spectrophotometrically celsis method with luminex reagentia charles river at 10 s incubation van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 total and intact cell counts were enumerated by flow cytometry according to the protocol and equipment bd accuri c6 described by prest et al 2013 invertebrate and invertebrate detritus speciation density and biovolume were determined by visual microscopic inspection of 100 to 500 ml water samples using a dissection microscope leica mz apo magnification up to 100 and the bacchus automated size measurement system carpentier et al 1999 and were expressed as total fresh weight biomass obtained by multiplying the biovolume with an assumed density of 1 µg µm3 chlorophyll a determined according to the applicable nen 2006 standard was used as indicator for density of algae 2 5 determination of the quantitative relationship between high mw oc and mgp parameters by addition series experiments to verify the assumed importance of high mw oc for mgp the quantitative relationship between the concentration of high mw oc and ensuing responses in mgp parameters was investigated under controlled conditions by addition series experiments in the laboratory hereto a high mw oc concentrate was isolated from bacf filtrate by 30 kda ultrafiltration as described for the phmoc method section 2 2 and subsequently added in increasing amounts by pipetting to 600 ml blank water in aoc free erlenmeyer flasks the blank water was an aerobic groundwater with a low oc content and a high biological stability van der kooij and veenendaal 2013 next all flasks were pasteurized and inoculated with 1 ml bacf filtrate to establish the same natural microbial consortium in all samples and then further processed as aoc a3 aoc p17 nox for control purposes and bpp assays the experiments were conducted once in summer and once in winter to assess seasonal differences 2 6 particle size distribution of high mw oc and mgp by laboratory filtration experiments the distribution of high mw oc biomass and mgp parameters according to particle size was investigated by laboratory filtration of bacf filtrate bacf filtrate was filtered under gravity over flat sheet membranes with pores sizes of respectively 0 1 0 22 0 4 and 3 µm millipore isopore polycarbonate 47 mm diameter types vctp04700 gttp04700 http04700 and tstp04700 respectively filter holders thermofisher scientific nalgene were autoclaved and the complete filtration setup including membranes was flushed with 6 l milli q water in advance of the actual filtration runs with bacf filtrate the obtained laboratory filtrates collected in 1 l aoc free glass schott duran bottles were poured over in aoc free erlenmeyer flasks and further analyzed on atp cell count lcocd aoc a3 and bpc14 the 0 1 µm laboratory filtration exhibited rapid filter clogging which necessitated frequent change of filter membrane whereas their bpp incubation curves featured a deviating shape and a significant spread between their duplicates these results were therefore considered to be unreliable and were excluded from further evaluation ultrafiltration results from schurer et al 2019 using the same water bacf filtrate and filtration principle size exclusion as the laboratory filtration were used to compare the effect of smaller membrane pore sizes 0 02 and 0 12 µm 2 7 seasonal variations and parameter correlations in high mw oc and mgp by field monitoring in the full scale surface water treatment plant the field monitoring study involved sampling on the parameters described in sections 2 2 to 2 4 in the full scale treatment plant s feed water pretreated water after rapid filtration or uv disinfection and bacf filtrate considered to be representative for distributed drinking water without interference of the clo2 post disinfection in the biomass and biostability analysis notably atp and intact cell count the monitoring period encompassed a four year period to cover multiple season alternations the field monitoring data set was evaluated on parameter correlations using realstats in ms excel for office 365 most of the data proved not normally distributed checked by shapiro wilk and were assessed by spearman rho correlation coefficient rs data with a normal distribution after log transformation were additionally assessed by pearson correlation coefficient rp correlations were classified as moderate good and strong for values of rp and rs ranging between 0 40 and 0 60 0 60 and 0 80 and 0 80 respectively all correlations with rp and rs 0 40 featured a p value of 0 02 meeting the significance criterion p 0 05 the results of the addition series experiments were evaluated on linearity by least square regression analysis and trend line fitting in ms excel for office 365 where the coefficient of determination r2 described the goodness of the fit 2 8 theoretical estimation of biomass oc content and oc consumptions for growth and maintenance the quantity of oc in the bacterial and invertebrate biomass in the bacf filtrate was calculated using conversion factors available from literature for atp 250 ng c ng atp karl 1980 and total cell count 10 to 120 fg c µm3 cell volume bratbak and dundas 1984 nagata 1986 fagerbakke et al 1996 khachikyan et al 2019 and 0 05 µg c µg fresh weight invertebrate biomass winberg et al 1971 and assuming that 25 of biomass is carbon for the waters studied here oc was considered to be the substrate most relevant as energy source for mgp as the concentrations of other potential energy sources were very low iron and manganese 5 µg l ammonia 10 µg l the oc consumption by the microbial biomass present in the water samples was estimated here from the bpp incubation curves including its distribution over respectively biomass growth and biomass maintenance the distinction between biomass growth and biomass maintenance was manifest in the bpp incubation curves typical for bacf filtrate as shown in fig 1 a and 1b as follows firstly atp i e biomass levels drop rapidly from the initial level at sampling atp0 to a stabilized minimum level atpmin in the lag phase where the biomass adapts to the incubation environment the subsequent increase from atpmin to atpmax indicates the production of biomass in the growth phase at the maximum reached level atpmax biomass concentrations remain constant stationary phase where the available oc is used for the maintenance of the cells membrane integrity osmotic condition and protein renewal the bpc14 value indicated in fig 1a thus encompasses both maintenance and growth of the biomass oc consumptions by the microbial biomass present in the water samples were estimated from the bpp incubation curves using theoretically derived yield factors unlike the aoc methods a3 and p17 nox the bpp assay cannot provide an exact and well defined aoc quantification as the variability in oc compounds autochthonous biomass consortia and initial biomass concentrations inherent to the bpp assay rule out the existence of a fixed and uniform biomass to oc yield factor van der wielen and hijnen 2016 using acetate as model substrate furthermore pirt 1982 demonstrated that the oc to biomass yield correlates positively with the biomass growth rate i e is not constant under oligotrophic conditions and slowly biodegradable oc nevertheless adopting theoretical approximations allows estimations on the order of magnitude level as follows the 14 day bpp incubation results of the field monitoring and filtration experiments were therefore used here to estimate the respective oc consumptions for biomass growth cg from the biomass increase in the growth phase for maintenance cm from the minimal biomass concentration atpmin assuming for simplification reasons a constant oc consumption for maintenance throughout the whole incubation and the total oc consumption cg cm by the by the following theoretical calculations main parameters are also indicated in fig 1a cg atpmax atpmin 250 2 and cm atpmin 250 md 14 the factors 250 2 and 14 respectively represent the c µg l to atp ng l conversion factor karl et al 1981 the commonly applied ratio between dissimilation and assimilation biomass production heijnen and van dijken 1992 and the duration of the bpp incubation days for the biomass specific maintenance rate md a value of 0 29 0 06 µg c µg biomass c day at the bpp incubation temperature of 25 c was adopted here based on data by tijhuis et al 1993 their eq 21 as the average for six organic compounds under aerobic conditions as listed in table s1 and following their conclusion that md was significantly impacted by the temperature but not by the electron donor receptor system in analogy to the approach of blokker and van der wielen 2018 3 results 3 1 quantitative relationship between bacf filtrate high mw oc and mgp the impact of high mw oc on mgp was verified under controlled conditions in the laboratory by the addition of increasing amounts of a high mw oc concentrate isolated from bacf filtrate to a blank water water quality data of the bacf filtrate and blank water in table s2 as shown in figs 2 a and 2b aoc a3 and bpc14 increased linearly as function of the high mw oc concentration r2 0 89 at concentrations above 25 µg l whereas aoc p17 nox remained low in all samples the clear increase of aoc a3 vis á vis aoc p17 nox demonstrated the responsiveness of aoc a3 to the high mw oc compounds present in drinking water in line with the nutritional characteristics of the pure cultures applied in the respective mgp assays section 2 3 moreover bpc14 correlated well with aoc a3 r2 0 88 but not with aoc p17 nox similar to findings later presented in section 3 2 laboratory filtration and sections 3 3 and 3 4 field monitoring in addition the observed bpp incubations typically featured stable and low atp levels without any distinct sharp spikes in the first seven days followed by a gradual increase up to eventual stabilization in the second week this curve shape is representative for mgp being dominated by slowly biodegradable high mw compounds van der kooij et al 2015 whereas bpp curves in waters with high concentrations of easily assimilable oc after advanced oxidation van der kooij et al 2015 and 2017 or by acetate addition van der wielen and hijnen 2016 show a steep increase of atp during the first few days followed by a decline the slopes of the linear trend lines in figs 2a and 2b were used to determine the ratio between mgp and the high mw oc concentration the obtained values of the respective ratio s for bpc14 and aoc a3 were higher in summer 1 2 ng d µg and 0 06 µg µg than in winter 0 6 ng d µg and 0 04 µg µg which suggested the presence of a seasonal difference concluding the experimental data thus clearly demonstrate the potency of high mw oc to induce mgp in bacf filtrate according to a linear relationship of which the mgp to high mw oc concentration ratio is seasonally variable how the individual subfractions encompassed by the total high mw oc contribute to mgp and how this explains the variability of their ratio will be addressed in the following sections 3 2 relationships between high mw oc particle size and mgp for bacf filtrate based on the results presented by schurer et al 2019 the importance of the sub micron particle size subfraction of the high mw oc for mgp was further verified by laboratory filtration experiments here bacf filtrate water quality data in table s3 was filtered through membranes with pore sizes of 0 22 0 45 and 3 0 µm with results as shown in fig 3 which for comparison also includes data of the same bacf filtrate after ultrafiltration with membrane pores sizes of 0 02 and 0 12 µm schurer et al 2019 the relative passages of bpc14 aoc a3 atp and cell counts all showed a marked change in the 0 12 to 0 45 µm pore size range whereas the change in lcocd biopolymer passage remained comparatively small this suggests that the large change in mgp is caused by only a small fraction of the totally present high mw oc the concentrations of the other lcocd fractions remained unaltered by the filtrations implying that bpc14 and aoc a3 were not significantly affected by these oc fractions although the hydrodynamic conditions partially differ between the laboratory filtrations and ultrafiltration the respective retentions of the various oc fractions were clearly distinguishable and in agreement with expectations based on their mw the applied membrane pore sizes and the size exclusion filtration mechanism furthermore the samples bpc14 curves in figure s4 correlated well with aoc a3 r2 0 92 as well as with atp and cell count r2 0 80 in a similar way as the addition series and the bacf filtrate field monitoring later discussed in section 3 4 based on these results it is thus concluded that mgp as bpc14 and aoc a3 in bacf filtrate is mostly attributable to the sub micron 0 12 0 45 µm particle size which coincides with the microbial biomass subfraction of the total high mw oc the validity of this principle finding under laboratory conditions for practice water treatment conditions will be explored in the next section 3 3 seasonal variability of high mw oc biomass and mgp in feed water and treated water the water quality data of the feed water pretreated water and bacf filtrate obtained during the field monitoring of the full scale treatment plant are summarized in table 2 water temperature high mw oc biomass and mgp parameters all exhibited clear seasonal variabilities in feed water pretreated water and bacf filtrate as shown in figs 4 a f the observed average levels and reductions of the field monitoring parameters were in the same range as reported in literature for similar treatment trains and feed waters van der kooij et al 2015 park et al 2016 hijnen et al 2018 the water temperature ranged between 5 and 22 c and was above 10 13 c in the period between april to october which is henceforth designated as summer here high mw oc biomass and mgp in the feed water and pretreated water all reached maximum levels in summer algal density in the feed water cyanobacteria and diatoms was also the highest in summer the concentrations of high mw oc in bacf filtrate fig 4c were mostly higher and more irregular in winter 100 150 µg l than in summer 50 µg l this seasonal pattern was thus contrary to that of the feed water removal of high mw oc in the pretreatment and bacf filtration was thus seasonally variable and appreciably higher 60 in summer than in winter where reductions dropped to negligible or even negative amounts i e release mgp and biomass were mainly removed in the pretreatment average reduction 70 to 90 whereas additional reduction in the bacf filtration was only small less than 10 bpc14 aoc a3 atp and cell count exhibited a similar seasonal pattern in bacf filtrate as in the feed and pretreated water i e with maximum levels occurring in the summer period figs 4d f cell count data not shown atp was cell bound free atp 1 ng l and correlated well with intact rp 0 87 n 28 and total cell count rs 0 71 n 36 microbial and invertebrate activity in the bacf filters was also the highest in summer as indicated by the increases in oxygen consumption in the filter beds and in the concentrations of invertebrate biomass and their detritus fig 4e concentrations of aoc p17 nox in bacf filtrate table 2 were without any obvious seasonal pattern data not shown and remained on average around the 10 µg l considered as upper level to avoid regrowth by low mw oc compounds van der kooij et al 1992 the absence of possible p phosphorus limitation was verified by the observed similarity of bpp incubation curves with and without the assays s standard p addition schurer et al 2019 3 4 relationships between high mw oc biomass and mgp in the field monitoring study the treatment plant monitoring data were investigated on correlations between mgp oc and biomass parameters with results shown in table 3 the aggregated data set of feed water pretreated water and bacf filtrate showed that mgp as bpc14 and aoc a3 correlated well with the high mw oc concentration phmoc and lcocd biopolymer and not significantly with aoc p17 nox the observed bpp incubation curve shape fig 1b was typical for mgp dominated by slowly biodegradable high mw oc compounds as described in section 3 1 these results confirmed the general importance of high mw oc for mgp in line with the approach and results by hijnen et al 2018 for similar surface water treatment conditions the current study showed furthermore that bpc14 and aoc a3 correlated strongly with biomass measured as atp which was newly included as additional parameter here the strong correlation observed between phmoc and lcocd biopolymer concentrations was in line with schurer et al 2019 additionally parameter correlations were evaluated separately for bacf filtrate alone since its seasonal pattern of high mw oc concentrations was different i e opposite from that in the other water types section 3 3 for bacf filtrate the correlation between bpc14 and aoc a3 was strong as shown in table 3 and fig 5 a both mgp parameters correlated poorly with aoc p17 nox lcocd low mw oc concentrations and only moderately with invertebrate biomass and detritus correlation with the lcocd humic substances concentration was moderately well but the existence of a strong causal relationship was rejected by the results of the laboratory filtration experiments previously described the observed good correlations between total mgp as bpc14 and the biodegradable biopolymer concentration aoc a3 the typical bpp incubation curve shapes the linearity observed in the high mw oc addition series and the importance of the 0 12 µm particle size fraction observed in the filtration experiments all pointed consistently to a strong connection between mgp and the presence of slowly biodegradable high mw oc compounds however despite these indications that mgp was dominated by high mw oc no significant correlation was observed between mgp and the high mw oc concentration in bacf filtrate therefore their relationship was investigated on the presence of temporal systematic trends by assessing the ratios of bpc14 and aoc a3 to the high mw oc concentration in bacf filtrate calculated from the paired field monitoring data as shown in fig 6 the ratios exhibited a clear seasonal pattern with minima and maxima in winter and summer respectively in the range of 0 5 to 4 0 ng d µg bpc14 and of 0 02 to 0 3 µg µg aoc a3 these values agree well with the seasonal ranking and order of magnitude obtained in the addition series experiment assuming that mgp remains linear to the high mw oc concentration and independent from aoc p17 nox the observed pattern in the mgp high mw oc concentration ratio thus indicates that the overall biodegradability of totally present high mw oc is seasonally variable in addition the field monitoring data importantly showed that mgp as bpc14 and aoc a3 correlated well to strongly with the biomass parameters cell count and atp for bacf filtrate as shown in table 3 and fig 5b this demonstrates that the importance of the biomass associated high mw oc subfraction for mgp as suggested by the filtration experiments outcome is also valid under the practical conditions of full scale bacf filtration the particular importance of the biomass associated high mw oc subfraction also explains the aforementioned seasonal variability of the total high mw oc s biodegradability the results thus show that mgp in bacf filtrate is not governed exclusively by the totally present quantity of high mw oc but instead is predominantly determined by the microbial biomass associated subfraction of the high mw oc 3 5 biomass oc content and consumption for maintenance and growth to provide a theoretical understanding of the role of biomass in mgp the oc quantities present in the biomass as well as the oc quantities consumed by the biomass were estimated for bacf filtrate using field monitoring data table 2 bpp incubation curves and literature conversion factors by the approach described in section 2 8 assuming a cell volume range between 0 15 and 1 0 µm3 and a c content of 10 to 100 fg per µm3 the average total cell count of 0 6 106 ml amounts to a biomass oc content of 10 60 µg c l using a c atp ratio of 250 the average 12 ng l atp in bacf filtrate which accounts for 50 of the totally present bacterial biomass based on the ratio between intact and total cell counts amounts to a significantly lower 6 µg biomass c l the invertebrate biomass c was estimated at a low 1 µg l 5 of the average 21 µg l fresh weight seeing the good correlations of bpc14 and aoc a3 with atp the biomass theoretical total oc consumption during the 14 day bpp incubations cm cg was calculated based on the biomass concentration present at the moment of sample collection atp0 for field sampled and laboratory filtered bacf filtrate as shown in fig 7 a the calculated total oc consumption increased as function of atp0 and ranged from 5 to 20 µg l which was in the same order of magnitude as the aoc a3 concentrations measured in bacf filtrate the share of cm of the total oc consumption was 30 to 80 and this proportion increased for higher atp0 levels fig 7b the impact of the initial biomass concentration in shifting the oc consumption from biomass growth towards biomass maintenance is also qualitatively observable in the shape of the bpp incubation curves of bacf filtrate fig 1b samples with higher levels of atp0 showed flatter curves with a smaller atp increase in the growth phase but also a persistence of stable and high atp levels throughout the latter half of the incubation period overall these results emphasize the importance of biomass maintenance vis á vis growth in the growth potential assessment of disinfectant free drinking water produced from eutrophic reservoir water containing significant levels of initial biomass and a slowly biodegradable oc nutrient matrix 4 discussion 4 1 the impact of feed water quality on treated water high mw oc biomass and mgp the detailed monitoring conducted in the current study enables a more detailed evaluation of the impact of the feed water quality and treatment efficiency on the produced drinking water represented by bacf filtrate high mw oc biomass and mgp than hitherto available the simultaneity of algal abundance in the reservoirs and increased concentrations of high mw oc in the plant s feed water points to a seasonal summerly production of high mw oc by the reservoir ecosystem a mixture of biopolymeric substances such as carbohydrates amino acids amino sugars proteins lipids and fatty acids can be produced by algae depending on their abundance speciation and growth phase nguyen et al 2005 pivokonsky et al 2006 pivokonsky et al 2014 the high proportion of carbohydrates 55 supports the high mw oc s algal origin pivokonsky et al 2014 hijnen et al 2018 the results thus show that algal activity can be a major and variable source of high mw oc in surface water treatment the opposite seasonal trends in the feed water and bacf filtrate high mw oc concentrations show that the impact of the feed water s quality on the produced drinking water s mgp is more complex than a straightforward direct and constant passage through the treatment steps the observed pretreatment s seasonally variable removal efficiency for high mw oc at unchanged coagulant dose suggests that its coagulability is affected by the ambient water temperature and the high mw oc concentration and composition e g the ratio between proteinous and polysaccharidic substances pivokonsky et al 2006 further removal by the bacf filtration correlates with water temperature and biological activity in the filters which suggests a major but only seasonally present role of biodegradation in line with siembida lösch et al 2015 biomass is largely but not completely removed in the conventional pretreatment whereas removal in bacf filtration is seasonally variable servais et al 1991 furthermore the pretreatment and bacf filtration steps can induce appreciable shifts in the biomass microbiome lautenschlager et al 2014 park et al 2016 with seasonal variability in biomass density in bacf filtration servais et al 1991 which suggests that only a minor part of the bacf filtrate biomass originates from the feed water further understanding of the fate and interactions between high mw oc and biomass throughout the treatment and their eventual impact on the drinking water s mgp is of interest e g by detailed characterization of the high mw oc s chemistry e g nguyen et al 2005 villacorte et al 2015 and biomass microbiome in addition revealing the biomass metabolic activity and pathways by novel metagenomic and proteomic methods is potentially promising in clarifying the relationship between aoc compounds biomass and mgp although they are still in an experimental phase of application 4 2 the significances of the high mw oc subfractions for mgp the results obtained by the addition series filtration experiments and field monitoring in this study all point to the new insight of the specific importance of the biomass associated sub micron fraction of the high mw oc for mgp as bpc14 and aoc a3 in bacf filtrate thus mgp is impacted by not only the concentration but also by the composition of the high mw oc especially the biomass associated subfraction as a result mgp can be high despite low concentrations of high mw oc as witnessed here for summer conditions in the bacf filtrate investigated here this explains the spread observed in the correlation between bpc14 and the high mw oc concentration observed for similar water types by hijnen et al 2018 r2 0 71 for the aggregated data set of raw water pretreated water and bacf filtrate in addition to the aforementioned major importance of the sub micron biomass associated high mw oc subfraction for mgp also the residual biodegradable oc fractions of a smaller particle size may still be relevant for mgp and biostability the observation that the 0 12 µm pore size ultrafiltrates and laboratory filtrates featured a comparatively low but still measurable level of bpc14 despite being devoid of bacterial biomass and aoc a3 type compounds section 3 2 of this paper and schurer et al 2019 shows that also the oc fractions which are not retained by the filtrations can still serve as nutrient source but induce a lower level of mgp fig 3 this residual oc contains smaller biopolymers humic substances and lower mw oc the latter fraction is to some extent biodegradable as reflected by the aoc p17 nox values however the bpp incubation curve shapes of the laboratory filtrations still suggest prevalence of slowly biodegradable oc possibly being the residual non filterable biopolymers or an association with humic compounds volk et al 1997 4 3 theoretical comparison of biomass oc content and consumptions to further substantiate the importance of the high mw oc subfractions for mgp observed in the field monitoring and laboratory experiments the respective contributions of the various high mw oc subfractions to the aoc pool as well as the consumption of oc by the microbial biomass are evaluated and compared as follows based on the theoretical approach and its background described in section 2 8 the estimated oc quantity in invertebrates is very low 1 µg c l compared to that of microbial biomass as well as aoc p17 nox and aoc a3 and is therefore most likely irrelevant for mgp the estimated average microbial biomass oc content in the bacf filtrate is in the range 10 60 µg c l the estimated oc consumption by the microbial biomass in bacf filtrate during the 14 day bpp incubation cm cg of 12 4 µg l was in the same order of magnitude as the estimated microbial biomass oc content but also similar to the measured aoc a3 concentrations 9 4 μ g l the similarity in biomass oc and aoc a3 quantities is further supported by using data of growth experiments of the aoc a3 s test strain a3 f johnsoniae on biomass substrates of pure p17 and nox cultures performed by sack et al 2009 from their original data a3 yield factors of 0 29 and 0 10 cfu cfu were derivable under the assumption that these values are representative for the growth of a3 on bacf filtrate microbial biomass and using the aoc a3 assays calibration factor of 1 3 104 cfu µg c sack et al 2011 the average bacf filtrate total cell count of 0 6 106 cells ml is equivalent to an aoc a3 content of 5 13 µg c l this value also corresponds well to the aoc a3 levels measured in the bacf filtrate the similarity in the respective estimated quantities of the oc consumption cm cg the oc present in the biomass subfraction and the aoc a3 concentrations shows that the observed importance of the microbial biomass high mw oc subfraction for mgp is also realistic from a theoretical viewpoint a possible mechanism for growth and maintenance associated with cell biomass of which the principle was shown by sack et al 2010 for a3 is the reuse of soluble organic carbon material released by intact cells and or particulate cellular debris after solubilization cryptic growth banks and bryers 1990 on the other hand cm cg is well below the totally present high mw oc concentration 15 to 30 of the 100 50 µg l lcocd biopolymer table 2 this suggests that part of the high mw oc is potentially still available for further assimilation by the biomass also after the 14 day period used as evaluation basis here 4 4 the importance of biomass maintenance in drinking water with a slowly biodegradable high mw oc nutrient matrix the evaluations of the bacf filtrate bpp incubations in section 3 5 show that the presence of significant amounts of initial biomass in a slowly biodegradable aoc pool results in the shift of oc consumption from biomass growth towards maintenance the potential importance of biomass maintenance is further emphasized by extending the bpp incubations to 28 days as incidentally performed for the laboratory filtrations curves in figure s4 these curves show that biomass levels remain stable and high also after the initial 14 day bpp incubation period this demonstrates the capability of the bacf filtrate aoc matrix to support biomass maintenance at a significant biomass level for an extended period for an assumed prolongation of biomass maintenance at the level of atpmax by a second 14 days a total oc consumption of 30 11 µg l is calculated of which 85 for maintenance cm this oc consumption exceeds the available aoc a3 quantity but is still below the total high mw oc quantity present as lcocd biopolymer and phmoc and might thus be supported by that other aoc e g the residual biopolymers humic substances and or recycled cellular material summarizing the bpp results and theoretical oc estimations obtained in this study highlight the relative importance of biomass maintenance over biomass growth in drinking water dominated by slowly biodegradable high mw oc compounds and the ensuing potential to sustain prolonged stable biomass levels in that drinking water van der kooij et al 2017 4 5 implications of the findings for biostability during treatment and distribution this paper demonstrates the specific relevance of the microbial high mw oc subfraction for biostability as assessed by mgp bioassays for the investigated treated surface water type mgp is thus not only dependent on the totally present high mw oc s quantity but also and predominantly on its ambient biomass content therefore treated water mgp levels can be high even at low high mw oc concentrations and vice versa the results thus support that thorough removal of microbial biomass and simultaneously other inorganic particulates in the water treatment may be promising in reducing the drinking water s mgp schurer et al 2019 however also the other non biomass associated oc fractions still contribute to mgp e g at situations of high aoc p17 nox levels and should therefore be included in monitoring and evaluations this study also highlights the potential of drinking water containing slowly degradable high mw oc to maintain stable and high biomass levels the findings made here for the produced treated water have potentially important implications for the biostability conditions in the supplied distribution network similar to the treated water the slowly biodegradable oc matrix may enable a sustained presence of stable and high levels of biomass bacteria protozoa and invertebrates in biofilm and suspended state in the distribution network and thus negatively affects regrowth and biostability boe hansen et al 2003 van der kooij et al 2017 hijnen et al 2018 the importance of biomass maintenance in the produced drinking water as discussed in the current study raises the question whether this parameter might serve as predictor for regrowth in the distribution network and if so which threshold level applies the prolonged biomass maintenance in oligotrophic treated water bacf filtrate observed here is in line with similar findings for slow sand filtrate by van der kooij et al 2017 data from that study indicate that regrowth defined here as the abundance of the indicator organism aeromonas in the distribution network is low for maintenance levels of 3 4 ng atp l in the produced drinking water and increases for 15 ng atp l maintenance levels to which the levels observed in the current study were similar however further interpretation must be made with caution as the respective produced waters also differed in other water quality aspects such as aoc furthermore the relationship between produced water mgp and the biostability and regrowth in the distribution network is complex seen the variety in nutrient uptake paths and physical environments the aoc compounds may contribute to regrowth conditions by direct and slow but long term uptake in biofilms on the pipe wall and loose deposits in the distribution system and further onto higher trophic levels such as invertebrates van lieverloo et al 2012 sack et al 2014 also bio physical agglomeration of oc compounds onto iron and manganese hydroxide particles may accelerate formation of loose deposits and biofilm camper 2004 ginige et al 2011 furthermore physical conditions such as temperature flow velocity residence time network configuration presence of sediments pipe wall roughness and piping and plumbing materials affect biostability and regrowth in the distribution network camper 2004 prévost et al 1998 liu et al 2014 prest et al 2016 the used mgp and oc characterization methods showed their value in elucidating the relationship between high mw oc and mgp and the relevance of biomass maintenance in detail in oligotrophic drinking water it is recommended that future studies include biological parameters atp flow cytometry based cell count volume and growth assays bgp as well as microbiome fingerprinting proteomics and metagenomics to further understand this relationship additional work on the effects and interactions of various conditions of the concentrations and types of high mw oc biomass and iron and manganese particulates on regrowth and biomass presence in full scale distribution networks and controllable model networks e g recirculation pipe simulators and annular or disk reactors biofilm monitors will further foster this understanding 5 conclusions the relationship between microbial growth potential mgp and high molecular weight organic carbon high mw oc comprising biopolymers invertebrates and microbial biomass was investigated for a surface water treatment plant using eutrophic reservoir water and disinfectant free distribution leading to the following conclusions i mgp of the treated water is determined by high mw oc and is mainly attributable to the microbial biomass associated 0 12 µm particle size subfraction of the high mw oc the other residual high mw oc and oc fractions of lower mw induce a minor but still measurable mgp ii treated water mgp increases linearly as function of the high mw oc s concentration with a ratio which is seasonally variable depending on the ambient biomass quantity in the high mw oc iii levels of high mw oc biomass and mgp feature clear seasonal patterns in feed water and treated water all show maximum levels in summer except the treated water s high mw oc concentration which has an opposite seasonal pattern due to seasonally variable removal in the treatment steps iv for the slowly biodegradable high mw oc nutrient matrix microbial biomass maintenance dominates over growth resulting in prolonged stable and high levels of microbial biomass v the levels of mgp and high mw oc including biomass are both important for biostability assessment the importance of biomass maintenance by a slowly biodegradable oc matrix derived here for produced water implies that similar conditions potentially affect regrowth and biostability in the distribution network in a negative way future research is to focus on the relationship between the oc matrix and mgp of the produced drinking water and the ensuing microbial and invertebrate activity in the distribution network eventually leading to the establishment of threshold values for these oc

16417,thermal hydrolysis process thp assisted anaerobic digestion ad has been demonstrated to be an efficient approach to improve biogas production and solids reduction given the faster reaction kinetics in the thp ad system reduction of sludge retention time srt is possible however a comprehensive understanding of the effects of sludge retention time srt on microbial dynamics and community assemblages is still lacking in thp ad systems thus twelve thp ad reactors were operated at different srts 10 30 d to fulfill the knowledge gap results showed that although all the bioreactors displayed good performance shorter srt reactors srt 10 d took a longer time to reach the stable state the total biogas production at srt of 10 d was lower than that at other longer srts attributing to the limited hydrolytic fermentative capacities of ad microbiomes different srts resulted in distinct succession patterns of ad microbiomes thp sludge reduced the microbial diversity in all the bioreactors over time but longer srts maintained higher biodiversity null model analysis suggested that thp ad microbial community assembly was predominately driven by deterministic selection at the tested srt range but stochasticity increased with elevated srts likely attributing to the immigrants from the feedstock phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens analysis revealed more stable network structures at longer srts evidenced by the lower modularity shorter harmonic geodesic distance and higher connectivity the potential keystone taxa under varied srts were identified some of which were hydrolytic fermentative bacteria e g peptostreptococcus lutispora synergistaceae suggesting that these species related to organic hydrolysis fermentation even with low abundance could still play pivotal ecological roles in maintaining the thp ad microbial community structure and functions collectively this study provides comprehensive and in depth insights into the mechanisms underlying

treatment and stabilization in wastewater treatment plants wwtps ad microbiomes generally form complicated ecological interaction networks rather than existing in isolation faust and raes 2012 the intricate balance and synergistic interactions among diverse microbial populations are the prerequisites of well performed ad systems for instance methanogens which can not directly utilize complex

full scale plants ge et al 2010 lu et al 2018 however the information on microbial community succession mechanisms of thp ad microbiomes is so far limited it is essential to gain the information to guide the system manipulation statistical analysis such as null model has been extensively employed to dissect community assembly mechanisms i e deterministic vs stochastic in both sludge and biofilm associated microbial communities indicating that both deterministic and stochastic processes concurrently influence microbiome assembly ofiţeru et al 2010 liébana et al 2019 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 mechanistic understanding of deterministic and stochastic processes driving ad community assembly would be beneficial for diagnosing ad system operation and performance yu et al 2021 previous studies reported that deterministic processes mainly governed ad microbial community assembly vanwonterghem et al 2014 peces et al 2018 however these ad reactors were fed with sterilized or non sterilized synthetic media such conclusion may not be directly applicable in the scenario where sludge is the feedstock since sludge is much more complex ju et al 2017 qualitatively investigated microbiome assemblages in ad system treating chemically enhanced primary treatment sludge and found that deterministic processes dominated in the ad microbial community assembly however the microbial community in the ad systems treating thp pre treated sludge hereafter referred to as thp sludge could be distinct from that when treating primary sludge was zhang et al 2021a owing to the different inhabiting environments lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a the high content of recalcitrant compounds and ammonium in thp ad systems may have toxic effects on the microorganisms and could create a more harsh environment for ad microbiota under such scenario the random dispersal of rare species may aggravate which strengthens the effects of stochastic processes on community assemblages thus it requires a comprehensive study to quantitatively determine the microbial community assembly mechanisms in thp ad systems sludge retention time srt is a vital operational parameter in balancing microbial groups fermenters syntrophs and methanogens wang et al 2020a previous studies primarily investigated the minimal srt required for thp ad process xue et al 2015 chen et al 2020 however the divergence of ad microbial communities influenced by distinct srt conditions has not been fully understood ad operated at different srts could be subjected to different extents of influences from feed sludge when a short srt applies niche vacancies may occur in the ad systems and such vacancies would be occupied by the immigrants from feed sludge on the other hand oligotrophic conditions at long srts could intensify nutrient competitions among the microbes weakening their ability to resist external interference sun et al 2020 in addition many microorganisms in feed sludge are not active in ad systems jiang et al 2021 which further complicates our understanding of srt effects to our knowledge whether and how dynamic srts influence the contribution of deterministic processes to thp ad microbiome assembly remains elusive therefore this study aims to investigate the microbial community assembly mechanisms in thp ad reactors with the main focus on srt effect here we operated twelve

standard respectively raunkjær et al 1994 zhang et al 2021b 3 results 3 1 long term performance of thp ad reactors at different srts the methane production performance under different srts 10 d 15 d 20 d and 30 d is presented in fig 1 a and fig s1a showing that the methane yield gradually increased in all the bioreactors after 30 days operation the performance of all reactors tended to be relatively stable the methane yield at srt of 20 d 290 18 ml g vssadd was not significantly different from that at srts of 15 d 278 13 ml g vssadd and 30 d 302 25 ml g vssadd which was significantly higher than that at srt of 10 d 251 11 ml g vssadd p 0 05 fig s2 acetate and propionate were the main components of vfas in the digested sludge fig s3 accounting for 88 of the total vfas on average it was observed that high vfas up to 3500 mg l accumulated in the reactors with srt of 10 d within the first 15 days followed by a gradual decrease to 100 mg l it may be due to the fact that 10 d of srt did not provide a favorable environment for slow growing methanogens at the beginning of operation resulting in their low activity for substrate consumption a similar trend was also observed in the reactors with srt of 15 d but there was much lower vfa accumulation 650 mg l at longer srts 20 d and 30 d no obvious vfa accumulation was observed where 200 mg l vfas were detected throughout the entire operational period during the stable period there was no substantial difference in vfa concentration among all the thp ad reactors moreover the organic loading rate at srt of 10 d was 1 5 3 times higher than that at other srts thus the lower methane production at srt of 10 d may be due to the limited hydrolysis and or fermentation of organics which was partially supported by the higher scod concentrations in the discharged sludge at shorter srts date not shown although methane production at srt of 30 d was significantly higher by approximately 8 6 than that at srt of 15 d p 0 05 the operational time doubled which is not practically and economically attractive considering the time required for achieving 90 of methane potential with methane generation at srt of 30 d as the reference xue et al 2015 the srt of thp ad system can be shortened to 15 d without substantially sacrificing methane recovery further reduction of srt to 10 d would require a longer time to achieve stable system performance this result is in agreement with previous studies in which they found that srt of thp ad systems can be reduced to 12 14 d xue et al 2015 chen et al 2020 in addition thermal hydrolysis at high temperature e g 165 c can result in the release of large amounts of proteinaceous materials which contribute to ammonium production after their hydrolysis and fermentation xue et al 2015 chen et al 2020 thus its concentration in the digested sludge gradually increased fig 1b the ammonium concentration did not have a significant difference among the reactors with srts of 10 d 15 d and 20 d at the later stage of operational period 1506 81 mg n l p 0 05 and was only 42 mg n l on average higher than that at srt of 30 d 1464 63 mg n l fig 1b fig s1b and fig s2 it could also support that the smallest extent of organic hydrolysis fermentation at srt of 10 d when taking into account the organic loading provided the ph values in all the bioreactors were not significantly different fluctuating from 7 3 to 7 9 during the entire operational period fig s4 this provided a favorable ph range for methanogenic activity 3 2 phylogenetic dynamics of microbial compositions a total of 2917 294 sequences from 51 sludge samples were recovered via illumina high throughput sequencing after quality filtering and trimming the good s coverage of all the samples was above 98 5 indicating that the achieved sequencing depth was sufficient to properly describe the diversity of the microbial community in all the thp ad reactors during the long term operation the biodiversity was gradually decreased in all the reactors regardless of srts table s1 the dissimilarity of microbial diversity among the thp ad reactors became more and more substantial along with time and the shorter srt the lower microbial diversity it may be because the higher organic loading rate with shorter srts provided more abundant organic carbon source and likely increased competition and predominant populations resulting in the decrease even disappearance of rare taxa zhang et al 2020 the relative abundance of top 30 genera identified in all the sludge samples was presented in fig 2 and fig s5 these genera were affiliated with bacteroidota average 36 44 firmicutes average 25 26 spirochaetota average 5 61 proteobacteria average 5 03 synergistota average 4 72 desulfobacterota average 3 55 halobacterota average 3 37 verrucomicrobiota average 3 29 chloroflexi average 2 46 cloacimonadota average 2 28 thermotogota average 1 63 and euryarchaeota average 0 53 the dominant phyla and genera under different srts were similar but their abundance had substantial variations to study the microbial community dynamics in the thp ad reactors nmds analysis based on bray curtis distance was conducted fig 3 a showing that the microbial populations separated from each other based on the srts and such dissimilarity became gradually more and more pronounced along with time adonis and anosim adonis p 0 001 anosim p 0 003 further confirmed the significant differences among the different srts it may be resulted from functional redundancy which means many taxonomically different microbes could perform the same metabolic functions louca et al 2018 in addition it can be seen that the microbial communities in all the reactors were significantly different from those in the inoculum regardless of the srts and there was a clear evolution trajectory during the long term operation lefse analysis with a lda threshold of 3 5 was performed to determine the significantly different taxa among the samples fig 3b and fig s6 at srt of 10 d norank f norank o rf39 genus lutispora genus norank f srb2 genus norank f norank o norank c norank p firmicutes genus methanospirillum genus rumen m2 genus were the biomarkers at srt of 15 d norank f rikenellaceae genus w5 christensenellaceae r 7 group genus and limnochordia class were the biomarkers at srt of 20 d dmer64 rikenellaceae rc9 gut group genus and norank f spirochaetaceae genus were the biomarkers at srt of 30 d norank f bacteroidetes genus fermentimonas genus mariniphaga genus norank f prolixibacteraceae genus blvii28 wastewater sludge group genus smithella genus and rbg 16 49 21 genus were the biomarkers the present results reveal that both feed sludge thp sludge and srt posed a selective pressure on the microbial populations in the ad reactors 3 3 effect of srt on deterministic and stochastic processes the clear dynamics of community structure were observed under different srts the null model was therefore employed to evaluate the assembly process shaping community structure under different srts results showed that the contribution of environmental selection to thp ad microbial community assembly was 63 8 81 at all the srts fig 4 suggesting that deterministic process played a greater role than stochasticity during metacommunity assemblage moreover the contribution of stochastic processes i e ecological drift homogenizing dispersal dispersal limitation on community assembly increased from 19 0 at srt of 10 d to 36 2 at srt of 30 d the present result indicates the influence of determinism on thp ad microbial community assembly became weaker at longer srts additionally the sloan neutral model showed that the goodness of fit r2 value and immigration rate increased with elevated srts fig s7 suggesting that the enhanced importance of stochasticity processes in shaping community assembly 7 1 7 2 7 8 and 8 1 of total otus were located in the area above the prediction suggesting that these taxa were present more frequently than expected among the top 10 otus otus assigned to f spirochaetaceae p firmicute g gracilibacter g syntrophobacter g syntrophus g caldicoprobacter p marinimicrobia sar406 clade were present at least two srt conditions at a higher frequency than predicted 3 4 effect of srt on co occurrence patterns of thp ad microbiomes rmt based networks were constructed to decipher the ecological interplays of co occurring species fig 5 in the constructed networks there were 268 nodes linked by 727 edges for srt of 10 d 319 nodes linked by 1402 edges for srt of 15 d 353 nodes linked by 2269 edges for srt of 20 d and 513 nodes linked by 4368 edges for srt of 30 d interestingly positive interaction dominated in the networks contributing to 88 2 88 5 89 7 and 98 4 of the species species interplays under srts of 10 d 15 d 20 d and 30 d respectively this result suggests ubiquitous presence of cooperative behaviors such as mutualism or commensalism which can be explained by the four consecutive and intricate processes hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the small world coefficients σ of all the networks of 1 suggest that the pmens of the microbial community possessed small world and modular structures table 2 which were considered as finer niches and functional units zhou et al 2010 the avgk increased with elevated srts while hd has the contrary trend revealing that the network interactions may be more intense in the ad microbes under longer srts moreover the lowest modularity was observed under the longest srt the present results indicate that srt played an important role in structuring microbial co occurrence patterns to identify the topological role of nodes in the networks the plots based on within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi were constructed fig s8 nodes are usually categorized into four groups peripherals connectors module hubs and network hubs deng et al 2016 ecologically peripherals represent specialists in the microbial community while module hubs and connectors represent generalists in the community and network hubs indicate supergeneralists olesen et al 2007 the majority of nodes were peripherals with most of their links inside their own modules in the four networks and supergeneralists were not observed in all networks fig 5 two connectors module hubs were identified in each network which were the keystone taxa driving the microbial succession and maintaining the microbial function in the thp ad systems otu4592 belonged to g peptostreptococcus was the connector in the microbial community at srt of 10 d but was the module hub in the microbial community at srt of 15 d otu2703 belonged to g lutispora and otu1014 belonged to f synergistaceae were identified as connector and module hub at srt of 10 d and 15 d respectively otu1370 c olb14 affiliated with p chloroflexi and otu4374 o c10 sb1a affiliated with c anaerolineae were the connectors at srt of 20 d while otu77 f comamonadaceae and otu3449 f sc i 84 affiliated with o burkholderiales were the module hubs at srt of 30 d of note the relative abundance of these keystone taxa was low 0 03 0 34 on average suggesting that some species with even low abundance could also play crucial roles in shaping the ad microbial community structures 100 positive microbial interactions between keystone species and their neighbors were observed under the four srts except for srt of 10 d 61 positive interaction indicating the ubiquitous presence of cooperative behavior such as cross feeding mutualism within the ad microbial community 4 discussion 4 1 srt influenced thp ad microbial community assembly null model analysis suggested that deterministic processes dominated microbial community assemblies in thp ad reactors regardless of the tested srts fig 4 in ad food web the intricate balance among multiple functional groups is essential for efficient methane production and strengthening the biotic interactions e g competition and cross feeding between primary and secondary metabolizers based on deterministic process the present result is consistent with previous studies which reported that deterministic assembly was the dominant process in bioreactors with desirable performance lin et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 however the role of stochastic processes in microbial assembly should not be overlooked they also played important roles in driving community assembly especially at a long srt e g 30 d which may be due to input resources and new microbes introduced by the periodic feeding campaigns the feed sludge not only changed the physicochemical traits in the thp ad reactors but also introduced new microflora thereby shifting the microbial communities and increasing the stochasticity during the community assemblage turnover lin et al 2017 in theory fresh thp sludge produced at high temperature could not have active microbes since the collected thp sludge was stored in a cold room 4 c microbiota growth may initiate which is partially supported by the result of fluorescent staining of dead live cells in the feed sludge conducted at the end of experiment fig s9 in practice owing to the high solids concentration and high temperature thp sludge is commonly diluted with primary sludge was before being fed into mesophilic ad systems jiang et al 2021 which inevitably introduce new microbes ecological drift an inherent stochastic process including birth death and reproduction zhou and ning 2017 could be another possible explanation rare taxa are more likely subjected to ecological drift and a small change in their abundance could result in extinction and thereby increase stochasticity indicating that the very low abundant keystone taxa may also contribute to stochasticity at a long srt substrates could be limited and microbes may rely on endogenous respiration as a survival strategy sun et al 2020 the ability of ad microbiomes to resist disturbances from the influent microbiota was relatively weaker compared to that at a short srt which is consistent with the higher estimated migration rate at longer srts fig s7 accordingly a long srt increased the stochasticity in the ad process the high biodiversity at a long srt means diverse microbial communities which contain many unique taxa with different trophic groups are functionally redundant briones and raskin 2003 zhang et al 2020 for instance abundant hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria were present in the thp ad reactors petrimonas proteiniphilum dmer64 longilinea syntrophomonas etc the total relative abundance of dominant methanogenic archaea e g methanoculleus methanosaeta methanolinea methanospirillum among the different srts were similar although the abundance of respective methanogenic archaea varied with srts fig 2 in this light even though high stochasticity was observed at a long srt functional redundancy of microbiomes could still guarantee the system function and stability in response to external disturbances 4 2 srt influenced co occurrence patterns of thp ad microbiomes it was previously observed that there were significant linkages between microbial network properties and ad system performance wu et al 2020 modules have been interpreted as niches or function units in microbial communities eiler et al 2012 sun et al 2021 the modularity of networks decreased with increased srts indicating a smaller extent of niche differentiation at a long srt faust and raes 2012 it means more stable network structures at longer srts which was corroborated by the results of avgk and hd of note stronger biotic interactions were previously thought to lead to greater determinism which is however contradictory to what we observed in this study in which higher stochasticity was present at longer srts it may be attributed to the fact that deterministic and stochastic processes were dynamic under varying srts and the increase in the effect of stochastic processes was greater than that of deterministic processes the more complex networks at longer srts could be explained by the limited resource availability bioavailable substrates became scarce especially at the end of operational period of a time cycle at a long srt microbes need to cooperate to utilize the limited carbon sources to improve food availability zhang et al 2020 the microorganisms also need to tightly connect each other to cope with the unfavorable environmental conditions in the thp ad reactors at a long srt e g 30 d by contrast at a short srt substrates were relatively sufficient and were not a limiting factor to function efficiently microorganisms do not need to be as interactive as that at a long srt fig 5 they also do not need to resist many external disturbances and therefore are less likely to form complicated modules and tight connectivity henzi et al 2009 keystone taxa have been demonstrated to be critical to maintaining ecosystem structures and functions as the loss of these highly connected species within networks would have the greatest influences on community structures sun et al 2021 different keystone taxa were observed in the networks under different srts which is in agreement with context dependency theory that keystone species could only play crucial roles under certain circumstances power et al 1996 sun et al 2021 their relative abundance was low suggesting that rare species have a crucial impact on the ability of a community to maintain the ecosystem s function likely by serving as functional cache or resource pool in response to environmental changes zhou et al 2021 these keystone species could be important for the efficient ad food web which supports the vital role of environmental filtering in the community assembly process according to the midas database nierychlo et al 2020 the genera lutispora and peptostreptococcus could transform macromolecular organics into vfas which could be further converted into acetate by acetogenic bacteria e g sedimentibacter bacteria affiliated with c anaerolineae and o burkholderiales have been found to be able to decompose carbohydrates via fermentation pérez pantoja et al 2012 zou et al 2018 we speculate that otu4374 and otu3449 could also play an important role in organic hydrolysis fermentation f synergistaceae is capable of oxidizing acetate to h2 co2 lv et al 2019 which could support the growth and activity of hydrotrophic methanogens e g methanoculleus methanospirillum although the generalists e g otu77 otu1370 otu3449 are uncultured species they were frequently reported in ad systems yang et al 2015 gulhane et al 2017 liang et al 2021 future investigation is required to better understand the specific functions of these populations in thp ad reactors 4 3 implications and research needs in mesophilic thp ad systems srt is an important operational parameter influencing microbial compositions and structures in this study we focused on the effects of a broad srt range 10 30 d on microbial community assembly and succession although deterministic selection dominated the community assembly in all the cases tested a longer srt resulted in a greater role of stochasticity in structuring the thp ad microbial community the thp ad reactors still performed well at srt of 30 d suggesting that functional redundancy could play an important role in maintaining system function and stability in response to disturbances of note these findings did not mean that a shorter srt must lead to higher determinism and there may be a threshold by which an extremely short srt e g 10 d may increase stochasticity and system instability since too many niche vacancies could be frequently occupied by the influent microbiota of feed sludge sun et al 2020 and pronounced vfas accumulation could occur resulting in an inhibitory effect on methanogens thp ad reactors at srt of 10 d required a longer time to achieve stable performance the methane yield was also lower owing to the limited hydrolysis fermentation in this light when treating thp sludge the srt could be shortened to 15 d rather than 10 d if studied at a finer time scale srt may be further reduced to some extent other parameters e g organic loading rate temperature substrate type are also important in shaping ad microbial communities wu et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 how the interactions of these parameters influence the microbial community assembly and succession warrants further study a fraction of species were present more frequently than predicted regardless of dynamic srts fig s7 some of which were frequently detected as hydrolyzers and or fermenters in thp ad systems e g f spirochaetaceae g gracilibacter g syntrophobacter g syntrophus g caldicoprobacter liu et al 1999 poirier et al 2016 ziganshina et al 2017 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2020b suggesting that they could be important functional populations in thp ad systems as such optimizing operational strategies could increase the abundance and or maintain the high activities of those taxa in reactors which could aid in strengthening the role of deterministic processes in microbial community assembly and ensuring better system function the optimal operational factors need to be determined in future studies additionally we deciphered the temporal community assembly mechanisms to some extent in the thp ad reactors but this study is still limited by the number of temporal samples analyzed and the system scale as stated above mixing thp sludge with primary sludge was has been widely implemented in real applications jiang et al 2021 the dynamic microbial communities in the primary sludge was would also influence the microbial assemblages in thp ad reactors therefore the assembly mechanisms of microbial communities in thp ad process in full scale systems should also be further studied via collecting a larger set of samples at a finer temporal resolution 5 conclusion srt played an important role in regulating system performance microbial assembly and succession in thp ad reactors the main findings are shown as following to achieve efficient substrate conversion and methane production the srt could be set to 15 d the limited hydrolytic fermentative capacities of microbiomes restricted a further srt reduction to 10 d microbial diversity decreased along with time during the long term operation in all the thp ad reactors but microbial community harbored higher biodiversity at a long srt than at a short srt it may be due to the increased competition and predominant populations at short srts with higher organic loading rates deterministic selection dominated the thp ad microbial community assemblages but the effect of stochastic processes on community assembly became more pronounced with increased srts likely attributing to the immigrants from the feedstock srt substantially influenced the topological properties of thp ad microbial networks the microbial community networks at longer srts had lower modularity and harmonic distance as well as higher average degree which could be due to the effects of limited resource

16417,thermal hydrolysis process thp assisted anaerobic digestion ad has been demonstrated to be an efficient approach to improve biogas production and solids reduction given the faster reaction kinetics in the thp ad system reduction of sludge retention time srt is possible however a comprehensive understanding of the effects of sludge retention time srt on microbial dynamics and community assemblages is still lacking in thp ad systems thus twelve thp ad reactors were operated at different srts 10 30 d to fulfill the knowledge gap results showed that although all the bioreactors displayed good performance shorter srt reactors srt 10 d took a longer time to reach the stable state the total biogas production at srt of 10 d was lower than that at other longer srts attributing to the limited hydrolytic fermentative capacities of ad microbiomes different srts resulted in distinct succession patterns of ad microbiomes thp sludge reduced the microbial diversity in all the bioreactors over time but longer srts maintained higher biodiversity null model analysis suggested that thp ad microbial community assembly was predominately driven by deterministic selection at the tested srt range but stochasticity increased with elevated srts likely attributing to the immigrants from the feedstock phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens analysis revealed more stable network structures at longer srts evidenced by the lower modularity shorter harmonic geodesic distance and higher connectivity the potential keystone taxa under varied srts were identified some of which were hydrolytic fermentative bacteria e g peptostreptococcus lutispora synergistaceae suggesting that these species related to organic hydrolysis fermentation even with low abundance could still play pivotal ecological roles in maintaining the thp ad microbial community structure and functions collectively this study provides comprehensive and in depth insights into the mechanisms underlying community assembly in thp ad reactors which could aid in diagnosing system stability graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion thermal hydrolysis process microbial diversity deterministic and stochastic processes ecological network 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad as a carbon neutral technology has been widely employed for waste activated sludge was treatment and stabilization in wastewater treatment plants wwtps ad microbiomes generally form complicated ecological interaction networks rather than existing in isolation faust and raes 2012 the intricate balance and synergistic interactions among diverse microbial populations are the prerequisites of well performed ad systems for instance methanogens which can not directly utilize complex and macromolecular organics are highly dependent on tight cooperation with other microbial groups from hydrolysis and acidogenesis steps of note it is known that poor degradability of was and slow hydrolysis rate greatly affect the operation and performance of ad systems to improve hydrolysis and solubilization thermal hydrolysis process thp has been developed and successfully implemented in full scale plants ge et al 2010 lu et al 2018 however the information on microbial community succession mechanisms of thp ad microbiomes is so far limited it is essential to gain the information to guide the system manipulation statistical analysis such as null model has been extensively employed to dissect community assembly mechanisms i e deterministic vs stochastic in both sludge and biofilm associated microbial communities indicating that both deterministic and stochastic processes concurrently influence microbiome assembly ofiţeru et al 2010 liébana et al 2019 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 mechanistic understanding of deterministic and stochastic processes driving ad community assembly would be beneficial for diagnosing ad system operation and performance yu et al 2021 previous studies reported that deterministic processes mainly governed ad microbial community assembly vanwonterghem et al 2014 peces et al 2018 however these ad reactors were fed with sterilized or non sterilized synthetic media such conclusion may not be directly applicable in the scenario where sludge is the feedstock since sludge is much more complex ju et al 2017 qualitatively investigated microbiome assemblages in ad system treating chemically enhanced primary treatment sludge and found that deterministic processes dominated in the ad microbial community assembly however the microbial community in the ad systems treating thp pre treated sludge hereafter referred to as thp sludge could be distinct from that when treating primary sludge was zhang et al 2021a owing to the different inhabiting environments lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a the high content of recalcitrant compounds and ammonium in thp ad systems may have toxic effects on the microorganisms and could create a more harsh environment for ad microbiota under such scenario the random dispersal of rare species may aggravate which strengthens the effects of stochastic processes on community assemblages thus it requires a comprehensive study to quantitatively determine the microbial community assembly mechanisms in thp ad systems sludge retention time srt is a vital operational parameter in balancing microbial groups fermenters syntrophs and methanogens wang et al 2020a previous studies primarily investigated the minimal srt required for thp ad process xue et al 2015 chen et al 2020 however the divergence of ad microbial communities influenced by distinct srt conditions has not been fully understood ad operated at different srts could be subjected to different extents of influences from feed sludge when a short srt applies niche vacancies may occur in the ad systems and such vacancies would be occupied by the immigrants from feed sludge on the other hand oligotrophic conditions at long srts could intensify nutrient competitions among the microbes weakening their ability to resist external interference sun et al 2020 in addition many microorganisms in feed sludge are not active in ad systems jiang et al 2021 which further complicates our understanding of srt effects to our knowledge whether and how dynamic srts influence the contribution of deterministic processes to thp ad microbiome assembly remains elusive therefore this study aims to investigate the microbial community assembly mechanisms in thp ad reactors with the main focus on srt effect here we operated twelve thp ad reactors under four different srts 10 d 15 d 20 d and 30 d the system performance microbial diversity and structure were evaluated the relative contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes in determining the ad microbial communities were unveiled via null model phylogenetic molecular ecological network pmen analysis was performed to uncover and compare the co occurrence

number of prjna772166 2 3 network construction random matrix theory rmt based approach was used to construct the pmens of microbial communities in the thp ad reactors operated at different srts following the protocols described by deng et al 2012 the relative abundance of otus was used to achieve the similarity matrix based on pearson correlation analysis between any two pairs of otus an appropriate threshold value for defining the network structure was determined with the rmt based approach deng et al 2012 only the nodes with higher abundance similarity values than the calculated

standard respectively raunkjær et al 1994 zhang et al 2021b 3 results 3 1 long term performance of thp ad reactors at different srts the methane production performance under different srts 10 d 15 d 20 d and 30 d is presented in fig 1 a and fig s1a showing that the methane yield gradually increased in all the bioreactors after 30 days operation the performance of all reactors tended to be relatively stable the methane yield at srt of 20 d 290 18 ml g vssadd was not significantly different from that at srts of 15 d 278 13 ml g vssadd and 30 d 302 25 ml g vssadd which was significantly higher than that at srt of 10 d 251 11 ml g vssadd p 0 05 fig s2 acetate and propionate were the main components of vfas in the digested sludge fig s3 accounting for 88 of the total vfas on average it was observed that high vfas up to 3500 mg l accumulated in the reactors with srt of 10 d within the first 15 days followed by a gradual decrease to 100 mg l it may be due to the fact that 10 d of srt did not provide a favorable environment for slow growing methanogens at the beginning of operation resulting in their low activity for substrate consumption a similar trend was also observed in the reactors with srt of 15 d but there was much lower vfa accumulation 650 mg l at longer srts 20 d and 30 d no obvious vfa accumulation was observed where 200 mg l vfas were detected throughout the entire operational period during the stable period there was no substantial difference in vfa concentration among all the thp ad reactors moreover the organic loading rate at srt of 10 d was 1 5 3 times higher than that at other srts thus the lower methane production at srt of 10 d may be due to the limited hydrolysis and or fermentation of organics which was partially supported by the higher scod concentrations in the discharged sludge at shorter srts date not shown although methane production at srt of 30 d was significantly higher by approximately 8 6 than that at srt of 15 d p 0 05 the operational time doubled which is not practically and economically attractive considering the time required for achieving 90 of methane potential with methane generation at srt of 30 d as the reference xue et al 2015 the srt of thp ad system can be shortened to 15 d without substantially sacrificing methane recovery further reduction of srt to 10 d would require a longer time to achieve stable system performance this result is in agreement with previous studies in which they found that srt of thp ad systems can be reduced to 12 14 d xue et al 2015 chen et al 2020 in addition thermal hydrolysis at high temperature e g 165 c can result in the release of large amounts of proteinaceous materials which contribute to ammonium production after their hydrolysis and fermentation xue et al 2015 chen et al 2020 thus its concentration in the digested sludge gradually increased fig 1b the ammonium concentration did not have a significant difference among the reactors with srts of 10 d 15 d and 20 d at the later stage of operational period 1506 81 mg n l p 0 05 and was only 42 mg n l on average higher than that at srt of 30 d 1464 63 mg n l fig 1b fig s1b and fig s2 it could also support that the smallest extent of organic hydrolysis fermentation at srt of 10 d when taking into account the organic loading provided the ph values in all the bioreactors were not significantly different fluctuating from 7 3 to 7 9 during the entire operational period fig s4 this provided a favorable ph range for methanogenic activity 3 2 phylogenetic dynamics of microbial compositions a total of 2917 294 sequences from 51 sludge samples were recovered via illumina high throughput sequencing after quality filtering and trimming the good s coverage of all the samples was above 98 5 indicating that the achieved sequencing depth was sufficient to properly describe the diversity of the microbial community in all the thp ad reactors during the long term operation the biodiversity was gradually decreased in all the reactors regardless of srts table s1 the dissimilarity of microbial diversity among the thp ad reactors became more and more substantial along with time and the shorter srt the lower microbial diversity it may be because the higher organic loading rate with shorter srts provided more abundant organic carbon source and likely increased competition and predominant populations resulting in the decrease even disappearance of rare taxa zhang et al 2020 the relative abundance of top 30 genera identified in all the sludge samples was presented in fig 2 and fig s5 these genera were affiliated with bacteroidota average 36 44 firmicutes average 25 26 spirochaetota average 5 61 proteobacteria average 5 03 synergistota average 4 72 desulfobacterota average 3 55 halobacterota average 3 37 verrucomicrobiota average 3 29 chloroflexi average 2 46 cloacimonadota average 2 28 thermotogota average 1 63 and euryarchaeota average 0 53 the dominant phyla and genera under different srts were similar but their abundance had substantial variations to study the microbial community dynamics in the thp ad reactors nmds analysis based on bray curtis distance was conducted fig 3 a showing that the microbial populations separated from each other based on the srts and such dissimilarity became gradually more and more pronounced along with time adonis and anosim adonis p 0 001 anosim p 0 003 further confirmed the significant differences among the different srts it may be resulted from functional redundancy which means many taxonomically different microbes could perform the same metabolic functions louca et al 2018 in addition it can be seen that the microbial communities in all the reactors were significantly different from those in the inoculum regardless of the srts and there was a clear evolution trajectory during the long term operation lefse analysis with a lda threshold of 3 5 was performed to determine the significantly different taxa among the samples fig 3b and fig s6 at srt of 10 d norank f norank o rf39 genus lutispora genus norank f srb2 genus norank f norank o norank c norank p firmicutes genus methanospirillum genus rumen m2 genus were the biomarkers at srt of 15 d norank f rikenellaceae genus w5 christensenellaceae r 7 group genus and limnochordia class were the biomarkers at srt of 20 d dmer64 rikenellaceae rc9 gut group genus and norank f spirochaetaceae genus were the biomarkers at srt of 30 d norank f bacteroidetes genus fermentimonas genus mariniphaga genus norank f prolixibacteraceae genus blvii28 wastewater sludge group genus smithella genus and rbg 16 49 21 genus were the biomarkers the present results reveal that both feed sludge thp sludge and srt posed a selective pressure on the microbial populations in the ad reactors 3 3 effect of srt on deterministic and stochastic processes the clear dynamics of community structure were observed under different srts the null model was therefore employed to evaluate the assembly process shaping community structure under different srts results showed that the contribution of environmental selection to thp ad microbial community assembly was 63 8 81 at all the srts fig 4 suggesting that deterministic process played a greater role than stochasticity during metacommunity assemblage moreover the contribution of stochastic processes i e ecological drift homogenizing dispersal dispersal limitation on community assembly increased from 19 0 at srt of 10 d to 36 2 at srt of 30 d the present result indicates the influence of determinism on thp ad microbial community assembly became weaker at longer srts additionally the sloan neutral model showed that the goodness of fit r2 value and immigration rate increased with elevated srts fig s7 suggesting that the enhanced importance of stochasticity processes in shaping community assembly 7 1 7 2 7 8 and 8 1 of total otus were located in the area above the prediction suggesting that these taxa were present more frequently than expected among the top 10 otus otus assigned to f spirochaetaceae p firmicute g gracilibacter g syntrophobacter g syntrophus g caldicoprobacter p marinimicrobia sar406 clade were present at least two srt conditions at a higher frequency than predicted 3 4 effect of srt on co occurrence patterns of thp ad microbiomes rmt based networks were constructed to decipher the ecological interplays of co occurring species fig 5 in the constructed networks there were 268 nodes linked by 727 edges for srt of 10 d 319 nodes linked by 1402 edges for srt of 15 d 353 nodes linked by 2269 edges for srt of 20 d and 513 nodes linked by 4368 edges for srt of 30 d interestingly positive interaction dominated in the networks contributing to 88 2 88 5 89 7 and 98 4 of the species species interplays under srts of 10 d 15 d 20 d and 30 d respectively this result suggests ubiquitous presence of cooperative behaviors such as mutualism or commensalism which can be explained by the four consecutive and intricate processes hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the small world coefficients σ of all the networks of 1 suggest that the pmens of the microbial community possessed small world and modular structures table 2 which were considered as finer niches and functional units zhou et al 2010 the avgk increased with elevated srts while hd has the contrary trend revealing that the network interactions may be more intense in the ad microbes under longer srts moreover the lowest modularity was observed under the longest srt the present results indicate that srt played an important role in structuring microbial co occurrence patterns to identify the topological role of nodes in the networks the plots based on within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi were constructed fig s8 nodes are usually categorized into four groups peripherals connectors module hubs and network hubs deng et al 2016 ecologically peripherals represent specialists in the microbial community while module hubs and connectors represent generalists in the community and network hubs indicate supergeneralists olesen et al 2007 the majority of nodes were peripherals with most of their links inside their own modules in the four networks and supergeneralists were not observed in all networks fig 5 two connectors module hubs were identified in each network which were the keystone taxa driving the microbial succession and maintaining the microbial function in the thp ad systems otu4592 belonged to g peptostreptococcus was the connector in the microbial community at srt of 10 d but was the module hub in the microbial community at srt of 15 d otu2703 belonged to g lutispora and otu1014 belonged to f synergistaceae were identified as connector and module hub at srt of 10 d and 15 d respectively otu1370 c olb14 affiliated with p chloroflexi and otu4374 o c10 sb1a affiliated with c anaerolineae were the connectors at srt of 20 d while otu77 f comamonadaceae and otu3449 f sc i 84 affiliated with o burkholderiales were the module hubs at srt of 30 d of note the relative abundance of these keystone taxa was low 0 03 0 34 on average suggesting that some species with even low abundance could also play crucial roles in shaping the ad microbial community structures 100 positive microbial interactions between keystone species and their neighbors were observed under the four srts except for srt of 10 d 61 positive interaction indicating the ubiquitous presence of cooperative behavior such as cross feeding mutualism within the ad microbial community 4 discussion 4 1 srt influenced thp ad microbial community assembly null model analysis suggested that deterministic processes dominated microbial community assemblies in thp ad reactors regardless of the tested srts fig 4 in ad food web the intricate balance among multiple functional groups is essential for efficient methane production and strengthening the biotic interactions e g competition and cross feeding between primary and secondary metabolizers based on deterministic process the present result is consistent with previous studies which reported that deterministic assembly was the dominant process in bioreactors with desirable performance lin et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 however the role of stochastic processes in microbial assembly should not be overlooked they also played important roles in driving community assembly especially at a long srt e g 30 d which may be due to input resources and new microbes introduced by the periodic feeding campaigns the feed sludge not only changed the physicochemical traits in the thp ad reactors but also introduced new microflora thereby shifting the microbial communities and increasing the stochasticity during the community assemblage turnover lin et al 2017 in theory fresh thp sludge produced at high temperature could not have active microbes since the collected thp sludge was stored in a cold room 4 c microbiota growth may initiate which is partially supported by the result of fluorescent staining of dead live cells in the feed sludge conducted at the end of experiment fig s9 in practice owing to the high solids concentration and high temperature thp sludge is commonly diluted with primary sludge was before being fed into mesophilic ad systems jiang et al 2021 which inevitably introduce new microbes ecological drift an inherent stochastic process including birth death and reproduction zhou and ning 2017 could be another possible explanation rare taxa are more likely subjected to ecological drift and a small change in their abundance could result in extinction and thereby increase stochasticity indicating that the very low abundant keystone taxa may also contribute to stochasticity at a long srt substrates could be limited and microbes may rely on endogenous respiration as a survival strategy sun et al 2020 the ability of ad microbiomes to resist disturbances from the influent microbiota was relatively weaker compared to that at a short srt which is consistent with the higher estimated migration rate at longer srts fig s7 accordingly a long srt increased the stochasticity in the ad process the high biodiversity at a long srt means diverse microbial communities which contain many unique taxa with different trophic groups are functionally redundant briones and raskin 2003 zhang et al 2020 for instance abundant hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria were present in the thp ad reactors petrimonas proteiniphilum dmer64 longilinea syntrophomonas etc the total relative abundance of dominant methanogenic archaea e g methanoculleus methanosaeta methanolinea methanospirillum among the different srts were similar although the abundance of respective methanogenic archaea varied with srts fig 2 in this light even though high stochasticity was observed at a long srt functional redundancy of microbiomes could still guarantee the system function and stability in response to external disturbances 4 2 srt influenced co occurrence patterns of thp ad microbiomes it was previously observed that there were significant linkages between microbial network properties and ad system performance wu et al 2020 modules have been interpreted as niches or function units in microbial communities eiler et al 2012 sun et al 2021 the modularity of networks decreased with increased srts indicating a smaller extent of niche differentiation at a long srt faust and raes 2012 it means more stable network structures at longer srts which was corroborated by the results of avgk and hd of note stronger biotic interactions were previously thought to lead to greater determinism which is however contradictory to what we observed in this study in which higher stochasticity was present at longer srts it may be attributed to the fact that deterministic and stochastic processes were dynamic under varying srts and the increase in the effect of stochastic processes was greater than that of deterministic processes the more complex networks at longer srts could be explained by the limited resource availability bioavailable substrates became scarce especially at the end of operational period of a time cycle at a long srt microbes need to cooperate to utilize the limited carbon sources to improve food availability zhang et al 2020 the microorganisms also need to tightly connect each other to cope with the unfavorable environmental conditions in the thp ad reactors at a long srt e g 30 d by contrast at a short srt substrates were relatively sufficient and were not a limiting factor to function efficiently microorganisms do not need to be as interactive as that at a long srt fig 5 they also do not need to resist many external disturbances and therefore are less likely to form complicated modules and tight connectivity henzi et al 2009 keystone taxa have been demonstrated to be critical to maintaining ecosystem structures and functions as the loss of these highly connected species within networks would have the greatest influences on community structures sun et al 2021 different keystone taxa were observed in the networks under different srts which is in agreement with context dependency theory that keystone species could only play crucial roles under certain circumstances power et al 1996 sun et al 2021 their relative abundance was low suggesting that rare species have a crucial impact on the ability of a community to maintain the ecosystem s function likely by serving as functional cache or resource pool in response to environmental changes zhou et al 2021 these keystone species could be important for the efficient ad food web which supports the vital role of environmental filtering in the community assembly process according to the midas database nierychlo et al 2020 the genera lutispora and peptostreptococcus could transform macromolecular organics into vfas which could be further converted into acetate by acetogenic bacteria e g sedimentibacter bacteria affiliated with c anaerolineae and o burkholderiales have been found to be able to decompose carbohydrates via fermentation pérez pantoja et al 2012 zou et al 2018 we speculate that otu4374 and otu3449 could also play an important role in organic hydrolysis fermentation f synergistaceae is capable of oxidizing acetate to h2 co2 lv et al 2019 which could support the growth and activity of hydrotrophic methanogens e g methanoculleus methanospirillum although the generalists e g otu77 otu1370 otu3449 are uncultured species they were frequently reported in ad systems yang et al 2015 gulhane et al 2017 liang et al 2021 future investigation is required to better understand the specific functions of these populations in thp ad reactors 4 3 implications and research needs in mesophilic thp ad systems srt is an important operational parameter influencing microbial compositions and structures in this study we focused on the effects of a broad srt range 10 30 d on microbial community assembly and succession although deterministic selection dominated the community assembly in all the cases tested a longer srt resulted in a greater role of stochasticity in structuring the thp ad microbial community the thp ad reactors still performed well at srt of 30 d suggesting that functional redundancy could play an important role in maintaining system function and stability in response to disturbances of note these findings did not mean that a shorter srt must lead to higher determinism and there may be a threshold by which an extremely short srt e g 10 d may increase stochasticity and system instability since too many niche vacancies could be frequently occupied by the influent microbiota of feed sludge sun et al 2020 and pronounced vfas accumulation could occur resulting in an inhibitory effect on methanogens thp ad reactors at srt of 10 d required a longer time to achieve stable performance the methane yield was also lower owing to the limited hydrolysis fermentation in this light when treating thp sludge the srt could be shortened to 15 d rather than 10 d if studied at a finer time scale srt may be further reduced to some extent other parameters e g organic loading rate temperature substrate type are also important in shaping ad microbial communities wu et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 how the interactions of these parameters influence the microbial community assembly and succession warrants further study a fraction of species were present more frequently than predicted regardless of dynamic srts fig s7 some of which were frequently detected as hydrolyzers and or fermenters in thp ad systems e g f spirochaetaceae g gracilibacter g syntrophobacter g syntrophus g caldicoprobacter liu et al 1999 poirier et al 2016 ziganshina et al 2017 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2020b suggesting that they could be important functional populations in thp ad systems as such optimizing operational strategies could increase the abundance and or maintain the high activities of those taxa in reactors which could aid in strengthening the role of deterministic processes in microbial community assembly and ensuring better system function the optimal operational factors need to be determined in future studies additionally we deciphered the temporal community assembly mechanisms to some extent in the thp ad reactors but this study is still limited by the number of temporal samples analyzed and the system scale as stated above mixing thp sludge with primary sludge was has been widely implemented in real applications jiang et al 2021 the dynamic microbial communities in the primary sludge was would also influence the microbial assemblages in thp ad reactors therefore the assembly mechanisms of microbial communities in thp ad process in full scale systems should also be further studied via collecting a larger set of samples at a finer temporal resolution 5 conclusion srt played an important role in regulating system performance microbial assembly and succession in thp ad reactors the main findings are shown as following to achieve efficient substrate conversion and methane production the srt could be set to 15 d the limited hydrolytic fermentative capacities of microbiomes restricted a further srt reduction to 10 d microbial diversity decreased along with time during the long term operation in all the thp ad reactors but microbial community harbored higher biodiversity at a long srt than at a short srt it may be due to the increased competition and predominant populations at short srts with higher organic loading rates deterministic selection dominated the thp ad microbial community assemblages but the effect of stochastic processes on community assembly became more pronounced with increased srts likely attributing to the immigrants from the feedstock srt substantially influenced the topological properties of thp ad microbial networks the microbial community networks at longer srts had lower modularity and harmonic distance as well as higher average degree which could be due to the effects of limited resource

16418,future climatic demographic technological urban and socio economic challenges call for more flexible and sustainable wastewater infrastructure systems exploratory modelling can help to investigate the consequences of these developments on the infrastructure in order to explore large numbers of adaptation strategies we need to re balance the degree of realism of sewer network and ability to reflect key performance characteristics against the model s parsimony and computational efficiency we present a spatially explicit algorithm for creating sanitary sewer networks that realistically represent key characteristics of a real system basic topographic demographic and urban characteristics are abstracted into a squared grid of blocks which are the foundation for the sewer network s topology delineation we compare three different pipe dimensioning approaches and found a good balance between detail and computational efficiency with a basic hydraulic performance assessment we demonstrate that we attain a computationally efficient and high fidelity wastewater sewer network with adequate hydraulic performance a spatial resolution of 250 m block size in combination with a sequential pipe by pipe pbp design algorithm provides a sound trade off between computational time and fidelity of relevant structural and hydraulic properties for exploratory modelling we can generate a simplified sewer network both topology and hydraulic design in 18 s using pbp versus 36 min using a highly detailed model or 1 s using a highly abstract model moreover this simplification can cut up to 1 10th to 1 50th the computational time for the hydraulic simulations depending on the routing method implemented we anticipate our model to be a starting point for sophisticated exploratory modelling into possible infrastructure adaptation measures of topological and loading changes of sewer systems for long term planning graphical abstract image graphical

systems face several challenges in meeting their future requirements the applicability and sustainability of conventional centralised sewer systems for wastewater management are increasingly questioned wong and brown 2009 hering et al 2012 marlow et al 2013 larsen et al 2016 bakhshipour et al 2019 aging or underperforming infrastructure and predicted climatic demographic technological urban and socio economic developments call for an adaptation of current urban wastewater management systems considering future requirements and challenges related to service provision baron et al 2016 larsen et al 2016 this adaptation involves not only technical aspects but also resource efficiency resilience and sustainability recent research suggests a transition towards more decentralised schemes e g on site cluster or community level infrastructure for treating dispersing or reusing wastewater at or near its source that align better with development scenarios kaufmann alves 2013 larsen et al 2013 baron et al 2016 bakhshipour et al 2019 hoffmann et al 2020 elmqvist et al 2021 and changing goals hering et al 2012 their degree of centralisation defined as the ratio of sinks and sources eggimann et al 2015 can vary from fully centralised e g all sources are connected to one centralised wastewater treatment plant to fully decentralised every source has its own local sink larsen et al 2013 eggimann et al 2015 poustie et al 2015 considering this additional degree of freedom is one of the grand challenges in current wastewater infrastructure planning three core issues emerge i generation of new or novel infrastructures within existing systems e g because existing infrastructures require renewal or due to urban growth ii appropriate representation of the spatial characteristics of infrastructure and of its underlying catchment and iii integration of deep or scenario uncertainty into the planning process several algorithms to generate water infrastructure have been developed and used to model and evaluate different system alternatives sitzenfrei et al 2010a present the virtual infrastructure benchmarking vibe model to generate ensembles of virtual case studies of entire urban water systems e g water supply drainage and sewer systems urich et al 2010 that resemble real systems for testing new measures and generalising theories spatial layouts of water infrastructure networks in this framework are generated through graph theoretical algorithms sitzenfrei et al 2010b duque et al 2020 or agent based models in which possible optimal sewer placement is identified urich et al 2010 graph theory ahuja et al 1993 is commonly used to represent water networks for example when solving optimization problems for design operation or maintenance using heuristics sitzenfrei et al 2010b urich et al 2010 haghighi and bakhshipour 2015 bakhshipour et al 2017 moeini and afshar 2017 or exact algorithms newman et al 2014 duque et al 2016 navin et al 2019 duque et al 2020 bakhshipour et al 2019 generate multiple infrastructure layouts and explore different degrees of centralization in both green fields and existing urban areas others considered the impact of the urban characteristics on water infrastructure kaufmann alves 2013 baron et al 2016 bach et al 2018 most of these aim to obtain a detailed representation of the sewer network and are therefore often computationally expensive depending on the size of the network i e number of pipes water infrastructures are closely tied to the urban form and therefore strongly conditioned by spatial characteristics for example location shape and dimensions of sewer infrastructures depend on the density and spatial distribution of water users but also influenced by terrain and street layout geographic information systems gis have been used to represent these spatial parameters to assess and improve the management and planning of urban drainage networks bach et al 2020 and localise different elements of the system leitão et al 2005 bach et al 2013 mair et al 2017 abbas et al 2019 a relevant open question in this regard is the required degree of spatial abstraction or resolution for different planning purposes especially in light of considerable uncertainties of future developments lempert et al 2003 coined the term deep uncertainty to describe situations where we know absolutely nothing about probability distributions and little more about the possible outcomes as is the case concerning future water use population growth and urbanisation maier et al 2014 one way to consider such uncertainties is to explore the consequences of system alternatives under different scenarios in a long term planning process such an approach has been applied to explore potential urban drainage transition pathways urich et al 2013 baron et al 2015 rauch et al 2017 for layout and size optimisation of sewer networks duque et al 2016 bakhshipour et al 2019 moeini and afshar 2019 turan

2010 quantification of decentralised water management opportunities bach et al 2013 risk and vulnerability assessment sitzenfrei et al 2011 meijer et al 2018 among others dance4water dynamic adaptation for enabling city evolution for water is an example of an integrated planning support model that simulates the development of water infrastructure over long time periods considering urban and societal dynamics rauch et al 2017 the model uses multi criteria assessment to evaluate numerous stormwater management options at various spatial scales urich et al 2013 given its size and scale dance4water requires significant data input to its sub models baron et al 2017 also present a highly detailed model sinoptikom to model transitions of combined sewer networks towards source separated wastewater systems with decentralised treatment over a 50 year period integer linear programming is used to optimize the transition strategy using an objective function with eight objectives this approach was applied to several small rural villages in germany with 500 800 inhabitants approximately 4 km network length sinoptikom is computationally hard to scale and details on the modelling approach and its implementation are not publicly accessible baron et al 2016 from a long term city scale planning perspective the above mentioned approaches suffer from high complexity a zeal for close representation of the real system next to the integrated modelling of physical processes seem to have led to detailed spatial models that require vast amounts of data and computational resources even for small water infrastructure systems we need models that allow us to analyse large numbers of sewer infrastructure alternatives and future scenarios for robust decision making and options exploration at larger spatial scales than what is currently available davis et al 2007 therefore the generation of sewer networks with different levels of spatial abstraction is necessary to i create appropriate sewer models for the modelling task e g more detailed hydraulic performance evaluation vs city scale urban drainage planning and ii allow the comparison of multiple alternatives while maintaining the integrity of information about the urban characteristics and associated water infrastructure bach et al 2020 this paper presents a sewer infrastructure generator for exploratory modelling in wastewater system planning focussed on sanitary sewers i e disregarding stormwater the automatic generation of representative sewer networks is essential to test the impact of changes in the urban form we developed a spatially explicit algorithm for creating approximate sewer network topologies that realistically represent main properties of a real system based on topographic demographic and urban characteristics to explore different degrees of realism levels of abstraction and computational efficiency two different methodologies for generating virtual wastewater sewer networks are tested and compared to the existing infrastructure a third highly abstract non spatial algorithm is used to compare the physical network characteristics and the computational effort required to generate such an abstract network these three approaches are contrasted to better understand the trade offs of different simplified representations in comparison to models using topology and dimensions of real sewer infrastructure we also evaluate the hydraulic performance of the most promising network generation approach against the expected performance of the real system 2 methodology following good modelling practice we first define the specific purpose and context before determining model structure and parameters and ultimately evaluating how well a model fulfils its purpose jakeman et al 2006 schmolke et al 2010 our aspiration is a sewer network generator for exploratory analysis of topological and loading changes of sewer systems for long term planning i e 10 years horizon at city scale typically several hundreds to thousands of km of pipes ideally we would like to use it interactively with stakeholders where only the most relevant out of thousands of candidate solutions would be selected and evaluated this would require the generation of hydraulically feasible designs and the computation of key hydraulic performance indicators for each relevant solution with high computational efficiency the sewer topology should fulfil requirements of pertinent planning dimensioning norms and be able to approximate the real system at district level while reflecting common constraints imposed by spatial characteristics such as topography the location of major roads surface water bodies or parklands furthermore the pipe diameter distributions should not diverge substantially from that of a real infrastructure system to estimate aggregate infrastructure cost and construction efforts key hydraulic performance characteristics under typical flow as well as high and low flow conditions should be reflected appropriately in summary we aim to develop a sewer network generator that is significantly faster while still respecting the spatial characteristics but also coarser than the existing approaches reviewed in the introduction fig 1 presents our proposed approach to achieve this we use basic spatial information from population land use and topography to create a spatial abstraction of the urban characteristics using the planning support model urbanbeats bach et al 2018 urban characteristics are abstracted into a squared grid of blocks as defined in section 2 1 in order to determine the need for wastewater management depending on the land use area this information is then used by the sewer infrastructure generator to produce a network topology these network designs are compared against a fully abstract spatially not explicit approach know as urban water infrastructure model uwim maurer et al 2013 and the real network since we want to sufficiently represent the characteristics of the real network we compared the physical characteristics concerning topology network connectivity and pipe diameter frequency distributions of the real system and the generated system at three spatial resolutions finally a basic hydraulic performance assessment was done for the algorithms that fulfilled abovementioned requirements for our envisaged modelling purpose 2 1 input data and abstraction of urban characteristics to generate a sewer network we require information on the a elevation b land use and c population which defines the urban environment to calculate wastewater volumes based on local planning regulations e g average housing occupancy water demands to support this process we use the urbanbeats planning support model as a starting point urbanbeats is a spatial model designed for planning decentralised stormwater management solutions in urban catchments bach et al 2018 bach et al 2020 it processes gis inputs of land use population and elevation among other data sets to produce a gridded map of cells known as blocks each block is a grid cell containing a geodatabase of urban characteristics for its corresponding geographic location and represents an abstraction of the urban environment this block can have a flexible size that is dependent on modelling aims and the model is capable of simulating differently sizes of urban areas it has been tested for areas ranging between 5 km2 up to 1200 km2 we selected urbanbeats as a suitable starting point for aggregating all relevant spatial information to undertake our sewer network generation the model considers the variability in land uses in a spatially explicit manner at a reasonably fine spatial scale additionally the spatial resolution in urbanbeats allows us to design an abstract network that can encompass a broad range of pipe diameters and spatial scales to set up our input layer for sewer network generation we follow the following steps 1 delineation of blocks 2 abstraction of the urban form and 3 spatial mapping of wastewater generation 2 1 1 delineation of blocks urbanbeats processes three essential spatial input maps of a elevation using a water centric classification from bach et al 2015 b land use and c population see fig 2 a c a grid of blocks containing the essential information to define the water infrastructure networks and technologies as well as their interconnectivity amongst the adjacent blocks is delineated for the spatial extents of these maps as described by bach et al 2018 blocks represent the smallest spatially explicit unit within the model in which input data is aggregated block size is user defined and will have an influence on the level of abstraction of urban characteristics in this study we use a 250 by 250 m square block size for the abstraction since we want to generate not only the trunk mains of the sewer network but also the collection sewers this size will provide us with an extensive sewer network without excessively aggregating the spatial data however we also test the sensitivity of our algorithm to larger square blocks with 500 m and 1000 m sides to better understand the impact of resolution 2 1 2 abstraction of the urban form and mapping of wastewater generation the available higher resolution input data is aggregated to the block level note that each block retains information about the mix of land uses while total population and average elevation are determined by overlaying the grid onto the input rasters urbanbeats then uses standard parameters e g from statutory planning guidelines and other relevant urban planning documents to create an abstraction of the urban form based on the aggregated input data this involves a procedural algorithm that systematically identifies characteristics for each land use such as the size and geometric form of residential allotments impervious fractions breakdown of land covers in industrial and commercial zones among others employment is determined from population data and non residential land uses for a full description we refer the reader to bach et al 2018 fig 2 d f illustrate the model outputs for 250 m blocks for various characteristics to determine the wastewater volumes generated an end use analysis considering the frequency and duration of different household water demands e g shower toilet kitchen laundry and multiplying these with flow rates for the various indoor household appliances is used for this study we applied water efficiency ratings from the australian standards as6400 2016 standards australia 2016 non residential wastewater volumes are determined based on unit flow rates per capita or floor space the process is calculated on a block by block basis other than irrigation all end uses are assumed to discharge into the sewer system output values are annual volumes but can be downscaled using appropriate diurnal and seasonal patterns or modified to reflect peak discharge for the following hydraulic design 2 2 sewer topology and hydraulic design sewer network topology delineation is intended to follow basic urban characteristics it should generate a network from scratch in new urban developments or represent an existing network when the cadastre is not available other methods for simplification e g skeletonization of an existing network could be used if all the data were known grayman and rhee 2000 cantone et al 2008 in this study we focus on the methodology for topology delineation based on the abstraction of the urban characteristics into a blocks map the blocks map is used by the infrastructure generator assuming that sewer connections are required in areas where people live or work the spatial distribution of population and employment defines areas needing wastewater management thereafter two key procedures are run 1 generation of sewer network topology section 2 2 1 followed by 2 hydraulic design of sewer pipes section 2 2 2 2 2 1 generation of sewer network topology based on the abstracted data of the city the sewer network topology is generated through the following steps 1 identify existing wastewater treatment plants main roads and water bodies 2 correct terrain depressions found after the abstraction of the topography 3 delineate sewer topology based on gravity driven flow paths influenced by the infrastructure identified in step 1 and 4 generate the trunk sewers to connect all local outlets to start we define a final outfall at the spatial system boundary typically representing a wastewater treatment plant or a trunk main leading thereto and use spatial features such as main roads and rivers to guide the sewer delineation the modeller can determine whether or not to use certain types of streets as an attractor for the sewer delineation since blocks are the lowest abstraction level the nodes of the flow paths are defined by each block s centroid with an elevation equal to the average elevation of the block pipes within the blocks are not considered topology delineation takes place over the entire area that requires wastewater management flow paths are delineated using the d8 algorithm o callaghan and mark 1984 assuming gravity driven flow following the steepest slope this algorithm determines the largest elevation drop among each block s eight neighbours and saves that neighbour as its downstream block the topography of the study area is pre processed to avoid the presence of internal depressions and flat areas by using a carving method sedgewick 1988 which is explained in more detail in appendix a1 1 local depressions that cannot be overcome with the pit removal method normally correspond to the lowest blocks either at the edge of the case study or natural depressions e g rivers or lakes these blocks are then the outlets of the generated sewer sub catchment to ensure that all these catchments drain to a defined wastewater treatment facility we subsequently generate the trunk sewers this is done by connecting the catchment sinks using a minimum spanning tree ahuja et al 1993 algorithm to get the minimum pipe length of such a trunk system the minimum spanning tree to delineate the trunk sewers considers the location of outlets of the different sub catchments and the wastewater treatment plant as well as the elevation of these points so far we allow for negative slopes i e against gravity which means that pumping is allowed we also allow crossings of water bodies considering that we do not necessarily want to have the trunk sewers being delineated along the rivers 2 2 2 hydraulic design of sewer pipes this part of the model builds on the generated sewer topology by assigning diameters and its upstream and downstream invert elevations to the pipes generated in the last section we apply and compare two distinct dimensioning algorithms to size the generated gravity sewer network a the sewer network design snd algorithm duque et al 2016 which gives a cost optimal hydraulic design after an exhaustive search over all the feasible design combinations and b pipe by pipe pbp method returning the first feasible hydraulic design obtained when designing one pipe at the time starting from the extremes of the network towards the outfall and choosing the minimum pipe diameter capable to transport the design flow these contrasting approaches were chosen to identify which general method is suitable to represent a realistic system vis à vis our modelling purpose the calculated average daily wastewater discharge at each block is used in eq 1 to estimate the maximum daily peak flow the model does not consider inflow from infiltration we consider residential industrial and commercial wastewater discharges per block assuming a separate foul sewer network the maximum daily peak flow is used as the design flow for the hydraulic design of the infrastructure 1 q max f max f ww q ww where qmax is the wastewater peak or design flow m3 s 1 qww is the average wastewater production m3 s 1 fmax the peak water use factor and fww the wastewater return factor representing the amount of used water that is discharged to the sewer we use a fmax value of 1 2 and a fww of 0 85 following butler and davies 2011 the design algorithms for pipe diameter and slope are parameterised to reflect local design regulations and customary hydraulic design constraints for both dimensioning algorithms the hydraulic constraints presented in table 1 are considered during the hydraulic design additional parameters and considerations for the hydraulic design under very steep or shallow terrain slopes using sewer drops or pumps respectively are presented in appendix a2 1 the pipe diameter is a discrete variable which is defined by the regulatory minimum diameter and the set of commercially available or used pipes we used the set of diameters d show in eq 2 2 d i n m 0 225 0 25 0 35 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 80 1 1 20 1 5 2 2 5 3 2 2 2 1 method 1 sewer network design snd in the first method we used the dimensioning algorithm of duque et al 2016 to solve the hydraulic design problem i e diameter slope combination for each pipe duque et al s 2016 framework finds the cost optimal design of a series of sewer pipes using dynamic programming the input data are network topology flow rates for each pipe a cost function in terms of the diameter and excavation depth roughness of the pipe material manning or strickler coefficients and hydraulic constraints that guarantee proper system operation see table 1 the hydraulic design problem is modelled as a shortest path problem cf bellman 1958 ahuja et al 1993 where the provided directed graph is reflecting the network topology and considers every feasible slope diameter combination for each pipe the slope is defined by discretized invert elevations of the couple of nodes at the extremes of each link while the diameter of the link is defined by its downstream node the shortest path algorithm identifies the cost optimal hydraulic design by selecting the least cost path each pipe has an estimated cost based on its diameter and required excavation volume the evaluation of every feasible design combination makes this algorithm computationally expensive however it is able to solve the problem in a polynomial time which makes it an np easy problem garey and johnson 1979 2 2 2 2 method 2 pipe by pipe design pbp the pipe by pipe design pbp algorithm designs one pipe at the time starting from upstream extremes of the network topology towards the outfall we calculate the minimum and maximum feasible slopes for the given diameter using manning s formula in eq 3 for the minimum and maximum velocity table 1 assuming a maximum filling ratio of the pipe 3 s v n 1 r 2 3 2 where s is the slope of the pipe v m s 1 is the flow velocity n s m 1 3 is the manning roughness coefficient and r m is the hydraulic radius we set initial values at the minimum slope for each pipe and select the first slope that fulfils the hydraulic constrains for the pipe including the minimum and maximum excavation limits of 1 2 m and 5 m respectively the real filling ratio for each diameter slope combination given the design flow is recalculated before the hydraulic constraints evaluation once a feasible discrete diameter is determined we continue downstream and design the next pipe when two or more pipes converge to one node the algorithm stops until all the upstream pipes have been designed this ensures connectivity between pipes each pipe starts at the deepest depth of the pipes arriving at its upstream node diameters increase as we proceed downstream implying that the minimum starting diameter for each pipe is that of its upstream neighbour once we reach the network outlet i e the sink a feasible hydraulic design is found this method thus only proposes a feasible hydraulic design that complies with constraints in table 1 without seeking an optimal design 2 3 model testing and application 2 3 1 model used for comparison urban water infrastructure model uwim the urban water infrastructure model uwim approach by maurer et al 2013 estimates the amount of sewer infrastructure needed in a given catchment uwim is not spatially explicit and therefore does not use an input topology of the network the core of uwim is an idealised catchment area model therefore representing the highest degree of abstraction among the presented dimensioning algorithms uwim dimensions the sewers based on the rational method and considering the average water consumption per capita per day and the total population in the catchment its output is the length of sewers required to drain the area and a size distribution of the pipe diameters uwim s input data comprises housing density total population amount of wastewater to drain and catchment area to calculate the total length and diameter distribution of sewer pipes it divides the total catchment area into a rectangular grid and uses three model parameters to characterise the catchment s geometric shape and urban form the parameter f 1 is the shape factor of the catchment area f 2 is the shape factor of housing plots and f 3 is the fraction of secondary lines above the main trunk they determine the height and width of the cells that subdivide the catchment the number and length of pipes is directly affected by the dimensions of the cells making the diameter distribution very sensitive to these parameters here f1 60 f2 60 f3 0 6 are chosen calibrated to the cells area to get a comparable sub catchment with regard to those obtained when using a 250 m block size to generate the topology this simple model can represent key parameters of real sewer systems realistically without any explicit spatial design we use this dimensioning algorithm as a benchmark for our abstraction process uwim is expected to be computationally efficient but also the coarsest and most abstract representation of the sewer system available 2 3 2 case study description we selected a region within inner metropolitan melbourne australia fig 2 as the case study for model testing the case study boundary encompasses two local councils city of melbourne city of port phillip and an area of 57 km2 this area has a population of approximately 148 633 people and predominantly residential land use 44 with mixed development densities ranging from medium 10 dwellings ha 1 to high density housing 30 dwellings ha 1 it is roughly characterised by hilly areas spanning from northeast to southeast a river system and a very flat area closer to the sea representing a wide variety of topographical characteristics for the network design algorithm furthermore the case study area is drained by a separate sewer system of which we are only considering the sanitary sewers input data was sourced from various open data repositories from the state of victoria 2009 and the australian bureau of statistics 2006 datavic 2020 we used a 1 m resolution dem state of victoria 2009 population density australian bureau of statistics 2006 and land use reclassified according to urbanbeats classification bach et al 2015 were converted to a 10m x 10m raster for urbanbeats input fig 2a c additionally to aid the delineation and network generation main roads and rivers were also obtained in esri shapefile format datavic 2020 to allow comparison with the real sewer infrastructure we obtained a sewer assets database from the water authority melbourne water the baseline used for the assessment was 2010 with land use data and population data from data sets around this time period the abstraction obtained from urbanbeats was created not only for 250 m block size but also for 500 m and 1 000 m to test the sensitivity of our sewer generation algorithm outputs for a 250 m block size are shown in fig 2 d f we can see from the employment map that the city s business activity is concentrated in the centre of the case study and north of the port in the west the darkest parts reflect the central business district and the st kilda region representing the highest office density in this case study another hotspot with high employee density is the port dominated by heavy industry and trade the population density follows the residential land use and shows a high concentration of residents along the coast to the south and across the hills areas without employment or population are either green spaces or undeveloped areas which do not need a wastewater management fig 2 f shows the wastewater discharge per block that is used as inflow for the wastewater sewer network it is calculated based on the water consumption per block considering the land use mix areas with higher discharge are those with high density residential commercial and industrial areas 2 3 3 validation and performance criteria we compare the physical characteristics and hydraulic performance from the generated networks obtained through the snd pbp and uwim algorithms against the real network since we sacrifice accuracy to reduce computational times we highlight the trade offs of more accurate physical characteristics against computational effort required to design a wastewater sewer network as outlined at the beginning of this section an acceptable generated sewer network would have total pipe lengths and dimensions in same order of magnitude and would suitably reproduce basic hydraulic performance as for the real network 2 3 3 1 representation of physical components versus computational effort a validation process was carried out to compare the generated systems with the existing sewer system for this we compare the fidelity of representing the real sewer network characteristics comparing the generated sewer network topology and pipe diameter distributions qualitatively as well as quantitatively using the kullback liebler kl divergence distance dkl for discrete probability distributions in eq 4 kullback 1959 4 d k l p q x x p x ln p x q x the kl divergence compares the probability of occurrence of each observation between two probability distributions there the results from both dimensioning algorithms are translated into frequency distributions of the pipe diameters to be compared where each diameter is considered an observation when calculating dkl p x and q x represent the two probability distributions of network pipe diameters x to compare an ideal kl divergence value is 0 i e both distributions are equal this measure is asymmetric which means it does not require or favour any specific probability distribution we also evaluate the computational effort required by the three different dimensioning approaches we compare for snd and pbp the impact of the spatial resolutions of the blocks during the topology delineation on the computational times likewise we compare the computational time used by uwim whose geometry parameters as specified in section 2 3 1 roughly reflect a 250 m resolution block 2 3 3 2 hydraulic performance both real and generated network topologies were designed using the same hydraulic parameters and conditions using the pbp algorithm and modelled in epa s storm water management model swmm rossman 2010 for a comparison of their basic hydraulic characteristics table 2 presents the hydraulic performance indicators used and the relevant flow conditions for their computation detailed water demand patterns and other modelling assumptions are presented in appendix a3 3 results 3 1 wastewater infrastructure generator there is a trade off between the spatial resolution determining the level of detail of generated sewer infrastructure and the computational effort required to generate and evaluate it larger block sizes give less detail for the abstraction of the urban characteristics and the delineation of the collection sewers between the blocks while reducing the number of pipes to represent the sewer infrastructure for the same urban area see appendix a1 2 table 3 compares the results of the generated sewer network topology delineation for the areas of inner melbourne to the real network topology the generated topology includes the collection and trunk sewers taking the wastewater to the discharge point in the west of the city there are similarities in the location of trunk sewers along the coastline in the south but also key differences in other areas of the city topological differences between the collection sewers of the real network and the generated one are clearly evident in fig 3 the generated network produces less but longer pipes since the pipes are generated from centroid to centroid of the blocks they can only be connected through their eight neighbours 3 2 hydraulic design pipe diameter frequency distributions for the real and generated network using the three design methodologies are shown in fig 4 this distribution gives a first good glance at the dimensions of the infrastructure using the different dimensioning algorithms it allows for a quick comparison of the proportion of the different pipe diameters in a sewer network based on the shape of distributions in addition considering the level of abstraction of uwim it is the most intuitive way to compare the three dimensioning algorithms snd pbp and uwim against the real network it shows that 80 of the real network is composed of the smallest diameter pipes and around 1 of diameters consist of trunk sewers with a pipe diameters greater than or equal to 1 m as apparent from fig 4 snd and pbp match the real network s diameter distribution closely but not uwim snd obtains a higher frequency of pipes with a diameter of 2 5 m in comparison to pbp while pbp has a higher frequency on the smallest diameter although uwim is similarly able to represent the proportion of smallest diameter sewers it appears to omit small to medium diameters and returns much larger portions of diameters between 0 8 m and 1 5 m 3 3 performance validation 3 3 1 representation of physical components versus computational effort table 4 shows how the three generated sewer networks differ in terms of fidelity of representing the physical components using the kl divergence measure and computational effort the computational effort cpu time required by snd is orders of magnitude higher than for the other two algorithms and also increases strongly with decreasing block size the urbanbeats spatial abstraction and topology delineation took about 17 s on a standard computer with intel core i7 8550u with 1 80ghz cpu 4 cores 16 gb memory ram as such it was not critical in the total computation time this time must be added to the time used by snd and pbp to dimension the pipes excluding topology delineation snd took around 2 181 s 36 min to solve a 763 pipe network design with 250 m block size while the pbp algorithm took less than 1 s uwim computational time accounts only for the dimensioning of pipes which took just 1 5 s and does not grow much with the size of the catchment area these stark differences are not apparent in the fidelity as reflected by kl divergence at 250 m spatial resolution both snd and pbp match the real network very closely kl divergence close to zero where snd s fidelity is only slightly better than that of pbp the coarser the resolution the faithless the fidelity higher the kl divergence uwim has an acceptable kl divergence of 0 32 considering its lack of a spatial representation 3 3 2 hydraulic performance and computational effort the hydraulic performance assessment was done for the hydraulic design of the generated and real topology using pbp algorithm only snd was omitted from this analysis as the network generation module required too much computational effort for it to be suitable for our purposes fig 5 shows that the hydrograph at the outfall node of the generated network reflects that of the real network closely during a 24 h simulation despite a small delay fig 6 compares the probability density distributions for the travel times from each upstream inspection shaft source to the outfall for both generated and real networks the average travel times have the same order of magnitude for the generated 3 900 s and real 2 900 s network topologies this corresponds to the average path length of 9 1 km and 8 1 km for the generated and real network topology respectively this 12 increase in the average path length for the generated network results in overall longer travel times table 5 presents a summary of the hydraulic performance for low typical and high flow conditions as expected there is neither flooding nor surcharge in the network under typical flow conditions with low flow conditions both generated and real networks present comparable sedimentation patterns in the smallest pipe diameters at the upstream parts of the network under typical flow the frictional losses and pumping required are underrepresented in the generated network throughout all simulations minor frictional losses were ignored these include entry or exit losses as well as losses at bends or intersections the reason for this is to avoid bias as the algorithm generating the network minimizes the number of pipes generating less intersections and bends likewise with high flow both generated and real networks present surcharge and flooding concentrated in the high inflow industrial area of the case study surcharges in the generated network however are twice as much table 6 presents the computational effort for 48 h hydraulic simulations in swmm the computational effort needed using the generated sewer network amount to less than 1 10th for kinematic wave calculations and 1 50th for dynamic wave calculations as compared to the real network 4 discussion the main aim is to identify a network generator that mimics the characteristics of real networks sufficiently well while significantly increasing the computational efficiency of network design and hydraulic performance evaluation one of the key challenges lies in demonstrating the fit for purpose of the network generators to support exploratory modelling of changing sewer systems in support of long term infrastructure planning we did this by comparing the generated network with the existing such a direct comparison faces two fundamental causes for deviation 1 the abstraction and idealisation of the network generator might produce fundamental topological or dimensioning differences because it ignores design relevant spatial details on the ground 2 there is no reason to believe that an existing network would have been the one and only best way to create a drainage system current systems represent one possible good enough solution for a functioning drainage system usually the product of an historically grown system we are interested to minimise the first cause of deviation however it is impossible to assign observed differences clearly to one or the other deviation type also the fidelity and acceptable computational time deemed necessary depend on what outcomes of interest one is interested to model at which spatial resolution with this difficulty in mind we assess the suitability of the presented sewer network generator this model is not only applicable for urban drainage planning and exploratory modelling but could also be used for other aims such us operation and maintenance modelling of the sewer systems for example it is possible to use this simplified sewer generator to analyse different sewer deterioration models implement different rehabilitation strategies change characteristics of the urban area and analyse the consequences on the sewer system among others however the nature of the model also has limitations in terms of the resolution that is required for the different modelling aims it is not meant to be use as a tool for a detailed design of a sewer system nor a detailed simulation of the operation of the network 4 1 wastewater infrastructure generation module network topology we found that a 250 m block size allows for simplification without losing important information of the land use classification and the average elevation per block the obtained topology delineation shows similarity between trunk sewers in the real and generated network as presented in fig 3 the generated topology reflects the two main trunk lines on the north and the south of the case study and the difference in their lengths is marginal 0 3 they differ in that the real trunk mains tend to follow roads and highways while the sewer generator prioritizes topography and follows the river the topology of the collection sewers shows more substantial differences the total pipe length of the generated network is 17 shorter compared to the real network fig 3 shows quite well that the real collection sewers tend to observe more closely the urban form e g road alignments and district shapes than optimising the slope to the surface elevation overall the sewer network coverage in the case study area is similar and follows the need for foul sewer networks mainly in residential industrial and commercial areas an exception is the area of the port on the west where the generated network has more sewer coverage this is an artefact of the simple rule of translating the employment per block into needs for wastewater handling the port area does not have their water consumption distributed equally over their entire land use as it is assumed by the model such special cases are quite easy to correct for in the model by creating a no sewer industrial area if needed there is also a very obvious difference in pipe length this can be attributed to the different definition of nodes in the model and in reality snd and pbp use the centroids of the blocks as nodes a pipe unit is usually defined between a pair of inspection shafts in the model this can be easily corrected by introducing a node rule that limits the maximum pipe length a more important issue with comparing real with generated networks is their different abstraction levels the generator is defining the block as a sub catchment therefore ignoring the pipes within a block and defining the centroid as a node it is not possible to achieve the same abstraction level with the real network as the real sub catchments are not aligning well with the square blocks used additionally the fairly large minimal diameter 0 225 m pipes used does not allow a simple cut off diameter to harmonise the representation of the two networks as a consequence we would expect the real network to be substantially larger than the more efficiently generated network nevertheless we can show that this generated network is capable of evacuating all the wastewater with a similar hydraulic behaviour 4 2 hydraulic design the diameter distribution represents two relevant factors a short hand reflection of the network level hydraulic characteristics and together with the length it is an important measure of replacement value e g maurer et al 2013 the results show that the two more detailed dimensioning algorithms snd and pbp have similar pipe diameter distributions to the real network the difference between snd and pbp are mainly visible on both ends of the diameter distribution snd estimates more pipes of large diameter 2 5 m and pbp calculated more pipes of small diameter 0 225 m this can be explained by the nature of each algorithm snd aims at optimizing construction costs of the system minimizing the amount of excavation by using larger diameters with lower slopes to comply with the hydraulic constraints duque et al 2020 on the other hand pbp designs one pipe at the time assigning the smallest feasible pipe diameter that would have the required capacity and looks for the first slope starting from the minimum at which the hydraulic constraints are fulfilled given the small fidelity difference compared to the real network as measured by kl divergence both snd and pbp are considered suitable for our purposes at 250 m block resolution at higher block resolutions the kl divergence increased substantially and all three algorithms performed similarly the high computational efforts table 4 and the poor scalability duque et al 2020 therewith the slow analysis of all possible hydraulic designs is a major drawback of snd pbp was several orders of magnitude faster than snd and was able to generate suitable network designs in less than a second and seems to scale well the overall conclusion is that the pbp design seems to be a good and robust approach to dimension the pipe network generated for a 250 m block resolution with a reasonable computational time this goodness was confirmed with the hydraulic performance validation snd can generate a more cost optimised network but requires substantially more computational effort additionally this optimisation is also not reflected in the real sewer network data at lower resolution the uwim approach performs comparably well and if the purpose were to only reflect the pipe diameter distributions under data poor conditions then uwim is a good choice 4 3 hydraulic performance validation the hydraulic performance evaluation was to see whether pbp algorithm would achieve sufficient fit for purpose hydraulic characteristics to make the real and generated networks comparable we re dimensioned the real network using pbp algorithm with low flow conditions both generated and real networks present similar sedimentation risk in the smallest pipe diameters at the upstream pipes of the network likewise with typical flow conditions the resulting flow hydrograph at the outfall of the simulated sewer catchment area closely resemble that of the simulated real sewer network this is however not the case for the other hydraulic performance criteria travel times are poorly represented by the generated network as on average they are 34 longer than for the real network this is can be explained by the 12 increase in the average path length from upstream extremes to the outfall in the generated network despite its total pipe length being 17 shorter we believe that this can be explained by the artefacts of the delineation of the trunk sewers the real trunk sewers do not follow an optimised least distance approach and consequently they are 18 longer and generate lengthier travel paths 12 towards the outfall from pipes on the east see fig 3 as a consequence of the lengthier travel paths we found that the network takes more time to drain than the real network under high flow conditions the portion of the network experiencing surcharge and the percentage of volume that is flooded at the peak hour is twice as much for the generated network as for the real one the surcharge is a consequence of the lengthier travel paths under high flow conditions where the water demand pattern has a peak factor of 3 0 note that the pipes are designed for the maximum daily peak flow under typical flow conditions where the peak factor reaches 1 2 we could identify that under the same flow conditions the differences in hydraulic performance among the real and generated networks come from the topology delineation rather than the pbp dimensioning algorithm the delineation of trunk sewers seems to have a higher impact than that of the collection sewers thus if one needs to represent abovementioned hydraulic characteristics e g outfall hydrograph travel times sedimentation surcharge flooding more closely the trunk sewer delineation should be improved to mimic the real layout and forego the length optimisation the pbp based sewer network generator does provide the necessary gains in computational speed requiring only about 11 16 s per run including network generation and hydraulic evaluation thus for applications where a consistent high level representation of main network and hydraulic characteristics is sufficient pbp is found to be the most suitable among the compared algorithms for achieve exploratory modelling of sanitary sewer networks at city scale 5 conclusions for exploratory modelling of changes in sewer topology at city scale the automatic generation of representative sewer networks is essential to test the impact of changes in the urban form relying on the real system has its own challenges typically asset databases are fraught with uncertainties where errors and missing information impede explicit modelling integrated models are often more detailed than necessary for strategic planning purposes and too computationally expensive for system level exploratory modelling we need models that allow us to analyse large numbers of sewer infrastructure alternatives and future scenarios for robust decision making and options exploration at larger spatial scales than what is currently available the presented sanitary sewer infrastructure generator allows for rapid creation of idealised yet sufficiently consistent realistic and reproducible representations of sanitary sewer systems compared to historically grown real sewer networks a spatial resolution of 250 m for network topology generation in combination with the pbp algorithm provides a sound trade off between computational time and fidelity of relevant structural and hydraulic properties for exploratory modelling there is a clear trade off between the spatial resolution determining the level of detail at which sewer infrastructure designs are generated and the computational effort required to do so the minimal uwim algorithm yields only a very rough estimation of the amount of infrastructure required but has a low data demand and is computationally efficient the snd algorithm is capable of creating cost optimised networks but has a substantial computational demand with np easy scalability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

16418,future climatic demographic technological urban and socio economic challenges call for more flexible and sustainable wastewater infrastructure systems exploratory modelling can help to investigate the consequences of these developments on the infrastructure in order to explore large numbers of adaptation strategies we need to re balance the degree of realism of sewer network and ability to reflect key performance characteristics against the model s parsimony and computational efficiency we present a spatially explicit algorithm for creating sanitary sewer networks that realistically represent key characteristics of a real system basic topographic demographic and urban characteristics are abstracted into a squared grid of blocks which are the foundation for the sewer network s topology delineation we compare three different pipe dimensioning approaches and found a good balance between detail and computational efficiency with a basic hydraulic performance assessment we demonstrate that we attain a computationally efficient and high fidelity wastewater sewer network with adequate hydraulic performance a spatial resolution of 250 m block size in combination with a sequential pipe by pipe pbp design algorithm provides a sound trade off between computational time and fidelity of relevant structural and hydraulic properties for exploratory modelling we can generate a simplified sewer network both topology and hydraulic design in 18 s using pbp versus 36 min using a highly detailed model or 1 s using a highly abstract model moreover this simplification can cut up to 1 10th to 1 50th the computational time for the hydraulic simulations depending on the routing method implemented we anticipate our model to be a starting point for sophisticated exploratory modelling into possible infrastructure adaptation measures of topological and loading changes of sewer systems for long term planning graphical abstract image graphical

emerge i generation of new or novel infrastructures within existing systems e g because existing infrastructures require renewal or due to urban growth ii appropriate representation of the spatial characteristics of infrastructure and of its underlying catchment and iii integration of deep or scenario uncertainty into the planning process several algorithms to generate water infrastructure have been developed and used to model and evaluate different system alternatives sitzenfrei et al 2010a present the virtual infrastructure benchmarking vibe model to generate ensembles of virtual case studies of entire urban water systems e g water supply drainage and sewer systems urich et al 2010 that resemble real systems for testing new measures and generalising theories spatial layouts of water infrastructure networks in this framework are generated through graph theoretical algorithms sitzenfrei et al 2010b duque et al 2020 or agent based models in which possible optimal sewer placement is identified urich et al 2010 graph theory ahuja et al 1993 is commonly used to represent water networks for example when solving optimization problems for design operation or maintenance using heuristics sitzenfrei et al 2010b urich et al 2010 haghighi and bakhshipour 2015 bakhshipour et al 2017 moeini and afshar 2017 or exact algorithms newman et al 2014 duque et al 2016 navin et al 2019 duque et al 2020 bakhshipour et al 2019 generate multiple infrastructure layouts and explore different degrees of centralization in both green fields and existing urban areas others considered the impact of the urban characteristics on water infrastructure kaufmann alves 2013 baron et al 2016 bach et al 2018 most of these aim to obtain a detailed representation of the sewer network and are therefore often computationally expensive depending on the size of the network i e number of pipes water infrastructures are closely tied to the urban form and therefore strongly conditioned by spatial characteristics for example location shape and dimensions of sewer infrastructures depend on the density and spatial distribution of water users but also influenced by terrain and street layout geographic information systems gis have been used to represent these spatial parameters to assess and improve the management and planning of urban drainage networks bach et al 2020 and localise different elements of the system leitão et al 2005 bach et al 2013 mair et al 2017 abbas et al 2019 a relevant open question in this regard is the required degree of spatial abstraction or resolution for different planning purposes especially in light of considerable uncertainties of future developments lempert et al 2003 coined the term deep uncertainty to describe situations where we know absolutely nothing about probability distributions and little more about the possible outcomes as is the case concerning future water use population growth and urbanisation maier et al 2014 one way to consider such uncertainties is to explore the consequences of system alternatives under different scenarios in a long term planning process such an approach has been applied to explore potential urban drainage transition pathways urich et al 2013 baron et al 2015 rauch et al 2017 for layout and size optimisation of sewer networks duque et al 2016 bakhshipour et al 2019 moeini and afshar 2019 turan

2010 quantification of decentralised water management opportunities bach et al 2013 risk and vulnerability assessment sitzenfrei et al 2011 meijer et al 2018 among others dance4water dynamic adaptation for enabling city evolution for water is an example of an integrated planning support model that simulates the development of water infrastructure over long time periods considering urban and societal dynamics rauch et al 2017 the model uses multi criteria assessment to evaluate numerous stormwater management options at various spatial scales urich et al 2013 given its size and scale dance4water requires significant data input to its sub models baron et al 2017 also present a highly detailed model sinoptikom to model transitions of combined sewer networks towards source separated wastewater systems with decentralised treatment over a 50 year period integer linear programming is used to optimize the transition strategy using an objective function with eight objectives this approach was applied to several small rural villages in germany with 500 800 inhabitants approximately 4 km network length sinoptikom is computationally hard to scale and details on the modelling approach and its implementation are not publicly accessible baron et al 2016 from a long term city scale planning perspective the above mentioned approaches suffer from high complexity a zeal for close representation of the real system next to the integrated modelling of physical processes seem to have led to detailed spatial models that require vast amounts of data and computational resources even for small water infrastructure systems we need models that allow us to analyse large numbers of sewer infrastructure alternatives and future scenarios for robust decision making and options exploration at larger spatial scales than what is currently available davis et al 2007 therefore the generation of sewer networks with different levels of spatial abstraction is necessary to i create appropriate sewer models for the modelling task e g more detailed hydraulic performance evaluation vs city scale urban drainage planning and ii allow the comparison of multiple alternatives while maintaining the integrity of information about the urban characteristics and associated water infrastructure bach et al 2020 this paper presents a sewer infrastructure generator for exploratory modelling in wastewater system planning focussed on sanitary sewers i e disregarding stormwater the automatic generation of representative sewer networks is essential to test the impact of changes in the urban form we developed a spatially explicit algorithm for creating approximate sewer network topologies that realistically represent main properties of a real system based on topographic demographic and urban characteristics to explore different degrees of realism levels of abstraction and computational efficiency two different methodologies for generating virtual wastewater sewer networks are tested and compared to the existing infrastructure a third highly abstract non spatial algorithm is used to compare the physical network characteristics and the computational effort required to generate such an abstract network these three approaches are contrasted to better understand the trade offs of different simplified representations in comparison to models using topology and dimensions of real sewer infrastructure we also evaluate the hydraulic performance of the most promising network generation approach against the expected performance of the real system 2 methodology following good modelling practice we first define the specific purpose and context before determining model structure and parameters and ultimately evaluating how well a model fulfils its purpose jakeman et al 2006 schmolke et al 2010 our aspiration is a sewer network generator for exploratory analysis of topological and loading changes of sewer systems for long term planning i e 10 years horizon at city scale typically several hundreds to thousands of km of pipes ideally we would like to use it interactively with stakeholders where only the most relevant out of thousands of candidate solutions would be selected and evaluated this would require the generation of hydraulically feasible designs and the computation of key hydraulic performance indicators for each relevant solution with high computational efficiency the sewer topology should fulfil requirements of pertinent planning dimensioning norms and be able to approximate the real system at district level while reflecting common constraints imposed by spatial characteristics such as topography the location of major roads surface water bodies or parklands furthermore the pipe diameter distributions should not diverge substantially from that of a real infrastructure system to estimate aggregate infrastructure cost and construction efforts key hydraulic performance characteristics under typical flow as well as high and low flow conditions should be reflected appropriately in summary we aim to develop a sewer network generator that is significantly faster while still respecting the spatial characteristics but also coarser than the existing approaches reviewed in the introduction fig 1 presents our proposed approach to achieve this we use basic spatial information from population land use and topography to create a spatial abstraction of the urban characteristics using the planning support model urbanbeats bach et al 2018 urban characteristics are abstracted into a squared grid of blocks as defined in section 2 1 in order to determine the need for wastewater management depending on the land use area this information is then used by the sewer infrastructure generator to produce a network topology these network designs are compared against a fully abstract spatially not explicit approach know as urban water infrastructure model uwim maurer et al 2013 and the real network since we want to sufficiently represent the characteristics of the real network we compared the physical characteristics concerning topology network connectivity and pipe diameter frequency distributions of the real system and the generated system at three spatial resolutions finally a basic hydraulic performance assessment was done for the algorithms that fulfilled abovementioned requirements for our envisaged modelling purpose 2 1 input data and abstraction of urban characteristics to generate a sewer network we require information on the a elevation b land use and c population which defines the urban environment to calculate wastewater volumes based on local planning regulations e g average housing occupancy water demands to support this process we use the urbanbeats planning support model as a starting point urbanbeats is a spatial model designed for planning decentralised stormwater management solutions in urban catchments bach et al 2018 bach et al 2020 it processes gis inputs of land use population and elevation among other data sets to produce a gridded map of cells known as blocks each block is a grid cell containing a geodatabase of urban characteristics for its corresponding geographic location and represents an abstraction of the urban environment this block can have a flexible size that is dependent on modelling aims and the model is capable of simulating differently sizes of urban areas it has been tested for areas ranging between 5 km2 up to 1200 km2 we selected urbanbeats as a suitable starting point for aggregating all relevant spatial information to undertake our sewer network generation the model considers the variability in land uses in a spatially explicit manner at a reasonably fine spatial scale additionally the spatial resolution in urbanbeats allows us to design an abstract network that can encompass a broad range of pipe diameters and spatial scales to set up our input layer for sewer network generation we follow the following steps 1 delineation of blocks 2 abstraction of the urban form and 3 spatial mapping of wastewater generation 2 1 1 delineation of blocks urbanbeats processes three essential spatial input maps of a elevation using a water centric classification from bach et al 2015 b land use and c population see fig 2 a c a grid of blocks containing the essential information to define the water infrastructure networks and technologies as well as their interconnectivity amongst the adjacent blocks is delineated for the spatial extents of these maps as described by bach et al 2018 blocks represent the smallest spatially explicit unit within the model in which input data is aggregated block size is user defined and will have an influence on the level of abstraction of urban characteristics in this study we use a 250 by 250 m square block size for the abstraction since we want to generate not only the trunk mains of the sewer network but also the collection sewers this size will provide us with an extensive sewer network without excessively aggregating the spatial data however we also test the sensitivity of our algorithm to larger square blocks with 500 m and 1000 m sides to better understand the impact of resolution 2 1 2 abstraction of the urban form and mapping of wastewater generation the available higher resolution input data is aggregated to the block level note that each block retains information about the mix of land uses while total population and average elevation are determined by overlaying the grid onto the input rasters urbanbeats then uses standard parameters e g from statutory planning guidelines and other relevant urban planning documents to create an abstraction of the urban form based on the aggregated input data this involves a procedural algorithm that systematically identifies characteristics for each land use such as the size and geometric form of residential allotments impervious fractions breakdown of land covers in industrial and commercial zones among others employment is determined from population data and non residential land uses for a full description we refer the reader to bach et al 2018 fig 2 d f illustrate the model outputs for 250 m blocks for various characteristics to determine the wastewater volumes generated an end use analysis considering the frequency and duration of different household water demands e g shower toilet kitchen laundry and multiplying these with flow rates for the various indoor household appliances is used for this study we applied water efficiency ratings from the australian standards as6400 2016 standards australia 2016 non residential wastewater volumes are determined based on unit flow rates per capita or floor space the process is calculated on a block by block basis other than irrigation all end uses are assumed to discharge into the sewer system output values are annual volumes but can be downscaled using appropriate diurnal and seasonal patterns or modified to reflect peak discharge for the following hydraulic design 2 2 sewer topology and hydraulic design sewer network topology delineation is intended to follow basic urban characteristics it should generate a network from scratch in new urban developments or represent an existing network when the cadastre is not available other methods for simplification e g skeletonization of an existing network could be used if all the data were known grayman and rhee 2000 cantone et al 2008 in this study we focus on the methodology for topology delineation based on the abstraction of the urban characteristics into a blocks map the blocks map is used by the infrastructure generator assuming that sewer connections are required in areas where people live or work the spatial distribution of population and employment defines areas needing wastewater management thereafter two key procedures are run 1 generation of sewer network topology section 2 2 1 followed by 2 hydraulic design of sewer pipes section 2 2 2 2 2 1 generation of sewer network topology based on the abstracted data of the city the sewer network topology is generated through the following steps 1 identify existing wastewater treatment plants main roads and water bodies 2 correct terrain depressions found after the abstraction of the topography 3 delineate sewer topology based on gravity driven flow paths influenced by the infrastructure identified in step 1 and 4 generate the trunk sewers to connect all local outlets to start we define a final outfall at the spatial system boundary typically representing a wastewater treatment plant or a trunk main leading thereto and use spatial features such as main roads and rivers to guide the sewer delineation the modeller can determine whether or not to use certain types of streets as an attractor for the sewer delineation since blocks are the lowest abstraction level the nodes of the flow paths are defined by each block s centroid with an elevation equal to the average elevation of the block pipes within the blocks are not considered topology delineation takes place over the entire area that requires wastewater management flow paths are delineated using the d8 algorithm o callaghan and mark 1984 assuming gravity driven flow following the steepest slope this algorithm determines the largest elevation drop among each block s eight neighbours and saves that neighbour as its downstream block the topography of the study area is pre processed to avoid the presence of internal depressions and flat areas by using a carving method sedgewick 1988 which is explained in more detail in appendix a1 1 local depressions that cannot be overcome with the pit removal method normally correspond to the lowest blocks either at the edge of the case study or natural depressions e g rivers or lakes these blocks are then the outlets of the generated sewer sub catchment to ensure that all these catchments drain to a defined wastewater treatment facility we subsequently generate the trunk sewers this is done by connecting the catchment sinks using a minimum spanning tree ahuja et al 1993 algorithm to get the minimum pipe length of such a trunk system the minimum spanning tree to delineate the trunk sewers considers the location of outlets of the different sub catchments and the wastewater treatment plant as well as the elevation of these points so far we allow for negative slopes i e against gravity which means that pumping is allowed we also allow crossings of water bodies considering that we do not necessarily want to have the trunk sewers being delineated along the rivers 2 2 2 hydraulic design of sewer pipes this part of the model builds on the generated sewer topology by assigning diameters and its upstream and downstream invert elevations to the pipes generated in the last section we apply and compare two distinct dimensioning algorithms to size the generated gravity sewer network a the sewer network design snd algorithm duque et al 2016 which gives a cost optimal hydraulic design after an exhaustive search over all the feasible design combinations and b pipe by pipe pbp method returning the first feasible hydraulic design obtained when designing one pipe at the time starting from the extremes of the network towards the outfall and choosing the minimum pipe diameter capable to transport the design flow these contrasting approaches were chosen to identify which general method is suitable to represent a realistic system vis à vis our modelling purpose the calculated average daily wastewater discharge at each block is used in eq 1 to estimate the maximum daily peak flow the model does not consider inflow from infiltration we consider residential industrial and commercial wastewater discharges per block assuming a separate foul sewer network the maximum daily peak flow is used as the design flow for the hydraulic design of the infrastructure 1 q max f max f ww q ww where qmax is the wastewater peak or design flow m3 s 1 qww is the average wastewater production m3 s 1 fmax the peak water use factor and fww the wastewater return factor representing the amount of used water that is discharged to the sewer we use a fmax value of 1 2 and a fww of 0 85 following butler and davies 2011 the design algorithms for pipe diameter and slope are parameterised to reflect local design regulations and customary hydraulic design constraints for both dimensioning algorithms the hydraulic constraints presented in table 1 are considered during the hydraulic design additional parameters and considerations for the hydraulic design under very steep or shallow terrain slopes using sewer drops or pumps respectively are presented in appendix a2 1 the pipe diameter is a discrete variable which is defined by the regulatory minimum diameter and the set of commercially available or used pipes we used the set of diameters d show in eq 2 2 d i n m 0 225 0 25 0 35 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 80 1 1 20 1 5 2 2 5 3 2 2 2 1 method 1 sewer network design snd in the first method we used the dimensioning algorithm of duque et al 2016 to solve the hydraulic design problem i e diameter slope combination for each pipe duque et al s 2016 framework finds the cost optimal design of a series of sewer pipes using dynamic programming the input data are network topology flow rates for each pipe a cost function in terms of the diameter and excavation depth roughness of the pipe material manning or strickler coefficients and hydraulic constraints that guarantee proper system operation see table 1 the hydraulic design problem is modelled as a shortest path problem cf bellman 1958 ahuja et al 1993 where the provided directed graph is reflecting the network topology and considers every feasible slope diameter combination for each pipe the slope is defined by discretized invert elevations of the couple of nodes at the extremes of each link while the diameter of the link is defined by its downstream node the shortest path algorithm identifies the cost optimal hydraulic design by selecting the least cost path each pipe has an estimated cost based on its diameter and required excavation volume the evaluation of every feasible design combination makes this algorithm computationally expensive however it is able to solve the problem in a polynomial time which makes it an np easy problem garey and johnson 1979 2 2 2 2 method 2 pipe by pipe design pbp the pipe by pipe design pbp algorithm designs one pipe at the time starting from upstream extremes of the network topology towards the outfall we calculate the minimum and maximum feasible slopes for the given diameter using manning s formula in eq 3 for the minimum and maximum velocity table 1 assuming a maximum filling ratio of the pipe 3 s v n 1 r 2 3 2 where s is the slope of the pipe v m s 1 is the flow velocity n s m 1 3 is the manning roughness coefficient and r m is the hydraulic radius we set initial values at the minimum slope for each pipe and select the first slope that fulfils the hydraulic constrains for the pipe including the minimum and maximum excavation limits of 1 2 m and 5 m respectively the real filling ratio for each diameter slope combination given the design flow is recalculated before the hydraulic constraints evaluation once a feasible discrete diameter is determined we continue downstream and design the next pipe when two or more pipes converge to one node the algorithm stops until all the upstream pipes have been designed this ensures connectivity between pipes each pipe starts at the deepest depth of the pipes arriving at its upstream node diameters increase as we proceed downstream implying that the minimum starting diameter for each pipe is that of its upstream neighbour once we reach the network outlet i e the sink a feasible hydraulic design is found this method thus only proposes a feasible hydraulic design that complies with constraints in table 1 without seeking an optimal design 2 3 model testing and application 2 3 1 model used for comparison urban water infrastructure model uwim the urban water infrastructure model uwim approach by maurer et al 2013 estimates the amount of sewer infrastructure needed in a given catchment uwim is not spatially explicit and therefore does not use an input topology of the network the core of uwim is an idealised catchment area model therefore representing the highest degree of abstraction among the presented dimensioning algorithms uwim dimensions the sewers based on the rational method and considering the average water consumption per capita per day and the total population in the catchment its output is the length of sewers required to drain the area and a size distribution of the pipe diameters uwim s input data comprises housing density total population amount of wastewater to drain and catchment area to calculate the total length and diameter distribution of sewer pipes it divides the total catchment area into a rectangular grid and uses three model parameters to characterise the catchment s geometric shape and urban form the parameter f 1 is the shape factor of the catchment area f 2 is the shape factor of housing plots and f 3 is the fraction of secondary lines above the main trunk they determine the height and width of the cells that subdivide the catchment the number and length of pipes is directly affected by the dimensions of the cells making the diameter distribution very sensitive to these parameters here f1 60 f2 60 f3 0 6 are chosen calibrated to the cells area to get a comparable sub catchment with regard to those obtained when using a 250 m block size to generate the topology this simple model can represent key parameters of real sewer systems realistically without any explicit spatial design we use this dimensioning algorithm as a benchmark for our abstraction process uwim is expected to be computationally efficient but also the coarsest and most abstract representation of the sewer system available 2 3 2 case study description we selected a region within inner metropolitan melbourne australia fig 2 as the case study for model testing the case study boundary encompasses two local councils city of melbourne city of port phillip and an area of 57 km2 this area has a population of approximately 148 633 people and predominantly residential land use 44 with mixed development densities ranging from medium 10 dwellings ha 1 to high density housing 30 dwellings ha 1 it is roughly characterised by hilly areas spanning from northeast to southeast a river system and a very flat area closer to the sea representing a wide variety of topographical characteristics for the network design algorithm furthermore the case study area is drained by a separate sewer system of which we are only considering the sanitary sewers input data was sourced from various open data repositories from the state of victoria 2009 and the australian bureau of statistics 2006 datavic 2020 we used a 1 m resolution dem state of victoria 2009 population density australian bureau of statistics 2006 and land use reclassified according to urbanbeats classification bach et al 2015 were converted to a 10m x 10m raster for urbanbeats input fig 2a c additionally to aid the delineation and network generation main roads and rivers were also obtained in esri shapefile format datavic 2020 to allow comparison with the real sewer infrastructure we obtained a sewer assets database from the water authority melbourne water the baseline used for the assessment was 2010 with land use data and population data from data sets around this time period the abstraction obtained from urbanbeats was created not only for 250 m block size but also for 500 m and 1 000 m to test the sensitivity of our sewer generation algorithm outputs for a 250 m block size are shown in fig 2 d f we can see from the employment map that the city s business activity is concentrated in the centre of the case study and north of the port in the west the darkest parts reflect the central business district and the st kilda region representing the highest office density in this case study another hotspot with high employee density is the port dominated by heavy industry and trade the population density follows the residential land use and shows a high concentration of residents along the coast to the south and across the hills areas without employment or population are either green spaces or undeveloped areas which do not need a wastewater management fig 2 f shows the wastewater discharge per block that is used as inflow for the wastewater sewer network it is calculated based on the water consumption per block considering the land use mix areas with higher discharge are those with high density residential commercial and industrial areas 2 3 3 validation and performance criteria we compare the physical characteristics and hydraulic performance from the generated networks obtained through the snd pbp and uwim algorithms against the real network since we sacrifice accuracy to reduce computational times we highlight the trade offs of more accurate physical characteristics against computational effort required to design a wastewater sewer network as outlined at the beginning of this section an acceptable generated sewer network would have total pipe lengths and dimensions in same order of magnitude and would suitably reproduce basic hydraulic performance as for the real network 2 3 3 1 representation of physical components versus computational effort a validation process was carried out to compare the generated systems with the existing sewer system for this we compare the fidelity of representing the real sewer network characteristics comparing the generated sewer network topology and pipe diameter distributions qualitatively as well as quantitatively using the kullback liebler kl divergence distance dkl for discrete probability distributions in eq 4 kullback 1959 4 d k l p q x x p x ln p x q x the kl divergence compares the probability of occurrence of each observation between two probability distributions there the results from both dimensioning algorithms are translated into frequency distributions of the pipe diameters to be compared where each diameter is considered an observation when calculating dkl p x and q x represent the two probability distributions of network pipe diameters x to compare an ideal kl divergence value is 0 i e both distributions are equal this measure is asymmetric which means it does not require or favour any specific probability distribution we also evaluate the computational effort required by the three different dimensioning approaches we compare for snd and pbp the impact of the spatial resolutions of the blocks during the topology delineation on the computational times likewise we compare the computational time used by uwim whose geometry parameters as specified in section 2 3 1 roughly reflect a 250 m resolution block 2 3 3 2 hydraulic performance both real and generated network topologies were designed using the same hydraulic parameters and conditions using the pbp algorithm and modelled in epa s storm water management model swmm rossman 2010 for a comparison of their basic hydraulic characteristics table 2 presents the hydraulic performance indicators used and the relevant flow conditions for their computation detailed water demand patterns and other modelling assumptions are presented in appendix a3 3 results 3 1 wastewater infrastructure generator there is a trade off between the spatial resolution determining the level of detail of generated sewer infrastructure and the computational effort required to generate and evaluate it larger block sizes give less detail for the abstraction of the urban characteristics and the delineation of the collection sewers between the blocks while reducing the number of pipes to represent the sewer infrastructure for the same urban area see appendix a1 2 table 3 compares the results of the generated sewer network topology delineation for the areas of inner melbourne to the real network topology the generated topology includes the collection and trunk sewers taking the wastewater to the discharge point in the west of the city there are similarities in the location of trunk sewers along the coastline in the south but also key differences in other areas of the city topological differences between the collection sewers of the real network and the generated one are clearly evident in fig 3 the generated network produces less but longer pipes since the pipes are generated from centroid to centroid of the blocks they can only be connected through their eight neighbours 3 2 hydraulic design pipe diameter frequency distributions for the real and generated network using the three design methodologies are shown in fig 4 this distribution gives a first good glance at the dimensions of the infrastructure using the different dimensioning algorithms it allows for a quick comparison of the proportion of the different pipe diameters in a sewer network based on the shape of distributions in addition considering the level of abstraction of uwim it is the most intuitive way to compare the three dimensioning algorithms snd pbp and uwim against the real network it shows that 80 of the real network is composed of the smallest diameter pipes and around 1 of diameters consist of trunk sewers with a pipe diameters greater than or equal to 1 m as apparent from fig 4 snd and pbp match the real network s diameter distribution closely but not uwim snd obtains a higher frequency of pipes with a diameter of 2 5 m in comparison to pbp while pbp has a higher frequency on the smallest diameter although uwim is similarly able to represent the proportion of smallest diameter sewers it appears to omit small to medium diameters and returns much larger portions of diameters between 0 8 m and 1 5 m 3 3 performance validation 3 3 1 representation of physical components versus computational effort table 4 shows how the three generated sewer networks differ in terms of fidelity of representing the physical components using the kl divergence measure and computational effort the computational effort cpu time required by snd is orders of magnitude higher than for the other two algorithms and also increases strongly with decreasing block size the urbanbeats spatial abstraction and topology delineation took about 17 s on a standard computer with intel core i7 8550u with 1 80ghz cpu 4 cores 16 gb memory ram as such it was not critical in the total computation time this time must be added to the time used by snd and pbp to dimension the pipes excluding topology delineation snd took around 2 181 s 36 min to solve a 763 pipe network design with 250 m block size while the pbp algorithm took less than 1 s uwim computational time accounts only for the dimensioning of pipes which took just 1 5 s and does not grow much with the size of the catchment area these stark differences are not apparent in the fidelity as reflected by kl divergence at 250 m spatial resolution both snd and pbp match the real network very closely kl divergence close to zero where snd s fidelity is only slightly better than that of pbp the coarser the resolution the faithless the fidelity higher the kl divergence uwim has an acceptable kl divergence of 0 32 considering its lack of a spatial representation 3 3 2 hydraulic performance and computational effort the hydraulic performance assessment was done for the hydraulic design of the generated and real topology using pbp algorithm only snd was omitted from this analysis as the network generation module required too much computational effort for it to be suitable for our purposes fig 5 shows that the hydrograph at the outfall node of the generated network reflects that of the real network closely during a 24 h simulation despite a small delay fig 6 compares the probability density distributions for the travel times from each upstream inspection shaft source to the outfall for both generated and real networks the average travel times have the same order of magnitude for the generated 3 900 s and real 2 900 s network topologies this corresponds to the average path length of 9 1 km and 8 1 km for the generated and real network topology respectively this 12 increase in the average path length for the generated network results in overall longer travel times table 5 presents a summary of the hydraulic performance for low typical and high flow conditions as expected there is neither flooding nor surcharge in the network under typical flow conditions with low flow conditions both generated and real networks present comparable sedimentation patterns in the smallest pipe diameters at the upstream parts of the network under typical flow the frictional losses and pumping required are underrepresented in the generated network throughout all simulations minor frictional losses were ignored these include entry or exit losses as well as losses at bends or intersections the reason for this is to avoid bias as the algorithm generating the network minimizes the number of pipes generating less intersections and bends likewise with high flow both generated and real networks present surcharge and flooding concentrated in the high inflow industrial area of the case study surcharges in the generated network however are twice as much table 6 presents the computational effort for 48 h hydraulic simulations in swmm the computational effort needed using the generated sewer network amount to less than 1 10th for kinematic wave calculations and 1 50th for dynamic wave calculations as compared to the real network 4 discussion the main aim is to identify a network generator that mimics the characteristics of real networks sufficiently well while significantly increasing the computational efficiency of network design and hydraulic performance evaluation one of the key challenges lies in demonstrating the fit for purpose of the network generators to support exploratory modelling of changing sewer systems in support of long term infrastructure planning we did this by comparing the generated network with the existing such a direct comparison faces two fundamental causes for deviation 1 the abstraction and idealisation of the network generator might produce fundamental topological or dimensioning differences because it ignores design relevant spatial details on the ground 2 there is no reason to believe that an existing network would have been the one and only best way to create a drainage system current systems represent one possible good enough solution for a functioning drainage system usually the product of an historically grown system we are interested to minimise the first cause of deviation however it is impossible to assign observed differences clearly to one or the other deviation type also the fidelity and acceptable computational time deemed necessary depend on what outcomes of interest one is interested to model at which spatial resolution with this difficulty in mind we assess the suitability of the presented sewer network generator this model is not only applicable for urban drainage planning and exploratory modelling but could also be used for other aims such us operation and maintenance modelling of the sewer systems for example it is possible to use this simplified sewer generator to analyse different sewer deterioration models implement different rehabilitation strategies change characteristics of the urban area and analyse the consequences on the sewer system among others however the nature of the model also has limitations in terms of the resolution that is required for the different modelling aims it is not meant to be use as a tool for a detailed design of a sewer system nor a detailed simulation of the operation of the network 4 1 wastewater infrastructure generation module network topology we found that a 250 m block size allows for simplification without losing important information of the land use classification and the average elevation per block the obtained topology delineation shows similarity between trunk sewers in the real and generated network as presented in fig 3 the generated topology reflects the two main trunk lines on the north and the south of the case study and the difference in their lengths is marginal 0 3 they differ in that the real trunk mains tend to follow roads and highways while the sewer generator prioritizes topography and follows the river the topology of the collection sewers shows more substantial differences the total pipe length of the generated network is 17 shorter compared to the real network fig 3 shows quite well that the real collection sewers tend to observe more closely the urban form e g road alignments and district shapes than optimising the slope to the surface elevation overall the sewer network coverage in the case study area is similar and follows the need for foul sewer networks mainly in residential industrial and commercial areas an exception is the area of the port on the west where the generated network has more sewer coverage this is an artefact of the simple rule of translating the employment per block into needs for wastewater handling the port area does not have their water consumption distributed equally over their entire land use as it is assumed by the model such special cases are quite easy to correct for in the model by creating a no sewer industrial area if needed there is also a very obvious difference in pipe length this can be attributed to the different definition of nodes in the model and in reality snd and pbp use the centroids of the blocks as nodes a pipe unit is usually defined between a pair of inspection shafts in the model this can be easily corrected by introducing a node rule that limits the maximum pipe length a more important issue with comparing real with generated networks is their different abstraction levels the generator is defining the block as a sub catchment therefore ignoring the pipes within a block and defining the centroid as a node it is not possible to achieve the same abstraction level with the real network as the real sub catchments are not aligning well with the square blocks used additionally the fairly large minimal diameter 0 225 m pipes used does not allow a simple cut off diameter to harmonise the representation of the two networks as a consequence we would expect the real network to be substantially larger than the more efficiently generated network nevertheless we can show that this generated network is capable of evacuating all the wastewater with a similar hydraulic behaviour 4 2 hydraulic design the diameter distribution represents two relevant factors a short hand reflection of the network level hydraulic characteristics and together with the length it is an important measure of replacement value e g maurer et al 2013 the results show that the two more detailed dimensioning algorithms snd and pbp have similar pipe diameter distributions to the real network the difference between snd and pbp are mainly visible on both ends of the diameter distribution snd estimates more pipes of large diameter 2 5 m and pbp calculated more pipes of small diameter 0 225 m this can be explained by the nature of each algorithm snd aims at optimizing construction costs of the system minimizing the amount of excavation by using larger diameters with lower slopes to comply with the hydraulic constraints duque et al 2020 on the other hand pbp designs one pipe at the time assigning the smallest feasible pipe diameter that would have the required capacity and looks for the first slope starting from the minimum at which the hydraulic constraints are fulfilled given the small fidelity difference compared to the real network as measured by kl divergence both snd and pbp are considered suitable for our purposes at 250 m block resolution at higher block resolutions the kl divergence increased substantially and all three algorithms performed similarly the high computational efforts table 4 and the poor scalability duque et al 2020 therewith the slow analysis of all possible hydraulic designs is a major drawback of snd pbp was several orders of magnitude faster than snd and was able to generate suitable network designs in less than a second and seems to scale well the overall conclusion is that the pbp design seems to be a good and robust approach to dimension the pipe network generated for a 250 m block resolution with a reasonable computational time this goodness was confirmed with the hydraulic performance validation snd can generate a more cost optimised network but requires substantially more computational effort additionally this optimisation is also not reflected in the real sewer network data at lower resolution the uwim approach performs comparably well and if the purpose were to only reflect the pipe diameter distributions under data poor conditions then uwim is a good choice 4 3 hydraulic performance validation the hydraulic performance evaluation was to see whether pbp algorithm would achieve sufficient fit for purpose hydraulic characteristics to make the real and generated networks comparable we re dimensioned the real network using pbp algorithm with low flow conditions both generated and real networks present similar sedimentation risk in the smallest pipe diameters at the upstream pipes of the network likewise with typical flow conditions the resulting flow hydrograph at the outfall of the simulated sewer catchment area closely resemble that of the simulated real sewer network this is however not the case for the other hydraulic performance criteria travel times are poorly represented by the generated network as on average they are 34 longer than for the real network this is can be explained by the 12 increase in the average path length from upstream extremes to the outfall in the generated network despite its total pipe length being 17 shorter we believe that this can be explained by the artefacts of the delineation of the trunk sewers the real trunk sewers do not follow an optimised least distance approach and consequently they are 18 longer and generate lengthier travel paths 12 towards the outfall from pipes on the east see fig 3 as a consequence of the lengthier travel paths we found that the network takes more time to drain than the real network under high flow conditions the portion of the network experiencing surcharge and the percentage of volume that is flooded at the peak hour is twice as much for the generated network as for the real one the surcharge is a consequence of the lengthier travel paths under high flow conditions where the water demand pattern has a peak factor of 3 0 note that the pipes are designed for the maximum daily peak flow under typical flow conditions where the peak factor reaches 1 2 we could identify that under the same flow conditions the differences in hydraulic performance among the real and generated networks come from the topology delineation rather than the pbp dimensioning algorithm the delineation of trunk sewers seems to have a higher impact than that of the collection sewers thus if one needs to represent abovementioned hydraulic characteristics e g outfall hydrograph travel times sedimentation surcharge flooding more closely the trunk sewer delineation should be improved to mimic the real layout and forego the length optimisation the pbp based sewer network generator does provide the necessary gains in computational speed requiring only about 11 16 s per run including network generation and hydraulic evaluation thus for applications where a consistent high level representation of main network and hydraulic characteristics is sufficient pbp is found to be the most suitable among the compared algorithms for achieve exploratory modelling of sanitary sewer networks at city scale 5 conclusions for exploratory modelling of changes in sewer topology at city scale the automatic generation of representative sewer networks is essential to test the impact of changes in the urban form relying on the real system has its own challenges typically asset databases are fraught with uncertainties where errors and missing information impede explicit modelling integrated models are often more detailed than necessary for strategic planning purposes and too computationally expensive for system level exploratory modelling we need models that allow us to analyse large numbers of sewer infrastructure alternatives and future scenarios for robust decision making and options exploration at larger spatial scales than what is currently available the presented sanitary sewer infrastructure generator allows for rapid creation of idealised yet sufficiently consistent realistic and reproducible representations of sanitary sewer systems compared to historically grown real sewer networks a spatial resolution of 250 m for network topology generation in combination with the pbp algorithm provides a sound trade off between computational time and fidelity of relevant structural and hydraulic properties for exploratory modelling there is a clear trade off between the spatial resolution determining the level of detail at which sewer infrastructure designs are generated and the computational effort required to do so the minimal uwim algorithm yields only a very rough estimation of the amount of infrastructure required but has a low data demand and is computationally efficient the snd algorithm is capable of creating cost optimised networks but has a substantial computational demand with np easy scalability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

16419,improving the chemical and biological quality of treated wastewater is particularly important in world regions under water stress in these regions reutilization of wastewater is seen as an alternative to reduce water demand particularly for agriculture irrigation in a reuse scenario the treated wastewater must have enough quality to avoid chemical and biological contamination of the receiving environment ozonation is among the technologies available to efficiently remove organic micropollutants and disinfect secondary effluents being implemented in full scale urban wastewater treatment plants worldwide however previous studies demonstrated that storage of ozone treated wastewater promoted the overgrowth of potentially harmful bacteria putting at risk its reutilization given for instance the possibility of contaminating the food chain therefore this study was designed to assess the potential beneficial role of inoculation of ozone treated wastewater with a diverse bacterial community during storage for the control of the overgrowth of potentially hazardous bacteria through bacterial competition to achieve this goal ozone treated wastewater tww was diluted with river water rw in the same proportion and the resulting bacterial community rw tww was compared to that of undiluted tww over 7 days storage as hypothesized in contrast to tww where dominance of beta and gammaproteobacteria namely pseudomonas spp and acinetobacter spp was observed upon storage for 7 days the bacterial communities of the diluted samples rw tww were diverse resembling those of rw moreover given the high abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in rw the concentration of these genes in rw tww did not differ from that of the non ozonated controls ww rw and rw ww over the storage period these results highlight the necessity of finding a suitable pristine diverse bacterial community to be used in the future to compete with bacteria surviving ozonation to prevent reactivation of undesirable bacteria during storage of treated wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozonation wastewater reuse antibiotic resistance genes competition microbiome 1 introduction conventional urban wastewater treatment plants uwwtps are known to contribute to the environmental contamination through the continuous discharge of recalcitrant organic micropollutants omps into the receiving waters rogowska et al 2020 indeed despite their notable capacity to reduce the readily metabolizable organic matter of sewage to values compatible with the legal recommended thresholds i e 5 day biochemical oxygen demand at 20 c without nitrification 25 mg l 1 o2 and chemical oxygen demand 125 mg l 1 o2 council directive 91 271 eec 1991 a wide variety of omps are still present in the secondary effluents of uwwtps mceachran et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2015 these compounds are present at very low concentrations up to µg l 1 and include both natural and xenobiotic compounds such as personal care products pharmaceuticals and pesticides directive 2013 ribeiro et al 2015 given their acute and or chronic toxicity the continuous discharge of uwwtps effluents into the receiving water bodies can pose a risk to wildlife agriculture goods and recreational and or drinking water eggen et al 2014 efforts have been made to upgrade the conventional uwwtps with a tertiary treatment to improve the quality of the final effluents united nations world water assessment programme 2017 foen 2015 and thus to avoid the dissemination of the omps in the environment ozonation is among the technologies available to efficiently remove omps from secondary effluents bourgin et al 2018 dogruel et al 2020 hollender et al 2009 iakovides et al 2019 moreira et al 2015 2016 rizzo et al 2019 zimmermann et al 2011 graça et al 2020a 2020b being implemented in full scale uwwtps in different world regions bourgin et al 2018 cui et al 2020 hollender et al 2009 kharel et al 2020 zimmermann et al 2011 the strong oxidation power of ozone not only breaks down chemical compounds but also attacks cellular components thus also being considered an effective disinfection agent cui et al 2020 iakovides et al 2019 hembach et al 2019 moreira et al 2016 rizzo et al 2019 sousa et al 2017 such feature is desirable since beside chemical micropollutants secondary effluents contain high abundance of potentially hazardous bacteria such as those resistant to antibiotics manaia et al 2016 vaz moreira et al 2014 hence the presence of these microorganisms in the uwwtps effluents contributes to increase antibiotic resistance dissemination alexander et al 2020 fouz et al 2020 improving the chemical and biological quality of the treated wastewater is particularly critical in world regions under water stress massive withdrawal and consumption coupled with unpredictable weather conditions such as flood and drought events has been leading to the deterioration of water availability quality and accessibility united nations world water assessment programme 2019 european commission 2020 in these regions reutilization of wastewater is seen as a way to reduce the water demand particularly for agriculture irrigation the activity sector with the highest consumption of freshwater wwap 2019 european commission 2020 in a wastewater reuse scenario uwwtps must assure that the quality of the treated wastewater does not potentiate the transmission of hazardous bacteria to humans and other animals through contamination of the receiving crops even if stored for periods varying between few hours to some days depending on the irrigation needs indeed a positive correlation between plant contamination and irrigation with wastewater has been described suggesting the potential of transmission to humans and other animals mainly if used in the irrigation of uncooked vegetables becerra castro et al 2015 several studies have been designed to evaluate the bacteriological quality of ozone treated stored wastewater becerra castro et al 2016 giannakis et al 2016 malvestiti and dantas 2018 moreira et al 2016 2018 2021 narcisoda rocha et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2014 and thus the feasibility of using this technology to meet the quality standards needed to reuse the treated wastewater in irrigation consistently these studies concluded that the microorganisms surviving ozonation including antibiotic resistant bacteria and their related genes regrow during the storage period sometimes reaching or even surpassing the values found in the untreated secondary effluent becerra castro et al 2016 giannakis et al 2016 malvestiti and dantas 2018 moreira et al 2016 2018 2021 narcisoda rocha et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2014 in addition ozonation promotes alteration of the microbial community leading to the predominance of proteobacteria namely the opportunistic pathogenic organisms pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp in ozone treated wastewater stored in the dark at room temperature alexander et al 2016 becerra castro et al 2016 jäger et al 2018 moreira et al 2018 2021 p aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp are capable of colonizing a wide diversity of environments from pristine freshwater to humans and other animals and have been described as potential vectors of antibiotic resistance alexander et al 2020 aloush et al 2006 antunes et al 2014 dijkshoorn et al 2007 narcisoda rocha et al 2013 muller et al 2018 harding et al 2018 hwang and yoon 2019 perez et al 2007 vaz moreira et al 2012 the success of these ubiquitous bacteria in the colonization of stored ozone treated water may be related to their wide array of mechanisms to cope with oligotrophic environments leclerc and moreau 2002 mahnert et al 2019 traits such as oxidative stress tolerance and membrane transport and secretion which allow cells to uptake nutrients in highly competitive nutrient poor environments as well as the capacity to express transport and metabolic systems for a wide diversity of alternative nutrients such as those eventually formed during ozonation of the wastewater egli 2010 dekic et al 2019 fiester and actis 2013 lesaulnier et al 2017 mahnert et al 2019 mena and gerba 2009 may allow these bacteria to out compete other less versatile microorganisms surviving the stress promoted by ozonation moreira et al 2021 high abundance of these opportunistic pathogenic bacteria in ozone treated stored wastewater represents a threat to the safe reuse of this water hence measures to avoid the overgrowth of potentially harmful bacteria namely p aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp in stored ozone treated wastewater are needed healthy natural microbial communities harbor a rich and diverse phylogenetic and functional assembly of microorganisms which interact through complex relationships competition predation parasitism mutualism commensalism van bruggen et al 2019 given these complex interactions these balanced communities show little disturbance and restore rapidly upon invasion or alteration of the environmental conditions van bruggen et al 2019 van elsas et al 2011 hence it is hypothesized that inoculation of a water sample holding a disturbed bacterial community with other environmental sample harbouring a balanced community would hamper the overgrowth of any particular type of microorganism nunes 2021 this study was designed to test this hypothesis i e to assess the potential beneficial role of a diverse bacterial community in the control of the overgrowth of potentially hazardous bacteria during storage of ozone treated wastewater through competition to achieve this goal the ozone treated wastewater was diluted with uwwtp receiving river water rw tww and the resulting bacterial community was analysed over 7 days of storage in contrast with previous studies storage was carried out under natural light and aeration since these conditions are described as facilitating recovery of cell injuries hijnen et al 2006 river water rw ozone treated wastewater tww non ozonated secondary wastewater ww and ww diluted in river water rw ww were used as controls 2 methods 2 1 utww and rw samples all experiments were performed using fresh samples collected in a conventional uwwtp located in northern portugal as previously described moreira et al 2021 grab wastewater samples herein named ww and for the sake of simplicity referred to untreated secondary wastewater because it was not ozonated were collected from the secondary clarifier in sterile glass bottles in three independent sampling occasions referred to as a b c accordingly on the same three independent sampling dates water samples of the receptor river herein named rw were collected upstream of the uwwtp effluent discharge site all samples were immediately transported into the laboratory and processed 2 2 ozonation set up the experimental set up and the operation conditions of the present study were those utilized in our previous work moreira et al 2021 briefly a flow through bubble column reactor 3 0 cm i d 70 cm height packed with glass rings 6 mm i d 6 mm height vwr germany to promote the contact between the gas phase and the ww was used to perform ozonation experiments in continuous mode i e both liquid inlet and outlet streams flow continuously a complete description of the reactor configuration and optimization is described elsewhere iakovides et al 2019 and the specific conditions selected in the present work i e an ozone dose of 10 mg o3 l 1 in the liquid phase corresponding to specific ozone doses varying between 0 5 and 1 go3 gdoc 1 and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 min are described in our previous work moreira et al 2021 these operating conditions were chosen based on the fact that similar conditions are frequently reported for the treatment of urban wastewater borowska et al 2016 bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2016 schollée et al 2018 in addition ozonation of secondary treated wastewater with these conditions previously reduced the abundance of both omps and total bacteria immediately after treatment but rendering a disturbed bacterial community upon storage of the ozone treated wastewater at room temperature in the dark moreira et al 2021 after ozonation the treated wastewater tww was bubbled with air under sterile conditions for 20 min to remove residual ozone as reported before moreira et al 2021 2 3 experimental design in order to assess the potential beneficial role of a diverse bacterial community in the control of the overgrowth of potentially hazardous bacteria during storage of ozone treated wastewater a tww sample was diluted with the uwwtp receiving river herein named rw tww fig 1 a and the bacterial community was analysed over 7 days of storage river water rw fig 1c ozone treated wastewater tww fig 1e non ozonated secondary treated wastewater alone ww fig 1d and

water plus 2 5 l of ozone treated or untreated i e non ozonated secondary wastewater rw tww and rw ww fig 1a b all the 5 erlenmeyer flasks sealed with cotton plugs to allow gas transference were kept for 7 days at room temperature and natural light and 500 rpm agitation samples of 1 1 l were collected and processed immediately after preparation of the experimental set up rw0 ww0 tww0 rw tww0 and

abundance of total heterotrophs was assessed by using the membrane filtration method one milliliter of serially 10 fold diluted sample or up to 100 ml of sample was filtered through cellulose nitrate membrane filters 0 22 μm porosity whatman uk in triplicate at 4 different sampling times 0 1 3 and 7 storage days for each flask assay afterwards the filtering membranes were incubated on plate count

the total bacterial abundance the inti1 gene encoding the class 1 integrons integrase is used as a marker for anthropogenic pollution because it is commonly linked to genes conferring resistance to antibiotics and it is found in pathogenic and commensal bacteria of humans and domestic animals gillings et al 2015 the mara operon confers multidrug resistance in enteric bacteria by modulating

bacterial community analysis the dna extracts from samples after 0 3 and 7 days storage from each flask assay were used for the 16s rrna gene sequence based bacterial community analysis except for tww0 and tww3 samples that could not be analysed due to insufficient dna concentration the dna was amplified for the hypervariable v3 v4 region with specific primers and further reamplified in a limited cycle pcr reaction to add sequencing adapters and dual indexes according with the methodology previously described moreira et al 2021 briefly first pcr reactions were performed for each sample

0 a 1 b 3 c and 7 d days of storage remarkably the microbial abundance of the analysed non ozonated urban secondary treated wastewater ww0 was similar to that of the receiving river water rw0 in both rw0 and ww0 total bacteria assessed by the quantification of the 16s rrna gene reached 108 gene copy number per 100 ml of sample whereas total cultivable heterotrophs reached 106 cfu 100 ml fig 2a green and brown bars respectively as expected ozonation reduced the microbial abundance of the secondary treated wastewater tww0 fig 2a light blue bars log reductions of approximately 6 and 4 units were registered for total heterotrophs and total bacteria respectively immediately after the treatment comparing brown and light blue bars in fig 2a consequently as expected the microbial abundance of the mixture of ozone treated wastewater with river water rw tww0 dark blue bars was 0 7 1 5 log lower than that observed in ww0 brown bars in fig 2a however in accordance with previous reports moreira et al 2021 storage of the tww also promoted regrowth in the present work increasing after 3 days fig 2d light blue bar with values of total bacteria and heterotrophs matching those registered for the ww0 samples after 7 days fig 2d light blue bars in contrast interestingly the abundance of total heterotrophs of rw tww samples after 7 days storage fig 2d dark blue bar was lower than that found in tww7 and ww0 3 2 structure and composition of the bacterial communities over 7 days storage surprisingly the structure and composition of the bacterial community of the ww0 samples were similar to those of the receptor river water rw0 figs 3 and s1 in ww0 proteobacteria candidatus parcubacteria od1 and bacteroidetes constituted the major phyla with relative abundances varying between 27 and 39 12 20 16 27 respectively figs 3 and s1 in rw0 the relative abundance of these phyla varied between 34 and 37 6 19 and 20 37 respectively figs 3 and s1 within these phyla betaproteobacteria candidatus paceibacter and sphingobacteriia were the major classes found in ww0 10 21 11 19 and 8 11 respectively whereas betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria candidatus paceibacter and flavobacteria were the major classes found in rw0 12 16 8 13 6 18 and 5 17 respectively fig 3 as expected these samples showed high diversity with numerous genera with relative abundance below 3 fig s1d exceptions were bacteroides spp which reached 4 in ww0 and rw0 and flavobacterium spp which reached 13 in rw0 figs 4 and s1 and are commonly found in wastewater and river water respectively ballesté and blanch 2010 hatayama et al 2016 the high relative abundance of arcobacter spp in ww0 and rw0 up to 7 and 6 respectively and acinetobacter spp up to 4 in rw0 figs 4 and s1 supports the conclusion that the sampled river was polluted since these organisms are commonly found in wastewater and polluted watercourses shrestha et al 2019 the low concentration of total dna in the tww0 samples hampered the analysis of the bacterial community structure immediately after ozonation however the dilution of tww0 with river water rendered a bacterial community similar to those of ww0 and rw0 with proteobacteria candidatus parcubacteria od1 and bacteroidetes constituting 36 40 8 18 and 21 30 of the total abundance in rw tww0 figs 3 and s1 within these phyla betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria candidatus paceibacter bacteroidia and flavobacteria 13 14 9 12 8 17 6 15 and 7 10 respectively were the major classes found in rw tww0 fig 3 in these samples beside arcobacter spp and bacteroides spp up to 5 and flavobacterium spp up to 8 also the abundance of acinetobacter spp reached 4 in two out of the three samples analysed figs 4 and s1 storage for 7 days under light and aerobic conditions promoted alterations in the rw tww bacterial community fig 3 as expected a clear decrease in the relative abundance of anaerobes belonging to classes bacteroidia and clostridia occurred fig 3 in addition also the organisms affiliated to candidatus saccharibacteria tm7 and epsilonproteobacteria decreased their abundance in rw tww samples in contrast the relative abundance of classes cytophagia sphingobacteriia planctomycetia alphaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobiae increased over the storage period of the rw tww samples similar variations in bacterial communities were observed in the controls over the storage period fig 3 a clear decrease in the relative abundance of bacteroidia candidatus saccharibacteria tm7 and epsilonproteobacteria and a clear increase in sphingobacteriia and alphaproteobacteria occurred in ww in rw a clear decrease in the relative abundance of bacteroidia flavobacteria clostridia candidatus saccharibacteria tm7 epsilon and gammaproteobacteria was observed whereas the relative abundance of actinobacteria cytophagia sphingobacteriia chlamydiae planctomycetia alphaproteobacteria verrucomicrobiae and opitutae increased over the storage period in rw ww bacteroidia candidatus saccharibacteria tm7 candidatus paceibacter epsilon and gammaproteobacteria were the classes with the most notorious decrease in the relative abundance whereas sphingobacteriia chlamydiae planctomycetia alphaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobiae were those with a clear increase over the 7 days in contrast storage of ozone treated wastewater for 7 days clearly promoted the predominance of proteobacteria as reported before becerra castro et al 2016 moreira et al 2018 2021 which constituted up to 99 9 of the total abundance in the tww7 samples fig 3 within this pylum gammaproteobacteria was the major class with abundances varying between 47 and 64 followed by betaproteobacteria 31 47 and alphaproteobacteria 0 1 6 in tww7 in these samples acinetobacter and pseudomonas were the major genera with relative abundance varying between 20 and 26 and 22 and 37 respectively figs 4 and s1 other abundant genera included cupriavidus acidovorax and mitsuaria which were found in all the three tww7 replicas at relative abundance varying between 5 and 12 whereas georgfuchsia 20 alkanindiges 9 and methylobacterium 5 were detected in high relative abundance in only one of the three tww7 replicas analysed fig 3 as previously observed the exact composition and abundance of the organisms surviving ozonation and storage differed according to the sampling ozonation treatment day which suggests some degree of stochasticity moreira et al 2021 nevertheless predominance of members of the genera pseudomonas acinetobacter cupriavidus acidovorax and methylobacterium in stored ozone treated wastewater was observed in both studies moreira et al 2021 because in our previous study storage of ozone treated wastewater was carried out in the dark whereas in the present study it was performed under light exposure and aeration we may conclude that storage conditions do not influence the establishment of an unbalanced bacterial community upon storage in contrast to tww7 the relative abundance of acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas spp in the rw tww7 samples did not exceed 1 and 3 respectively figs 4 s1 whereas flavobacterium sediminibacterium reyranella novosphingobium polynucleobacter and nitrosomonas commonly found in freshwater environments hahn et al 2010 kang et al 2013 pagnier et al 2011 garcia lopes et al 2019 constituted between 2 and 6 of the total abundance in these samples fig 4 the higher diversity and evenness of the rw tww7 bacterial communities when compared to those of tww7 were confirmed with the alpha and beta diversity indices fig 5 table 1 these results confirm that ozonation promotes disturbance of the wastewater bacterial community with selection of pseudomonas spp and acinetobacter spp that proliferate and dominate in stored ozone treated water as previously described becerra castro et al 2016 moreira et al 2018 2021 irrigation of edible plants namely those eaten raw with stored ozone treated wastewater is thus worrisome since these ubiquitous organisms are not only opportunist pathogens but also antibiotic resistance vectors leungtongkam et al 2018 hwang et al 2019 salgado camargo et al 2020 indeed the presence of acinetobacter harbouring carbapenem hydrolysing oxacillinases genes and multidrug resistant p aeruginosa in stored ozone treated wastewater was previously demonstrated moreira et al 2021 and carbapenem resistant acinetobacter are among the five groups of microorganisms considered public health threats that require urgent and aggressive action whereas multi drug resistant p aeruginosa are among the eleven microbial groups constituting public health threats requiring prompt and sustained action centers for disease control 2019 however this study demonstrates that the overgrowth of pseudomonas spp and acinetobacter spp is hampered when ozone treated wastewater is diluted and stored with water samples with a diverse bacterial community indeed possibly due to competition with the much more abundant river water bacteria the bacterial community of rw tww7 resembles the diverse microbiomes of rw ww and rw ww without significant predominance of any bacterial group figs 3 4 and s1 in contrast with tww7 samples which communities cluster together in the pcoa biplot fig 5 group iii the communities of rw tww7 cluster with those after 3 days storage rw tww3 and all the controls ww rw and rw ww after both storage sampling days fig 5 group ii the slight variation between the communities of stored samples fig 5 group ii from those at the beginning of the assay fig 5 group i might be explained by the environmental and biotic conditions imposed by the confinement of the samples in the flasks the so called microcosm effect lopes et al 2013 3 3 abundance of antibiotic resistance genes according to the resemblance of their bacterial communities comparable abundances of intl1 a proxy for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 mara an indicator of stress response in enterobacteriaceae castiglioni et al 2008 and the args analysed were detected in both ww0 and rw0 fig 6 a as expected intl1 and sul1 were the genes with the highest number of copies per volume of sample 107 108 gene copies per 100 ml in ww0 and rw0 indeed the integrase gene intl1 one of the core features of class i integrons allowing the capture of genes conferring resistance to heavy metals disinfectants and antibiotics is widespread in pathogenic commensal and environmental bacteria gillings et al 2015 zheng et al 2020 also the sul1 gene which encodes resistance to sulphonamides the oldest antibiotic class still in use in clinical and veterinary settings is widely distributed among bacteria nunes et al 2020 slight lower abundances of the plasmid gene qnrs encoding resistance to quinolones in a wide diversity of bacteria jacoby et al 2014 were found in both ww0 and rw0 samples approximately 106 gene copies per 100 ml similar or slightly lower abundances 105 106 gene copies per 100 ml were registered for bla tem which encodes extended spectrum beta lactamases capable of hydrolyzing many penicillins and early cephalosporins and is ubiquitous in enterobacteriaceae lachmayr et al 2009 as well as for bla oxa and bla imp which respectively encode oxacillinases and metallo beta lactamases acting upon carbapenems and are frequently found in p aeruginosa and a baumanni amin et al 2019 among the analysed args the plasmid gene bla ctx m which encodes an extended spectrum beta lactamase capable of hydrolyzing cephalosporins mainly in enterobacteriaceae cantón et al 2012 was the gene found at the lowest concentration approximately 104 gene copies per 100 ml in ww0 and rw0 also the prevalence of all genes analysed was similar in both rw0 and ww0 fig 6e this demonstrates the contamination of the river with anthropogenic activities as expected ozonation of wastewater significantly decreased the abundance of all the genes analysed in tww0 with log reductions varying between 4 2 intl1 and 3 2 bla tem fig 6a however the prevalence of all the genes quantified was similar in tww0 and ww0 except for bla imp and qnrs fig 6e given the high abundances of the analysed genes in river water rw0 the dilution of ozone treated water with river water rw0 tww0 did not bring significant decreases on their abundance or prevalence when compared to rw0 or even with ww0 except for the abundance of bla imp fig 6a e dark blue bars vs brown and green bars consequently the abundance and prevalence of the analysed genes in the rw tww samples did not differ from those of the controls ww rw and rw ww over the storage period fig 6 nevertheless storage significantly reduced the abundance of qnrs bla oxa bla tem bla ctx m and bla imp in ww and rw with log reductions varying between 3 6 and 1 3 fig 6a d in contrast in the tww samples the abundance of intl1 bla tem bla ctx m and sul1 increased over storage fig 6a d light blue bars indeed after 7 days storage sul1 re activated to levels similar to those found in ww0 as reported before sousa et al 2017 hembach et al 2019 iakovides et al 2019 moreover after 7 days storage the abundance of intl1 sul1 and bla tem was similar in both ww7 and tww7 fig 6d likewise after 7 days storage the prevalence of intl1 mara sul1 bla tem and bla ctx m was similar in ww7 and tww7 samples fig 6d in summary when comparing tww with rw tww0 samples dilution of ozone treated wastewater in river water did not improve the quality of the stored wastewater in terms of abundance and prevalence of args hence despite demonstrating that dilution of ozone treated wastewater with river water hampers the overgrowth of proteobacteria rendering a diverse bacterial community even after 7 days storage the results of this study point out the need for a careful selection of the microbial community to be used in the future as inoculum of tww such inoculum must harbor a wide diversity of pristine microorganisms to compete with the proteobacteria surviving ozonation in order to prevent reactivation of undesirable bacteria and args during storage of tww 4 conclusions the main conclusions of the present work are listed as follows storage of ozone treated wastewater under light and aerobic conditions promoted the overgrowth of beta and gammaproteobacteria namely pseudomonas spp and acinetobacter spp in contrast dilution of ozone treated wastewater in river water hampered the dominance of these organisms rendering a diverse bacterial community similar to that of river water even after 7 days storage ozonation reduced the abundance but not the prevalence of args in wastewater immediately after the treatment except for bla imp and qnrs however given the high abundance of args in river water the concentration of the analysed args was similar in stored ww rw and tww rw this study demonstrates that overgrowth and predominance of potentially hazardous bacteria namely pseudomonas spp and acinetobacter spp can be hampered in stored ozone treated wastewater when diluted in water harboring a diverse community however it also points out the need to carefully select the dilution medium since it must contain a pristine rich and diverse bacterial community capable of outcompeting potentially harmfull bacteria rendering a final stored ozone treated wastewater with not only a balanced community but also with low abundance and prevalence of args future studies are necessary to establish the minimal volume of dilution medium needed to guarantee an

16419,improving the chemical and biological quality of treated wastewater is particularly important in world regions under water stress in these regions reutilization of wastewater is seen as an alternative to reduce water demand particularly for agriculture irrigation in a reuse scenario the treated wastewater must have enough quality to avoid chemical and biological contamination of the receiving environment ozonation is among the technologies available to efficiently remove organic micropollutants and disinfect secondary effluents being implemented in full scale urban wastewater treatment plants worldwide however previous studies demonstrated that storage of ozone treated wastewater promoted the overgrowth of potentially harmful bacteria putting at risk its reutilization given for instance the possibility of contaminating the food chain therefore this study was designed to assess the potential beneficial role of inoculation of ozone treated wastewater with a diverse bacterial community during storage for the control of the overgrowth of potentially hazardous bacteria through bacterial competition to achieve this goal ozone treated wastewater tww was diluted with river water rw in the same proportion and the resulting bacterial community rw tww was compared to that of undiluted tww over 7 days storage as hypothesized in contrast to tww where dominance of beta and gammaproteobacteria namely pseudomonas spp and acinetobacter spp was observed upon storage for 7 days the bacterial communities of the diluted samples rw tww were diverse resembling those of rw moreover given the high abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in rw the concentration of these genes in rw tww did not differ from that of the non ozonated controls ww rw and rw ww over the storage period these results highlight the necessity of finding a suitable pristine diverse bacterial community to be used in the future to compete with bacteria surviving ozonation to prevent reactivation of undesirable bacteria during storage of treated wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozonation wastewater reuse antibiotic resistance genes competition microbiome 1 introduction conventional urban wastewater treatment plants uwwtps are known to contribute to the environmental contamination through the continuous discharge of recalcitrant organic micropollutants omps into the receiving waters rogowska et al 2020 indeed despite their notable capacity to reduce the readily metabolizable organic matter of sewage to values compatible with the legal recommended thresholds i e 5 day biochemical oxygen demand at 20 c without nitrification 25 mg l 1 o2 and chemical oxygen demand 125 mg l 1 o2 council directive 91 271 eec 1991 a wide variety of omps are still present in the secondary effluents of uwwtps mceachran et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2015 these compounds are present at very low concentrations up to µg l 1 and include both natural and xenobiotic compounds such as personal care products pharmaceuticals and pesticides directive 2013 ribeiro et al 2015 given their acute and or chronic toxicity the continuous discharge of uwwtps effluents into the receiving water bodies can pose a risk to wildlife agriculture goods and recreational and or drinking water eggen et al 2014 efforts have been made to upgrade the conventional uwwtps with a tertiary treatment to improve the quality of the final effluents united nations world water assessment programme 2017 foen 2015 and thus to avoid the dissemination of the omps in the environment ozonation is among the technologies available to efficiently remove omps from secondary effluents bourgin et al 2018 dogruel et al 2020 hollender et al 2009 iakovides et al 2019 moreira et al 2015 2016 rizzo et al 2019 zimmermann et al 2011 graça et al 2020a 2020b being implemented in full scale uwwtps in different world regions bourgin et al 2018 cui et al 2020 hollender et al 2009 kharel et al 2020 zimmermann et al 2011 the strong oxidation power of ozone not only breaks down chemical compounds but also attacks cellular components thus also being considered an effective disinfection agent cui et al 2020 iakovides et al 2019 hembach et al 2019 moreira et al 2016 rizzo et al 2019 sousa et al 2017 such feature is desirable since beside chemical micropollutants secondary effluents contain high abundance of potentially hazardous bacteria such as those resistant to antibiotics manaia et al 2016 vaz moreira et al 2014 hence the presence of these microorganisms in the uwwtps effluents contributes to increase antibiotic resistance dissemination alexander et al 2020 fouz et al 2020 improving the chemical and biological quality of the treated wastewater is particularly critical in world regions under water stress massive withdrawal and consumption coupled with unpredictable weather conditions such as flood and drought events has been leading to the deterioration of water availability quality and accessibility united nations world water assessment programme 2019 european commission 2020 in these regions reutilization of wastewater is seen as a way to reduce the water demand particularly for agriculture irrigation the activity sector with the highest consumption of freshwater wwap 2019 european commission 2020 in a wastewater reuse scenario uwwtps must assure that the quality of the treated wastewater does not potentiate the transmission of hazardous bacteria to humans and other animals through contamination of the receiving crops even if stored for periods varying between few hours to some days depending on the irrigation needs indeed a positive correlation between plant contamination and irrigation with wastewater has been described suggesting the potential of transmission to humans and other animals mainly if used in the irrigation of uncooked vegetables becerra castro et al 2015 several studies have been designed to evaluate the bacteriological quality of ozone treated stored wastewater becerra castro et al 2016 giannakis et al 2016 malvestiti and dantas 2018 moreira et al 2016 2018 2021 narcisoda rocha et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2014 and thus the feasibility of using this technology to meet the quality standards needed to reuse the treated wastewater in irrigation consistently these studies concluded that the microorganisms surviving ozonation including antibiotic resistant bacteria and their related genes regrow during the storage period sometimes reaching or even surpassing the values found in the untreated secondary effluent becerra castro et al 2016 giannakis et al 2016 malvestiti and dantas 2018 moreira et al 2016 2018 2021 narcisoda rocha et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2014 in addition ozonation promotes alteration of the microbial community leading to the predominance of proteobacteria namely the opportunistic pathogenic organisms pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp in ozone treated wastewater stored in the dark at room temperature alexander et al 2016 becerra castro et al 2016 jäger et al 2018 moreira et al 2018 2021 p aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp are capable of colonizing a wide diversity of environments from pristine freshwater to humans and other animals and have been described as potential vectors of antibiotic resistance alexander et al 2020 aloush et al 2006 antunes et al 2014 dijkshoorn et al 2007 narcisoda rocha et al 2013 muller et al 2018 harding et al 2018 hwang and yoon 2019 perez et al 2007 vaz moreira et al 2012 the success of these ubiquitous bacteria in the colonization of stored ozone treated water may be related to their wide array of mechanisms to cope with oligotrophic environments leclerc and moreau 2002 mahnert et al 2019 traits such as oxidative stress tolerance and membrane transport and secretion which allow cells to uptake nutrients in highly competitive nutrient poor environments as well as the capacity to express transport and metabolic systems for a wide diversity of alternative nutrients such as those eventually formed during ozonation of the wastewater egli 2010 dekic et al 2019 fiester and actis 2013 lesaulnier et al 2017 mahnert et al 2019 mena and gerba 2009 may allow these bacteria to out compete other less versatile microorganisms surviving the stress promoted by ozonation moreira et al 2021 high abundance of these opportunistic pathogenic bacteria in ozone treated stored wastewater represents a threat to the safe reuse of this water hence measures to avoid the overgrowth of potentially harmful bacteria namely p aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp in stored ozone treated wastewater are needed healthy natural microbial communities harbor a rich and diverse phylogenetic and functional assembly of microorganisms which interact through complex relationships competition predation parasitism mutualism commensalism van bruggen et al 2019 given these complex interactions these balanced communities show little disturbance and restore rapidly upon invasion or alteration of the environmental conditions van bruggen et al 2019 van elsas et al 2011 hence it is hypothesized that inoculation of a water sample holding a disturbed bacterial community with other environmental sample harbouring a balanced community would hamper the overgrowth of any particular type of microorganism nunes 2021 this study was designed to test this hypothesis i e to assess the potential beneficial role of a diverse bacterial community in the control of the overgrowth of potentially hazardous bacteria during storage of ozone treated wastewater through competition to achieve this goal the ozone treated wastewater was diluted with uwwtp receiving river water rw tww and the resulting bacterial community was analysed over 7 days of storage in contrast with previous studies storage was carried out under natural light and aeration since these conditions are described as facilitating recovery of cell injuries hijnen et al 2006 river water rw ozone treated wastewater tww non ozonated secondary wastewater ww and ww diluted in river water rw ww were used as controls 2 methods 2 1 utww and rw samples all experiments were performed using fresh samples collected in a conventional uwwtp located in northern portugal as previously described moreira et al 2021 grab wastewater samples herein named ww and for the sake of simplicity referred to untreated secondary wastewater because it was not ozonated were collected from the secondary clarifier in sterile glass bottles in three independent sampling occasions referred to as a b c accordingly on the same three independent sampling dates water samples of the receptor river herein named rw were collected upstream of the uwwtp effluent discharge site all samples were immediately transported into the laboratory and processed 2 2 ozonation set up the experimental set up and the operation conditions of the present study were those utilized in our previous work moreira et al 2021 briefly a flow through bubble column reactor 3 0 cm i d 70 cm height packed with glass rings 6 mm i d 6 mm height vwr germany to promote the contact between the gas phase and the ww was used to perform ozonation experiments in continuous mode i e both liquid inlet and outlet streams flow continuously a complete description of the reactor configuration and optimization is described elsewhere iakovides et al 2019 and the specific conditions selected in the present work i e an ozone dose of 10 mg o3 l 1 in the liquid phase corresponding to specific ozone doses varying between 0 5 and 1 go3 gdoc 1 and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 min are described in our previous work moreira et al 2021 these operating conditions were chosen based on the fact that similar conditions are frequently reported for the treatment of urban wastewater borowska et al 2016 bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2016 schollée et al 2018 in addition ozonation of secondary treated wastewater with these conditions previously reduced the abundance of both omps and total bacteria immediately after treatment but rendering a disturbed bacterial community upon storage of the ozone treated wastewater at room temperature in the dark moreira et al 2021 after ozonation the treated wastewater tww was bubbled with air under sterile conditions for 20 min to remove residual ozone as reported before moreira et al 2021 2 3 experimental design in order to assess the potential beneficial role of a diverse

water plus 2 5 l of ozone treated or untreated i e non ozonated secondary wastewater rw tww and rw ww fig 1a b all the 5 erlenmeyer flasks sealed with cotton plugs to allow gas transference were kept for 7 days at room temperature and natural light and 500 rpm agitation samples of 1 1 l were collected and processed immediately after preparation of the experimental set up rw0 ww0 tww0 rw tww0 and

abundance of total heterotrophs was assessed by using the membrane filtration method one milliliter of serially 10 fold diluted sample or up to 100 ml of sample was filtered through cellulose nitrate membrane filters 0 22 μm porosity whatman uk in triplicate at 4 different sampling times 0 1 3 and 7 storage days for each flask assay afterwards the filtering membranes were incubated on plate count agar pca merck at 30 c for 48 h to enumerate total heterotrophs the cultivable bacteria counts were expressed as the average of log colony forming units cfu per 100 ml average of the technical triplicates for each flask assay and average of the three independent flask assays 2 5 dna extraction volumes ranging from 100 to 1000 ml of each sample were filtered through polycarbonate membranes 0

of storage using the conditions listed in table s1 based on the methodology previously described narcisoda rocha et al 2018 the abundance of the housekeeping gene 16s rrna was quantified to evaluate the total bacterial abundance the inti1 gene encoding the class 1 integrons integrase is used as a marker for anthropogenic pollution because it is commonly linked to genes conferring resistance to antibiotics and it is found in pathogenic and commensal bacteria of humans and domestic animals gillings et al 2015 the mara operon confers multidrug resistance in enteric bacteria by modulating

bacterial community analysis the dna extracts from samples after 0 3 and 7 days storage from each flask assay were used for the 16s rrna gene sequence based bacterial community analysis except for tww0 and tww3 samples that could not be analysed due to insufficient dna concentration the dna was amplified for the hypervariable v3 v4 region with specific primers and further reamplified in a limited cycle pcr reaction to add sequencing adapters and dual indexes according with the methodology previously described moreira et al 2021 briefly first pcr reactions were performed for each sample

0 a 1 b 3 c and 7 d days of storage remarkably the microbial abundance of the analysed non ozonated urban secondary treated wastewater ww0 was similar to that of the receiving river water rw0 in both rw0 and ww0 total bacteria assessed by the quantification of the 16s rrna gene reached 108 gene copy number per 100 ml of sample whereas total cultivable heterotrophs reached 106 cfu 100 ml fig 2a green and brown bars respectively as expected ozonation reduced the microbial abundance of the secondary treated wastewater tww0 fig 2a light blue bars log reductions of approximately 6 and 4 units were registered for total heterotrophs and total bacteria respectively immediately after the treatment comparing brown and light blue bars in fig 2a consequently as expected the microbial abundance of the mixture of ozone treated wastewater with river water rw tww0 dark blue bars was 0 7 1 5 log lower than that observed in ww0 brown bars in fig 2a however in accordance with previous reports moreira et al 2021 storage of the tww also promoted regrowth in the present work increasing after 3 days fig 2d light blue bar with values of total bacteria and heterotrophs matching those registered for the ww0 samples after 7 days fig 2d light blue bars in contrast interestingly the abundance of total heterotrophs of rw tww samples after 7 days storage fig 2d dark blue bar was lower than that found in tww7 and ww0 3 2 structure and composition of the bacterial communities over 7 days storage surprisingly the structure and composition of the bacterial community of the ww0 samples were similar to those of the receptor river water rw0 figs 3 and s1 in ww0 proteobacteria candidatus parcubacteria od1 and bacteroidetes constituted the major phyla with relative abundances varying between 27 and 39 12 20 16 27 respectively figs 3 and s1 in rw0 the relative abundance of these phyla varied between 34 and 37 6 19 and 20 37 respectively figs 3 and s1 within these phyla betaproteobacteria candidatus paceibacter and sphingobacteriia were the major classes found in ww0 10 21 11 19 and 8 11 respectively whereas betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria candidatus paceibacter and flavobacteria were the major classes found in rw0 12 16 8 13 6 18 and 5 17 respectively fig 3 as expected these samples showed high diversity with numerous genera with relative abundance below 3 fig s1d exceptions were bacteroides spp which reached 4 in ww0 and rw0 and flavobacterium spp which reached 13 in rw0 figs 4 and s1 and are commonly found in wastewater and river water respectively ballesté and blanch 2010 hatayama et al 2016 the high relative abundance of arcobacter spp in ww0 and rw0 up to 7 and 6 respectively and acinetobacter spp up to 4 in rw0 figs 4 and s1 supports the conclusion that the sampled river was polluted since these organisms are commonly found in wastewater and polluted watercourses shrestha et al 2019 the low concentration of total dna in the tww0 samples hampered the analysis of the bacterial community structure immediately after ozonation however the dilution of tww0 with river water rendered a bacterial community similar to those of ww0 and rw0 with proteobacteria candidatus parcubacteria od1 and bacteroidetes constituting 36 40 8 18 and 21 30 of the total abundance in rw tww0 figs 3 and s1 within these phyla betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria candidatus paceibacter bacteroidia and flavobacteria 13 14 9 12 8 17 6 15 and 7 10 respectively were the major classes found in rw tww0 fig 3 in these samples beside arcobacter spp and bacteroides spp up to 5 and flavobacterium spp up to 8 also the abundance of acinetobacter spp reached 4 in two out of the three samples analysed figs 4 and s1 storage for 7 days under light and aerobic conditions promoted alterations in the rw tww bacterial community fig 3 as expected a clear decrease in the relative abundance of anaerobes belonging to classes bacteroidia and clostridia occurred fig 3 in addition also the organisms affiliated to candidatus saccharibacteria tm7 and epsilonproteobacteria decreased their abundance in rw tww samples in contrast the relative abundance of classes cytophagia sphingobacteriia planctomycetia alphaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobiae increased over the storage period of the rw tww samples similar variations in bacterial communities were observed in the controls over the storage period fig 3 a clear decrease in the relative abundance of bacteroidia candidatus saccharibacteria tm7 and epsilonproteobacteria and a clear increase in sphingobacteriia and alphaproteobacteria occurred in ww in rw a clear decrease in the relative abundance of bacteroidia flavobacteria clostridia candidatus saccharibacteria tm7 epsilon and gammaproteobacteria was observed whereas the relative abundance of actinobacteria cytophagia sphingobacteriia chlamydiae planctomycetia alphaproteobacteria verrucomicrobiae and opitutae increased over the storage period in rw ww bacteroidia candidatus saccharibacteria tm7 candidatus paceibacter epsilon and gammaproteobacteria were the classes with the most notorious decrease in the relative abundance whereas sphingobacteriia chlamydiae planctomycetia alphaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobiae were those with a clear increase over the 7 days in contrast storage of ozone treated wastewater for 7 days clearly promoted the predominance of proteobacteria as reported before becerra castro et al 2016 moreira et al 2018 2021 which constituted up to 99 9 of the total abundance in the tww7 samples fig 3 within this pylum gammaproteobacteria was the major class with abundances varying between 47 and 64 followed by betaproteobacteria 31 47 and alphaproteobacteria 0 1 6 in tww7 in these samples acinetobacter and pseudomonas were the major genera with relative abundance varying between 20 and 26 and 22 and 37 respectively figs 4 and s1 other abundant genera included cupriavidus acidovorax and mitsuaria which were found in all the three tww7 replicas at relative abundance varying between 5 and 12 whereas georgfuchsia 20 alkanindiges 9 and methylobacterium 5 were detected in high relative abundance in only one of the three tww7 replicas analysed fig 3 as previously observed the exact composition and abundance of the organisms surviving ozonation and storage differed according to the sampling ozonation treatment day which suggests some degree of stochasticity moreira et al 2021 nevertheless predominance of members of the genera pseudomonas acinetobacter cupriavidus acidovorax and methylobacterium in stored ozone treated wastewater was observed in both studies moreira et al 2021 because in our previous study storage of ozone treated wastewater was carried out in the dark whereas in the present study it was performed under light exposure and aeration we may conclude that storage conditions do not influence the establishment of an unbalanced bacterial community upon storage in contrast to tww7 the relative abundance of acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas spp in the rw tww7 samples did not exceed 1 and 3 respectively figs 4 s1 whereas flavobacterium sediminibacterium reyranella novosphingobium polynucleobacter and nitrosomonas commonly found in freshwater environments hahn et al 2010 kang et al 2013 pagnier et al 2011 garcia lopes et al 2019 constituted between 2 and 6 of the total abundance in these samples fig 4 the higher diversity and evenness of the rw tww7 bacterial communities when compared to those of tww7 were confirmed with the alpha and beta diversity indices fig 5 table 1 these results confirm that ozonation promotes disturbance of the wastewater bacterial community with selection of pseudomonas spp and acinetobacter spp that proliferate and dominate in stored ozone treated water as previously described becerra castro et al 2016 moreira et al 2018 2021 irrigation of edible plants namely those eaten raw with stored ozone treated wastewater is thus worrisome since these ubiquitous organisms are not only opportunist pathogens but also antibiotic resistance vectors leungtongkam et al 2018 hwang et al 2019 salgado camargo et al 2020 indeed the presence of acinetobacter harbouring carbapenem hydrolysing oxacillinases genes and multidrug resistant p aeruginosa in stored ozone treated wastewater was previously demonstrated moreira et al 2021 and carbapenem resistant acinetobacter are among the five groups of microorganisms considered public health threats that require urgent and aggressive action whereas multi drug resistant p aeruginosa are among the eleven microbial groups constituting public health threats requiring prompt and sustained action centers for disease control 2019 however this study demonstrates that the overgrowth of pseudomonas spp and acinetobacter spp is hampered when ozone treated wastewater is diluted and stored with water samples with a diverse bacterial community indeed possibly due to competition with the much more abundant river water bacteria the bacterial community of rw tww7 resembles the diverse microbiomes of rw ww and rw ww without significant predominance of any bacterial group figs 3 4 and s1 in contrast with tww7 samples which communities cluster together in the pcoa biplot fig 5 group iii the communities of rw tww7 cluster with those after 3 days storage rw tww3 and all the controls ww rw and rw ww after both storage sampling days fig 5 group ii the slight variation between the communities of stored samples fig 5 group ii from those at the beginning of the assay fig 5 group i might be explained by the environmental and biotic conditions imposed by the confinement of the samples in the flasks the so called microcosm effect lopes et al 2013 3 3 abundance of antibiotic resistance genes according to the resemblance of their bacterial communities comparable abundances of intl1 a proxy for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 mara an indicator of stress response in enterobacteriaceae castiglioni et al 2008 and the args analysed were detected in both ww0 and rw0 fig 6 a as expected intl1 and sul1 were the genes with the highest number of copies per volume of sample 107 108 gene copies per 100 ml in ww0 and rw0 indeed the integrase gene intl1 one of the core features of class i integrons allowing the capture of genes conferring resistance to heavy metals disinfectants and antibiotics is widespread in pathogenic commensal and environmental bacteria gillings et al 2015 zheng et al 2020 also the sul1 gene which encodes resistance to sulphonamides the oldest antibiotic class still in use in clinical and veterinary settings is widely distributed among bacteria nunes et al 2020 slight lower abundances of the plasmid gene qnrs encoding resistance to quinolones in a wide diversity of bacteria jacoby et al 2014 were found in both ww0 and rw0 samples approximately 106 gene copies per 100 ml similar or slightly lower abundances 105 106 gene copies per 100 ml were registered for bla tem which encodes extended spectrum beta lactamases capable of hydrolyzing many penicillins and early cephalosporins and is ubiquitous in enterobacteriaceae lachmayr et al 2009 as well as for bla oxa and bla imp which respectively encode oxacillinases and metallo beta lactamases acting upon carbapenems and are frequently found in p aeruginosa and a baumanni amin et al 2019 among the analysed args the plasmid gene bla ctx m which encodes an extended spectrum beta lactamase capable of hydrolyzing cephalosporins mainly in enterobacteriaceae cantón et al 2012 was the gene found at the lowest concentration approximately 104 gene copies per 100 ml in ww0 and rw0 also the prevalence of all genes analysed was similar in both rw0 and ww0 fig 6e this demonstrates the contamination of the river with anthropogenic activities as expected ozonation of wastewater significantly decreased the abundance of all the genes analysed in tww0 with log reductions varying between 4 2 intl1 and 3 2 bla tem fig 6a however the prevalence of all the genes quantified was similar in tww0 and ww0 except for bla imp and qnrs fig 6e given the high abundances of the analysed genes in river water rw0 the dilution of ozone treated water with river water rw0 tww0 did not bring significant decreases on their abundance or prevalence when compared to rw0 or even with ww0 except for the abundance of bla imp fig 6a e dark blue bars vs brown and green bars consequently the abundance and prevalence of the analysed genes in the rw tww samples did not differ from those of the controls ww rw and rw ww over the storage period fig 6 nevertheless storage significantly reduced the abundance of qnrs bla oxa bla tem bla ctx m and bla imp in ww and rw with log reductions varying between 3 6 and 1 3 fig 6a d in contrast in the tww samples the abundance of intl1 bla tem bla ctx m and sul1 increased over storage fig 6a d light blue bars indeed after 7 days storage sul1 re activated to levels similar to those found in ww0 as reported before sousa et al 2017 hembach et al 2019 iakovides et al 2019 moreover after 7 days storage the abundance of intl1 sul1 and bla tem was similar in both ww7 and tww7 fig 6d likewise after 7 days storage the prevalence of intl1 mara sul1 bla tem and bla ctx m was similar in ww7 and tww7 samples fig 6d in summary when comparing tww with rw tww0 samples dilution of ozone treated wastewater in river water did not improve the quality of the stored wastewater in terms of abundance and prevalence of args hence despite demonstrating that dilution of ozone treated wastewater with river water hampers the overgrowth of proteobacteria rendering a diverse bacterial community even after 7 days storage the results of this study point out the need for a careful selection of the microbial community to be used in the future as inoculum of tww such inoculum must harbor a wide diversity of pristine microorganisms to compete with the proteobacteria surviving ozonation in order to prevent reactivation of undesirable bacteria and args during storage of tww 4 conclusions the main conclusions of the present work are listed as follows storage of ozone treated wastewater under light and aerobic conditions promoted the overgrowth of beta and gammaproteobacteria namely pseudomonas spp and acinetobacter spp in contrast dilution of ozone treated wastewater in river water hampered the dominance of these organisms rendering a diverse bacterial community similar to that of river water even after 7 days storage ozonation reduced the abundance but not the prevalence of args in wastewater immediately after the treatment except for bla imp and qnrs however given the high abundance of args in river water the concentration of the analysed args was similar in stored ww rw and tww rw this study demonstrates that overgrowth and predominance of potentially hazardous bacteria namely pseudomonas spp and acinetobacter spp can be hampered in stored ozone treated wastewater when diluted in water harboring a diverse community however it also points out the need to carefully select the dilution medium since it must contain a pristine rich and diverse bacterial community capable of outcompeting potentially harmfull bacteria rendering a final stored ozone treated wastewater with not only a balanced community but also with low abundance and prevalence of args future studies are necessary to establish the minimal volume of dilution medium needed to guarantee an efficient transplant of the microbiome into the ozone treated wastewater funding this work was financially supported by project norte 01 0247 feder 033330 depcat and norte 01 0145 feder 000069 healthy
