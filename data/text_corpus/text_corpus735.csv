singh et al 2012 vörösmarty et al 2000 the methods used for monitoring surface waters and determining water dynamics include in situ measurements modelling and remote sensing baup et al 2014 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 hall et al 2011 harding and warnaars 2011 jørgensen et al 2005 saltankin 1992 weekley and li 2019 remote sensing methods have been developed for the monitoring of global water

methods than the bathymetry map were applied due to the reasons such as intensive labour high labour and equipment cost and time consuming reasons duan and bastiaanssen 2013 feng et al 2011 lu et al 2013 peng et al 2006 therefore bathymetry maps for a particular lake or reservoir are often absent or difficult to obtain duan and bastiaanssen 2013 gao 2015 has divided the volume estimation methods which use the water area and or water level information derived from satellite data into three categories i elevation volume curve h v or area volume curve a v method ii volume fluctuations by

constituted the steps of this study 1 1 test area the test area covers the arapapıştı canyon and kemer dam on akçay river which its feeding area is within the borders of bozdoğan aydın and kale denizli districts in turkey fig 1 the test area is located in aegean in turkey between latitudes 37 25 24 n and 37 34 46 n and longitudes 28 29 53 e and 28 42 04 e arapapıştı canyon which is formed by the erosion of geological units of the akçay river basin between kemer dam reservoir and i̇nceğiz lake named in this study in the akçay valley is 380 m high and 6 km long aydin municipality 2020 the total area of the canyon which narrows up to 12 m in some areas is 0 58 km2 kemer dam is an important tourism region due to the arapapıştı natural canyon valley it contains in addition to electricity generation while tourism activities boat trips can be carried out smoothly in the reservoir and canyon during periods of high occupancy rate the withdrawal of water in the canyon during periods of low occupancy rate makes it impossible to carry out tourism activities along with the wet dry season cycle water dynamics of the reservoir water level and volume in the reservoir area change seasonally by the reason of the human induced effects such as electricity generation and agricultural irrigation the intensive water use for agricultural irrigation and electricity production causes the water level in the dam and the reservoir volume to fall to the lowest levels the dam which was built in 1958 for irrigation flood control and energy production on the akçay river in bozdoğan aydın district is actively producing electrical energy dsi 1953 the maximum and minimum operating volumes of the dam which has a reservoir area of 12 1 km2 are 57 6 hm3 and 419 2 hm3 and the maximum and minimum

in situ water level and reservoir in situ volume relationship volume 1 46e 30 water level13 194 have an rmse of 5 75 hm3 the relationship between the in situ water level and the reservoir area is linear r2 0 99 rmse 1 m and the relation of the dam volume with the reservoir area is exponential r2 0 99 rmse 8 36 hm3 the equation from which the volume can be determined from the water covered area derived from the satellite image is volume hm3 4 5161 water covered area km2 233 58 fig 11 5 2 calculated volumes the monthly reservoir volume vai was calculated by the hypsometric relationship equation vahri pyramidal frustum model vapfi and tin based calculation vatini method fig 12 the calculated total volumes vtoti have been also validated against in situ gaging station data obtained from dsi the relationships in volumes between in situ and estimated from different methods were plotted on a scatter diagram fig 14 5 3 hypsometry relationship accuracy relative volume vahri and volume changes above the lowest water level were evaluated by the regression line constructed using the monthly water level hi and water body area ai value ranges the slope and intercept parameters have been obtained utilizing an ordinary least squares regression ols technique the slope of the regression line of the hypsometric relationship between h and a of the kemer dam reservoir is 4 3 a and the intercept value b is 235 6 the regression line produced for the kemer dam is for the heights of the water level between 245 57 m and 281 22 m the hypsometric relationship between h and a of the kemer dam reservoir has an rmse of 0 83 m with a high r2 0 99 and low regression residuals ranged between 0 m and 3 39 m mean 0 7 m median 0 27 m fig 13 in the relative volume of hypsometric relationship equation calculations area parameter and water level parameter equations were used separately to compare which equation is more accurate the total monthly reservoir volume vtoti calculated by area parameter and water level parameter equation ranges from 76 20 hm3 to 276 7 hm3 and ranges from 69 74 hm3 to 288 36 hm3 respectively the volume vahri above the lowest water level in the studied period calculated by area parameter and water level parameter equation varies between 29 85 hm3 and 230 34 hm3 and between 23 38 hm3 and 242 hm3 respectively according to the validation results the calculated volumes except the volume corresponding to the constant volume are highly correlated with in situ volumes the calculated value of the constant volume is far above its real value the hypsometric relationship method calculates the reference level volume constant volume with a fairly high error the error for area equation is 23 46 hm3 and for water level equation is 11 56 hm3 the deviation of calculated values from in situ values for the volumes calculated with the elevation and area equations varies between 0 65 and 8 14 hm3 and between 0 21 and 14 60 hm3 respectively volumes calculated by the area equation were determined more than the actual values for values below 265 hm3 and values above this value as lower using the area parameter equation relationship in volumes between the calculated total vtoti estimated from hypsometry relationship vahri vbi and in situ measurements have an r2 0 99 and an rmse of 9 42 hm3 including error for constant volume using the water level equation the rmse value decrease to 5 02 hm3 including error for constant volume when the errors in the constant volume are ignored the rmse values of elevation and area parameter equations have reduced to 4 4 hm3 and 8 hm3 respectively fig 14 volume variations derived from the water level equation have shown lower deviations from in situ data the highly correlated linear relationship between water level and area indicates that reservoir volume is continuously variable the accuracy of the volume estimated from the hypsometric regression line generated by the in situ measured water level information and the area information extracted from the satellite image is slightly high but the rmse level of the area parameter equation indicates that the reservoir s hypsometry line needs improvement for water levels varying between 245 57 and 281 22 m the reservoir volume can be estimated with high accuracy by the water level parameter equation using the slope and intercept parameters derived from the hypsometric relationship 5 4 pyramidal frustum model volume accuracy calculated volume changes δvapfi and the total volume vtoti by this method between the contour levels in the contour dataset ranges from 0 90 to 40 45 hm3 and 61 15 hm3 to 282 75 hm3 respectively the calculated total reservoir volumes by pyramidal frustum model were compared with the in situ volume information in fig 14 the calculated volumes are lower than the actual values the difference between the calculated total volume and the in situ volume is between 0 45 and 10 93 hm3 these error values correspond to 0 74 and 6 4 of the in situ values as the reservoir volume increases the amount of error in the calculated volume increases the periods in which the error in the calculated volume is high are also periods in which the water level is high october november and december are the months when errors in the calculated volumes are low the calculated volumes are compatible with the in situ volume data using the pyramidal frustum model relationship in volumes between the calculated total vtoti δvapfi vb and in situ measurements have an r2 0 99 the accuracy of the pyramidal frustum model volume calculation is high with an rmse of 6 19 hm3 fig 14 table 1 in the contour data set the height difference between the contours varies between 10 cm and 470 cm likewise the volume change δvapfi between successive levels in the contour data set ranges from 0 9 hm3 to 40 45 hm3 as the water level increase between the contour intervals also the volume between these intervals increases fig 15 the slope of the bottom topography of the dam varies at different levels the bottom topography of the dam is divided into 3 different segments according to the slope in the first segment between 245 57 and 261 75 m where the bottom topography slope is relatively low the relationship between the change in water level and the volume change is exponential due to the non linear bottom topography non linear hypsometry relationship and narrow valley width in other segments between 263 78 and 274 82 m and between 275 17 and 281 22 m where the bottom topography slope is high the relationship between the change in water level and the volume change is linear due to the linear bottom topography and the increase in the valley width compared to the first segment the size of the symbols in these diagrams shows periods in which the volume of the reservoir is relatively high 5 5 tin based volume estimation accuracy according to the tin based volume calculation the dam volume vatini above the lowest water level in the studied period varies between 14 6 hm3 and 234 07 hm3 and the total volume vtoti varies between 60 96 hm3 and 280 43 hm3 the calculated volumes of tin based estimation are lower than the real volume with volume differences ranging from 0 64 hm3 to 12 92 hm3 fig 14 this difference corresponds to a deviation from the real volume values between 0 and 7 62 the volumes calculated by the tin based method are consistent with the real volumes and r2 has a value of 0 99 fig 14 the accuracy of the tin based calculation has an rmse of 7 64 hm3 the margin of error is higher during periods of high dam volume low errors in calculated volumes are in october november and december 5 6 discussions the characteristics of satellite images and the chosen volume calculation method are the components that affect the performance in volume determination studies the fact that satellite images have sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to determine the sudden changes in time and the amount of these changes are crucial in the correct detection of the spatial change in the reservoir areas and the related volumetric change the accuracy of higher spatial resolution sensors spatial resolution 5 m in detecting water covered areas is high huang et al 2018 and accuracy increases with a spatial resolution of satellites in the determination of aquatic environments by remote sensing özelkan 2020 zhou 2017 therefore spatial resolution is an important factor to consider in the determination and monitoring of water resources by remote sensing techniques huang et al 2018 the lower temporal resolution of the higher spatial resolution of satellite complicates the dense temporal monitoring huang et al 2018 in contrast planetscope satellites generate daily data and have a higher spatial resolution making them advantageous in aquatic environment detection and monitoring cooley et al 2017 huang et al 2018 water dynamics are also important in determining the volume in addition to whether the changes in the water level cause spatial changes the issues such as the very steep less inclined and very sloping of the lakeshore topography are the issues that should be taken into consideration in such studies it is important that the spatial resolution of the satellite images is sufficient to reveal the change in dams with steep or low slope topography components such as hydrological budget precipitation and drought in the region cause a significant change in water level and volume as water dynamics affects the volume determination performance each of these components can be evaluated as a separate case study also the linearity of hypsometry affects the performance of the hypsometry relationship based volume estimation non linear hypsometry relationship between area and elevation results in low r2 in regression busker et al 2019 additionally winter ice snow coverage and cloud coverage are important factors for bad hypsometry regression relationship the high r2 value of linear ols regression analysis is caused by the linear hypsometry relationship in kemer dam and arapapıştı canyon according to the high r2 value of linear ols regression the reservoir volume of the test site is continuously variable another parameter that affects the performance in volume calculation is data sparseness the data sparseness of the area information obtained from satellite images due to different reasons in the time series and thus the gaps in the temporal data set cause variability in the volume estimation busker et al 2019 in this test site between the two successive contours the excessive increase in water level and the corresponding volume is caused by the temporal distance between the two levels is widened as some images in the winter period cannot be used for cloudiness or shadow reasons another possible reason is rising water levels with increased rainfall at the end of the drought period on the other hand the reason for the slight increase in the water level and the volume change in the contour data set is that the rising water level during the rainy period stays at the same level for a few months another parameter that affects the performance in the volume calculation is the measurement time difference of the volume determination parameters the temporal difference between the lake level measurements and the date of acquisition of the satellite image from which area information was obtained in lakes whose level varies very rapidly in a short period increases the uncertainty in the definition of the hypsometry relationship busker et al 2019 the mismatch of dates between satellite sensing and water level measurement data can lead to additional errors in later water volume estimates duan and bastiaanssen 2013 since the concurrent water level measurement data with the date of satellite image acquired is used in the definition of the kemer dam hypsometry relationship there is no uncertainty due to the date difference in the hypsometry curve obtained the use of the lake area data acquired from satellite images and their concurrent water level data are common in defining the a l relationship in volume calculation applications sima and tajrishy 2013 the accuracy of the estimated volumes produced by different methods from the data set was analyzed by rmse and standard error rate of the regression ser between the in situ volume and calculated volumes of different methods table 1 values close to the lowest volume 61 6 hm3 above the reference water level have been produced by tin based estimation and pyramidal frustum methods the hypsometry relationship method estimates the constant volume 46 36 hm3 quite differently from its real value 69 82 hm3 and 57 92 hm3 this method also calculates with a high bias the minimum total water volume 76 20 hm3 and 69 74 hm3 the maximum values calculated by these methods are also quite different from actual in situ values in contrast the minimum volumes produced by pyramidal frustum and tin based model are very close to the real values the maximum volume values produced by these methods are also closer to actual in situ values than the results produced by the hypsometry relationship hypsometry relationship and pyramidal frustum model have the lowest rmse values of 5 02 hm3 and 6 19 hm3 respectively if the constant volume in the dataset is ignored the rmse value for the water level equation of hypsometry relationship decreases to 4 42 hm3 pyramidal frustum and tin based models estimate the minimum volumes at around real values but the hypsometry relationship generally estimates volumes as higher than real values the biases between in situ volume values and the volume values estimated by the pyramidal frustum are lower than the other methods max 10 93 hm3 ser values of the pyramidal frustum model have the lowest value compared to other methods in fact the difference in the ser values of the methods tin based volume estimation pyramidal frustum water level equation of hypsometry relationship was realized in decimal part according to the clustering of time series data while the anomaly of the hypsometry relationship estimates is more similar to in situ values anomaly the anomaly of pyramidal frustum model estimates is similar to tin based model estimates anomaly fig 16 a similar study was made by sima and tajrishy 2013 in lake urmiye and the power model and the truncated pyramid model were compared power models have been more reliable approximation for the geometry of the lake urmia the bottom morphology of kemer dam and urmiye lake are quite different from each other while the bottom topography of urmia has a low slope the kemer dam has a v shaped and highly sloping bottom topography the slope of which can vary at different levels since a part of kemer lake is a canyon the bottom topography is steep at the edges although the level decreased in the canyon due to the steep topography there was no field change this partially reduced the success of hypsometry in the kemer dam compared to the pyramidal frustum method in both sides kemer and urmiye the power model hypsometry overestimates the volumes all methods used at this test site calculated the maximum dam volume lower than the true value the morphology of the lake effects the formation of slopes of the a l and v l curves sima and tajrishy 2013 circular bowl shaped wetlands and lakes are water reservoirs with suitable morphology where the v h power model performs well sima and tajrishy 2013 6 conclusions in hydrological studies in addition to monitoring the temporal variation of fluctuation in water dynamics satellite images provide important data in determining the amount of change in water dynamics water dynamic characteristic of the dam the linearity of hypsometry morphology of reservoir area measurement time difference of the volume determination parameters data sparseness the temporal and spatial resolution of satellite images geometric accuracy and the volume calculation method used affect the performance in the determination of volume change using satellite images the consistent relationship between in situ volumes and water volumes calculated by different methods show that planetscope satellite images provide applicable data for determining temporal fluctuations

which use the water area and or water level information derived from satellite data into three categories i elevation volume curve h v or area volume curve a v method ii volume fluctuations by

produced by integrating the in situ water level and the remotely sensed area was used with the remotely sensed area to calculate volume variations lu et al 2013 the integrating of water level and the area extracted from satellite data also was used in deriving the volume variations based on linear area elevation hypsometric relationship busker et al 2019 in recent years without the need for in

demonstrates the production of the underwater topography in the water reservoir areas and natural canyons of absent difficult to obtain the bottom topography by integrating the in situ water level and the area information gathered from high spatiotemporal resolution planetscope remote sensing in the gis environment with this integration it is aimed to determine the fluctuations in the dam volumes

constituted the steps of this study 1 1 test area the test area covers the arapapıştı canyon and kemer dam on akçay river which its feeding area is within the borders of bozdoğan aydın and kale denizli districts in turkey fig 1 the test area is located in aegean in turkey between latitudes 37 25 24 n and 37 34 46 n and longitudes 28 29 53 e and 28 42 04 e arapapıştı canyon which is formed by the erosion of geological units of the akçay river basin between kemer dam reservoir and i̇nceğiz lake named in this study in the akçay valley is 380 m high and 6 km long aydin municipality 2020 the total area of the canyon which narrows up to 12 m in some areas is 0 58 km2 kemer dam is an important tourism region due to the arapapıştı natural canyon valley it contains in addition to electricity generation while tourism activities boat trips can be carried out smoothly in the reservoir and canyon during periods of high occupancy rate the withdrawal of water in the canyon during periods of low occupancy rate makes it impossible to carry out tourism activities along with the wet dry season cycle water dynamics of the reservoir water level and volume in the reservoir area change seasonally by the reason of the human induced effects such as electricity generation and agricultural irrigation the intensive water use for agricultural irrigation and electricity production causes the water level in the dam and the reservoir volume to fall to the lowest levels the dam which was built in 1958 for irrigation flood control and energy production on the akçay river in bozdoğan aydın district is actively producing electrical energy dsi 1953 the maximum and minimum operating volumes of the dam which has a reservoir area of 12 1 km2 are 57 6 hm3 and 419 2 hm3 and the maximum and minimum

where the flow of akçay river is in the se nw direction yandere murtuma and sarhoş stream are among the main tributaries of the akçay river long term monthly flows on akçay before dam construction varied between 3 7 m3 and 71 m3 per second akçay river s long term average monthly flow according to akçay değirmen alanı gauging station which built at the point before the main tributaries of the

area is dated 16 08 2016 the years 2017 and 2018 which include the last 2 hydrological periods where satellite images can be obtained regularly have been selected as the time interval to monitor volume changes in the reservoir area to determine the volume changes that occur monthly in the reservoir area acquired satellite images were preferred at the beginning of each month in case the image of the first day of the month cannot be found due to problems such as cloudiness the next first images were used due to the cloudiness in the first periods of 2017 the 20 month data with the images of the period that started on 29 04 2017 and ended on 31 12 2018 were used to estimate volume fluctuations by different methods and compared with in situ data 2 2 in situ measurements for kemer dam

in situ or satellite derived radar and laser altimeter water level measurements and bathymetry maps busker et al 2019 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 the use of temporal satellite imagery in the production of bottom or underwater topography is widespread in the lake and dam reservoirs where the water level is variable and there is no bathymetry map bhagwat et al 2019 busker et al 2019 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 feng et al 2011 jeihouni et al 2017 lu et al 2013 use of satellite altimeter data is common in lakes or rivers where there is no in situ water level measurement station busker et al

total volume of each month vb is the constant volume below the lowest water level vai is the dynamic volume varying with water levels above constant volume similar assumptions were made within the scope of the study conducted by duan and bastiaanssen 2013 and wval and wvall definitions were used for water level above the lowest level and water volume above the lowest water level respectively 4 2 contouring a known way of representing terrain is a contour topographic map freeman and morse 1967 kweon and kanade 1994 lu et al 2013 it can be assumed that the boundaries of the water body of a

amin of the tin during the tin creation from polygon dataset the triangulated surface was converted to a raster by gradual changing of the feature edges delaunay conforming triangulation technique delaunay 1934 edelsbrunner and tan 1993 was used along the break lines of tin in order to densify each segment of the break lines to produce multiple triangle edges 4 4 tin based volume determination the tin based volume estimation for each month vatini was made using the tin of the kemer dam fig 5 above the lowest water level hmin and the overlapping water covered area wcai polygon corresponding month the polygon boundaries of water covered areas wcai of each month were intersected with the tin surface fig 6 fig 7 and the tin was cut by the overlapping water covered area polygon representing that month the dam volume for each month was calculated from the sum of the volumes of all triangles remaining under the intersection of the polygon of the respective month with the tin these volumes

4 6 contour based or pyramidal frustum model volume δvapfi calculation the pyramidal frustum model volume calculation abileah and vignudelli 2011 shjeflo 1968 taube 2000 has been widely used in volume estimation or monitoring volume change studies today it is common for this method to use by combining the water covered area information generated from satellite imagery with water level information obtained from different sources this method was used in the estimation of water storage changes by a combination of satellite altimetry and satellite imagery abileah and vignudelli 2011 baup et al 2014 crétaux et al 2016 sima and tajrishy 2013 zhang et al 2013 and the observation of fluctuation analysis of water levels and volumes of lakes with remotely sensed data only ma et al 2019 and monitoring the fluctuation of large water bodies liu and yue 2017 also singh et al 2015 used for delineating the volume through a combination of altimeter satellite imagery and bathymetry data contour based or pyramidal frustum model volume δvapfi calculation uses the contours derived by a combination of the in situ water level data and planetscope derived water covered areas in this study firstly the contours produced were arranged according to the water level information in this context the long term contour dataset containing water level elevation and related water covered area information corresponding to the acquisition day of the monthly time series of the planetscope was sorted in ascending order of elevation the volume of each water level δvi was calculated by the pyramidal frustum model using related information from contour dataset since the water level information in the contour dataset represents the level above the lowest water level the total volume vtoti was found by adding the constant volume vb below the lowest water level to the volume δvapfi obtained monthly contours representing two successive water levels are considered frustum in this method ma et al 2019 and the volume of frustum was calculated by this adapted equation from taube 2000 abileah and vignudelli 2011 sima and tajrishy 2013 ma et al 2019 5 δ v a p f i wlc i 1 wlc i 3 wca i 1 wca i wca i 1

vb is the constant volume below the lowest water level 5 results 5 1 in situ volume in situ water level and satellite derived water covered area relationship according to the in situ data the highest dam volume between the year of 2017 and 2019 is 379 65 hm3 and the lowest is 45 8 hm3 on the other hand the highest value of the water level in the dam is 289 2 m and the lowest value is 245 3 m within a hydrological year the occupancy rate of the dam reaches its peak in may in the last 3 years the water levels realized in may are 281 2 m 2017 278 81 m 2018 and 289 22 m 2019 the periods with the lowest occupancy rate in the dam were between september and october and the occupancy rate during this period of the last three years was 15 10 and 17 respectively the relationship between the water level and the water volume in the dam is exponential and the equation is 7 volume hm 3 3 e 29 water level m 12 659 the relationship between the in situ water level and in situ dam volume has an rmse of 5 hm3 the volume calculated from this relationship is highly compatible with the real volume and deviations in the estimated volume are ranged from 0 07 hm3 to 12 24 hm3 fig 8 during the monitoring period between 29 04 2017 and 31 12 2018 the measured water level and reservoir volume on the days of satellite acquisition ranges from 245 57 m to 281 22 m and from 46 36 hm3 to 291 35 hm3 respectively fig 9 the reservoir area or water covered area derived from satellite imagery ranges from 3 3 km2 to 10 35 km2 fig 10 according to the data only on the days of satellite acquisition the in situ water level and reservoir in situ volume relationship volume 1 46e 30 water level13 194 have an rmse of 5 75 hm3 the relationship between the in situ water level and the reservoir area is linear r2 0 99 rmse 1 m and the relation of the dam volume with the reservoir area is exponential r2 0 99 rmse 8 36 hm3 the equation from which the volume can be determined from the water covered area derived from the satellite image is volume hm3 4 5161 water covered area km2 233 58 fig 11 5 2 calculated volumes the monthly reservoir volume vai was calculated by the hypsometric relationship equation vahri pyramidal frustum model vapfi and tin based calculation vatini method fig 12 the calculated total volumes vtoti have been also validated against in situ gaging station data obtained from dsi the relationships in volumes between in situ and estimated from different methods were plotted on a scatter diagram fig 14 5 3 hypsometry relationship accuracy relative volume vahri and volume changes above the lowest water level were evaluated by the regression line constructed using the monthly water level hi and water body area ai value ranges the slope and intercept parameters have been obtained utilizing an ordinary least squares regression ols technique the slope of the regression line of the hypsometric relationship between h and a of the kemer dam reservoir is 4 3 a and the intercept value b is 235 6 the regression line produced for the kemer dam is for the heights of the water level between 245 57 m and 281 22 m the hypsometric relationship between h and a of the kemer dam reservoir has an rmse of 0 83 m with a high r2 0 99 and low regression residuals ranged between 0 m and 3 39 m mean 0 7 m median 0 27 m fig 13 in the relative volume of hypsometric relationship equation calculations area parameter and water level parameter equations were used separately to compare which equation is more accurate the total monthly reservoir volume vtoti calculated by area parameter and water level parameter equation ranges from 76 20 hm3 to 276 7 hm3 and ranges from 69 74 hm3 to 288 36 hm3 respectively the volume vahri above the lowest water level in the studied period calculated by area parameter and water level parameter equation varies between 29 85 hm3 and 230 34 hm3 and between 23 38 hm3 and 242 hm3 respectively according to the validation results the calculated volumes except the volume corresponding to the constant volume are highly correlated with in situ volumes the calculated value of the constant volume is far above its real value the hypsometric relationship method calculates the reference level volume constant volume with a fairly high error the error for area equation is 23 46 hm3 and for water level equation is 11 56 hm3 the deviation of calculated values from in situ values for the volumes calculated with the elevation and area equations varies between 0 65 and 8 14 hm3 and between 0 21 and 14 60 hm3 respectively volumes calculated by the area equation were determined more than the actual values for values below 265 hm3 and values above this value as lower using the area parameter equation relationship in volumes between the calculated total vtoti estimated from hypsometry relationship vahri vbi and in situ measurements have an r2 0 99 and an rmse of 9 42 hm3 including error for constant volume using the water level equation the rmse value decrease to 5 02 hm3 including error for constant volume when the errors in the constant volume are ignored the rmse values of elevation and area parameter equations have reduced to 4 4 hm3 and 8 hm3 respectively fig 14 volume variations derived from the water level equation have shown lower deviations from in situ data the highly correlated linear relationship between water level and area indicates that reservoir volume is continuously variable the accuracy of the volume estimated from the hypsometric regression line generated by the in situ measured water level information and the area information extracted from the satellite image is slightly high but the rmse level of the area parameter equation indicates that the reservoir s hypsometry line needs improvement for water levels varying between 245 57 and 281 22 m the reservoir volume can be estimated with high accuracy by the water level parameter equation using the slope and intercept parameters derived from the hypsometric relationship 5 4 pyramidal frustum model volume accuracy calculated volume changes δvapfi and the total volume vtoti by this method between the contour levels in the contour dataset ranges from 0 90 to 40 45 hm3 and 61 15 hm3 to 282 75 hm3 respectively the calculated total reservoir volumes by pyramidal frustum model were compared with the in situ volume information in fig 14 the calculated volumes are lower than the actual values the difference between the calculated total volume and the in situ volume is between 0 45 and 10 93 hm3 these error values correspond to 0 74 and 6 4 of the in situ values as the reservoir volume increases the amount of error in the calculated volume increases the periods in which the error in the calculated volume is high are also periods in which the water level is high october november and december are the months when errors in the calculated volumes are low the calculated volumes are compatible with the in situ volume data using the pyramidal frustum model relationship in volumes between the calculated total vtoti δvapfi vb and in situ measurements have an r2 0 99 the accuracy of the pyramidal frustum model volume calculation is high with an rmse of 6 19 hm3 fig 14 table 1 in the contour data set the height difference between the contours varies between 10 cm and 470 cm likewise the volume change δvapfi between successive levels in the contour data set ranges from 0 9 hm3 to 40 45 hm3 as the water level increase between the contour intervals also the volume between these intervals increases fig 15 the slope of the bottom topography of the dam varies at different levels the bottom topography of the dam is divided into 3 different segments according to the slope in the first segment between 245 57 and 261 75 m where the bottom topography slope is relatively low the relationship between the change in water level and the volume change is exponential due to the non linear bottom topography non linear hypsometry relationship and narrow valley width in other segments between 263 78 and 274 82 m and between 275 17 and 281 22 m where the bottom topography slope is high the relationship between the change in water level and the volume change is linear due to the linear bottom topography and the increase in the valley width compared to the first segment the size of the symbols in these diagrams shows periods in which the volume of the reservoir is relatively high 5 5 tin based volume estimation accuracy according to the tin based volume calculation the dam volume vatini above the lowest water level in the studied period varies between 14 6 hm3 and 234 07 hm3 and the total volume vtoti varies between 60 96 hm3 and 280 43 hm3 the calculated volumes of tin based estimation are lower than the real volume with volume differences ranging from 0 64 hm3 to 12 92 hm3 fig 14 this difference corresponds to a deviation from the real volume values between 0 and 7 62 the volumes calculated by the tin based method are consistent with the real volumes and r2 has a value of 0 99 fig 14 the accuracy of the tin based calculation has an rmse of 7 64 hm3 the margin of error is higher during periods of high dam volume low errors in calculated volumes are in october november and december 5 6 discussions the characteristics of satellite images and the chosen volume calculation method are the components that affect the performance in volume determination studies the fact that satellite images have sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to determine the sudden changes in time and the amount of these changes are crucial in the correct detection of the spatial change in the reservoir areas and the related volumetric change the accuracy of higher spatial resolution sensors spatial resolution 5 m in detecting water covered areas is high huang et al 2018 and accuracy increases with a spatial resolution of satellites in the determination of aquatic environments by remote sensing özelkan 2020 zhou 2017 therefore spatial resolution is an important factor to consider in the determination and monitoring of water resources by remote sensing techniques huang et al 2018 the lower temporal resolution of the higher spatial resolution of satellite complicates the dense temporal monitoring huang et al 2018 in contrast planetscope satellites generate daily data and have a higher spatial resolution making them advantageous in aquatic environment detection and monitoring cooley et al 2017 huang et al 2018 water dynamics are also important in determining the volume in addition to whether the changes in the water level cause spatial changes the issues such as the very steep less inclined and very sloping of the lakeshore topography are the issues that should be taken into consideration in such studies it is important that the spatial resolution of the satellite images is sufficient to reveal the change in dams with steep or low slope topography components such as hydrological budget precipitation and drought in the region cause a significant change in water level and volume as water dynamics affects the volume determination performance each of these components can be evaluated as a separate case study also the linearity of hypsometry affects the performance of the hypsometry relationship based volume estimation non linear hypsometry relationship between area and elevation results in low r2 in regression busker et al 2019 additionally winter ice snow coverage and cloud coverage are important factors for bad hypsometry regression relationship the high r2 value of linear ols regression analysis is caused by the linear hypsometry relationship in kemer dam and arapapıştı canyon according to the high r2 value of linear ols regression the reservoir volume of the test site is continuously variable another parameter that affects the performance in volume calculation is data sparseness the data sparseness of the area information obtained from satellite images due to different reasons in the time series and thus the gaps in the temporal data set cause variability in the volume estimation busker et al 2019 in this test site between the two successive contours the excessive increase in water level and the corresponding volume is caused by the temporal distance between the two levels is widened as some images in the winter period cannot be used for cloudiness or shadow reasons another possible reason is rising water levels with increased rainfall at the end of the drought period on the other hand the reason for the slight increase in the water level and the volume change in the contour data set is that the rising water level during the rainy period stays at the same level for a few months another parameter that affects the performance in the volume calculation is the measurement time difference of the volume determination parameters the temporal difference between the lake level measurements and the date of acquisition of the satellite image from which area information was obtained in lakes whose level varies very rapidly in a short period increases the uncertainty in the definition of the hypsometry relationship busker et al 2019 the mismatch of dates between satellite sensing and water level measurement data can lead to additional errors in later water volume estimates duan and bastiaanssen 2013 since the concurrent water level measurement data with the date of satellite image acquired is used in the definition of the kemer dam hypsometry relationship there is no uncertainty due to the date difference in the hypsometry curve obtained the use of the lake area data acquired from satellite images and their concurrent water level data are common in defining the a l relationship in volume calculation applications sima and tajrishy 2013 the accuracy of the estimated volumes produced by different methods from the data set was analyzed by rmse and standard error rate of the regression ser between the in situ volume and calculated volumes of different methods table 1 values close to the lowest volume 61 6 hm3 above the reference water level have been produced by tin based estimation and pyramidal frustum methods the hypsometry relationship method estimates the constant volume 46 36 hm3 quite differently from its real value 69 82 hm3 and 57 92 hm3 this method also calculates with a high bias the minimum total water volume 76 20 hm3 and 69 74 hm3 the maximum values calculated by these methods are also quite different from actual in situ values in contrast the minimum volumes produced by pyramidal frustum and tin based model are very close to the real values the maximum volume values produced by these methods are also closer to actual in situ values than the results produced by the hypsometry relationship hypsometry relationship and pyramidal frustum model have the lowest rmse values of 5 02 hm3 and 6 19 hm3 respectively if the constant volume in the dataset is ignored the rmse value for the water level equation of hypsometry relationship decreases to 4 42 hm3 pyramidal frustum and tin based models estimate the minimum volumes at around real values but the hypsometry relationship generally estimates volumes as higher than real values the biases between in situ volume values and the volume values estimated by the pyramidal frustum are lower than the other methods max 10 93 hm3 ser values of the pyramidal frustum model have the lowest value compared to other methods in fact the difference in the ser values of the methods tin based volume estimation pyramidal frustum water level equation of hypsometry relationship was realized in decimal part according to the clustering of time series data while the anomaly of the hypsometry relationship estimates is more similar to in situ values anomaly the anomaly of pyramidal frustum model estimates is similar to tin based model estimates anomaly fig 16 a similar study was made by sima and tajrishy 2013 in lake urmiye and the power model and the truncated pyramid model were compared power models have been more reliable approximation for the geometry of the lake urmia the bottom morphology of kemer dam and urmiye lake are quite different from each other while the bottom topography of urmia has a low slope the kemer dam has a v shaped and highly sloping bottom topography the slope of which can vary at different levels since a part of kemer lake is a canyon the bottom topography is steep at the edges although the level decreased in the canyon due to the steep topography there was no field change this partially reduced the success of hypsometry in the kemer dam compared to the pyramidal frustum method in both sides kemer and urmiye the power model hypsometry overestimates the volumes all methods used at this test site calculated the maximum dam volume lower than the true value the morphology of the lake effects the formation of slopes of the a l and v l curves sima and tajrishy 2013 circular bowl shaped wetlands and lakes are water reservoirs with suitable morphology where the v h power model performs well sima and tajrishy 2013 6 conclusions in hydrological studies in addition to monitoring the temporal variation of fluctuation in water dynamics satellite images provide important data in determining the amount of change in water dynamics water dynamic characteristic of the dam the linearity of hypsometry morphology of reservoir area measurement time difference of the volume determination parameters data sparseness the temporal and spatial resolution of satellite images geometric accuracy and the volume calculation method used affect the performance in the determination of volume change using satellite images the consistent relationship between in situ volumes and water volumes calculated by different methods show that planetscope satellite images provide applicable data for determining temporal fluctuations in the dam water volume and planning in the water management high spatiotemporal planetscope cubesat satellites of planetlabs produce daily images hence eliminates date dependence by giving an on date image on or near the measured day for hydrological applications its high spatial resolution can create a better estimation of area and volume compared to 30 m and 10 m resolution satellites its ability to produce a prediction range compatible with the real data range makes the pyramidal frustum method is advantageous for reservoir volume studies the geometry of the water reservoir affects the volume calculation accuracy of the hypsometry relationship model the pyramidal model is successful in revealing the slope related anomaly variation at different levels of the dam bottom topography

niazi et al 2017 non point pollution he and lu 2016 and flood events tularam and ilahee 2008 besides baseflow is influenced by catchment characteristics e g topography segura et al 2019 vegetation cheng et al 2017 climate yang et al 2017 and soil texture gnann et al 2021 in mountainous areas baseflow is affected by precipitation and the presence of quaternary deposits and porous volcanic glacial bedrock devito et al 2005 which affects the process of baseflow generation via surface water groundwater interactions price 2011 yet the effects of rainfall and geologic variability on the spatial and temporal dynamics of baseflow are still poorly understood topography has a significant impact on the vegetation and climate conditions in mountainous catchments and influences hydrological processes which indirectly influences anthropogenic activities in the regions jong et al 2009 thus identifying baseflow variations is essential for managing water resources energy budgets and biogeochemical cycles in mountainous catchments bales et al 2006 previous studies investigated the impacts of surface geomorphology e g elevation gan et al 2015 and slope segura et al 2019 vegetation condition and precipitation variation on baseflow in mountainous catchments gan et al 2015 zomlot et al 2015 segura et al 2019 cochand et al 2019 for instance jacques and sauchyn 2009 utilised long term streamflow records to connect winter baseflow and air temperature in the context of climate change they showed that increasing winter baseflow trends were caused by permafrost thawing improving the infiltration and intensifying hydrological cycling in canada s northwest territories cochand et al 2019 proposed an approach to identify the impacts of hydrogeological properties on the seasonal variation of groundwater storage they highlighted that mountains might strongly impact baseflow due to high elevation variation under changing climate at the catchment scale in the valais alps of switzerland segura et al 2019 adopted spatial stream network models to establish relationships between water isotopic signatures geologic and topographic attributes and showed that geologic and geomorphic features might control baseflow in mountainous catchments zomlot et al 2015 adopted the wetspass model to estimate long term average baseflow and evaluated the controlling factors of baseflow variation via statistical methods such as principal component analysis multiple linear regression analysis and relative importance analysis they found that groundwater recharge and baseflow variation were strongly influenced by vegetation cover in flanders qin et al 2017 used the isotopic baseflow separation method combined with the variable infiltration capacity vic model to simulate the effects of permafrost on baseflow on the northeastern qinghai tibet plateau they showed that temperature rather than precipitation controlled the variation in baseflow moreover the peak and recession of baseflow would occur in spring and autumn respectively gan et al 2015 analysed the baseflow characteristics in the arid alpine river systems of northwest china and found that baseflow in this area is mainly generated by rainfall snowmelt and glacier melt in addition several studies also explored the baseflow characteristics in karstic catchments eris and wittenberg 2015 however to our knowledge baseflow signatures have seldom yet been comprehensively used to investigate the baseflow characteristics particularly the baseflow characteristics of mountainous catchments around the north china plain ncp remains largely unclear the ncp is a typical region in north china zheng et al 2019 and plays a significant role in the economic development zhao et al 2019 population aggregation kang and eltahir 2018 and agriculture irrigation kang and eltahir 2018 in china moreover it is also important for the regional ecosystem xu and ding 2018 however increasing population and urbanisation led to water shortage and constrained the sustainability in this region liu and yu 2001 therefore sustainable management of groundwater and hence baseflow is of the utmost importance baseflow is a critical component connecting headwater catchments with plain areas with important impacts on the irrigation of crops liu et al 2018 since mountainous catchments are the origin of many rivers in the ncp and significantly influence catchment hydrological processes e g groundwater storage we should enhance our understanding of the baseflow dynamic variation process of this area most of the previous studies conducted in this area documented the streamflow characteristics and showed that streamflow decreased in the past decades bao et al 2012 li et al 2018b wang et al 2013 bao et al 2012 and wang et al 2013 analysed the combined effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities in decreasing total streamflow li et al 2018b found that land use changes also caused runoff decline however few studies investigated baseflow characteristics therefore the present study used a physical based method to separate baseflow from total streamflow and investigate baseflow characteristics in mountainous catchments around the ncp the hydrological signature hs is a set of hydrological indices used in many hydrological study fields including catchment classification sawicz et al 2011 hydrological model calibration euser et al 2013 water resource assessment smakhtin 1999 the dynamic description of groundwater zhang et al 2018 heudorfer et al 2019 and streamflow characteristics mcmillan 2021 therefore it contains numerous processes gnann et al 2021 to investigate baseflow characteristics we used the concept of baseflow signature which is derived from the hs previous studies mostly preferred to assess baseflow characteristics using the baseflow index bfi abebe and foerch 2006 santhi et al 2008 gan et al 2015 singh et al 2019 notably abebe and foerch 2006 investigated the correlation between catchment attributes i e climate geology and vegetation conditions and the baseflow index and found that high baseflow would coincide with high precipitation and the geologic backgrounds with granites or basalt santhi et al 2008 used the bfi to explore the relationship between baseflow and the hydro landscape and revealed that the percentage of sand influenced baseflow variations most gan et al 2015 studied the baseflow supplies e g snow melt glacier melt and rainfall via bfi in the northwest of china and discovered that the baseflow supplies were strongly impacted by precipitation temperature and topography e g elevation and slope singh et al 2019 linked bfi and other hydrologic factors to construct a predictive model for the bfi and described baseflow temporal and spatial variations in new zealand even though the bfi can reflect the entire baseflow variation it contains multiple different hydrological processes which would result in uncertainties due to limitations of concept gnann et al 2021 hence we focused on the baseflow i e the baseflow duration curve to improve the physical description of baseflow processes with bss we intended to divide our bss into two groups distribution and dynamics which can efficiently distinguish the diverse factors influencing baseflow from different components i e baseflow distribution signatures and illustrate various baseflow dynamic characteristics i e seasonality stability and sensitivity baseflow dynamic characteristics are critical for assessing catchment drought and are significant for the hydrologic water cycle gnann et al 2021 hellwig et al 2020 laaha and blöschl 2006 segura et al 2019 tashie et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a for instance laaha and blöschl 2006 used combinations of low flow seasonality indices to regionalize catchments in austria tashie et al 2020 investigated baseflow spatial stability in continental america via the logarithmic recession constant furthermore hellwig et al 2020 developed a high resolution groundwater model to monitor the baseflow drought sensitivity at the large scale with limitations in mountainous regions due to low resolution for streamflow components baseflow has various characteristics e g seasonal variations sensitivity and stability clarifying the baseflow process provides valuable information on the hydrological cycle in mountainous catchments however there is also a scarcity of applications of bs to unravel the baseflow characteristics and implications of hydrologic interactions between surface water and groundwater in mountainous catchments therefore the key objectives of this study are to 1 determine whether the baseflow signature can be used to unravel the baseflow characteristics 2 evaluate which catchment attributes are the main factors controlling variations in baseflow signatures and 3 investigate the response of other baseflow signatures to bfi in the mountainous catchments around the ncp thus this study may improve our understanding of the baseflow characteristics under different catchment attributes in mountainous catchments and provide guidelines for integrated water management in the ncp 2 materials 2 1 study area the ncp is located in the east of china surrounded by mountains from north west and south fu et al 2014 eighteen mountainous catchments 35 42 n 113 120 e around the ncp were selected in this study fig 1 a located mainly on the east foot of the taihang mountain and the south foot of the yan mountain approximately covering 17 71 104 km2 more detailed information about the catchments is provided in table 1 and fig 2 the mountainous catchments around the ncp have a semi humid monsoonal climate mainly influenced by the east asian summer monsoon the annual precipitation varies between 500 and 800 mm with higher rainfall in the southern catchments and precipitation occurs from june to september i e the rainy period summer and early autumn the other months i e october to may are dry and in this period water resources may not meet the living requirements of the residents in the ncp zheng et al 2019 the average annual temperature is about 13 c gong et al 2017 january is the coldest month with an average temperature of 1 6 c while july is the hottest month 26 3 c zheng et al 2019 the relative humidity varies between 50 and 70 feng et al 2019 and evaporation is larger than the average annual rainfall especially in june and july wang et al 2009 topographically the elevation range is relatively large with high altitudes in the western and northern region i e high rocky mountains and low elevations in the east and south i e the ncp a representative alluvial plain thus many rivers and streams that supply water to the downstream region flow from west to east the dominating soil type is rendzina which is formed from limestone via clarification and calcification sun et al 2020 additionally karst landforms occur frequently in this area institute of karst geology 2006 there are for example many ice caves in the mountainous catchments representing the largest mid latitudinal ice cave group worldwide fang et al 2010 jin et al 2015 forestland grassland and farmland are the principal land use types in mountainous catchments xia et al 2008 sun et al 2020 in addition a variety of water conservation projects e g dams and reservoirs were developed in mountainous catchments since the 1970 s which may impact the generation of streamflow li et al 2018b 2 2 data sources several studies have shown that baseflow is strongly influenced by diverse factors including location e g latitude and longitude samuel et al 2012 catchment size lacey and grayson 1998 topography e g elevation and slope samuel et al 2012 vegetation condition tan et al 2020 climate

urbanisation bhaskar et al 2016 to quantify the relationships between catchment attributes and bss this study used 23 potential determinants to describe the causality of baseflow characteristics in mountainous catchments fig 2 the daily streamflow data for 18 hydrological gauges were collected from the hydrological yearbooks of china http loess geodata cn this data undergoes good quality control before being released by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china a seasonal division between summer june july and august and winter december january and february seasons was adopted to employ seasonal ratio analysis daily precipitation and temperature data were collated from the national meteorological administration of china https data cma cn detailed information on the selected meteorological stations is given in table 2 details on other datasets used in this study are shown in table 3 the mean annual precipitation temperature and other relevant data were processed in the software r https www r project org 3 methods 3 1 baseflow separation algorithm in this study a revised version of the one parameter method by zhang et al 2017 first proposed by chapman and maxwell 1996 was used to separate baseflow from total streamflow records 1 q b i α 2 α q b i 1 1 α 2 α q i where q is streamflow mm d qb is baseflow mm d i is the time step and α is the recession constant d 2 α e 1 k where k is the characteristic drainage time scale zhang et al 2014a representing the catchment storage delay brutsaert 2005 and can be estimated from the observed hydrograph recessions zhang et al 2014a which influences the groundwater recession process when there is little or no precipitation tashie et al 2020 α is recession constant defined as the rate of baseflow decay related to catchment hydraulic conductivity and soil porosity characteristics vogel and kroll 1996 and can be determined by recession analysis which is essential for the baseflow separation algorithm cheng et al 2016 herein to reduce the uncertainties e g empirical arbitrary pelletier and andréassian 2020 the revised chapman maxwell method zhang et al 2017 was adopted to separate the baseflow due to its high efficiency operability and repeatability aksoy et al 2009 in the revised method the automatic recession analysis developed by cheng et al 2016 was used to obtain the recession constant reflecting more objective catchment specific characteristics zhang et al 2014a in addition this method is beneficial for reducing the scale and temporal limitations compared to other tracer based zhang et al 2017 we also used lyne hollick digital filter for separating baseflow from total streamflow and its results were similar to the chapman maxwell results zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 see fig s1 in addition the chapman maxwell method has a good performance for separating the baseflow for many catchments at regional and global scales ma et al 2020 tan et al 2020 mo et al 2021 therefore we only showed results from the revised chapman and maxwell method in this study 3 2 baseflow signatures baseflow signatures belong to the statistical signatures containing the catchment specific behaviours of hydrologic processes and reflect the variability of the catchment response and the effects of other catchment characteristics euser et al 2013 they can be divided into several types e g frequency magnitude timing duration and rate of change mcmillan 2021 in order to enhance our understanding of the baseflow distribution and dynamic characteristics in mountainous catchments specifically nine bss including frequency and timing signature baseflow index bfi the five distribution signature i e the magnitude of baseflow with the percentiles qb 1 qb 33 qb 50 qb 66 and qb 99 respectively and the three dynamics signature i e timing signature seasonality ratio sr duration signature concavity index ci and rate of change the slope of the baseflow duration curve sbdc were chosen in this study a summary of the bss is given in table 4 the detailed steps of the present study are described in fig 3 3 2 1 baseflow index the bfi is the ratio of total baseflow to total streamflow in the long term bloomfield et al 2009 gnann et al 2021 and is commonly used to investigate the baseflow groundwater discharge contribution to streamflow carrillo et al 2011 heudorfer et al 2019 it reflects the relation between baseflow and streamflow zhang et al 2020 the bfi can be calculated as 3 bfi q b q where q is the total streamflow and qb is the baseflow estimated by the baseflow separation algorithm here we also analysed the correlations between the bfi and other baseflow signatures 3 2 2 baseflow duration curve bdc the bdc is a cumulative frequency curve showing the percentage of baseflow equalled or exceeded during a specified period george 1962 similar to the flow duration curve fdc it was firstly proposed by searcy 1959 to evaluate dynamic hydrological behaviour e g low flows smakhtin 2001 and flood events vogel and fennessey 1995 and perform catchment classification ley et al 2011 the curve divides the entire flow into three periods i e high median and low flow teutschbein et al 2015 and is a good way to display the percentage of cumulative frequency during a given period george 1962 and baseflow dynamics the bdc can be calculated according to cheng et al 2012 4 p 100 m n 1 where p is the probability that a given baseflow will be equalled or exceeded of time m is the increasing ranked position on the listing dimensionless and n is the length of the entire period dimensionless here the bdc was used for the first time to evaluate the baseflow dynamics of mountainous catchments more details on the bdc can be found in george 1962 the inputs of the following baseflow signatures are categorised by distributed and dynamic classifications 3 2 3 distribution signatures the magnitude of baseflow can be described by baseflow distribution signatures derived from the bdc westerberg et al 2016 here five baseflow signatures including low baseflow qb 1 and qb 33 median baseflow qb 50 and high baseflow qb 66 and qb 99 percentiles were utilised to disentangle the baseflow hydrological responses to catchment attributes additionally three dynamic signatures containing quantitative information were used to further investigate baseflow characteristics i e seasonality stability sensitivity and unravel the baseflow characteristics from different perspectives 3 2 4 seasonality ratio the seasonality variation of baseflow can be evaluated by the seasonality ratio sr laaha and blöschl 2006 this index is widely used to identify the temporal dominant baseflow contributors i e the dominance of summer or winter baseflow zhang et al 2019a and regionalise baseflow laaha and blöschl 2006 the baseflow dynamics in one year and seasonal patterns are contained in sr wittenberg 2003 kinkela and pearce 2014 a variety of algorithms have been used to calculate this index laaha and blöschl 2006 sauquet and catalogne 2011 zhang et al 2014c among these the method developed by sauquet and catalogne 2011 was used in the present study and coupled with the concavity index to better unravel baseflow characteristics in mountainous catchments the sr can be expressed as sauquet and catalogne 2011 5 sr q b s 50 q b w 50 where qbs 50 and qbw 50 represent the 50 percentiles of summer baseflow mainly in june july and august and winter baseflow in december january and february sr 1 infers that the baseflow contribution in summer is close to that of the winter season sr 1 means that baseflow in the catchments is mainly from the winter season while sr 1 suggests summer dominated baseflow 3 2 5 concavity index the concavity index is used to describe the stability and nonlinearity of baseflow tashie et al 2020 which is associated with hydrogeology e g catchment mean slope zhang et al 2014c or elevation zhang et al 2018 and climate condition e g evapotranspiration or precipitation tashie et al 2020 the concavity index is useful to show the baseflow dynamics and reflects bank storage conditions tashie et al 2020 it can be calculated as 6 ci q b 90 q b 1 q b 99 q b 1 where qb 1 qb 90 and qb 99 are the first 90th and 99th percentiles of baseflow respectively this signature is used to compare the difference between high and low baseflow representing the shape of the bdc zhang et al 2018 the ci varies from 0 to 1 a value closer to 0 means that there is little storage capacity in the catchment riparian area however a value close to 1 indicates large storage with moderate baseflow variability sauquet and catalogne 2011 3 2 6 slope of the baseflow duration curve sbdc baseflow sensitivity can be quantified using the sbdc yadav et al 2007 a common index applied to hydrological dynamics westerberg et al 2016 this index is similar to the slope of the flow duration curve fdc sawicz et al 2011 westerberg et al 2016 berghuijs et al 2016 therefore the sbdc also exhibits a sensitivity to baseflow a higher value indicates a larger variation ley et al 2011 sawicz et al 2011 this index can be calculated as 7 s bdc ln q b 66 ln q b 33 where qb 33 and qb 66 are the 33rd and 66th percentiles of baseflow respectively the slope of the bdc is different from the shape of the bdc the former shows the variability of baseflow while the latter is mainly influenced by connectivity sauquet and catalogne 2011 more information on this index is given by yadav et al 2007 3 3 multiple linear regression mlr multiple linear regression mlr was used to assess relationships between one response variable and multiple predictor variables via a linear equation adamowski et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 8 y a b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b i x i where y is the response variable i e baseflow signatures a and bi are the intercept and linear coefficients and xi are the observed independent variables i e catchment attributes the dataset was standardised by z scores before conducting mlr as zhang et al 2020 9 z s c o r e s x m e a n x 2 s d x where x is the original data and sd is the standard deviation 4 results 4 1 baseflow estimation the drainage timescale and recession constants of the catchments are shown in table 1 the timescale amounted to 76 36 45 55 days mean 1sd and the longest recession timescale was 178 6 days in the xiaojue catchment while the shortest was 23 2 days in the guantai catchment the average recession constant was 0 982 0 011 the recession analysis of the xiaojue catchment is shown as an example in fig 4 a summary of timescale and recession constants is given in table 1 the average bfi was 0 36 0 10 and ranged from 0 15 caigoubaodong to 0 49 daomaguan across the 18 catchments fig 5 the bfi was smaller than 0 3 in four catchments xiangshuibao caigoubao caigoubaodong and weishui 4 2 baseflow signatures details of the bdc for the 18 catchments are shown in fig 6 for four groups based on catchment location specifically the variation trend in group1 was relatively uniform except for the guojiatun catchment with a relatively high baseflow fig 6b catchments in group2 also had a similar trend however the caigoubaodong catchment was different from the other three catchments fig 6c in group3 there was significant variability among the daomaguan xiaojue and weishui catchments fig 6d in group4 all three catchments had a significant declining trend over the whole period the average ci was 0 32 0 31 fig 5 and the largest value was 0 99 in the xiangshuibao catchment the lowest value was 0 01 in the caigoubaodong catchment the average sbdc was 2 60 1 01 fig 5 and values range from 1 70 to 5 00 for most gauges the largest value was 5 47 in the weishui catchment while the daomaguan catchment had the lowest of 1 42 the average of the 18 catchments sr was 2 04 2 78 the lowest value was 0 18 and occurred in the weishui catchment the largest value was higher than 10 in the guojiatun catchment the remaining catchments had values ranging from 0 50 to 4 00 fig 5 to further investigate seasonal variations seasonal differences in bdc between summer and winter were plotted in fig 7 the guojiatun sandaohezi luanxian guantai and liujiahe catchments showed larger summer than winter baseflow i e the red line is above the blue line conversely the sanhe and xiangshuibao catchments were winter baseflow dominated low baseflow was evaluated by the qb 1 and qb 33 table 4 the average qb 1 was 0 003 0 005 and the largest value was 0 02 in the daomaguan catchment most of the catchments had values below 0 01 the average qb 33 was 0 02 0 02 and ranged from 0 003 to 0 06 fig 5 the median baseflow was investigated via the qb 50 which was 0 03 0 02 the largest and lowest values were found in the sanhe and guantai catchments high baseflow is described by the qb 66 and qb 99 table 4 the qb 66 across all catchments was 0 04 0 03 and ranged between 0 01 and 0 12 the average qb 99 was 1 36 2 23 the largest value 8 74 was found in the caigoubao catchment and the lowest 0 08 in the guojiatun catchment 4 3 temporal variation and spatial patterns in baseflow signatures to unravel the dynamics of baseflow signature behaviour the temporal variation and spatial patterns of bss were investigated the qb 33 had the highest variation among the bss fig 8 on the other hand qb 1 qb 50 and qb 66 showed little annual variability and the bfi showed a slight annual change fig 8 fig 9 summarises the spatial patterns in bss the eastern part of the research area tended to have a higher bfi but lower ci and qb 99 compared to those in the western part fig 9 the spatial pattern of qb 1 was not as apparent as that of other bss the qb 33 qb 50 and qb 66 displayed high values in the northern and middle region fig 9 however sbdc was large in the southern part but low in the northern part opposite to the sr pattern 4 4 factors affecting baseflow signatures to further assess the spatial pattern we investigated correlations between 23 primary factors related to location topography vegetation climate geology soil and human activities potentially influencing baseflow variation in mountainous catchments and baseflow signatures fig 10 details on these factors are given in the source data section 2 2 and table 3 the bfi was strongly influenced by vegetation conditions with a pearson s r of 0 62 for the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi 0 64 for the leaf area index lai and 0 63 for the vegetation fraction coverage vfc besides evapotranspiration et summer precipitation p summer and topographical factors e g elevation and slope also had a significant impact on the bfi details shown in fig 10 the ci had a strong negative relationship with vegetation conditions e g ndvi lai and vfc p summer and et all r 0 45 the elevation factor also had a positive impact on the ci r 0 43 other relevant relations showed similar patterns fig 10 the sr was influenced by catchment mean annual precipitation p and catchment mean annual temperature t with r 0 83 and 0 53 soil moisture in different depths was negatively correlated with the sr especially the sm40 100 cm with r 0 54 the catchment location i e latitude and longitude showed a relatively strong positive relationship with the sr r 0 43 and 0 42 the p winter and urbanisation level ur negatively impacted sr with r 0 43 and 0 38 fig 10 most of the factors showed non significant relationships with the sbdc the ur and sm0 10 cm had relatively strong correlations with the sbdc r 0 49 and 0 43 latitude also affected the sbdc r 0 40 fig 10 for qb 1 most of the r values were below 0 2 except for p and slope with r 0 29 and 0 23 fig 10 illustrating similar responses of some baseflow distribution signatures such as qb 33 qb 50 and qb 66 to catchment attributes specifically slope vegetation condition e g ndvi lai and vfc p summer et and clay all had positive effects however elevation p winter soil moisture in all depths and sand had negative effects fig 10 compared to qb 33 qb 50 and qb 66 intriguingly qb 99 was conversely affected by several factors the vegetation climate factors e g p summer and et and soil type all strongly influenced qb 99 r 0 71 for sand r 0 71 for ndvi and et fig 10 we further investigated the impacts of catchment attributes 23 factors on baseflow signature behaviour by mlr table 5 models explaining variability in sr and qb 99 had relatively high r2 values 0 65 and 0 58 qb 1 showed the weakest fit r2 0 12 among all bss in summary summer precipitation evapotranspiration soil texture vegetation and geomorphic factors i e elevation and slope were the main factors determining baseflow characteristics in the studied mountainous catchments table 5 4 5 relationship between bfi and other baseflow signatures linear regressions were used to further investigate the relationships between the bfi and the other eight bss table 6 the ci had a negative impact on the bfi with an r2 of 0 28 regarding baseflow distribution signatures qb 1 qb 33 qb 50 qb 66 and qb 99 the r2 values of the positive correlations with the bfi increased with increasing baseflow percentiles 0 14 0 19 0 21 0 23 and 0 53 respectively however ci and qb 99 had a significant relationship with the bfi the four factors qb 50 qb 66 qb 99 and ci showed a strong and significant correlation with the bfi r 2 0 756 p 0 0006 these four bss showed an almost optimum prediction of the bfi as all the bss combined only achieved an r2 0 785 and p 0 025 table 6 5 discussion 5 1 baseflow recession characteristics in mountainous catchments the vegetation and slope have a paramount role in baseflow recession in mountainous catchments fig 10 we performed the recession analysis individually in the present study instead of using a uniform recession constant to highlight the effects of the true catchment attributes to baseflow the k reflects the characteristic drainage time scale zhang et al 2014a naturally the recession behaviour of a catchment is characterised by high nonlinearity with catchment attributes such as vegetation conditions and geomorphology jachens et al 2020 5 2 baseflow behaviour of frequency and timing characteristics in the present study the xiaojue catchment had a relatively large time scale with 178 571 days and a recession constant of 0 994 table 1 this catchment is in the upstream region of the ziya river and the vegetation is relatively dense as shown by an ndvi of 0 70 fig 2 facilitating the infiltration of surface water into groundwater aquifers during precipitation events therefore groundwater storage should be supplemented and generate more baseflow discharge to surface streamflow in drought periods however the pingshan catchment is in the downstream region of the ziya river and had a time scale of 58 140 days table 1 which is lower than that of the upstream xiaojue catchment these results are consistent with zhang et al 2019a in the weihe river basin the supply of groundwater differs with elevation and precipitation is the main source replenishing groundwater in low elevation regions segura et al 2019 conversely the role of snowmelt and other delayed sources of groundwater is amplified in high elevation regions segura et al 2019 stoelzle et al 2020 additionally the main vegetation type in the pingshan catchment was cropland xia et al 2008 and the root depth was relatively short when precipitation occurs more surface water flow is generated due to the easily saturated soil thus diminishing groundwater storage and discharge during the drought season we investigated the factors influencing baseflow behaviour via the bfi in the mountainous catchments around the ncp fig 5 our study showed that vegetation condition and climate factors e g p summer and et were the most significant factors impacting the bfi denser vegetation in general lifts deep groundwater to the subsurface aquifer this portion of groundwater would discharge as baseflow to supply surface water and result in an increased bfi moreover surface water would infiltrate to soil water storage and or groundwater recharge in the wet season yona et al 2020 thereby more baseflow may be generated and its contribution to streamflow bfi may increase additionally et may be increased by the snowmelt during spring summer in high elevations this portion of delayed flow would support considerable baseflow ficklin et al 2016 and has a strong effect on the bfi in our study elevation exhibited a negative correlation with the bfi fig 10 it is well known that low elevation areas have shallow aquifers and groundwater discharges the surface water frequently kobierska et al 2015 consequently baseflow is the main resource of surface streamflow in the downstream low territory region segura et al 2019 5 3 characteristics of baseflow distributions the bdc provides a useful way to reveal the variability further and document the factors influencing baseflow for that the bdc is separated into three parts i e high qb 66 qb 99 median qb 33 qb 66 and low baseflow qb 1 qb 33 to demonstrate the baseflow flux distributions fig 5 in our study qb 1 was a poor variable to reflect the impact of catchment attributes on baseflow because the strongest relationship qb 1 vs p only had an r 0 29 fig 10 the low baseflow is primarily influenced by other stable slower sources e g soil water snowmelt etc in mountainous catchments rather than the main component from p qb 33 qb 50 and qb 66 all had stronger relationships with vegetation condition e g ndvi lai and vfc fig 10 vegetation is beneficial for increasing infiltration when the subsurface soil water is at less than field moisture capacity and facilitates baseflow generation the soil moisture of all subsurface layers 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm 100 200 cm had negative relationships with the distribution characteristics of baseflow this suggests that the generation of baseflow from soil water would be hindered in catchments within steep slopes qiu et al 2001 therefore these catchments showed similar spatial patterns fig 9 in contrast the qb 99 had a strong positive relationship with sand fig 10 high baseflow is mainly supplied by surface water especially during summer sand regions have a large porosity and strong infiltration ability and supply considerable baseflow during higher precipitation events r of qb 99 vs sand was 0 71 however the qb 99 showed negative relationships with the ndvi et and p summer fig 10 the ndvi indicated a relatively large canopy interception thus leading to impeded baseflow through an increased et and interception nearing et al 2021 furthermore we hypothesised that due to saturation with the increase in summer precipitation p tended to cause quick flow rather than baseflow causing a decrease in qb 99 with increasing slope surface runoff increases while infiltration into groundwater decreases lee et al 2014 therefore the qb 99 showed a spatial pattern opposite to that of low and median baseflow e g qb 33 qb 50 and qb 99 fig 9 5 4 characteristics of baseflow dynamics the characteristics of baseflow dynamics were derived from three baseflow signatures including sr ci and sbdc the seasonal characteristics of baseflow was analysed with the sr fig 5 an index that indicates the baseflow difference between summer and winter a large sr value sr 1 shows that the summer season contributes more baseflow while a low value sr 1 shows that winter is the dominant season for baseflow in this study the sr was lower than 1 in seven catchments indicating that baseflow was mainly derived from winter fig 5 however catchments located in regions of monsoonal climate should be dominated by the summer baseflow this is consistent with the study by zhang et al 2019a in the loess plateau catchment interestingly for several catchments baseflow was more dependent on the winter baseflow this may result from a combination of geological and vegetation conditions karst geomorphology is common in the investigated catchments fig 2 with typical karst features i e karst aquifers or highly porous settings formed by volcanic or glacial terrain institute of karst geology 2006 fan 2011 price 2011 yu 2020 in the lowland regions the vegetation is primarily grassland and cropland surface runoff or other supplies e g flow from snow melting may infiltrate into the groundwater aquifers in summer frohlich and frohlich 1994 devito et al 2005 when the baseflow is damped by low groundwater water levels and enveloped storage in karst aquifers in the winter season exfiltration should occur and last relatively long into the dryer period fig 10 shows that the correlation between sr and karst was negative with r 0 34 we hypothesise that the anti seasonal behaviour of the ice caves may cause this interesting phenomenon in the summer warm season the temperature in this cave is lower than the outside temperature i e around 0 c and therefore the air liquid water might be reserved as solid water e g ice in the cave however the opposite should occur in the winter cold season with inside temperatures much higher than outside temperatures stored water should discharge as baseflow in other words the generation of baseflow might be intensified and impact baseflow behaviour around the year one of the most famous ice caves is located in the west of the kuangmenkou catchment and this was a catchment that presents this abnormal phenomenon more information about the anti seasonal nature of ice caves were found in jin et al 2015 however more work should be conducted to unravel this phenomenon further we investigated the dominant factors influencing the sr and found that precipitation and mean annual temperature were the two controlling factors that impacted sr fig 10 the soil moisture and urbanisation level also influenced baseflow seasonal variation fig 10 generally baseflow can be supplied by sufficient precipitation in the wet season and the resulting infiltration into groundwater and therefore there was a dominant summer baseflow trend conversely an increase in winter precipitation would increase winter baseflow and diminish the sr fig 10 the winter precipitation in the northern part of the study area was lower than that in the southern part and may not supply the winter baseflow sufficiently in this part resulting in high sr values duan et al 2017 in addition this phenomenon exists in impervious surface areas caused by urbanisation which impede the infiltration of surface water the ci and sbdc are indices that describe the stability and sensitivity of baseflow table 4 the ci is closely associated with nonlinear storage discharge relationships of catchments tashie et al 2020 and hydrogeologic conditions smakhtin 2001 a large ci indicates that a catchment has large aquifers that moderate the variation in baseflow fig 10 shows that p summer and vegetation conditions i e ndvi lai and vfc were in good agreement with the ci r2 between 0 45 and 0 49 in the summer season wet season baseflow would be affected by precipitation events and had a great variation with a lower ci additionally larger vegetation indices generally indicate dense vegetation in catchments and more groundwater could be lifted by the rooting function of deep rooted vegetation lee et al 2005 this changes the subsurface water storage and indirectly influences baseflow negative relationships between vegetation rooting depth and groundwater recharge have previously been proved li et al 2018 in other words a catchment with a higher average rooting depth will have a higher groundwater discharge recharge rate vegetation with deeper roots absorb deep groundwater and has a markable influence on groundwater storage changes in a unit fan et al 2017 leading to great variations in baseflow in the short term baseflow generation is a synergetic process influenced by elevation t and et in the area with low elevations the aquifer is short and the rate of groundwater interaction i e discharge and recharge is high however temperature decreases with elevation which leads to low evaporation thus groundwater storage would be reduced due to more intense evaporation in low elevations which might diminish the amount of baseflow generation furthermore the selected mountainous catchments are located on the windward slope therefore precipitation is high and increases with elevation rainfall contributed significantly to groundwater storage additionally karst bedrock formed by the combination of soluble rocks e g limestone and dissolving effects of precipitation heidelberg 1980 is infrequent in this system and characterised by slow seepage i e between groundwater and surface water huang et al 1993 ghasemizadeh et al 2012 however when exceeding a certain altitude the precipitation diminishes and groundwater recharge is due to snow glacier melting gan et al 2015 a stable source of baseflow i e the value of ci increases this may be the reason why the ci is large in the northwest of the ncp the sbdc was strongly influenced by anthropogenic activity in the studied mountainous catchments i e urbanisation level ur the infiltration of rainfall would be impeded by impervious surface areas and thus hinder baseflow recharge on a long term scale i e higher sbdc 5 5 implications of the relationship between bfi and other baseflow signatures the bfi refers to the ratio between baseflow and total streamflow over the entire studied period the summer precipitation was a significant source that could increase groundwater recharge and therefore the bfi might increase in summer for the qb 99 the canopy interception of vegetation may make a difference leading to the decrease of high baseflow the relationships between bfi and sr sbdc were not significant with r2 0 029 and 0 001 table 6 the bfi had a significant relationship with ci with r2 0 280 the ci reveals the stability of baseflow which was apparently influenced by vegetation and climate factors including p summer and et with larger vegetation indices i e denser vegetation this would tend to increase groundwater storage by conserving groundwater soil water there would be more groundwater discharge i e baseflow and a lower ci as e g evidenced by sauquet and catalogne 2011 in france our multiple linear regression results indicated that using the other eight bss could well predict the bfi r2 0 785 p 0 025 table 6 additionally five predictors had a good capability to predict the bfi r2 0 756 p 0 0006 a single bs could not predict the bfi well which was also proved for other catchments by mcmillan 2021 our results provide a possibility to estimate the bfi by considering multiple baseflow hydrological processes i e bs in summary this study only assessed the relationships between the bfi and other baseflow signatures further long term and large scale studies are needed to reveal the underlying mechanisms 6 conclusions and future work baseflow signatures explained the variability of specific hydrologic processes to expand our understanding of baseflow response mechanisms we investigated the baseflow characteristics of 18 mountainous catchments around the north china plain nine baseflow signatures containing baseflow index baseflow distribution qb 1 qb 33 qb 50 qb 66 and qb 99 and dynamic characteristics baseflow duration curve seasonality ratio concavity index and slope of the baseflow duration curve were selected to analyse the baseflow characteristics our results confirmed a strong spatial pattern for most of the baseflow signatures while most annual trends were not significant p 0 05 the variability of baseflow index was highly correlated to the synergy from vegetation summer precipitation and evapotranspiration in addition the influencing factors of baseflow distribution signatures with similar effect patterns compared to the baseflow index except for terrain and soil texture for baseflow dynamic signatures the concavity index and seasonality ratio were strongly impacted by vegetation and climate factors e g precipitation and evapotranspiration and soil moisture temperature soil moisture and urbanisation level were the primary factors influencing the slope of the baseflow duration curve with a carbonate rock fissure karst structure the karst areas in our study may have stored superfluous water in summer and discharged it in winter thereby influencing the concavity index and seasonality ratio in monsoonal climate regions our results provided important insights into the catchment attributes impacting baseflow hydrological processes nevertheless there are still improvements would to be made in future work more comprehensive studies particularly those related to observations large catchment datasets

3676,baseflow is paramount to sustain the ecological integrity of river catchments identifying baseflow characteristics and influencing factors can facilitate the understanding of the water budget of catchments in this study a revised one parameter digital filter was used to separate baseflow from total daily streamflow in 18 mountainous catchments around the north china plain ncp nine baseflow signatures bss including baseflow index bfi the five distribution signature with the representative percentiles qb 1 qb 33 qb 50 qb 66 qb 99 respectively and the three dynamics signature seasonality ratio sr concavity index ci and slope of the baseflow duration curve sbdc were used to assess the baseflow hydrological behaviour i e seasonality stability and sensitivity our findings showed 1 an apparent spatial pattern for most baseflow signatures except for qb 1 but no particular temporal variation in the studied catchments 2 that summer precipitation evapotranspiration soil texture

distribution and 4 that qb 50 qb 66 qb 99 and ci were good predictors to estimate the bfi r 2 0 756 this study analysed the baseflow signature behaviour of mountainous catchments and provided insights into the hydrological processes related to baseflow keywords baseflow characteristics baseflow signature mountainous catchments 1 introduction baseflow is the portion of total streamflow from groundwater and other delayed flows singh et al 2019 and plays an essential role in the interaction between groundwater and surface water banks et al 2011 thus it contributes considerably to eco hydrological processes for example baseflow contributes to irrigation water management hall 1968 ecological protection price 2011 groundwater storage trends zhang et al 2014b groundwater recharge niazi et al 2017 non point pollution he and lu 2016 and flood events tularam and ilahee 2008 besides baseflow is influenced by catchment characteristics e g topography segura et al 2019 vegetation cheng et al 2017 climate yang et al 2017 and soil texture gnann et al 2021 in mountainous areas baseflow is affected by precipitation and the presence of quaternary deposits and porous volcanic glacial bedrock devito et al 2005 which affects the process of baseflow generation via surface water groundwater interactions price 2011 yet the effects of rainfall and geologic variability on the spatial and temporal dynamics of baseflow are still poorly understood topography has a significant impact on the vegetation and climate conditions in mountainous catchments and influences hydrological processes which indirectly influences anthropogenic activities in the regions jong et al 2009 thus identifying baseflow variations is essential for managing water resources energy budgets and biogeochemical cycles in mountainous catchments bales et al 2006 previous studies investigated the impacts of surface geomorphology e g elevation gan et al 2015 and slope segura et al 2019 vegetation condition and precipitation variation on baseflow in mountainous catchments gan et al 2015 zomlot et al 2015 segura et al 2019 cochand et al 2019 for instance jacques and sauchyn 2009 utilised long term streamflow records to connect winter baseflow and air temperature in the context of climate change they showed that increasing winter baseflow trends were caused by permafrost thawing improving the infiltration and intensifying hydrological cycling in canada s northwest territories cochand et al 2019 proposed an approach to identify the impacts of hydrogeological properties on the seasonal variation of groundwater storage they highlighted that mountains might strongly impact baseflow due to high elevation variation under changing climate at the catchment scale in the valais alps of switzerland segura et al 2019 adopted spatial stream network models to establish relationships between water isotopic signatures geologic and topographic attributes and showed that geologic and geomorphic features might control baseflow in mountainous catchments zomlot et al 2015 adopted the wetspass model to estimate long term average baseflow and evaluated the controlling factors of baseflow variation via statistical methods such as principal component analysis multiple linear regression analysis and relative importance analysis they found that groundwater recharge and baseflow variation were strongly influenced by vegetation cover in flanders qin et al 2017 used the isotopic baseflow separation method combined with the variable infiltration capacity vic model to simulate the effects of permafrost on baseflow on the northeastern qinghai tibet plateau they showed that temperature rather than precipitation controlled the variation in baseflow moreover the peak and recession of baseflow would occur in spring and autumn respectively gan et al 2015 analysed the baseflow characteristics in the arid alpine river systems of northwest china and found that baseflow in this area is mainly generated by rainfall snowmelt and glacier melt in addition several studies also explored the baseflow characteristics in karstic catchments eris and wittenberg 2015 however to our knowledge baseflow signatures have seldom yet been comprehensively used to investigate the baseflow characteristics particularly the baseflow characteristics of mountainous catchments around the north china plain ncp remains largely unclear the ncp is a typical region in north china zheng et al 2019 and plays a significant role in the economic development zhao et al 2019 population aggregation kang and eltahir 2018 and agriculture irrigation kang and eltahir 2018 in china moreover it is also important for the regional ecosystem xu and ding 2018 however increasing population and urbanisation led to water shortage and constrained the sustainability in this region liu and yu 2001 therefore sustainable management of groundwater and hence baseflow is of the utmost importance baseflow is a critical component connecting headwater catchments with plain areas with important impacts on the irrigation of crops liu et al 2018 since mountainous catchments are the origin of many rivers in the ncp and significantly influence catchment hydrological processes e g groundwater storage we should enhance our understanding of the baseflow dynamic variation process of this area most of the previous studies conducted in this area documented the streamflow characteristics and showed that streamflow decreased in the past decades bao et al 2012 li et al 2018b wang et al 2013 bao et al 2012 and wang et al 2013 analysed the combined effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities in decreasing total streamflow li et al 2018b found that land use changes also caused runoff decline however few studies investigated baseflow characteristics therefore the present study used a physical based method to separate baseflow from total streamflow and investigate baseflow characteristics in mountainous catchments around the ncp the hydrological signature hs is a set of hydrological indices used in many hydrological study fields including catchment classification sawicz et al 2011 hydrological model calibration euser et al 2013 water resource assessment smakhtin 1999 the dynamic description of groundwater zhang et al 2018 heudorfer et al 2019 and streamflow characteristics mcmillan 2021 therefore it contains numerous processes gnann et al 2021 to investigate baseflow characteristics we used the concept of baseflow signature which is derived from the hs previous studies mostly preferred to assess baseflow characteristics using the baseflow index bfi abebe and foerch 2006 santhi et al 2008 gan et al 2015 singh et al 2019 notably abebe and foerch 2006 investigated the correlation between catchment attributes i e climate geology and vegetation conditions and the baseflow index and found that high baseflow would coincide with high precipitation and the geologic backgrounds with granites or basalt santhi et al 2008 used the bfi to explore the relationship between baseflow and the hydro landscape and revealed that the percentage of sand influenced baseflow variations most gan et al 2015 studied the baseflow supplies e g snow melt glacier melt and rainfall via bfi in the northwest of china and discovered that the baseflow supplies were strongly impacted by precipitation temperature and topography e g elevation and slope singh et al 2019 linked bfi and other hydrologic factors to construct a predictive model for the bfi and described baseflow temporal and spatial variations in new zealand even though the bfi can reflect the entire baseflow variation it contains multiple different hydrological processes which would result in uncertainties due to limitations of concept gnann et al 2021 hence we focused on the baseflow i e the baseflow duration curve to improve the physical description of baseflow processes with bss we intended to divide our bss into two groups distribution and dynamics which can efficiently distinguish the diverse factors influencing baseflow from different components i e baseflow distribution signatures and illustrate various baseflow dynamic characteristics i e seasonality stability and sensitivity baseflow dynamic characteristics are critical for assessing catchment drought and are significant for the hydrologic water cycle gnann et al 2021 hellwig et al 2020 laaha and blöschl 2006 segura et al 2019 tashie et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a for instance laaha and blöschl 2006 used combinations of low flow seasonality indices to regionalize catchments in austria tashie et al 2020 investigated baseflow spatial stability in continental america via the logarithmic recession constant furthermore hellwig et al 2020 developed a high resolution groundwater model to monitor the baseflow drought sensitivity at the large scale with limitations in mountainous regions due to low resolution for streamflow components baseflow has various characteristics e g seasonal variations sensitivity and stability clarifying the baseflow process provides valuable information on the hydrological cycle in mountainous catchments however there is also a scarcity of applications of bs to unravel the baseflow characteristics and implications of hydrologic interactions between surface water and groundwater in mountainous catchments therefore the key objectives of this study are to 1 determine whether the baseflow signature can be used to unravel the baseflow characteristics 2 evaluate which catchment attributes are the main factors controlling variations in baseflow signatures and 3 investigate the response of other baseflow signatures to bfi in the mountainous catchments around the ncp thus this study may improve our understanding of the baseflow characteristics under different catchment attributes in mountainous catchments and provide guidelines for integrated water management in the ncp 2 materials 2 1 study area the ncp is located in the east of china surrounded by mountains from north west and south fu et al 2014 eighteen mountainous catchments 35 42 n 113 120 e around the ncp were selected in this study fig 1 a located mainly on the east foot of the taihang mountain and the south foot of the yan mountain approximately covering 17 71 104 km2 more detailed information about the catchments is provided in table 1 and fig 2 the mountainous catchments around the ncp have a semi humid monsoonal climate mainly influenced by the east asian summer monsoon the annual precipitation varies between 500 and 800 mm with higher rainfall in the southern catchments and precipitation occurs from june to september i e the rainy period summer and early autumn the other months i e october to may are dry and in this period water resources may not meet the living requirements of the residents in the ncp zheng et al 2019 the average annual temperature is about 13 c gong et al 2017 january is the coldest month with an average temperature of 1 6 c while july is the hottest month 26 3 c zheng et al 2019 the relative humidity varies between 50 and 70 feng et al 2019 and evaporation is larger than the average annual rainfall especially in june and july wang et al 2009 topographically the elevation range is relatively large with high altitudes in the western and northern region i e high rocky mountains and low elevations in the east and south i e the ncp a representative alluvial plain thus many rivers and streams that supply water to the downstream region flow from west to east the dominating soil type is rendzina which is formed from limestone via clarification and calcification sun et al 2020 additionally karst landforms occur frequently in this area institute of karst geology 2006 there are for example many ice caves in the mountainous catchments representing the largest mid latitudinal ice cave group worldwide fang et al 2010 jin et al 2015 forestland grassland and farmland are the principal land use types in mountainous catchments xia et al 2008 sun et al 2020 in addition a variety of water conservation projects e g dams and reservoirs were developed in mountainous catchments since the 1970 s which may impact the generation of streamflow li et al 2018b 2 2 data sources several studies have shown that baseflow is strongly influenced by diverse factors including location e g latitude and longitude samuel et al 2012 catchment size lacey and grayson 1998 topography e g elevation and slope samuel et al 2012 vegetation condition tan et al 2020 climate

urbanisation bhaskar et al 2016 to quantify the relationships between catchment attributes and bss this study used 23 potential determinants to describe the causality of baseflow characteristics in mountainous catchments fig 2 the daily streamflow data for 18 hydrological gauges were collected from the hydrological yearbooks of china http loess geodata cn this data undergoes good quality control before being released by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china a seasonal division between summer june july and august and winter december january and february seasons was adopted to employ seasonal ratio analysis daily precipitation and temperature data were collated from the national meteorological administration of china https data cma cn detailed information on the selected meteorological stations is given in table 2 details on other datasets used in this study are shown in table 3 the mean annual precipitation temperature and other relevant data were processed in the software r https www r project org 3 methods 3 1 baseflow separation algorithm in this study a revised version of the one parameter method by zhang et al 2017 first proposed by chapman and maxwell 1996 was used to separate baseflow from total streamflow records 1 q b i α 2 α q b i 1 1 α 2 α q i where q is streamflow mm d qb is baseflow mm d i is the time step and α is the recession constant d 2 α e 1 k where k is the characteristic drainage time scale zhang et al 2014a representing the catchment storage delay brutsaert 2005 and can be estimated from the observed hydrograph recessions zhang et al 2014a which influences the groundwater recession process when there is little or no precipitation tashie et al 2020 α is recession constant defined as the rate of baseflow decay related to catchment hydraulic conductivity and soil porosity characteristics vogel and kroll 1996 and can be determined by recession analysis which is essential for the baseflow separation algorithm cheng et al 2016 herein to reduce the uncertainties e g empirical arbitrary pelletier and andréassian 2020 the revised chapman maxwell method zhang et al 2017 was adopted to separate the baseflow due to its high efficiency operability and repeatability aksoy et al 2009 in the revised method the automatic recession analysis developed by cheng et al 2016 was used to obtain the recession constant reflecting more objective catchment specific characteristics zhang et al 2014a in addition this method is beneficial for reducing the scale and temporal limitations compared to other tracer based zhang et al 2017 we also used lyne hollick digital filter for separating baseflow from total streamflow and its results were similar to the chapman maxwell results zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 see fig s1 in addition the chapman maxwell method has a good performance for separating the baseflow for many catchments at regional and global scales ma et al 2020 tan et al 2020 mo et al 2021 therefore we only showed results from the revised chapman and maxwell method in this study 3 2 baseflow signatures baseflow signatures belong to the statistical signatures containing the catchment specific behaviours of hydrologic processes and reflect the variability of the catchment response and the effects of other catchment characteristics euser et al 2013 they can be divided into several types e g frequency magnitude timing duration and rate of change mcmillan 2021 in order to enhance our understanding of the baseflow distribution and dynamic characteristics in mountainous catchments specifically nine bss including frequency and timing signature baseflow index bfi the five distribution signature i e the magnitude of baseflow with the percentiles qb 1 qb 33 qb 50 qb 66 and qb 99 respectively and the three dynamics signature i e timing signature seasonality ratio sr duration signature concavity index ci and rate of change the slope of the baseflow duration curve sbdc were chosen in this study a summary of the bss is given in table 4 the detailed steps of the present study are described in fig 3 3 2 1 baseflow index the bfi is the ratio of total baseflow to total streamflow in the long term bloomfield et al 2009 gnann et al 2021 and is commonly used to investigate the baseflow groundwater discharge contribution to streamflow carrillo et al 2011 heudorfer et al 2019 it reflects the relation between baseflow and streamflow zhang et al 2020 the bfi can be calculated as 3 bfi q b q where q is the total streamflow and qb is the baseflow estimated by the baseflow separation algorithm here we also analysed the correlations between the bfi and other baseflow signatures 3 2 2 baseflow duration curve bdc the bdc is a cumulative frequency curve showing the percentage of baseflow equalled or exceeded during a specified period george 1962 similar to the flow duration curve fdc it was firstly proposed by searcy 1959 to evaluate dynamic hydrological behaviour e g low flows smakhtin 2001 and flood events vogel and fennessey 1995 and perform catchment classification ley et al 2011 the curve divides the entire flow into three periods i e high median and low flow teutschbein et al 2015 and is a good way to display the percentage of cumulative frequency during a given period george 1962 and baseflow dynamics the bdc can be calculated according to cheng et al 2012 4 p 100 m n 1 where p is the probability that a given baseflow will be equalled or exceeded of time m is the increasing ranked position on the listing dimensionless and n is the length of the entire period dimensionless here the bdc was used for the first time to evaluate the baseflow dynamics of mountainous catchments more details on the bdc can be found in george 1962 the inputs of the following baseflow signatures are categorised by distributed and dynamic classifications 3 2 3 distribution signatures the magnitude of baseflow can be described by baseflow distribution signatures derived from the bdc westerberg et al 2016 here five baseflow signatures including low baseflow qb 1 and qb 33 median baseflow qb 50 and high baseflow qb 66 and qb 99 percentiles were utilised to disentangle the baseflow hydrological responses to catchment attributes additionally three dynamic signatures containing quantitative information were used to further investigate baseflow characteristics i e seasonality stability sensitivity and unravel the baseflow characteristics from different perspectives 3 2 4 seasonality ratio the seasonality variation of baseflow can be evaluated by the seasonality ratio sr laaha and blöschl 2006 this index is widely used to identify the temporal dominant baseflow contributors i e the dominance of summer or winter baseflow zhang et al 2019a and regionalise baseflow laaha and blöschl 2006 the baseflow dynamics in one year and seasonal patterns are contained in sr wittenberg 2003 kinkela and pearce 2014 a variety of algorithms have been used to calculate this index laaha and blöschl 2006 sauquet and catalogne 2011 zhang et al 2014c among these the method developed by sauquet and catalogne 2011 was used in the present study and coupled with the concavity index to better unravel baseflow characteristics in mountainous catchments the sr can be expressed as sauquet and catalogne 2011 5 sr q b s 50 q b w 50 where qbs 50 and qbw 50 represent the 50 percentiles of summer baseflow mainly in june july and august and winter baseflow in december january and february sr 1 infers that the baseflow contribution in summer is close to that of the winter season sr 1 means that baseflow in the catchments is mainly from the winter season while sr 1 suggests summer dominated baseflow 3 2 5 concavity index the concavity index is used to describe the stability and nonlinearity of baseflow tashie et al 2020 which is associated with hydrogeology e g catchment mean slope zhang et al 2014c or elevation zhang et al 2018 and climate condition e g evapotranspiration or precipitation tashie et al 2020 the concavity index is useful to show the baseflow dynamics and reflects bank storage conditions tashie et al 2020 it can be calculated as 6 ci q b 90 q b 1 q b 99 q b 1 where qb 1 qb 90 and qb 99 are the first 90th and 99th percentiles of baseflow respectively this signature is used to compare the difference between high and low baseflow representing the shape of the bdc zhang et al 2018 the ci varies from 0 to 1 a value closer to 0 means that there is little storage capacity in the catchment riparian area however a value close to 1 indicates large storage with moderate baseflow variability sauquet and catalogne 2011 3 2 6 slope of the baseflow duration curve sbdc baseflow sensitivity can be quantified using the sbdc yadav et al 2007 a common index applied to hydrological dynamics westerberg et al 2016 this index is similar to the slope of the flow duration curve fdc sawicz et al 2011 westerberg et al 2016 berghuijs et al 2016 therefore the sbdc also exhibits a sensitivity to baseflow a higher value indicates a larger variation ley et al 2011 sawicz et al 2011 this index can be calculated as 7 s bdc ln q b 66 ln q b 33 where qb 33 and qb 66 are the 33rd and 66th percentiles of baseflow respectively the slope of the bdc is different from the shape of the bdc the former shows the variability of baseflow while the latter is mainly influenced by connectivity sauquet and catalogne 2011 more information on this index is given by yadav et al 2007 3 3 multiple linear regression mlr multiple linear regression mlr was used to assess relationships between one response variable and multiple predictor variables via a linear equation adamowski et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 8 y a b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b i x i where y is the response variable i e baseflow signatures a and bi are the intercept and linear coefficients and xi are the observed independent variables i e catchment attributes the dataset was standardised by z scores before conducting mlr as zhang et al 2020 9 z s c o r e s x m e a n x 2 s d x where x is the original data and sd is the standard deviation 4 results 4 1 baseflow estimation the drainage timescale and recession constants of the catchments are shown in table 1 the timescale amounted to 76 36 45 55 days mean 1sd and the longest recession timescale was 178 6 days in the xiaojue catchment while the shortest was 23 2 days in the guantai catchment the average recession constant was 0 982 0 011 the recession analysis of the xiaojue catchment is shown as an example in fig 4 a summary of timescale and recession constants is given in table 1 the average bfi was 0 36 0 10 and ranged from 0 15 caigoubaodong to 0 49 daomaguan across the 18 catchments fig 5 the bfi was smaller than 0 3 in four catchments xiangshuibao caigoubao caigoubaodong and weishui 4 2 baseflow signatures details of the bdc for the 18 catchments are shown in fig 6 for four groups based on catchment location specifically the variation trend in group1 was relatively uniform except for the guojiatun catchment with a relatively high baseflow fig 6b catchments in group2 also had a similar trend however the caigoubaodong catchment was different from the other three catchments fig 6c in group3 there was significant variability among the daomaguan xiaojue and weishui catchments fig 6d in group4 all three catchments had a significant declining trend over the whole period the average ci was 0 32 0 31 fig 5 and the largest value was 0 99 in the xiangshuibao catchment the lowest value was 0 01 in the caigoubaodong catchment the average sbdc was 2 60 1 01 fig 5 and values range from 1 70 to 5 00 for most gauges the largest value was 5 47 in the weishui catchment while the daomaguan catchment had the lowest of 1 42 the average of the 18 catchments sr was 2 04 2 78 the lowest value was 0 18 and occurred in the weishui catchment the largest value was higher than 10 in the guojiatun catchment the remaining catchments had values ranging from 0 50 to 4 00 fig 5 to further investigate seasonal variations seasonal differences in bdc between summer and winter were plotted in fig 7 the guojiatun sandaohezi luanxian guantai and liujiahe catchments showed larger summer than winter baseflow i e the red line is above the blue line conversely the sanhe and xiangshuibao catchments were winter baseflow dominated low baseflow was evaluated by the qb 1 and qb 33 table 4 the average qb 1 was 0 003 0 005 and the largest value was 0 02 in the daomaguan catchment most of the catchments had values below 0 01 the average qb 33 was 0 02 0 02 and ranged from 0 003 to 0 06 fig 5 the median baseflow was investigated via the qb 50 which was 0 03 0 02 the largest and lowest values were found in the sanhe and guantai catchments high baseflow is described by the qb 66 and qb 99 table 4 the qb 66 across all catchments was 0 04 0 03 and ranged between 0 01 and 0 12 the average qb 99 was 1 36 2 23 the largest value 8 74 was found in the caigoubao catchment and the lowest 0 08 in the guojiatun catchment 4 3 temporal variation and spatial patterns in baseflow signatures to unravel the dynamics of baseflow signature behaviour the temporal variation and spatial patterns of bss were investigated the qb 33 had the highest variation among the bss fig 8 on the other hand qb 1 qb 50 and qb 66 showed little annual variability and the bfi showed a slight annual change fig 8 fig 9 summarises the spatial patterns in bss the eastern part of the research area tended to have a higher bfi but lower ci and qb 99 compared to those in the western part fig 9 the spatial pattern of qb 1 was not as apparent as that of other bss the qb 33 qb 50 and qb 66 displayed high values in the northern and middle region fig 9 however sbdc was large in the southern part but low in the northern part opposite to the sr pattern 4 4 factors affecting baseflow signatures to further assess the spatial pattern we investigated correlations between 23 primary factors related to location topography vegetation climate geology soil and human activities potentially influencing baseflow variation in mountainous catchments and baseflow signatures fig 10 details on these factors are given in the source data section 2 2 and table 3 the bfi was strongly influenced by vegetation conditions with a pearson s r of 0 62 for the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi 0 64 for the leaf area index lai and 0 63 for the vegetation fraction coverage vfc besides evapotranspiration et summer precipitation p summer and topographical factors e g elevation and slope also had a significant impact on the bfi details shown in fig 10 the ci had a strong negative relationship with vegetation conditions e g ndvi lai and vfc p summer and et all r 0 45 the elevation factor also had a positive impact on the ci r 0 43 other relevant relations showed similar patterns fig 10 the sr was influenced by catchment mean annual precipitation p and catchment mean annual temperature t with r 0 83 and 0 53 soil moisture in different depths was negatively correlated with the sr especially the sm40 100 cm with r 0 54 the catchment location i e latitude and longitude showed a relatively strong positive relationship with the sr r 0 43 and 0 42 the p winter and urbanisation level ur negatively impacted sr with r 0 43 and 0 38 fig 10 most of the factors showed non significant relationships with the sbdc the ur and sm0 10 cm had relatively strong correlations with the sbdc r 0 49 and 0 43 latitude also affected the sbdc r 0 40 fig 10 for qb 1 most of the r values were below 0 2 except for p and slope with r 0 29 and 0 23 fig 10 illustrating similar responses of some baseflow distribution signatures such as qb 33 qb 50 and qb 66 to catchment attributes specifically slope vegetation condition e g ndvi lai and vfc p summer et and clay all had positive effects however elevation p winter soil moisture in all depths and sand had negative effects fig 10 compared to qb 33 qb 50 and qb 66 intriguingly qb 99 was conversely affected by several factors the vegetation climate factors e g p summer and et and soil type all strongly influenced qb 99 r 0 71 for sand r 0 71 for ndvi and et fig 10 we further investigated the impacts of catchment attributes 23 factors on baseflow signature behaviour by mlr table 5 models explaining variability in sr and qb 99 had relatively high r2 values 0 65 and 0 58 qb 1 showed the weakest fit r2 0 12 among all bss in summary summer precipitation evapotranspiration soil texture vegetation and geomorphic factors i e elevation and slope were the main factors determining baseflow characteristics in the studied mountainous catchments table 5 4 5 relationship between bfi and other baseflow signatures linear regressions were used to further investigate the relationships between the bfi and the other eight bss table 6 the ci had a negative impact on the bfi with an r2 of 0 28 regarding baseflow distribution signatures qb 1 qb 33 qb 50 qb 66 and qb 99 the r2 values of the positive correlations with the bfi increased with increasing baseflow percentiles 0 14 0 19 0 21 0 23 and 0 53 respectively however ci and qb 99 had a significant relationship with the bfi the four factors qb 50 qb 66 qb 99 and ci showed a strong and significant correlation with the bfi r 2 0 756 p 0 0006 these four bss showed an almost optimum prediction of the bfi as all the bss combined only achieved an r2 0 785 and p 0 025 table 6 5 discussion 5 1 baseflow recession characteristics in mountainous catchments the vegetation and slope have a paramount role in baseflow recession in mountainous catchments fig 10 we performed the recession analysis individually in the present study instead of using a uniform recession constant to highlight the effects of the true catchment attributes to baseflow the k reflects the characteristic drainage time scale zhang et al 2014a naturally the recession behaviour of a catchment is characterised by high nonlinearity with catchment attributes such as vegetation conditions and geomorphology jachens et al 2020 5 2 baseflow behaviour of frequency and timing characteristics in the present study the xiaojue catchment had a relatively large time scale with 178 571 days and a recession constant of 0 994 table 1 this catchment is in the upstream region of the ziya river and the vegetation is relatively dense as shown by an ndvi of 0 70 fig 2 facilitating the infiltration of surface water into groundwater aquifers during precipitation events therefore groundwater storage should be supplemented and generate more baseflow discharge to surface streamflow in drought periods however the pingshan catchment is in the downstream region of the ziya river and had a time scale of 58 140 days table 1 which is lower than that of the upstream xiaojue catchment these results are consistent with zhang et al 2019a in the weihe river basin the supply of groundwater differs with elevation and precipitation is the main source replenishing groundwater in low elevation regions segura et al 2019 conversely the role of snowmelt and other delayed sources of groundwater is amplified in high elevation regions segura et al 2019 stoelzle et al 2020 additionally the main vegetation type in the pingshan catchment was cropland xia et al 2008 and the root depth was relatively short when precipitation occurs more surface water flow is generated due to the easily saturated soil thus diminishing groundwater storage and discharge during the drought season we investigated the factors influencing baseflow behaviour via the bfi in the mountainous catchments around the ncp fig 5 our study showed that vegetation condition and climate factors e g p summer and et were the most significant factors impacting the bfi denser vegetation in general lifts deep groundwater to the subsurface aquifer this portion of groundwater would discharge as baseflow to supply surface water and result in an increased bfi moreover surface water would infiltrate to soil water storage and or groundwater recharge in the wet season yona et al 2020 thereby more baseflow may be generated and its contribution to streamflow bfi may increase additionally et may be increased by the snowmelt during spring summer in high elevations this portion of delayed flow would support considerable baseflow ficklin et al 2016 and has a strong effect on the bfi in our study elevation exhibited a negative correlation with the bfi fig 10 it is well known that low elevation areas have shallow aquifers and groundwater discharges the surface water frequently kobierska et al 2015 consequently baseflow is the main resource of surface streamflow in the downstream low territory region segura et al 2019 5 3 characteristics of baseflow distributions the bdc provides a useful way to reveal the variability further and document the factors influencing baseflow for that the bdc is separated into three parts i e high qb 66 qb 99 median qb 33 qb 66 and low baseflow qb 1 qb 33 to demonstrate the baseflow flux distributions fig 5 in our study qb 1 was a poor variable to reflect the impact of catchment attributes on baseflow because the strongest relationship qb 1 vs p only had an r 0 29 fig 10 the low baseflow is primarily influenced by other stable slower sources e g soil water snowmelt etc in mountainous catchments rather than the main component from p qb 33 qb 50 and qb 66 all had stronger relationships with vegetation condition e g ndvi lai and vfc fig 10 vegetation is beneficial for increasing infiltration when the subsurface soil water is at less than field moisture capacity and facilitates baseflow generation the soil moisture of all subsurface layers 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm 100 200 cm had negative relationships with the distribution characteristics of baseflow this suggests that the generation of baseflow from soil water would be hindered in catchments within steep slopes qiu et al 2001 therefore these catchments showed similar spatial patterns fig 9 in contrast the qb 99 had a strong positive relationship with sand fig 10 high baseflow is mainly supplied by surface water especially during summer sand regions have a large porosity and strong infiltration ability and supply considerable baseflow during higher precipitation events r of qb 99 vs sand was 0 71 however the qb 99 showed negative relationships with the ndvi et and p summer fig 10 the ndvi indicated a relatively large canopy interception thus leading to impeded baseflow through an increased et and interception nearing et al 2021 furthermore we hypothesised that due to saturation with the increase in summer precipitation p tended to cause quick flow rather than baseflow causing a decrease in qb 99 with increasing slope surface runoff increases while infiltration into groundwater decreases lee et al 2014 therefore the qb 99 showed a spatial pattern opposite to that of low and median baseflow e g qb 33 qb 50 and qb 99 fig 9 5 4 characteristics of baseflow dynamics the characteristics of baseflow dynamics were derived from three baseflow signatures including sr ci and sbdc the seasonal characteristics of baseflow was analysed with the sr fig 5 an index that indicates the baseflow difference between summer and winter a large sr value sr 1 shows that the summer season contributes more baseflow while a low value sr 1 shows that winter is the dominant season for baseflow in this study the sr was lower than 1 in seven catchments indicating that baseflow was mainly derived from winter fig 5 however catchments located in regions of monsoonal climate should be dominated by the summer baseflow this is consistent with the study by zhang et al 2019a in the loess plateau catchment interestingly for several catchments baseflow was more dependent on the winter baseflow this may result from a combination of geological and vegetation conditions karst geomorphology is common in the investigated catchments fig 2 with typical karst features i e karst aquifers or highly porous settings formed by volcanic or glacial terrain institute of karst geology 2006 fan 2011 price 2011 yu 2020 in the lowland regions the vegetation is primarily grassland and cropland surface runoff or other supplies e g flow from snow melting may infiltrate into the groundwater aquifers in summer frohlich and frohlich 1994 devito et al 2005 when the baseflow is damped by low groundwater water levels and enveloped storage in karst aquifers in the winter season exfiltration should occur and last relatively long into the dryer period fig 10 shows that the correlation between sr and karst was negative with r 0 34 we hypothesise that the anti seasonal behaviour of the ice caves may cause this interesting phenomenon in the summer warm season the temperature in this cave is lower than the outside temperature i e around 0 c and therefore the air liquid water might be reserved as solid water e g ice in the cave however the opposite should occur in the winter cold season with inside temperatures much higher than outside temperatures stored water should discharge as baseflow in other words the generation of baseflow might be intensified and impact baseflow behaviour around the year one of the most famous ice caves is located in the west of the kuangmenkou catchment and this was a catchment that presents this abnormal phenomenon more information about the anti seasonal nature of ice caves were found in jin et al 2015 however more work should be conducted to unravel this phenomenon further we investigated the dominant factors influencing the sr and found that precipitation and mean annual temperature were the two controlling factors that impacted sr fig 10 the soil moisture and urbanisation level also influenced baseflow seasonal variation fig 10 generally baseflow can be supplied by sufficient precipitation in the wet season and the resulting infiltration into groundwater and therefore there was a dominant summer baseflow trend conversely an increase in winter precipitation would increase winter baseflow and diminish the sr fig 10 the winter precipitation in the northern part of the study area was lower than that in the southern part and may not supply the winter baseflow sufficiently in this part resulting in high sr values duan et al 2017 in addition this phenomenon exists in impervious surface areas caused by urbanisation which impede the infiltration of surface water the ci and sbdc are indices that describe the stability and sensitivity of baseflow table 4 the ci is closely associated with nonlinear storage discharge relationships of catchments tashie et al 2020 and hydrogeologic conditions smakhtin 2001 a large ci indicates that a catchment has large aquifers that moderate the variation in baseflow fig 10 shows that p summer and vegetation conditions i e ndvi lai and vfc were in good agreement with the ci r2 between 0 45 and 0 49 in the summer season wet season baseflow would be affected by precipitation events and had a great variation with a lower ci additionally larger vegetation indices generally indicate dense vegetation in catchments and more groundwater could be lifted by the rooting function of deep rooted vegetation lee et al 2005 this changes the subsurface water storage and indirectly influences baseflow negative relationships between vegetation rooting depth and groundwater recharge have previously been proved li et al 2018 in other words a catchment with a higher average rooting depth will have a higher groundwater discharge recharge rate vegetation with deeper roots absorb deep groundwater and has a markable influence on groundwater storage changes in a unit fan et al 2017 leading to great variations in baseflow in the short term baseflow generation is a synergetic process influenced by elevation t and et in the area with low elevations the aquifer is short and the rate of groundwater interaction i e discharge and recharge is high however temperature decreases with elevation which leads to low evaporation thus groundwater storage would be reduced due to more intense evaporation in low elevations which might diminish the amount of baseflow generation furthermore the selected mountainous catchments are located on the windward slope therefore precipitation is high and increases with elevation rainfall contributed significantly to groundwater storage additionally karst bedrock formed by the combination of soluble rocks e g limestone and dissolving effects of precipitation heidelberg 1980 is infrequent in this system and characterised by slow seepage i e between groundwater and surface water huang et al 1993 ghasemizadeh et al 2012 however when exceeding a certain altitude the precipitation diminishes and groundwater recharge is due to snow glacier melting gan et al 2015 a stable source of baseflow i e the value of ci increases this may be the reason why the ci is large in the northwest of the ncp the sbdc was strongly influenced by anthropogenic activity in the studied mountainous catchments i e urbanisation level ur the infiltration of rainfall would be impeded by impervious surface areas and thus hinder baseflow recharge on a long term scale i e higher sbdc 5 5 implications of the relationship between bfi and other baseflow signatures the bfi refers to the ratio between baseflow and total streamflow over the entire studied period the summer precipitation was a significant source that could increase groundwater recharge and therefore the bfi might increase in summer for the qb 99 the canopy interception of vegetation may make a difference leading to the decrease of high baseflow the relationships between bfi and sr sbdc were not significant with r2 0 029 and 0 001 table 6 the bfi had a significant relationship with ci with r2 0 280 the ci reveals the stability of baseflow which was apparently influenced by vegetation and climate factors including p summer and et with larger vegetation indices i e denser vegetation this would tend to increase groundwater storage by conserving groundwater soil water there would be more groundwater discharge i e baseflow and a lower ci as e g evidenced by sauquet and catalogne 2011 in france our multiple linear regression results indicated that using the other eight bss could well predict the bfi r2 0 785 p 0 025 table 6 additionally five predictors had a good capability to predict the bfi r2 0 756 p 0 0006 a single bs could not predict the bfi well which was also proved for other catchments by mcmillan 2021 our results provide a possibility to estimate the bfi by considering multiple baseflow hydrological processes i e bs in summary this study only assessed the relationships between the bfi and other baseflow signatures further long term and large scale studies are needed to reveal the underlying mechanisms 6 conclusions and future work baseflow signatures explained the variability of specific hydrologic processes to expand our understanding of baseflow response mechanisms we investigated the baseflow characteristics of 18 mountainous catchments around the north china plain nine baseflow signatures containing baseflow index baseflow distribution qb 1 qb 33 qb 50 qb 66 and qb 99 and dynamic characteristics baseflow duration curve seasonality ratio concavity index and slope of the baseflow duration curve were selected to analyse the baseflow characteristics our results confirmed a strong spatial pattern for most of the baseflow signatures while most annual trends were not significant p 0 05 the variability of baseflow index was highly correlated to the synergy from vegetation summer precipitation and evapotranspiration in addition the influencing factors of baseflow distribution signatures with similar effect patterns compared to the baseflow index except for terrain and soil texture for baseflow dynamic signatures the concavity index and seasonality ratio were strongly impacted by vegetation and climate factors e g precipitation and evapotranspiration and soil moisture temperature soil moisture and urbanisation level were the primary factors influencing the slope of the baseflow duration curve with a carbonate rock fissure karst structure the karst areas in our study may have stored superfluous water in summer and discharged it in winter thereby influencing the concavity index and seasonality ratio in monsoonal climate regions our results provided important insights into the catchment attributes impacting baseflow hydrological processes nevertheless there are still improvements would to be made in future work more comprehensive studies particularly those related to observations large catchment datasets

3677,the source region of the yangtze river located on the qinghai tibet plateau is very sensitive to climate change the impact of climate change on the source region of the yangtze river has been detected from multi aspect but limited research has been conducted on the hydropower impact of important water system especially for the yalong river which is the longest tributary in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and rich in hydropower reserves with a value of approximately 33 72 million kilowatts in this study we performed statistical downscaling of 10 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 models and used the bayesian weighted ensemble method to analyze the yalong river basin the interdecadal climate characteristics of the region were analyzed and drive the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model coupled with reservoir operation module to obtain the spatiotemporal changes in water energy resources in the future the results showed the precipitation in the yalong river basin showed an increasing trend 12 38 mm 10a 25 65 mm 10a under the shared socioeconomic pathways 2 4 5 ssp2 4 5 and socioeconomic pathways 5 8 5 ssp5 8 5 scenarios coupled with reservoir operation rules the excess water during the wet season could be transferred to the dry season even so it was estimated the overall power generation of the basin would be reduced by 4 to 6 compared to the baseline period this change will largely affect the energy of chongqing and sichuan provinces which rely heavily on the yalong river for hydropower generation our framework and research results are expected to provide useful information for other river systems in the qinghai tibet plateau and can be used to re examine the research results of related river basins keywords climate change impacts projection hydropower source region of the yangtze river cmip6 1 introduction compared with traditional fossil fuels renewable energy such as wind energy solar energy and hydropower can reduce the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide jerez et al 2015 as one of the renewable energy sources with the greatest potential and most stability for development and the weakest dependence on weather conditions hydropower can effectively alleviate greenhouse gas emissions and it can flexibly allocate water resources in a river basin however hydropower generation largely depends on the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources and precipitation some studies have shown that in the context of global warming heat waves and droughts may have an important impact on water resources for hydropower generation wetherald and manabe 1999 schär et al 2004 van vliet et al 2016 therefore the changes in water resources caused by climate change will directly affect the water energy relationship table 1 the qinghai tibet plateau is the birthplace of many major rivers in china and its water source area is very sensitive to climate change factors many tributaries of the water source area have established a huge hydropower energy base among them the yangtze river as the region with the richest hydropower resources in china plays a pivotal role ren et al 2019 used the mci esm lr model of cmip5 to project the daily extreme temperature of 20 meteorological stations over the qinghai tibet plateau and its surrounding areas in the future from 2016 to 2050 and found that under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the maximum temperature and minimum temperature at the 20 stations would increase by 0 46 c and 0 83 c and by 0 30 c and 0 68 c respectively zhong et al 2018 analyzed the changes in the hydrological situation of the lancang river basin in the qinghai tibet plateau from 2006 to 2100 based on the five gcm models of cmip5 and the vic hydrological model and the results showed that the trend of precipitation under the rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios was between 5 and 26 mm 10 a and the low flow in the upper reaches of the qinghai tibet plateau showed a higher relative increase sun et al 2019 used the 10 models in cmip5 to project hydrological meteorological and agricultural drought under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios and found that precipitation runoff and soil moisture showed an increasing trend during 2021 2100 however compared with the 1954 2013 period droughts increased in duration and were likely to become more severe yu et al 2018 collected 54 models under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios to evaluate the response of the yangtze river basin to climate change based on the vic hydrological model in general the average precipitation of the yangtze river basin will increase from 2010 to 2099 and the runoff in the middle and lower reaches will slightly increase compared with the baseline period the above studies on the qinghai tibetan plateau and the yangtze river basin were all focused on the response of hydrometeorology to climate change in addition studies on the qinghai tibet plateau under the background of climate change include changes in frozen earth and glaciers lu et al 2017 ji et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 and studies on the yangtze river basin include studies on food crops and agriculture sun et al 2019 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b however there have been few studies on hydroelectric energy under climate change therefore it is necessary to understand the connection between water resources and the power supply under future climate change based on the latest and most complete data in key areas of china s hydroelectric power generation currently the most authoritative and effective way to assess the trend and development of long term precipitation and runoff under climate change scenarios is the coupled model intercomparison project cmip of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc scholars at home and abroad have conducted many related studies on climate change based on cmip5 on a global scale dams et al 2015a dams et al 2015b liu et al 2017 li et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 and have carried out some research on the impact of climate change on water energy van et al 2016 estimated the electricity of 24 515 hydropower stations and 1427 thermoelectric power plants in the world based on cmip5 data by using a coupled hydrological electricity model and they found that the reduction in estimated runoff of most hydropower stations in the world under rcp2 6 8 5 from 2040 to 2069 resulted in the reduction of the available capacity of 61 74 of hydropower stations and 81 86 of thermoelectric power plants chilkoti et al 2017 used 6 models of cmip5 to carry out a hydropower estimation study based on the hymod hydrological model and estimated the hydropower of 2091 2100 for the hydropower project near the tara hash river in florida usa hydropower the future precipitation will increase by approximately 14 compared to the baseline period 1970 2000 and the multi annual average runoff and power generation will increase by approximately 21 and 16 respectively based on two scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 of cmip5 ali et al 2018 estimated the climate and power generation of seven large scale hydropower project catchments in india it was found that all reservoirs would experience a wetter climate and hydropower energy increased compared with the baseline period up to 25 sarzaeim et al 2018 simulated the monthly temperature and precipitation from 2020 to 2049 based on three scenarios under cmip5 for run off hydropower stations and concluded that hydropower generation showed an increasing trend compared to the baseline period these studies provided important information for decision makers and scientific researchers and provided references for the development and improvement of next generation models on the basis of cmip5 cmip6 includes a more complex global carbon cycle aerosol effects atmospheric chemistry terrestrial and marine biogeochemistry and other processes further perfecting and improving the physical process of each model and improving the model s simulation ability cmip6 is the most complete of the cmip plan providing the largest simulation data eyring et al 2016 o neill et al 2016 with the release of more new generation models the simulation capabilities of different models with different precisions in different regions and different periods of time for specific research problems and the type of reference they can provide for regional decision makers need further discussion therefore we chose the yalong river basin yrb which has a large systematic deviation in the cmip5 model and is rich in water resources in the source area of the yangtze river basin as the research area stocker et al 2013 the yrb is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river basin in the influence area of the qinghai tibetan plateau with complex terrain which mainly undertakes the power generation task and is an important hydropower hub in southwest china gu et al 2015 gu et al 2018 in addition the yrb is one of the thirteen largest hydropower bases in china the theoretical hydropower reserve of the whole basin is 38 4 million kw accounting for 13 8 of the total amount of the yangtze river basin and the technological development capacity is 34 66 million kw the planned annual power generation can save approximately 49 5 million tons of raw coal consumption and reduce approximately 120 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions 945 000 tons of sulfur dioxide 6 22 million tons of dust and 17 55 million tons of waste residue which showed hydropower plays an important role in the yrb the purpose of this study was to assess changes in hydrology and hydropower generation due to projected climate change conditions to this end we first used the bias correction and spatial disaggregation bcsd method to perform statistical downscaling on the 10 cmip6 models in the yrb then the 10 downscaled models based on the bayesian weighted ensemble method were used to study future meteorological changes and drive the large scale hydrological model of vic which was unidirectionally coupled with the reservoir operation module finally project the future hydrological resources and hydropower situation in the source region of the yrb under the background of global warming to further explore its impact on the upstream regional society our framework is expected to provide a detailed assessment of the hydrological climate of the study area under the premise that the projected data in the future provide a new opportunity and can be used re examine the conclusions of previous related modeling work 2 research area methods and data 2 1 overview of the study area the yalong river originates from the southern foot of the bayan har mountains in qinghai province flows through qinghai sichuan and other provinces and is the longest tributary in the upper reaches of the yangtze river on the qinghai tibetan plateau the yalong river has a total length of 1571 km a drainage area of 136000 km2 and a natural drop of 3830 m fig 1 the yrb belongs to the climatic region of the western sichuan plateau the multi annual average precipitation of the whole basin is 600 800 mm and the average annual discharge at the outlet of the basin is 1890 m3 s the runoff of the yalong river is mainly formed by precipitation and the rest is replenished by groundwater and snowmelt ice a total of 22 cascade hydropower stations are planned along the mainstream yalong river among them jinping i jinping ii guandi ertan and tongzilin have been built and put into operation however the hydrological time series of jinping i jinping ii guandi and tongzilin were relatively short so our research selected ertan with a long time series to replace the outlet of yrb ertan hydrological station is located not far from the upper reaches of ertan reservoir and records the inflow of ertan reservoir fig 1 the cultivated land and towns along the mainstream are distributed at high elevations so there is basically no flood control task jinping i and ertan are controlled reservoir projects and the hydropower installed capacity of the yalong river ranks third among the thirteen hydropower bases planned in china 2 2 research methods 2 2 1 variable infiltration capacity model vic the vic model is a large scale distributed hydrological model developed by the university of washington and university of california berkeley liang et al 1994 it is based on multiple independent grids for calculating evapotranspiration and runoff generation specifically in the land surface process the soil is divided into three layers among which the underlying surface is divided into n 1 types of vegetation cover where n 1 2 3 n represents n vegetation type n n 1 means bare land liang et al 1996 for evapotranspiration of each grid interception evaporation of vegetation canopy and vegetation transpiration are calculated according to the types and proportions of vegetation in the grid for bare land without vegetation coverage only evaporation of bare land is considered the vic model integrates the heat and moisture exchange between the atmosphere vegetation and soil and simultaneously conserves the energy balance and water balance which compensates for the deficiency of traditional hydrological models in describing the energy flux in the runoff generation module the upper layer soil the top and the second layer soil are called upper layer soil and the lower layer soil reflect the dynamic and slow change of soil to precipitation respectively the capacity curve of soil saturation is used in the calculation of surface runoff and the calculation of base flow is mainly based on the arno conceptual model liang et al 1999 liang et al 2003 the configuration of vic model was shown in fig 2 there is no corresponding routing module in vic so the model composed of unit hydrograph and linearized st venant equations are used in this study to perform routing calculation lohmann et al 1998 the main idea is calculation first and then superposition merging that is first calculate the runoff process from each grid to the outlet section of the basin and then superimpose these processes to finally get the routing flow more detailed descriptions of the vic model can be found in the literature e g in liang et al 1994 previous studies have reported good simulation results for the yangtze river and yellow river using the vic model xie et al 2003 yuan et al 2004 the rosenbrock algorithm was used to calibrate and optimize the hydrological parameters of the vic model rosenbrock 1960 the algorithm adopts the oth stage search and each search stage includes a set of exploratory search directions in addition the rosenbrock algorithm only simply judges and evaluates the objective function and does not require the gradient of the objective function zordan et al 2014 due to the complex and multi dimensional parameters of the watershed hydrological model multiple parameters need to be optimized at the same time and even the objective function cannot be derived and solved therefore rosenbrock algorithm has been widely used in the calibration of hydrological model parameters garcía romero et al 2019 adeyeri et al 2020 the specific parameter calibration process is as follows a first initialize the selected hydrological model parameters and upper lower thresholds of corresponding parameters b select the initial set of orthogonal vectors that is the orthogonal vectors and the step size of the unit base in the n dimensional space then the transformation of axial step was combined with rotating of direction for cyclic search until if there was at least one successful iteration if the objective at any of these steps was perceived as being an improvement over the objective at the current best point in each direction and the search in that direction at that stage was stopped c if the change of the objective function in the iteration was within the specified error range stop the calculation and end the optimization d using these new orthonormal vectors compute the new calculation the nash efficiency coefficient nash certainty coefficient r2 and bias bias were selected to evaluate the simulation effect of the model in the calibration period and validation period and the evaluation grade was based on nilawar and waikar 2018 2 2 2 bcsd statistical downscaling at present the application of global climate models in the region still has systematic errors and simulation deviations due to the scale which changes with the location of the study area the study period and other factors bias corrected and spatial disaggregation bcsd wood et al 2004 method has been widely used internationally because of its simplicity efficiency and effectiveness in reducing the systematic errors of gcms maurer and hidalgo 2008 maurer et al 2010 dars et al 2017 bcsd consists of two parts bias correction and spatial disaggregation the method corrects gcm data by identifying the deviation between gcm output and measured meteorological data and then downscales the corrected gcm data from low resolution to high resolution 2 2 3 reservoir operation scheme in our study the operation curve of the operation diagram was adopted in the reservoir operation scheme in the yangtze river basin most reservoirs generally follow the design operation curve of reservoir operation diagram these operation rules are based on the trial calculation and verification of various multi year hydrological data which are of great significance for the operation of the reservoir and can reflect the operation status of the reservoir to a certain extent in the future the reservoir rules of the four hydropower stations were extracted from the operation chart and the operation rules are specified in the form of relevant constraints and equations to simulate the operation of the reservoir under the current and future hydrological scenarios taking ertan reservoir as an example and it should be noted here that ertan reservoir is a large hydropower hub mainly for power generation which does not undertake the flood control tasks of upstream and downstream therefore the following scheme rules are the power generation operation scheme 1 reservoir operation mode the water level of the reservoir should rise from the dead water level of 1 155 m in june to the normal water level of 1 200 m in early september depending on the inflow the reservoir is expected to remain at the design normal water level for 1 to 3 months when the inflow is insufficient reduce the release to maintain a high water level and vice versa from the beginning of december to june of the following year the reservoir releases water to generate electricity which generally drops to a dead water level in early june when the water level is higher than 1200 m all the water above 1200 m should be released 2 rules of reservoir operation firstly the average generated output during the period is determined according to the reservoir water level at the beginning of the period when the water level is in the firm output area the power station works according to the firm output if the reservoir has been stored to the normal water level of 1200 m power generation will be based on the input flow 2 2 4 one way coupling to hydrological model the reservoir operation scheme was included in the routing module of hydrological model in an offline one way coupled mode as follows a under the condition of a given inflow runoff of a certain reservoir the reservoir operation scheme was used to adjust and calculate the outflow flow and corresponding hydropower section 2 2 3 b in the routing module the inflow of the downstream reservoir originally the natural runoff at the reservoir was replaced with the outflow of the upstream reservoir after confluence the impact of reservoir operation on the routing process and downstream runoff was investigated c loop a and b until the last reservoir downstream 2 3 data sources 1 measured meteorological data the 0 5 0 5 grid dataset of daily surface precipitation in china v2 0 and the 0 5 0 5 grid dataset of daily surface temperature in china v2 0 were used as the measured data of precipitation and temperature in this study these datasets were based on the precipitation and temperature data from china s surface high density stations 2472 national meteorological observatories compiled by the national meteorological information center s basic data special project and the thin plate spline tps method was used for spatial analysis this dataset is based on the precipitation and temperature data from 2 472 national meteorological observation stations in china and the data are newly compiled by the national meteorological information center the thin plate spline method tps was used for spatial interpolation to generate daily grid data of 0 5 0 5 horizontal resolution on the surface in china from 1961 to the latest data the data were cross verified and error analyzed with good quality http data cma cn the daily dataset of china surface climate data v3 0 was used for wind speed data which contains the wind speed data from more than 690 benchmark weather stations in china after quality inspection and control since 1951 2 cmip6 data the working group on coupled modelling wgcm of the world climate research programme wcrp has issued and organized a total of 6 model comparison programs namely cmip1 to cmip6 the latest cmip6 is currently underway and its latest global simulation results of climate models come from scientists from all over the world compared with cmip5 cmip6 has developed a set of new emission scenarios driven by different socioeconomic models shared socioeconomic pathways ssps the latest ssps can quantitatively describe the relationship between global climate change and the path of socioeconomic development to reflect the climate change challenges that society will face in the future eyring et al 2016 in this study we screened out 20 models according to variable grid size and realization and respectively interpolated them to a resolution of 0 5 see supporting information then analyzing the spatial distribution and time series correlation between cmip6 and measured precipitation in the historical period finally 10 models with a higher resolution and a broad representation that performed better under our evaluation conditions from the 20 screened models were selected combined with the work done in cmip5 taking rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 as the research direction ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 were selected to represent moderately vulnerable societies with moderate radiative forcing and high radiative forcing with fossil fuels respectively after downscaling the selected model data based on the measured data the bayesian weighted ensemble method was used to output the daily precipitation temperature and wind speed data under the multi model historical climate representation scenario 1980 2016 and the future scenario 2020 2099 table 2 listed the original spatial resolution of the 10 models and the information of research institutions 3 other data the daily runoff 1980 2016 from ertan and other hydrological stations came from the yangtze river hydrological yearbook in addition the vegetation and soil data required in the vic model were extracted from the land cover data developed by the university of maryland and the global 5 soil texture classification data were provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa hydrological office 3 results and analysis in the yrb the jinping i jinping ii guandi and tongzilin hydrological stations were built late and the hydrological time series of those were relatively short compared to the hydrological time series of ertan hydrological station which was built in the 1950 s and ertan hydrological station was close to tongzilin the outlet station of the basin therefore the ertan hydrological station was selected to study the runoff change according to the reservoir operation scheme to explore the future water resource change in the yrb 3 1 accuracy analysis of cmip6 the pearson correlation coefficient bias and root mean square error between precipitation of cmip6 and observed precipitation were 0 54 1 31 and 3 24 respectively additionally the correlation coefficient bias and root mean square error between temperature of cmip6 and observed temperature were 0 91 3 26 and 2 77 respectively fig 3 showed the spatial distribution of multi annual daily average of cmip6 and observed data from fig 3 it can be seen the multi annual average daily precipitation of cmip6 and observed data were relatively similar in spatial distribution and both decreased from southeast to northwest i e inland however the maximum value of cmip6 was larger than that of observed precipitation and the minimum value was also less than that of observed precipitation the temperature data of cmip6 could also well reproduce the historical spatial distribution of the observed multi annual average daily temperature that is decreasing from southeast to northwest but the maximum and minimum temperature values of cmip6 were larger than the corresponding values of the observed temperature the comparison of the historical time sequence and spatial distribution of cmip6 between corresponding observed data showed that the data could reproduce the precipitation and temperature of the yrb ensuring the applicability of the historical period of cmip6 3 2 validation of the applicability of the hydrological model to verify the applicability of vic hydrological model in the yrb and the impact of reservoir operation on runoff we choose 1980 2000 as the calibration period 2001 2012 as the validation period a and 2013 2017 as the verification period b in the validation period b the regulation and storage function of jinping i jinping ii and guandi reservoirs were considered while those reservoirs were not considered in validation period a note here the measured runoff of ertan hydrological station was the inflow of ertan reservoir so ertan reservoir was not added to make the visualization effect of simulated runoff more clearly in wet and dry season the daily runoff was disposed into monthly runoff the results were shown in fig 4 it can be seen from the runoff simulation results that vic could accurately simulate the flood peak value and flood peak appearance time in the calibration period and in the validation period a except for 2001 2005 and 2010 there was a severe underestimation the other years had a better fit for the wet and dry periods to analyze the impact of the reservoir operation scheme on runoff compared to the validation period b we set up a no reservoir operation plan scenario which the simulation period was 2013 2017 from fig 4 it can be clearly observed that whether or not to consider reservoir operation has a greater impact on the simulated runoff specifically without considering reservoir operation simulated runoff was significantly underestimated during the dry season and significantly overestimated in 2016 and 2017 after considering the reservoir operation scheme the runoff presented obvious peak load shaving which fitted well with the measured runoff the serious overestimation in 2016 and 2017 may have been caused by the successive construction of certain reservoirs which have yet to be put into operation were among 22 planned cascade hydropower stations in the yrb the related indicators between the runoff simulated by the vic and the measured runoff in the calibration and validation periods were shown in table 3 the results of runoff simulation and accuracy evaluation showed that the vic hydrological model had a better simulation effect in the yrb in summary vic could simulate the daily runoff in the yrb well during the calibration and validation periods and had certain applicability in the yrb it is feasible to apply the vic model to climate change impact assessments in the yrb 3 3 variation in runoff at multi scale based on the daily precipitation and runoff of eight decadal periods the multi annual average precipitation and runoff of each intra decadal period were calculated and compared with the multi annual average daily precipitation and runoff of the baseline period 1980 2017 as shown in fig 5 in the two scenarios the precipitation in 2020 2099 showed a stable increase on the interdecadal scale and the precipitation of ssp5 8 5 was greater than that of ssp2 4 5 in each interdecadal period however the gap gradually increased from the 1950 s to the 1970 s and the runoff showed an increasing trend under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 at rates of 12 26 mm 10a and 25 11 mm 10a respectively it was found under the premise that the precipitation increased in each decadal period compared with baseline period the corresponding runoff decreased compared with the baseline period and it was not that the runoff of ssp5 8 5 was greater than that of ssp2 4 5 at any time to clarify the reasons for the decrease in runoff in the yrb in the future under the background of increased precipitation the percentage change in precipitation evaporation runoff in each interdecadal period compared to that in the baseline period was analyzed as shown in fig 6 the multi annual average daily precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff during the baseline period were 2 21 mm 1 14 mm and 1609 23 m3 s respectively additionally the multi annual average daily precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff during ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 2020 2099 were 2 33 mm 1 45 mm 1429 29 m3 s and 2 44 mm 1 52 mm and 1466 21 m3 s respectively the increasing rate of precipitation in the future was lower than that of evapotranspiration which led to an increase in precipitation but a decrease in runoff in the two future scenarios resulting in a shortage of water resources in the yrb compared with the baseline period in terms of percentage the maximum variation in precipitation under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 was 8 87 and 19 77 respectively but the variation in evapotranspiration was as high as 34 39 and 49 51 respectively and the interdecadal evaporation percentage was 3 16 times more than that of precipitation except for the 2030 s in addition there was no significant difference in the percentage of precipitation variation between the two scenarios in the 2040 s and 2060 s but the evapotranspiration of ssp5 8 5 was 1 91 and 5 18 more than that of ssp2 4 5 in 2040 s and 2060 s respectively which made the runoff of ssp2 4 5 more than that of ssp5 8 5 in the corresponding period the operation and benefits of large scale reservoirs on the yrb are affected by intra annual variation in runoff especially during the flood season and the non flood season therefore the runoff of the ertan reservoir which is regulated by cascade reservoirs was further sorted into monthly and seasonal scales to analyze the monthly natural runoff and regulated runoff in the future fig 7 shows that under the influence of global warming alone the monthly natural runoff obtained by the two scenarios was mainly reduced from june to september compared with the baseline period with the largest variation in july but the overall runoff still showed a bimodal structure in addition the runoff in the future dry season november to march of the next year will increase slightly compared with the baseline period and the spring autumn drought could be partially alleviated combined with reservoir operation and the impact of climate change on runoff the flood peak in july was greatly reduced and runoff increased from december to april in the dry season the four reservoirs in the yrb reduced runoff by 28 98 and 28 22 in the rainy season and increased runoff by 82 28 and 77 21 in the dry season under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively under the overall two scenarios the future runoff showed a decreasing trend from june to september and an increasing trend from october to march of the next year although there was a shortage of water resources in the future compared with the baseline period the intra annual distribution was more uniform according to the climate division of the four seasons in china the yrb is divided into spring from march to may summer from june to august autumn from september to november and winter from december to february of the following year the four season runoff under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios was calculated and the percentage variation compared with the baseline period was obtained as shown in fig 8 the variation in ertan runoff before reservoir operation compared with the baseline period showed a consistent trend in both scenarios before being adjusted by the reservoirs the runoff at ertan in the two scenarios increased in winter but decreased in the rest of the seasons the largest decrease was in summer with decreases of 22 92 ssp2 4 5 and 22 37 ssp5 8 5 under the dual impact of reservoirs and global climate change the spring runoff increased from 16 31 ssp2 4 5 and 11 23 ssp5 8 5 before the operation of the cascade reservoir group to 88 85 ssp2 4 5 and 93 25 ssp5 8 5 and the winter runoff increased from 13 97 ssp2 4 5 and 17 44 ssp5 8 5 to 78 91 ssp2 4 5 and 80 58 ssp5 8 5 respectively the two season runoff with abundant precipitation and water resources in summer and autumn was blocked by the reservoir to be discharged during the dry season of the year to achieve profitability 3 4 impacts of climate change on hydropower generation in yrb and energy in sichuan and chongqing provinces considering the jinping i jinping ii and guandi reservoirs were all put into operation in approximately 2013 while other reservoirs under construction were not put into operation we selected 2013 2019 as the historical period to investigate the actual hydropower generation in the past few years on this basis the historical power generation of the four reservoirs in the yrb was compared with the future power generation under the influence of global warming and reservoir operation according to the reservoir operation scheme the power generation of the ertan reservoir under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 was obtained as shown in fig 9 during the historical period of 2013 2019 according to the reservoir operation rules the average hydropower generation of the ertan reservoir was approximately 19 109 kw h h per year for ssp2 4 5 according to the actual operation rule the average hydropower generation of the ertan reservoir was expected to decrease by 1 26 109 kw h 2 19 109 kw h h 6 67 11 52 for ssp5 8 5 according to the actual operation rules the average hydropower generation of the ertan reservoir was expected to decrease by 0 71 109 kw h 2 07 109 kw h h 5 21 10 89 analysis of the other three reservoirs showed similar results to the ertan reservoir in addition the multi annual average total power generation of the four reservoirs in the yrb under different scenarios was calculated compared with the historical period the future total power generation of the two ssps was consistent with the overall runoff change in the basin specifically according to the actual operation rules under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp 5 8 5 scenarios the average hydropower generation of the yrb was estimated to be 63 2 109 kw h h and 64 9 109 kw h h and it was estimated that the multi annual average would decrease by 4 6 although the future runoff of the yrb was reduced compared with the baseline period it still has great hydropower potential in terms of the total amount of water resources and intra annual distribution the decrease in power generation may be due to the change in hydrological law which leads to the failure of the historical operation rule to be better applied to future runoff change therefore adaptive scheduling rules can be formulated according to the rules of future runoff according to the multi year data of the yalong river hydropower company among the existing power generation units in the basin the jin guan power generation unit sends power to sichuan jiangsu and chongqing and the ertan hydropower station sends power to sichuan and chongqing https www ehdc com cn gtylj index htm the specific power distribution and annual electricity consumption of each province are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 among them ertan sent power to chongqing at approximately 28 and sichuan at approximately 72 jin guan sent power to chongqing sichuan jiangsu at approximately 18 25 and 57 respectively fig 11 showed the power consumption of sichuan chongqing and jiangsu showed an increasing trend with annual average power consumption of 10 32 109 kw h 5 76 109 kw h and 22 92 109 kw h respectively while the power transmission from the yrb to sichuan chongqing and jiangsu accounted for 12 20 and 6 of their multi annual average power consumption 2013 2019 respectively the proportion of yrb hydropower in sichuan and chongqing was relatively high so the reduction of hydropower generation in the yrb due to climate change was bound to have a large impact on the energy of these two places according to the existing hydropower transmission ratio of yrb to each province it was estimated sichuan and chongqing will reduce by 1 66 109 kw h 1 43 109 kw h and 1 06 109 kw h 0 98 109 kw h respectively under the scenarios of ssp2 4 5 and ssp 5 8 5 in the future in view of the reduction in hydropower generation capacity in the yrb in the future we propose the following schemes 1 the yrb has not reached full capacity most of the time under actual operation rules so according to the evolution law of hydrological and meteorological conditions in the future the reservoir operation mode can be optimized to enhance the adaptability of the reservoir under climate change this method would reduce the adverse effects of climate change on reservoirs and give full play to the comprehensive benefits of reservoir operation 2 relevant research literature of zhang 2018 showed that although the correlation between photovoltaic output data and temperature data was low it generally showed a positive correlation trend therefore in combination with the future temperature increase and construction of clean energy base in the yrb relevant departments can vigorously develop clean energy such as photovoltaic power generation and use hydropower and solar energy to ensure energy supply and safety in the region in addition for the thermal power plants in the river basin the fuel could be converted into more efficient gas fired power plants with lower cooling water demand to reduce the water demand of the plants 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis of cmip6 in the projection and analysis of future climate change the biggest uncertainty comes from the model followed by various scenarios and the framework of the hydrological model among them the climate models although are constantly improving due to limitations in calculations and the chaotic characteristics of the climate system the current global climate models are still limited in their ability to simulate in the future which is the main reason for the great uncertainty of climate model therefore the selection of multi model was conducive to the accuracy of our final results and the robustness of the model although multi model selection and ensemble analysis is the mainstream processing method paltan et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 kim et al 2020 akinsanola et al 2020a akinsanola et al 2020b it is difficult to accurately quantify the uncertainty only through multi model ensemble mme set moreover in order to achieve accurate quantification more and more complex control experiments may be needed which may bring huge workload and is not mandatory in all similar studies therefore our goal is mainly to provide broad uncertainties to prove the reliability of the results obtained from mme according to relevant research of arnell 2003 runoff is more sensitive to precipitation than other factors so precipitation related indexes are mainly used as important factors in uncertainty analysis we processed the 10 selected models into annual average precipitation respectively and compared them with the annual average precipitation of the mme so as to show the model uncertainty caused by internal variability qualitatively as shown in fig 12 it can be seen that although the precipitation of each model presented an increasing trend of different magnitudes there was a large jump between adjacent years therefore the uncertainty fluctuation range of the 10 models was also relatively large and the uncertainty in the ssp5 8 5 scenario was greater than that of the ssp2 4 5 the annual precipitation after bayesian weighted ensemble was located between the upper and lower envelopes and the uncertainty was greatly reduced after the weighted ratio through the above uncertainty range panel and the final mme set it indicated that the uncertainty of our results was reduced compared with that before mme therefore our results can be considered to provide reliable information for future changes of water resources and hydropower in yrb 4 2 analysis of limitations in climate change projection the future climate change impact of any particular watershed is difficult to project and hydrological systems are not static model calibration with different hydrological historical conditions may produce differences in future projection results or may be unreliable however the scenario estimated in this paper is not far from the historical conditions used in the calibration and the maximum precipitation variability is 18 so the estimated result is reasonable silberstein et al 2012 our study used only one hydrological model to simulate the future runoff of the yrb mainly because there are many uncertain factors in future runoff simulations such as the structure and parameterization of the hydrological model and the structure and initial conditions of the gcm dams et al 2015a dams et al 2015b making it challenging to deal with and compare uncertainties from all factors however from the current research the uncertainty of the hydrological model is smaller than the uncertainty of the scenario silberstein et al 2012 dams et al 2015a dams et al 2015b in addition the upper reaches of the yrb are located on the qinghai tibetan plateau and are covered by a great deal of snow in winter however our study used the vic hydrological model to calibrate and validate the total runoff in the baseline period and has not yet verified the snowmelt module under the multi model ensemble both precipitation and runoff simulations will appear to be flattened but the actual future precipitation and runoff simulations inherently have largely uncertain factors an exact value cannot be obtained and the flattening of the peak will not have a decisive impact on the future trend thus we did not further address the possible flat phenomenon the 2015 paris climate agreement put forward the goal of controlling the temperature increase at 2 c and striving to control it at 1 5 c additionally the 2018 ipcc 1 5 c special report indicated that the 1 5 c warming target would be more conducive to the implementation of mitigation and adaptation policies therefore regional analysis for the special scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 c global warming is urgent and realistic the analysis of the special scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 c in the yrb will be the next step of research 5 conclusion the yrb is located in southwest china the numerous reservoirs and power stations in the basin constitute a complex engineering system that affects the safety of the power system in the southwest future changes in precipitation and runoff will play a decisive role in the hydropower of the yalong river and will affect the temporal and spatial allocation of water resources therefore it is imperative to analyze the future spatiotemporal changes in runoff and power generation in the yrb based on the latest perfected and improved cmip6 general circulation model under the background of increasingly frequent extreme climate therefore in the context of ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 we conducted hydrological hydropower projection and quantitative analysis on the yrb the third largest hydropower planning base on china s qinghai tibet plateau under the background of global warming based on the measured dataset bcsd statistical downscaling of cmip6 was performed and the future dataset of the bayesian multi model weighted set was constructed using the vic large scale distributed hydrological model unidirectionally coupled with the reservoir operation module to further project the future regulated runoff and hydropower the main conclusions are as follows in the context of global warming although the total amount of precipitation in the yrb will increase the natural runoff will decrease compared to the baseline period and the runoff will decrease during the rainy season and increase during the dry season however natural runoff still shows an increasing trend at the interdecadal scale the reduction in future runoff will lead to a downturn in hydropower generation that relies on natural runoff the yrb is expected to experience a loss of 4 6 of power generation under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in general our research results have guiding significance not only for the yrb but also for water resource management in other basins of the upper reaches of the yangtze river because the precipitation patterns and development grades of these basins are similar to those of the upper reaches of the yangtze river more importantly our climate impact assessment framework is generally sufficient to determine future changes in precipitation hydrology and hydropower under the combined effects of global warming and reservoir operation and can provide information for the integrated management of water resources in different climate regions around the world credit authorship contribution statement yinmao zhao conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review

3677,the source region of the yangtze river located on the qinghai tibet plateau is very sensitive to climate change the impact of climate change on the source region of the yangtze river has been detected from multi aspect but limited research has been conducted on the hydropower impact of important water system especially for the yalong river which is the longest tributary in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and rich in hydropower reserves with a value of approximately 33 72 million kilowatts in this study we performed statistical downscaling of 10 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 models and used the bayesian weighted ensemble method to analyze the yalong river basin the interdecadal climate characteristics of the region were analyzed and drive the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model coupled with reservoir operation module to obtain the spatiotemporal changes in water energy resources in the future the results showed the precipitation in the yalong river basin showed an increasing trend 12 38 mm 10a 25 65 mm 10a under the shared socioeconomic pathways 2 4 5 ssp2 4 5 and socioeconomic pathways 5 8 5 ssp5 8 5 scenarios coupled with reservoir operation rules the excess water during the wet season could be transferred to the dry season even so it was estimated the overall power generation of the basin would be reduced by 4 to 6 compared to the baseline period this change will largely affect the energy of chongqing and sichuan provinces which rely heavily on the yalong river for hydropower generation our framework and research results are expected to provide useful information for other river systems in the qinghai tibet plateau and can be used to re examine the research results of related river basins keywords climate change impacts projection hydropower source region of the yangtze river cmip6 1 introduction compared with traditional fossil fuels renewable energy such as wind energy solar energy and hydropower can reduce the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide jerez et al 2015 as one of the renewable energy sources with the greatest potential and most stability for development and the weakest dependence on weather conditions hydropower can effectively alleviate greenhouse gas emissions and it can flexibly allocate water resources in a river basin however hydropower generation largely depends on the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources and precipitation some studies have shown that in the context of global warming heat waves and droughts may have an important impact on water resources for hydropower generation wetherald and manabe 1999 schär et al 2004 van vliet et al 2016 therefore the changes in water resources caused by climate change will directly affect the water energy relationship table 1 the qinghai tibet plateau is the birthplace of many major rivers in china and its water source area is very sensitive to climate change factors many tributaries of the water source area have established a huge hydropower energy base among them the yangtze river as the region with the richest hydropower resources in china plays a pivotal role ren et al 2019 used the mci esm lr model of cmip5 to project the daily extreme temperature of 20 meteorological stations over the qinghai tibet plateau and its surrounding areas in the future from 2016 to 2050 and found that under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the maximum temperature and minimum temperature at the 20 stations would increase by 0 46 c and 0 83 c and by 0 30 c and 0 68 c respectively zhong et al 2018 analyzed the changes in the hydrological situation of the lancang river basin in the qinghai tibet plateau from 2006 to 2100 based on the five gcm models of cmip5 and the vic hydrological model and the results showed that the trend of precipitation under the rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios was between 5 and 26 mm 10 a and the low flow in the upper reaches of the qinghai tibet plateau showed a higher relative increase sun et al 2019 used the 10 models in cmip5 to project hydrological meteorological and agricultural drought under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios and found that precipitation runoff and soil moisture showed an increasing trend during 2021 2100 however compared with the 1954 2013 period droughts increased in duration and were likely to become more severe yu et al 2018 collected 54 models under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios to evaluate the response of the yangtze river basin to climate change based on the vic hydrological model in general the average precipitation of the yangtze river basin will increase from 2010 to 2099 and the runoff in the middle and lower reaches will slightly increase compared with the baseline period the above studies on the qinghai tibetan plateau and the yangtze river basin were all focused on the response of hydrometeorology to climate change in addition studies on the qinghai tibet plateau under the background of climate change include changes in frozen earth and glaciers lu et al 2017 ji et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 and studies on the yangtze river basin include studies on food crops and agriculture sun et al 2019 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b however there have been few studies on hydroelectric energy under climate change therefore it is necessary to understand the connection between water resources and the power supply under future climate change based on the latest and most complete data in key areas of china s hydroelectric power generation currently the most authoritative and effective way to assess the trend and development of long term precipitation and runoff under climate change scenarios is the coupled model intercomparison project cmip of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc scholars at home and abroad have conducted many related studies on climate change based on cmip5 on a global scale dams et al 2015a dams et al 2015b liu et al 2017 li et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 and have carried out some research on the impact of climate change on water energy van et al 2016 estimated the electricity of 24 515 hydropower stations and 1427 thermoelectric power plants in the world based on cmip5 data by using a coupled hydrological electricity model and they found that the reduction in estimated runoff of most hydropower stations in the world under rcp2 6 8 5 from 2040 to 2069 resulted in the reduction of the available capacity of 61 74 of hydropower stations and 81 86 of thermoelectric power plants chilkoti et al 2017 used 6 models of cmip5 to carry out a hydropower estimation study based on the hymod hydrological model and estimated the hydropower of 2091 2100 for the hydropower project near the tara hash river in florida usa hydropower the future precipitation will increase by approximately 14 compared to the baseline period 1970 2000 and the multi annual average runoff and power generation will increase by approximately 21 and 16 respectively based on two scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 of cmip5 ali et al 2018 estimated the climate and power generation of seven large scale hydropower project catchments in india it was found that all reservoirs would experience a wetter climate and hydropower energy increased compared with the baseline period up to 25 sarzaeim et al 2018 simulated the monthly temperature and precipitation from 2020 to 2049 based on three scenarios under cmip5 for run off hydropower stations and concluded that hydropower generation showed an increasing trend compared to the baseline period these studies provided important information for decision makers and scientific researchers and provided references for the development and improvement of next generation models on the basis of cmip5 cmip6 includes a more complex global carbon cycle aerosol effects atmospheric chemistry terrestrial and marine biogeochemistry and other processes further perfecting and improving the physical process of each model and improving the model s simulation ability cmip6 is the most complete of the cmip plan providing the largest simulation data eyring et al 2016 o neill et al 2016 with the release of more new generation models the simulation capabilities of different models with different precisions in different regions and different periods of time for specific research problems and the type of reference they can provide for regional decision makers need further discussion therefore we chose the yalong river basin yrb which has a large systematic deviation in the cmip5 model and is rich in water resources in the source area of the yangtze river basin as the research area stocker et al 2013 the yrb is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river basin in the influence area of the qinghai tibetan plateau with complex terrain which mainly undertakes the power generation task and is an important hydropower hub in southwest china gu et al 2015 gu et al 2018 in addition the yrb is one of the thirteen largest hydropower bases in china the theoretical hydropower reserve of the whole basin is 38 4 million kw accounting for 13 8 of the total amount of the yangtze river basin and the technological development capacity is 34 66 million kw the planned annual power generation can save approximately 49 5 million tons of raw coal consumption and reduce approximately 120 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions 945 000 tons of sulfur dioxide 6 22 million tons of dust and 17 55 million tons of waste residue which showed hydropower plays an important role in the yrb the purpose of this study was to assess changes in hydrology and hydropower generation due to projected climate change conditions to this end we first used the bias correction and spatial disaggregation bcsd method to perform statistical downscaling on the 10 cmip6 models in the yrb then the 10 downscaled models based on the bayesian weighted ensemble method were used to study future meteorological changes and drive the large scale hydrological model of vic which was unidirectionally coupled with the reservoir operation module finally project the future hydrological resources and hydropower situation in the source region of the yrb under the background of global warming to further explore its impact on the upstream regional society our framework is expected to provide a detailed assessment of the hydrological climate of the study area under the premise that the projected data in the future provide a new opportunity and can be used re examine the conclusions of previous related modeling work 2 research area methods and data 2 1 overview of the study area the yalong river originates from the southern foot of the bayan har mountains in qinghai province flows through qinghai sichuan and other provinces and is the longest tributary in the upper reaches of the yangtze river on the qinghai tibetan plateau the yalong river has a total length of 1571 km a drainage area of 136000 km2 and a natural drop of 3830 m fig 1 the yrb belongs to the climatic region of the western sichuan plateau the multi annual average precipitation of the whole basin is 600 800 mm and the average annual discharge at the outlet of the basin is 1890 m3 s the runoff of the yalong river is mainly formed by precipitation and the rest is replenished by groundwater and snowmelt ice a total of 22 cascade hydropower stations are planned along the mainstream yalong river among them jinping i jinping ii guandi ertan and tongzilin have been built and put into operation however the hydrological time series of jinping i jinping ii guandi and tongzilin were relatively short so our research selected ertan with a long time series to replace the outlet of yrb ertan hydrological station is located not far from the upper reaches of ertan reservoir and records the inflow of ertan reservoir fig 1 the cultivated land and towns along the mainstream are distributed at high elevations so there is basically no flood control task jinping i and ertan are controlled reservoir projects and the hydropower installed capacity of the yalong river ranks third among the thirteen hydropower bases planned in china 2 2 research methods 2 2 1 variable infiltration capacity model vic the vic model is a large scale distributed hydrological model developed by the university of washington and university of california berkeley liang et al 1994 it is based on multiple independent grids for calculating evapotranspiration and runoff generation specifically in the land surface process the soil is divided into three layers among which the underlying surface is divided into n 1 types of vegetation cover where n 1 2 3 n represents n vegetation type n n 1 means bare land liang et al 1996 for evapotranspiration of each grid interception evaporation of vegetation canopy and vegetation transpiration are calculated according to the types and proportions of vegetation in the grid for bare land without vegetation coverage only evaporation of bare land is considered the vic model integrates the heat and moisture exchange between the atmosphere vegetation and soil and simultaneously conserves the energy balance and water balance which compensates for the deficiency of traditional hydrological models in describing the energy flux in the runoff generation module the upper layer soil the top and the second layer soil are called upper layer soil and the lower layer soil reflect the dynamic and slow change of soil to precipitation respectively the capacity curve of soil saturation is used in the calculation of surface runoff and the calculation of base flow is mainly based on the arno conceptual model liang et al 1999 liang et al 2003 the configuration of vic model was shown in fig 2 there is no corresponding routing module in vic so the model composed of unit hydrograph and linearized st venant equations are used in this study to perform routing calculation lohmann et al 1998 the main idea is calculation first and then superposition merging that is first calculate the runoff process from each grid to the outlet section of the basin and then superimpose these processes to finally get the routing flow more detailed descriptions of the vic model can be found in the literature e g in liang et al 1994 previous studies have reported good simulation results for the yangtze river and yellow river using the vic model xie et al 2003 yuan et al 2004 the rosenbrock algorithm was used to calibrate and optimize the hydrological parameters of the vic model rosenbrock 1960 the algorithm adopts the oth stage search and each search stage includes a set of exploratory search directions in addition the rosenbrock algorithm only simply judges and evaluates the objective function and does not require the gradient of the objective function zordan et al 2014 due to the complex and multi dimensional parameters of the watershed hydrological model multiple parameters need to be optimized at the same time and even the objective function cannot be derived and solved therefore rosenbrock algorithm has been widely used in the calibration of hydrological model parameters garcía romero et al 2019 adeyeri et al 2020 the specific parameter calibration process is as follows a first initialize the selected hydrological model parameters and upper lower thresholds of corresponding parameters b select the initial set of orthogonal vectors that is the orthogonal vectors and the step size of the unit base in the n dimensional space then the transformation of axial step was combined with rotating of direction for cyclic search until if there was at least one successful iteration if the objective at any of these steps was perceived as being an improvement over the objective at the current best point in each direction and the search in that direction at that stage was stopped c if the change of the objective function in the iteration was within the specified error range stop the calculation and end the optimization d using these new orthonormal vectors compute the new calculation the nash efficiency coefficient nash certainty coefficient r2 and bias bias were selected to evaluate the simulation effect of the model in the calibration period and validation period and the evaluation grade was based on nilawar and waikar 2018 2 2 2 bcsd statistical downscaling at present the application of global climate models in the region still has systematic errors and simulation deviations due to the scale which changes with the location of the study area the study period and other factors bias corrected and spatial disaggregation bcsd wood et al 2004 method has been widely used internationally because of its simplicity efficiency and effectiveness in reducing the systematic errors of gcms maurer and hidalgo 2008 maurer et al 2010 dars et al 2017 bcsd consists of two parts bias correction and spatial disaggregation the method corrects gcm data by identifying the deviation between gcm output and measured meteorological data and then downscales the corrected gcm data from low resolution to high resolution 2 2 3 reservoir operation scheme in our study the operation curve of the operation diagram was adopted in the reservoir operation scheme in the yangtze river basin most reservoirs generally follow the design operation curve of reservoir operation diagram these operation rules are based on the trial calculation and verification of various multi year hydrological data which are of great significance for the operation of the reservoir and can reflect the operation status of the reservoir to a certain extent in the future the reservoir rules of the four hydropower stations were extracted from the operation chart and the operation rules are specified in the form of relevant constraints and equations to simulate the operation of the reservoir under the current and future hydrological scenarios taking ertan reservoir as an example and it should be noted here that ertan reservoir is a large hydropower hub mainly for power generation which does not undertake the flood control tasks of upstream and downstream therefore the following scheme rules are the power generation operation scheme 1 reservoir operation mode the water level of the reservoir should rise from the dead water level of 1 155 m in june to the normal water level of 1 200 m in early september depending on the inflow the reservoir is expected to remain at the design normal water level for 1 to 3 months when the inflow is insufficient reduce the release to maintain a high water level and vice versa from the beginning of december to june of the following year the reservoir releases water to generate electricity which generally drops to a dead water level in early june when the water level is higher than 1200 m all the water above 1200 m should be released 2 rules of reservoir operation firstly the average generated output during the period is determined according to the reservoir water level at the beginning of the period when the water level is in the firm output area the power station works according to the firm output if the reservoir has been stored to the normal water level of 1200 m power generation will be based on the input flow 2 2 4 one way coupling to hydrological model the reservoir operation scheme was included in the routing module of hydrological model in an offline one way coupled mode as follows a under the condition of a given inflow runoff of a certain reservoir the reservoir operation scheme was used to adjust and calculate the outflow flow and corresponding hydropower section 2 2 3 b in the routing module the inflow of the downstream reservoir originally the natural runoff at the reservoir was replaced with the outflow of the upstream reservoir after confluence the impact of reservoir operation on the routing process and downstream runoff was investigated c loop a and b until the last reservoir downstream 2 3 data sources 1 measured meteorological data the 0 5 0 5 grid dataset of daily surface precipitation in china v2 0 and the 0 5 0 5 grid dataset of daily surface temperature in china v2 0 were used as the measured data of precipitation and temperature in this study these datasets were based on the precipitation and temperature data from china s surface high density stations 2472 national meteorological observatories compiled by the national meteorological information center s basic data special project and the thin plate spline tps method was used for spatial analysis this dataset is based on the precipitation and temperature data from 2 472 national meteorological observation stations in china and the data are newly compiled by the national meteorological information center the thin plate spline method tps was used for spatial interpolation to generate daily grid data of 0 5 0 5 horizontal resolution on the surface in china from 1961 to the latest data the data were cross verified and error analyzed with good quality http data cma cn the daily dataset of china surface climate data v3 0 was used for wind speed data which contains the wind speed data from more than 690 benchmark weather stations in china after quality inspection and control since 1951 2 cmip6 data the working group on coupled modelling wgcm of the world climate research programme wcrp has issued and organized a total of 6 model comparison programs namely cmip1 to cmip6 the latest cmip6 is currently underway and its latest global simulation results of climate models come from scientists from all over the world compared with cmip5 cmip6 has developed a set of new emission scenarios driven by different socioeconomic models shared socioeconomic pathways ssps the latest ssps can quantitatively describe the relationship between global climate change and the path of socioeconomic development to reflect the climate change challenges that society will face in the future eyring et al 2016 in this study we screened out 20 models according to variable grid size and realization and respectively interpolated them to a resolution of 0 5 see supporting information then analyzing the spatial distribution and time series correlation between cmip6 and measured precipitation in the historical period finally 10 models with a higher resolution and a broad representation that performed better under our evaluation conditions from the 20 screened models were selected combined with the work done in cmip5 taking rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 as the research direction ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 were selected to represent moderately vulnerable societies with moderate radiative forcing and high radiative forcing with fossil fuels respectively after downscaling the selected model data based on the measured data the bayesian weighted ensemble method was used to output the daily precipitation temperature and wind speed data under the multi model historical climate representation scenario 1980 2016 and the future scenario 2020 2099 table 2 listed the original spatial resolution of the 10 models and the information of research institutions 3 other data the daily runoff 1980 2016 from ertan and other hydrological stations came from the yangtze river hydrological yearbook in addition the vegetation and soil data required in the vic model were extracted from the land cover data developed by the university of maryland and the global 5 soil texture classification data were provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa hydrological office 3 results and analysis in the yrb the jinping i jinping ii guandi and tongzilin hydrological stations were built late and the hydrological time series of those were relatively short compared to the hydrological time series of ertan hydrological station which was built in the 1950 s and ertan hydrological station was close to tongzilin the outlet station of the basin therefore the ertan hydrological station was selected to study the runoff change according to the reservoir operation scheme to explore the future water resource change in the yrb 3 1 accuracy analysis of cmip6 the pearson correlation coefficient bias and root mean square error between precipitation of cmip6 and observed precipitation were 0 54 1 31 and 3 24 respectively additionally the correlation coefficient bias and root mean square error between temperature of cmip6 and observed temperature were 0 91 3 26 and 2 77 respectively fig 3 showed the spatial distribution of multi annual daily average of cmip6 and observed data from fig 3 it can be seen the multi annual average daily precipitation of cmip6 and observed data were relatively similar in spatial distribution and both decreased from southeast to northwest i e inland however the maximum value of cmip6 was larger than that of observed precipitation and the minimum value was also less than that of observed precipitation the temperature data of cmip6 could also well reproduce the historical spatial distribution of the observed multi annual average daily temperature that is decreasing from southeast to northwest but the maximum and minimum temperature values of cmip6 were larger than the corresponding values of the observed temperature the comparison of the historical time sequence and spatial distribution of cmip6 between corresponding observed data showed that the data could reproduce the precipitation and temperature of the yrb ensuring the applicability of the historical period of cmip6 3 2 validation of the applicability of the hydrological model to verify the applicability of vic hydrological model in the yrb and the impact of reservoir operation on runoff we choose 1980 2000 as the calibration period 2001 2012 as the validation period a and 2013 2017 as the verification period b in the validation period b the regulation and storage function of jinping i jinping ii and guandi reservoirs were considered while those reservoirs were not considered in validation period a note here the measured runoff of ertan hydrological station was the inflow of ertan reservoir so ertan reservoir was not added to make the visualization effect of simulated runoff more clearly in wet and dry season the daily runoff was disposed into monthly runoff the results were shown in fig 4 it can be seen from the runoff simulation results that vic could accurately simulate the flood peak value and flood peak appearance time in the calibration period and in the validation period a except for 2001 2005 and 2010 there was a severe underestimation the other years had a better fit for the wet and dry periods to analyze the impact of the reservoir operation scheme on runoff compared to the validation period b we set up a no reservoir operation plan scenario which the simulation period was 2013 2017 from fig 4 it can be clearly observed that whether or not to consider reservoir operation has a greater impact on the simulated runoff specifically without considering reservoir operation simulated runoff was significantly underestimated during the dry season and significantly overestimated in 2016 and 2017 after considering the reservoir operation scheme the runoff presented obvious peak load shaving which fitted well with the measured runoff the serious overestimation in 2016 and 2017 may have been caused by the successive construction of certain reservoirs which have yet to be put into operation were among 22 planned cascade hydropower stations in the yrb the related indicators between the runoff simulated by the vic and the measured runoff in the calibration and validation periods were shown in table 3 the results of runoff simulation and accuracy evaluation showed that the vic hydrological model had a better simulation effect in the yrb in summary vic could simulate the daily runoff in the yrb well during the calibration and validation periods and had certain applicability in the yrb it is feasible to apply the vic model to climate change impact assessments in the yrb 3 3 variation in runoff at multi scale based on the daily precipitation and runoff of eight decadal periods the multi annual average precipitation and runoff of each intra decadal period were calculated and compared with the multi annual average daily precipitation and runoff of the baseline period 1980 2017 as shown in fig 5 in the two scenarios the precipitation in 2020 2099 showed a stable increase on the interdecadal scale and the precipitation of ssp5 8 5 was greater than that of ssp2 4 5 in each interdecadal period however the gap gradually increased from the 1950 s to the 1970 s and the runoff showed an increasing trend under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 at rates of 12 26 mm 10a and 25 11 mm 10a respectively it was found under the premise that the precipitation increased in each decadal period compared with baseline period the corresponding runoff decreased compared with the baseline period and it was not that the runoff of ssp5 8 5 was greater than that of ssp2 4 5 at any time to clarify the reasons for the decrease in runoff in the yrb in the future under the background of increased precipitation the percentage change in precipitation evaporation runoff in each interdecadal period compared to that in the baseline period was analyzed as shown in fig 6 the multi annual average daily precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff during the baseline period were 2 21 mm 1 14 mm and 1609 23 m3 s respectively additionally the multi annual average daily precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff during ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 2020 2099 were 2 33 mm 1 45 mm 1429 29 m3 s and 2 44 mm 1 52 mm and 1466 21 m3 s respectively the increasing rate of precipitation in the future was lower than that of evapotranspiration which led to an increase in precipitation but a decrease in runoff in the two future scenarios resulting in a shortage of water resources in the yrb compared with the baseline period in terms of percentage the maximum variation in precipitation under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 was 8 87 and 19 77 respectively but the variation in evapotranspiration was as high as 34 39 and 49 51 respectively and the interdecadal evaporation percentage was 3 16 times more than that of precipitation except for the 2030 s in addition there was no significant difference in the percentage of precipitation variation between the two scenarios in the 2040 s and 2060 s but the evapotranspiration of ssp5 8 5 was 1 91 and 5 18 more than that of ssp2 4 5 in 2040 s and 2060 s respectively which made the runoff of ssp2 4 5 more than that of ssp5 8 5 in the corresponding period the operation and benefits of large scale reservoirs on the yrb are affected by intra annual variation in runoff especially during the flood season and the non flood season therefore the runoff of the ertan reservoir which is regulated by cascade reservoirs was further sorted into monthly and seasonal scales to analyze the monthly natural runoff and regulated runoff in the future fig 7 shows that under the influence of global warming alone the monthly natural runoff obtained by the two scenarios was mainly reduced from june to september compared with the baseline period with the largest variation in july but the overall runoff still showed a bimodal structure in addition the runoff in the future dry season november to march of the next year will increase slightly compared with the baseline period and the spring autumn drought could be partially alleviated combined with reservoir operation and the impact of climate change on runoff the flood peak in july was greatly reduced and runoff increased from december to april in the dry season the four reservoirs in the yrb reduced runoff by 28 98 and 28 22 in the rainy season and increased runoff by 82 28 and 77 21 in the dry season under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively under the overall two scenarios the future runoff showed a decreasing trend from june to september and an increasing trend from october to march of the next year although there was a shortage of water resources in the future compared with the baseline period the intra annual distribution was more uniform according to the climate division of the four seasons in china the yrb is divided into spring from march to may summer from june to august autumn from september to november and winter from december to february of the following year the four season runoff under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios was calculated and the percentage variation compared with the baseline period was obtained as shown in fig 8 the variation in ertan runoff before reservoir operation compared with the baseline period showed a consistent trend in both scenarios before being adjusted by the reservoirs the runoff at ertan in the two scenarios increased in winter but decreased in the rest of the seasons the largest decrease was in summer with decreases of 22 92 ssp2 4 5 and 22 37 ssp5 8 5 under the dual impact of reservoirs and global climate change the spring runoff increased from 16 31 ssp2 4 5 and 11 23 ssp5 8 5 before the operation of the cascade reservoir group to 88 85 ssp2 4 5 and 93 25 ssp5 8 5 and the winter runoff increased from 13 97 ssp2 4 5 and 17 44 ssp5 8 5 to 78 91 ssp2 4 5 and 80 58 ssp5 8 5 respectively the two season runoff with abundant precipitation and water resources in summer and autumn was blocked by the reservoir to be discharged during the dry season of the year to achieve profitability 3 4 impacts of climate change on hydropower generation in yrb and energy in sichuan and chongqing provinces considering the jinping i jinping ii and guandi reservoirs were all put into operation in approximately 2013 while other reservoirs under construction were not put into operation we selected 2013 2019 as the historical period to investigate the actual hydropower generation in the past few years on this basis the historical power generation of the four reservoirs in the yrb was compared with the future power generation under the influence of global warming and reservoir operation according to the reservoir operation scheme the power generation of the ertan reservoir under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 was obtained as shown in fig 9 during the historical period of 2013 2019 according to the reservoir operation rules the average hydropower generation of the ertan reservoir was approximately 19 109 kw h h per year for ssp2 4 5 according to the actual operation rule the average hydropower generation of the ertan reservoir was expected to decrease by 1 26 109 kw h 2 19 109 kw h h 6 67 11 52 for ssp5 8 5 according to the actual operation rules the average hydropower generation of the ertan reservoir was expected to decrease by 0 71 109 kw h 2 07 109 kw h h 5 21 10 89 analysis of the other three reservoirs showed similar results to the ertan reservoir in addition the multi annual average total power generation of the four reservoirs in the yrb under different scenarios was calculated compared with the historical period the future total power generation of the two ssps was consistent with the overall runoff change in the basin specifically according to the actual operation rules under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp 5 8 5 scenarios the average hydropower generation of the yrb was estimated to be 63 2 109 kw h h and 64 9 109 kw h h and it was estimated that the multi annual average would decrease by 4 6 although the future runoff of the yrb was reduced compared with the baseline period it still has great hydropower potential in terms of the total amount of water resources and intra annual distribution the decrease in power generation may be due to the change in hydrological law which leads to the failure of the historical operation rule to be better applied to future runoff change therefore adaptive scheduling rules can be formulated according to the rules of future runoff according to the multi year data of the yalong river hydropower company among the existing power generation units in the basin the jin guan power generation unit sends power to sichuan jiangsu and chongqing and the ertan hydropower station sends power to sichuan and chongqing https www ehdc com cn gtylj index htm the specific power distribution and annual electricity consumption of each province are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 among them ertan sent power to chongqing at approximately 28 and sichuan at approximately 72 jin guan sent power to chongqing sichuan jiangsu at approximately 18 25 and 57 respectively fig 11 showed the power consumption of sichuan chongqing and jiangsu showed an increasing trend with annual average power consumption of 10 32 109 kw h 5 76 109 kw h and 22 92 109 kw h respectively while the power transmission from the yrb to sichuan chongqing and jiangsu accounted for 12 20 and 6 of their multi annual average power consumption 2013 2019 respectively the proportion of yrb hydropower in sichuan and chongqing was relatively high so the reduction of hydropower generation in the yrb due to climate change was bound to have a large impact on the energy of these two places according to the existing hydropower transmission ratio of yrb to each province it was estimated sichuan and chongqing will reduce by 1 66 109 kw h 1 43 109 kw h and 1 06 109 kw h 0 98 109 kw h respectively under the scenarios of ssp2 4 5 and ssp 5 8 5 in the future in view of the reduction in hydropower generation capacity in the yrb in the future we propose the following schemes 1 the yrb has not reached full capacity most of the time under actual operation rules so according to the evolution law of hydrological and meteorological conditions in the future the reservoir operation mode can be optimized to enhance the adaptability of the reservoir under climate change this method would reduce the adverse effects of climate change on reservoirs and give full play to the comprehensive benefits of reservoir operation 2 relevant research literature of zhang 2018 showed that although the correlation between photovoltaic output data and temperature data was low it generally showed a positive correlation trend therefore in combination with the future temperature increase and construction of clean energy base in the yrb relevant departments can vigorously develop clean energy such as photovoltaic power generation and use hydropower and solar energy to ensure energy supply and safety in the region in addition for the thermal power plants in the river basin the fuel could be converted into more efficient gas fired power plants with lower cooling water demand to reduce the water demand of the plants 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis of cmip6 in the projection and analysis of future climate change the biggest uncertainty comes from the model followed by various scenarios and the framework of the hydrological model among them the climate models although are constantly improving due to limitations in calculations and the chaotic characteristics of the climate system the current global climate models are still limited in their ability to simulate in the future which is the main reason for the great uncertainty of climate model therefore the selection of multi model was conducive to the accuracy of our final results and the robustness of the model although multi model selection and ensemble analysis is the mainstream processing method paltan et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 kim et al 2020 akinsanola et al 2020a akinsanola et al 2020b it is difficult to accurately quantify the uncertainty only through multi model ensemble mme set moreover in order to achieve accurate quantification more and more complex control experiments may be needed which may bring huge workload and is not mandatory in all similar studies therefore our goal is mainly to provide broad uncertainties to prove the reliability of the results obtained from mme according to relevant research of arnell 2003 runoff is more sensitive to precipitation than other factors so precipitation related indexes are mainly used as important factors in uncertainty analysis we processed the 10 selected models into annual average precipitation respectively and compared them with the annual average precipitation of the mme so as to show the model uncertainty caused by internal variability qualitatively as shown in fig 12 it can be seen that although the precipitation of each model presented an increasing trend of different magnitudes there was a large jump between adjacent years therefore the uncertainty fluctuation range of the 10 models was also relatively large and the uncertainty in the ssp5 8 5 scenario was greater than that of the ssp2 4 5 the annual precipitation after bayesian weighted ensemble was located between the upper and lower envelopes and the uncertainty was greatly reduced after the weighted ratio through the above uncertainty range panel and the final mme set it indicated that the uncertainty of our results was reduced compared with that before mme therefore our results can be considered to provide reliable information for future changes of water resources and hydropower in yrb 4 2 analysis of limitations in climate change projection the future climate change impact of any particular watershed is difficult to project and hydrological systems are not static model calibration with different hydrological historical conditions may produce differences in future projection results or may be unreliable however the scenario estimated in this paper is not far from the historical conditions used in the calibration and the maximum precipitation variability is 18 so the estimated result is reasonable silberstein et al 2012 our study used only one hydrological model to simulate the future runoff of the yrb mainly because there are many uncertain factors in future runoff simulations such as the structure and parameterization of the hydrological model and the structure and initial conditions of the gcm dams et al 2015a dams et al 2015b making it challenging to deal with and compare uncertainties from all factors however from the current research the uncertainty of the hydrological model is smaller than the uncertainty of the scenario silberstein et al 2012 dams et al 2015a dams et al 2015b in addition the upper reaches of the yrb are located on the qinghai tibetan plateau and are covered by a great deal of snow in winter however our study used the vic hydrological model to calibrate and validate the total runoff in the baseline period and has not yet verified the snowmelt module under the multi model ensemble both precipitation and runoff simulations will appear to be flattened but the actual future precipitation and runoff simulations inherently have largely uncertain factors an exact value cannot be obtained and the flattening of the peak will not have a decisive impact on the future trend thus we did not further address the possible flat phenomenon the 2015 paris climate agreement put forward the goal of controlling the temperature increase at 2 c and striving to control it at 1 5 c additionally the 2018 ipcc 1 5 c special report indicated that the 1 5 c warming target would be more conducive to the implementation of mitigation and adaptation policies therefore regional analysis for the special scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 c global warming is urgent and realistic the analysis of the special scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 c in the yrb will be the next step of research 5 conclusion the yrb is located in southwest china the numerous reservoirs and power stations in the basin constitute a complex engineering system that affects the safety of the power system in the southwest future changes in precipitation and runoff will play a decisive role in the hydropower of the yalong river and will affect the temporal and spatial allocation of water resources therefore it is imperative to analyze the future spatiotemporal changes in runoff and power generation in the yrb based on the latest perfected and improved cmip6 general circulation model under the background of increasingly frequent extreme climate therefore in the context of ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 we conducted hydrological hydropower projection and quantitative analysis on the yrb the third largest hydropower planning base on china s qinghai tibet plateau under the background of global warming based on the measured dataset bcsd statistical downscaling of cmip6 was performed and the future dataset of the bayesian multi model weighted set was constructed using the vic large scale distributed hydrological model unidirectionally coupled with the reservoir operation module to further project the future regulated runoff and hydropower the main conclusions are as follows in the context of global warming although the total amount of precipitation in the yrb will increase the natural runoff will decrease compared to the baseline period and the runoff will decrease during the rainy season and increase during the dry season however natural runoff still shows an increasing trend at the interdecadal scale the reduction in future runoff will lead to a downturn in hydropower generation that relies on natural runoff the yrb is expected to experience a loss of 4 6 of power generation under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in general our research results have guiding significance not only for the yrb but also for water resource management in other basins of the upper reaches of the yangtze river because the precipitation patterns and development grades of these basins are similar to those of the upper reaches of the yangtze river more importantly our climate impact assessment framework is generally sufficient to determine future changes in precipitation hydrology and hydropower under the combined effects of global warming and reservoir operation and can provide information for the integrated management of water resources in different climate regions around the world credit authorship contribution statement yinmao zhao conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review

3678,grey water footprint gwf is an indicator that converts the pollution loads to the equivalent freshwater volume in water footprint wf assessment the conventional application of gwf is to account the embedded water required for the assimilation of pollution loads discharged by production processes however this research highlights a deficiency in gwf accounting and proposes an integrated methodology to reinforce gwf to consider the regional environmental concerns in the wf of agricultural productions this methodology has three main consecutive steps first the soil and water assessment tool swat is used for basin simulation second the wfs of agricultural productions are assessed by the modeling outcomes and according to the conventional approach of gwf accounting in the third step an amendment is introduced in wf assessment for accounting the embedded freshwater required for environmental enhancement this amendment develops multiple pollutant gwf assessment and increases the wfs of agricultural productions in environmentally impaired basins this approach is verified in zrebar lake basin where farmlands are the main non point sources and the lake experiences eutrophication here the average wfs of rain fed and irrigated crops are increased 8 9 and 5 8 respectively by the developed methodology in addition the average ratio of gwf to wf of crops grows from 1 3 to 7 6 and the water pollution level increases more than 5 3 times in basin for wf sustainability assessment this enhancement in the quantification of gwf is mainly due to the fact that the majority of the gwf of crops in the study area is related to nitrogen pollution loads while phosphorous reduction is more critical for eutrophication control thus this approach enables the multiple pollutant gwf to consider the impacts of both pollution loads and ecological impairment in the wf of products this perspective can promote gwf as an environmental indicator and extend its application for decision making keywords agriculture eutrophication grey water footprint gwf swat water quality water management 1 introduction water footprint wf is the embodied freshwater volume consumed directly and indirectly in production processes this indicator includes blue green and grey components that can calculate the hidden water of agricultural productions with different perspectives hoekstra et al 2011 blue water footprint bwf is the water consumed by irrigation per production which is abstracted from groundwater or surface water and is not returned to the same basin water footprint network 2021 green water footprint gnwf is the precipitated water stored in soil consumed by plants and transpired hoekstra and chapagain 2006 in a recent review by lovarelli et al 2016 they concluded that most of the literature on wf assessment used only bwf and gnwf in their analysis in addition these two indicators are used for economic valuation and efficiency analysis of water systems bae and dall erba 2018 zhang et al 2019 or inter basin water transfer policies manshadi et al 2015 zhuo et al 2016 farmers can count on these two indicators for optimizing the cultivation patterns luan et al 2018 mojtabavi et al 2018 mubako 2018 they have also formed the main part of wf assessment for analyzing water security in times of climate change haida et al 2019 masud et al 2019 or regarding water food energy nexus lee et al 2018 xu et al 2019 the viewpoint of recent contributions implies that bwf and gnwf have evolved from water consumption indicators to decision making indicators however grey water footprint gwf is barely emphasized in the literature for wf assessment while it may similarly have the potential of development gwf is known as the equivalent volume of freshwater required for assimilating pollutants to meet specific water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 this definition is developed for reflecting the water quality issues in wf as contaminations have this potential to intensify the basin problems such as water scarcity and water allocation kariman et al 2017 pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016a equation 1 shows the conventional method cm of gwf assessment m3 ton 1 gwf 1 y max l c max c nat i where y is the production yield of crop or product ton ha l denotes the export pollution load ton ha of pollutant i discharged to the receiving water body cmax represents the maximum allowable concentration of the pollutant and cnat equals the concentration of the pollutant in the receiving water provided that the interferences of human activities are excluded here the assimilative capacity is the difference between cmax and cnat hoekstra et al 2011 in this equation max selects the highest ratio of pollution load to the assimilative capacity among different pollutants despite the strengths of gwf its conventional approach has some shortcomings that limit the application of this indicator gwf has two major shortcomings first it is unable to capture the impacts of environmental concerns or probable ecological impairments of basins where the production process is located quinteiro et al 2018 emphasized that a production process may change land use lu and impose long term environmental impacts in a basin likewise a manufacturer may put the ecosystem at risk through overexploitation of water from the basin these two cases can violate the minimum environmental flow of river and degrade its water quality lovarelli et al 2018 it can also result in reduced self purification potential of river and change the value of cnat liu et al 2016 these examples show that the wfs of products need to be different between the environmentally clean areas and polluted or ecologically impaired areas secondly cmax can be defined by the global standards or ambient water quality standards awqs the global standards cannot represent the local environmental conditions of basins on the contrary awqs can be set locally oriented by an integrated modeling that simulates the quality and quantity of receiving water bodies in different conditions chukalla et al 2018 thus awqs is variable from one basin to another as a matter of differences in lus and ecosystems monfared et al 2017 van vliet et al 2017 wu et al 2016 it can also be modified over time due to the variations of pollution mitigation policies feizi ashtiani et al 2015 incera et al 2017 as well as features and methods in census and monitoring zhao et al 2018 note that in areas nations with strict water quality standards cmax is determined closer to cnat and thus gwf increases in comparison with other areas nations without strict cmax regardless of emitted pollution loads or current environmental status if gwf is used as an index for sustainable production this increase makes a paradox choosing stricter water quality standards by monitoring organizations an environmental movement can adversely reflect the unsustainability of productions in comparison with other areas nation which may disgrace the productions this may mislead decision makers in trading the wfs of products captured by the conventional gwf assessment regarding these shortcomings the methodology of gwf accounting has been recently developed by jamshidi 2019 in order to consider the environmental impairment of rivers in gwf accordingly some amendments are introduced for accounting gwf in fish farming it is also emphasized that the application of integrated simulation tools is inevitable for awqs determination however the applicability of the developed methodology dm has been only verified in river systems for one specific aquatic product the question is whether it can be used for lake basins or for multiple agricultural productions or with different simulation tools for example the soil and water assessment tool swat is known as an integrated modeling tool for wf assessment on the basin scale where farmlands are the dominated lus ahmadzadeh et al 2016 jamshidi et al 2020 this study primarily aims to answer the aforementioned question and present a state of the art application for gwf as an environmental indicator for this purpose the swat model is used for basin simulation and crop wf assessment here the multiple pollutant gwf is calculated by both the conventional cm and developed methodology dm the comparative study explains how gwf enables accounting basin environmental problems in the wf assessment of agricultural productions note that the proposed methodology can be simply used in any cases nevertheless zrebar lake basin has been chosen as the study area for verification where eutrophication is its main ecological concern this basin has been previously modeled by imani et al 2017 we updated the swat model and used the calibrated results to extract data required for measuring the blue green and grey wfs of 10 agricultural productions the water footprint sustainability ws indicators are also evaluated for these crops to extend the application of the dm the results are subsequently discussed in different scenarios of standard limits and compared with the results of other studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology the methodology of this research has three consecutive steps as shown in fig 1 the first step focuses on basin simulation by the swat model as described in 2 2 the second step uses the outcomes of the swat model for the conventional wf accounting of crops as described in 2 3 finally this study uses the developed methodology dm to consider the environmental concerns in wf assessment as described in section 2 4 note that the methodology is thoroughly similar to jamshidi 2019 however it has three main differences first the swat model is used for basin simulation tool instead of qual2kw this is due to the fact that the study area is a lake basin where diffuse sources such as farmlands are the main lus accordingly the pollution loads evapotranspiration and yields of each crop are calculated secondly bwf gnwf and gwf of 10 agricultural productions are calculated third gwf is recalculated based on multiple pollutants of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp to address eutrophication as the main water quality impairment in the study area finally ws indicators are calculated for both the agricultural productions and the basin in which the application of developed gwf is discussed the presented methodology is verified in zrebar lake basin western iran the basin is rather small 90 km2 and is mainly covered with farmlands 20 km2 other lus of this area are pastures and oak trees 29 km2 and rural areas without wastewater treatment plants less than 1 km2 fig 2 b the water body and surrounding wetlands include the remaining area here the average temperature and precipitation are 13 2 c and 1050 mm respectively the application of manures nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers in this area for agriculture are 15000 kg ha 170 kg ha and 75 kg ha on average respectively these fertilizers can be partially washed out and nutrients are leached to the lake in addition nutrients can be discharged from pastures through sewage and sediments transported by the ghezelchesoo canal gzc upstream imani et al 2017 have previously used swat modeling to determine the impacts of best management practices bmps on agricultural discharges and nutrients concentrations of lake it was found that the nutrient content of lake can be reduced by farm management practices nevertheless the incomes of farmers are not sufficient to afford all of pollution abatement strategies as a result 60 reduction of tn and tp of lake was set as short term applicable waste load allocation wla strategy this ratio is used in this study to set the cmax of tn and tp awqs in the lake 2 2 setup and parameterization of simulation model 2 2 1 simulation the swat is a semi distributed model that uses topography and climate data soil properties and lus as inputs for basin simulation the required background dataset table 1 and the process of simulation calibration have followed the same method of imani et al 2017 here the simulation was carried out for a 14 year period 2000 2013 for 1100 hydrological response units hrus in 26 sub basins fig 2c the sensitivity analysis was also carried out by the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup developed by abbaspour et al 2007 it can reduce the time required for justifications in modeling the swat model uses complex processes of the water cycle on a basin scale as recently discussed by rivas tabares et al 2019 it also employs the nitrogen n and phosphor p cycles to consider the interactions of these pollutants in water soil and crops for example it considers the losses of organic n and p in the top layer of soil sediment yield and nitrate leaching in the form of runoff lateral flow and percolation imani et al 2019 thus the n cycles emphasized by hu et al 2018 for gwf assessment of agricultural productions are automatically addressed by the swat model in addition this integrated modeling approach satisfies the requirement for estimating the leaching runoff fractions for crops wf accounting franke et al 2013 martinez paz et al 2018 furthermore recent studies have verified that swat modeling is accurate in the simulation of basins with lack of data leh et al 2018 romagnoli et al 2017 2 2 2 calibration and validation the swat model is calibrated simultaneously based on inflow m3 s nitrate and phosphate concentrations mg l of the lake the observed data include daily data of inflow 2006 2013 in addition to daily or weekly nutrients sampled data of lake 2006 2007 2010 2013 however their monthly averages were used for calibration and validation by the swat cup fig 3 r2 rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr index and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are used to validate the calibration as shown in table 2 it should be noted that the lake is presented as a reservoir in the swat model its surface area changes in accordance with the inflow volume here an area volume curve was developed using the experimental data derived from the operation of primary and emergency spillways of the embankment dam in zrebar lake equation 2 it required a modification in the swat code to simulate the reservoir surface area as previously carried out by tegegne et al 2013 and imani et al 2017 2 sa 146 0 0068 v 0 0005 v 2 in which sa is the surface area of the water body ha and v is the volume of water in the reservoir m3 in the study area the rain fed rf crops are rf wheat rf barley rf pea and rf grape while the irrigated crops are wheat barley tomato tobacco alfalfa and apple these crops were introduced to the swat model whose effective parameters were adjusted table 3 the following steps are carried out for crop analysis 1 specify planting and harvesting dates of major crops in the model 2 adjust the parameters affecting actual evapotranspiration et and crop yields 3 simulate and calibrate et and the crops yield these two parameters were adjusted in simulation such that the average yields of crops fig 4 a and the average evapotranspiration of irrigated crops in wet years fig 4b were matched to the observed data reported by iranian ministry of agriculture table 1 here it is assumed that the average annual et for wet years equals to the maximum et as it is similarly recommended by ahmadzadeh et al 2016 2 3 conventional grey water footprint this study follows the standard method introduced by hoekstra et al 2011 and franke et al 2013 for the conventional wf accounting of crops in this step wf equation 3 is the aggregate of grey equation 1 green equation 4 and blue equation 5 wfs 3 wf g n w f b w f g w f 4 gnwf 10 et a y 5 bwf 10 e t b et a y 6 wf a w f y 0 01 7 gr gwf 100 wf in these equations gnwf bwf and gwf are green blue and grey wfs m3 ton respectively eta denotes the annually average evapotranspiration mm of the agricultural productions that only use precipitation and stored water in soil like rf crops etb represents the annually average evapotranspiration mm of crops that use irrigation with precipitation and soil moisture hoekstra et al 2011 these data have been derived from the 14 year simulation period by the swat model here number 10 converts the unit of wf to m3 ha wfa also restates the water footprint of agricultural productions per area m3 km2 where the role of production yield is removed equation 6 gr is also the ratio of gwf to wf in equation 7 2 4 developed grey water footprint this study introduces a new dimensionless coefficient in wf assessment λ for considering the environmental impairments of receiving water bodies thus equation 3 is altered to equation 8 as follows 8 wf g n w f b w f λ g w f 9 λ 1 i f ω 1 1 ω i f ω 1 10 ω m i n ω 1 q act q env ω 2 do act do std ω 3 n req o r p req n act o r p act ω 4 ec req ec act ω 5 mp req mp act where λ is the altering coefficient that can convert probable environmental damages ambient problems into equivalent embedded freshwater volume by multiplying gwf meanwhile it relies on ω as equation 9 which is also dimensionless ω classifies typical environmental damages in five categories and separately quantifies their impacts regarding the actual and required level of related parameters in the receiving water bodies ω1 to ω5 whenever any of these five indicators are calculated below 1 it means that kind of environmental impairment requires some embedded freshwater volume for recovery and rehabilitation this volume shows how severe the environment of productions is impaired and hence reflects it in their wfs in equation 10 ω is the minimum of these indicators which maximizes λ and intensifies gwf here the main five ecological concerns are 1 the minimum environmental flow e flow of rivers ω1 2 the minimum oxygen level required for the aquatic life ω2 3 eutrophication and algal bloom ω3 saline intrusion ω4 and eco toxicity ω5 which are defined as follows and as table 4 ω1 highlights the importance of minimum e flow in water resources this indicator evaluates the embedded freshwater required for enhancing the actual flow qact to the minimum required e flow in receiving water body qenv this indicator is indispensable in basins where the water body experiences over water allocations for agricultural and industrial productions unsustainable operation of dams or long term drought if the average river flow qact exceeds the annual e flow qenv at hotspots ω1 is not critical and can be neglected ω2 emphasizes the basic water quality condition for preserving the ecosystem in surface waters dostd is the minimum concentration of dissolved oxygen do required for the conservation of aquatic life it is usually assumed above 5 mg l in basins where the actual do doact degrades below dostd some embedded freshwater is required for enhancing doact to dostd level it means that crops and other productions in this basin should consider the lack of do in their wfs as an environmental impairment ω3 specifically points to the eutrophication problem of lakes reservoirs and estuaries in case a crop is produced in a lake basin with eutrophic conditions some embedded freshwater volume is required for virtual dilution of nutrients and water quality rehabilitation of lake thus the n and p concentrations of lake nact or pact should be abated by adding some embedded freshwater volume such that the trophic state of lake improves at least one level nreq or preq for instance the eutrophic condition of lake is enough to be improved from eutrophic to the mesotrophic condition in this condition the minimum n and p concentrations of the mesotrophic state are defined as nreq and preq respectively in ω3 ω4 points to the problem of saline intrusion in water resources this is a common phenomenon in coastal areas or aquifers under water stress the over pumping and extraction of groundwater for agricultural or industrial applications can cause salinity intrusion with the dm perspective some embedded freshwater volume should be virtually charged to groundwater to reduce the actual electro conductivity ecact to the required levels ecreq this indicator can be accounted in basins where crops are irrigated by groundwater with the risks of saline intrusion ω5 is attributed to the eco toxicity of water resources it points to the concentrations of toxins and micropollutants mps in the receiving water bodies mps may directly or indirectly cause health and ecological risks or remain for long term in the ecosystem different products manufactured by industries or agricultural crops may partially discharge toxic materials in the production processes such as heavy metals micro plastics or even pharmaceuticals to the water resources herrebrugh 2018 martínez alcalá et al 2018 thus it is recommended that some embedded freshwater volume should be allocated for these basins to virtually dilute the actual mps mpact below the limits that may expose health or environmental risks in the short or long run mpreq note that in all of the five aforementioned classifications an agricultural production may not discharge mps nutrients or it may not be even responsible for lack of do although the production process is not in charge of impaired environment it still requires considering ω in wf assessment this is due to the fact that these products have consumed the natural resources of a basin where the ecosystem is already impaired and needs recovery accordingly gwf can be promoted by the dm perspective as an environmental indicator zrebar lake is mainly impaired by eutrophication due to nutrient discharges among five classifications ω3 can be directly used for gwf assessment in this area however it does not mean other four classifications should not be used for wf assessment the dm recommends that whenever reliable data is available or environmental damages are observed more than one classification can be chosen for gwf assessment in this area there is lack of reliable data for mps ec is not a threat for the environment and do ranges between 4 4 and 7 mg l 2011 2013 which can be slightly ignored the e flow is satisfied and ω1 is also neglected as the lake is located in humid area without considerable effects of dams operation upstream therefore ω is calculated here based on one class only 2 5 water footprint sustainability assessment ws can be introduced as a supplementary environmental indicator in the wf assessment of agricultural productions this index estimates whether the current water uses wfs in basin assure the availability of water for future generations pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016b ws can assess the environmental sustainability of agricultural productions based on the three indicators of green water scarcity gnws blue water scarcity bws and water pollution level wpl these indicators are calculated by equations 11 12 13 respectively if these indicators are higher than 1 the use of wfs in the basin is unsustainable while in lower values than 1 the water availability would be enough to meet green blue or grey wfs 11 gnws g n w f y gnwa 12 bws b w f y bwa 13 wpl g w f y r act in these equations gnwa is the green water availability calculated by equation 14 bwa is the blue water availability calculated by equation 15 and ract is the actual streamflows in the basin during the same period of wf assessment it includes the aggregate of the natural runoff rnat and irrigation water withdrawal in which the discharges of wastewater treatment plants are excluded d ambrosio et al 2018 gnwf bwf gwf and y are defined earlier 14 gnwa et a et env et upd 15 bwa r nat q env here etenv is the evapotranspiration of ecologically protected areas or areas with ecological interests and etupd is the evapotranspiration of unproductive areas such as barelands or areas with poor soil quality for agricultural purposes rnat eta and qenv are defined previously all these parameters are generally calculated in the basin scale however for the ws assessment of agricultural productions based on the swat model this study recommends that gnwa can directly be derived from the model outcomes for each agricultural lu in addition the calculation basically lacks the soil moisture which should be added to equation 14 rnat can also be directly derived from the swat model according to the not irrigated scenario qenv is also estimated in this study by the montana method tennant 1976 3 results 3 1 swat modeling the simulation results in calibration validation period show that the tn concentration of zrebar lake grows from 2007 to 2013 while tp is rather constant fig 5 tn increases from 4 mg l to 9 mg l mainly due to the overconsumption of fertilizers in farmlands conversely tp is variable around 0 64 mg l which can arise from the agricultural sediment transport to the lake on average farmlands annually export 204 kgn ha and 3 7 kgp ha to the lake table 5 here the maximum nutrient loads discharged by agricultural lus are attributed to apple 536 2 kgn ha and tobacco 11 16 kgp ha respectively table 5 also shows that agricultural productions are rather different regarding the multiple pollutant discharged loads for example the p n ratio of discharges ranges between 0 0038 apple and 34 3 pea it implies that the gwf of agricultural productions can be variable according to the multiple pollutant assessment in addition the highest eta and etb are attributed to apple 472 mm and alfalfa 1204 mm respectively note that the rf crops such as peas grapes rf barley and rf wheat require no irrigation and therefore their eta equals etb as explained by hoekstra et al 2011 fig 5 illustrates that the zrebar lake contains high tn and tp concentrations which verifies eutrophication problem regarding the trophic state index tsi nouri et al 2010 thus the cmax of tn and tp in the lake is set as 3 5 mg l and 0 25 mg l respectively these concentrations are 60 less see section 2 1 than the simulated concentrations in 2013 fig 5 which were 9 mgn l nact and 0 64 mgp l pact note that cmax is set for short term awqs by considering the economic limitations of farm management practices imani et al 2017 the concentrations are ultimately required to be reduced to 3mgn l nreq and 0 1mgp l preq in long term where the tsi factor of lake promotes at least one level nouri et al 2010 cnat is also determined as 0 4 mgn l and 0 01 mgp l based on vollenweider data dodds and smith 2016 wetzel 2001 and the supporting guideline of gwf accounting franke et al 2013 according to these assumptions wfs are calculated for each crop in two approaches of cm and dm 3 2 water footprint assessment in order to quantify the impacts of developing grey water accounting the wfs of agricultural products are evaluated in two scenarios the wfs are initially assessed by the cm where no amendment is included in gwf and hence λ 1 afterwards the wfs are assessed by the dm taking eutrophication into account as an environmental impairment here λ is quantified by the proposed equations λ 1 according to the results of first step it can be realized that most crops are n related as gwfn is greater than gwfp table 6 in addition the conventional gwf includes a very small share of wf for all crops gr ranges between 0 2 tomato and 2 4 rf barley which is 1 3 on average it shows that the conventional gwf is rather insignificant for crops in comparison with bwf and gnwf thus gwf can hardly indicate the environmental problem of this area as it is limited and can be easily neglected in the second step ωn and ωp are calculated by equation 10 these parameters equal 0 33 and 0 156 as ω3 respectively as a result λ equals 6 4 equation 9 it means that λ is p related as p is more critical for environmental recovery in the study area ωp ωn while the gwfs of crops are n related according to their gwfn gwfn gwfp it points to the fact that the conventional gwf focuses only on pollution discharges while the new method also takes the environmental issues into account thus dm increases the average of gwfs and total wfs of crops in the study area from 34 m3 ton and 2907 5 m3 ton to 217 4 m3 ton and 3090 9 m3 ton respectively the average wfs of cereals rf crops and irrigated crops rise to about 10 7 8 9 and 5 8 respectively gr also ranges between 1 tomato and 13 6 rf barley the dm can increase the average gr from 1 3 λ 1 to 7 6 λ 1 the concept of correcting factor in the dm can be explained through an example the gwf of alfalfa increases from 23 7 m3 ton to 152 m3 ton by the dm it means that producing alfalfa would embed grey water of 23 7 m3 ton only if it was produced in an area with environmentally accepted conditions however it now requires extra 127 9 m3 ton of embedded grey water as it is cultivated in a lake basin with hyper eutrophic conditions this example implies that cultivating crops or manufacturing products in the vicinity of environmentally impaired lakes rivers and estuaries needs extra embedded freshwater in wf assessment this enhancement of crops wf in environmentally impaired areas can raise the awareness of producers and decision makers about the local ecological problems using this approach the applicability of gwf can be developed from a pollution discharge indicator to an environmental indicator this concept can also be interpreted by wfa which calculates the wf of agricultural productions per area as equation 6 the dm can increase the wfa of all agricultural productions in an environmentally impaired area as demonstrated in fig 6 here the average wfa of agricultural productions grows from 67 8 to 71 7 m3 km2 it means that in basins with ecological concerns or impaired environment any production requires some embedded freshwater unless the producers cooperate for the rehabilitation of surrounding environment this concept can be used for land use management and economic evaluation of projects 3 3 water footprint sustainability assessment the impact of the dm is also evaluated on the ws of agricultural productions in this basin table 7 shows that the dm increases the wpls of all agricultural productions in this basin with impaired environment nevertheless all the crops are reported as sustainable product according to their wpl 1 this table also illustrates that the gnws of all crops are less than 1 while the bws of irrigated crops are higher than 1 it means that this basin has theoretically available green and grey water for these crops in future generations whereas it lacks available water for irrigated crops as similarly highlighted by mekonnen and hoekstra 2020 in global scale it is noteworthy to say that these calculations are carried out according to the swat model outcomes for each lu in basin scale gnws bws and wpl are calculated as 0 74 0 26 and 0 16 with dm respectively by the cm wpl in the basin would be limited to 0 03 here the overall rnat ract and qenv for in basin are calculated about 13 5 13 8 and 3 5 mcm respectively by the swat model here the minimum qenv is 3 mcm by montana method 4 discussion in the recent decade studies for example by rodrigues et al 2014 or veettil and mishra 2016 have used bwf and gnwf as indicators of water scarcity and vulnerability at the basin level for integrated water management based on the results of this research gwf can now be similarly claimed as an environmental indicator at the basin level it can be used for integrated decision making for controlling pollution discharges regarding basin ecological background likewise d ambrosio et al 2020 have recently recommended gwf as a sustainability indicator on the basin scale although they accurately used the swat model for crop wf assessment the uncertainties were reported as the main challenge of gwf assessment uncertainties can originate from the input data water quality background and multiple pollutant assessment the latter is emphasized by de girolamo et al 2019 where the n related gwf revealed larger uncertainty than p related gwf of crops the method of regulating water quality standards can also impose additional uncertainties to gwf assessment table 8 re evaluates the average gwf of this research in scenarios with different cmax and creq s1 s3 here s1 quantifies gwf with different regulation strategies a c by the cm λ 1 both s2 and s3 consider the eutrophication problem of

concluded that the dm adds more complexity to gwf assessment by introducing creq nevertheless it can provide flexibility in standard regulations for example cmax is not necessarily required to be set environmentally ideal in basins this study recommends that cmax should be determined as locally oriented and practical strategy a if the basin has been damaged ecologically and requires rehabilitation as eutrophication the effects must separately be included in gwf of products by creq and λ this study recommends that the determination of cmax follows strategy a the eutrophication problem is then included in gwf by λ 6 4 s2a the latter accounts the embedded freshwater required for the water quality enhancement of zrebar lake for only one eutrophication class see the descriptions of equation 10 as such 9 m3 km2 would be the embedded freshwater required for achieving awqs s1a while 38 m3 km2 would be the remaining embedded freshwater required for basin ecological rehabilitation the aggregate is 47 m3 km2 s2a if the lake is required to be recovered two eutrophication classes creq can be set stricter as λ 18 3 s3a in this condition the total embedded freshwater required for simultaneously meeting the standard limits and basin ecological rehabilitation is 160 m3 km2 s3a the comparison between s1b and s3a shows that the embedded freshwater required for ideal environmental condition is far more reflected by the dm s3a 160 m3 km2 rather than cm s1b 25 m3 km2 gr also grows from 4 2 to 18 5 except s2a and s3a the other scenarios are not recommended as they ignore the problem of lake eutrophication s1 nor are the standard limits reachable or compatible with the basin characteristics s2b s2c s3b and s3c since nact and pact are modeled respectively as 9 and 0 64 mg l the cmax of strategy b may not be simply satisfied 85 reduction in short term or without imposing high costs to the diffuse pollution sources the cmax of strategy c also emphasizes p while n is drastically increasing in the basin as shown in fig 5 yet all these scenarios verify that gwf gr and the embedded freshwater can range significantly across different water quality regulation strategies table 8 shows that assuming different limits for cmax and creq have significant impacts on gr it may also turn the multiple pollutant gwf from n related to p related and vice versa in this study scenarios s2a and s3a gwfs of rf pea tobacco and tomato are p related 3 out of 10 while the others are n related the domination of n related gwf is similar to the results of chukalla et al 2018 however the results of pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2018 and de girolamo et al 2019 have shown that crops gwf are mostly p related this controversy can be justified by the standardization uncertainties it also implies that the multiple pollutant gwf of crops is regionally specific and depends on a set of variables for example aldaya et al 2020 have concluded that about 60 of n related gwf of diffuse sources originate from chemical fertilizers or from cereals changing the farming pattern may have impacts on the total gwf of basin likewise the current study shows that the gr of cereals wheat and barley is about 11 4 which is 2 2 times more than that of non cereal crops 5 1 gr has also been quantified between 7 8 s2a and 18 5 s3a in this study while it has been reported 4 by d ambrosio et al 2020 1 7 7 7 for 70 year assessment of irrigated crops by martínez paz et al 2018 20 in segura river basin south eastern spain pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2018 18 for cereals in iran ababaei and etedali 2017 or less than 15 globally by the reports published by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 furthermore in this study the gr of rf crops are calculated as 9 5 while this ratio is 6 4 for irrigated crops a similar trend has been reported by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 where the gr of rf crops is 10 4 while it is 9 1 for the irrigated crops however ababaei and etedali 2017 obtained this ratio as about 4 20 for rain fed and 17 35 for irrigated cereals this study also showed that the swat model outcomes can be used for the ws assessment of agricultural productions for each lu and for basin the capabilities of this complex model can facilitate these calculations d ambrosio et al 2020 used the swat model outcomes for annual ws assessment in river basin they concluded that this integrated model can provide the main inputs required for both wf and ws assessment jamshidi et al 2020 showed that water quality calibration by the concentrations of pollutants in the reservoir as a checkpoint can present reliable inputs for wf assessment this conclusion can be extended for ws assessment through the current research the swat model simulates surface and groundwater flows and their interactions uses complex hydrological and nutrient cycles considers return flows and interbasin transfers and can be calibrated in both runoffs and hotspots imani et al 2019 2017 these advantages reduce the estimations required for ws assessment however some recommendations are 1 bwa can be calculated by the etb overall evapotranspiration from precipitation irrigation and soil moisture multiplied by area and subtracted by gnwa instead of estimating rnat and qenv as verified by abbasi et al 2020 2 the soil moisture should be added to eta not irrigated scenario for accounting gnwa and 3 the dm should be used for accounting wpl instead of the cm the dm includes the environmental status in both wf and ws assessment here the wpl of basin is 0 03 by the cm while it is 0 16 by the dm the wpl based on the cm 0 03 is not an appropriate indicator to show the sustainability of zrebar lake as it currently encounters high eutrophication level this controversy can be decreased by the dm and is recommended in further studies it should be noted that the dm includes the main environmental status of area within the gwf of products for better decision making while wpl introduces an extra index for wfs to show their sustainability in a period accordingly the bwfs of irrigated crops in zrebar lake basin particularly apple tomato and alfalfa are pointed as unsustainable bws 1 while the gnwf and gwf of all crops are sustainable gnws 1 wpl 1 low wpl is one example implies that ws assessment may cause misinterpretation about the environmental impairment in basins 5 conclusions this study verified that the dm can be used for wf assessment of agricultural productions it also found that the applicability of the dm is not limited to a certain case product or even simulation tool nonetheless the swat model is recommended for crops wf and ws assessment as it provides the required data on the basin scale furthermore this research concludes that the dm introduces a new application for gwf it is promoted from a pollution discharge calculator to an environmental indicator that can also regionally reflect the status of impaired environment in the wfs of products the impacts of pollution loads emissions and the local environmental status ambient are accumulated in the dm for the quantification of multiple pollutant gwf this advantage has been highlighted in this study as tp becomes critical for controlling eutrophication ambient based despite the fact that crops gwfs are n related emission based thus the equivalent embedded freshwater required for environmental rehabilitation is separately quantified by the dm in addition to the embedded freshwater required for water quality assimilation cm this approach increases the insignificant gr values in regions where λ 1 and increases the wpl of environmentally impaired basin to become a more real index for sustainability assessment it was comprehensively discussed that the quantification of gwf relies on water quality standard regulations and policies which can increase the uncertainties dm is recommended to be used in further evaluations with respect to its possible impacts on the estimated values of the wfs and wss of products this approach may motivate cmax selection more regionally and add possible environmental impairments by this perspective therefore more research can evaluate this point of view and also consider the impacts of bmps critical source areas csas water recycling and reuse and the uncertainties originating from local regulations and wla credit authorship contribution

3678,grey water footprint gwf is an indicator that converts the pollution loads to the equivalent freshwater volume in water footprint wf assessment the conventional application of gwf is to account the embedded water required for the assimilation of pollution loads discharged by production processes however this research highlights a deficiency in gwf accounting and proposes an integrated methodology to reinforce gwf to consider the regional environmental concerns in the wf of agricultural productions this methodology has three main consecutive steps first the soil and water assessment tool swat is used for basin simulation second the wfs of agricultural productions are assessed by the modeling outcomes and according to the conventional approach of gwf accounting in the third step an amendment is introduced in wf assessment for accounting the embedded freshwater required for environmental enhancement this amendment develops multiple pollutant gwf assessment and increases the wfs of agricultural productions in environmentally impaired basins this approach is verified in zrebar lake basin where farmlands are the main non point sources and the lake experiences eutrophication here the average wfs of rain fed and irrigated crops are increased 8 9 and 5 8 respectively by the developed methodology in addition the average ratio of gwf to wf of crops grows from 1 3 to 7 6 and the water pollution level increases more than 5 3 times in basin for wf sustainability assessment this enhancement in the quantification of gwf is mainly due to the fact that the majority of the gwf of crops in the study area is related to nitrogen pollution loads while phosphorous reduction is more critical for eutrophication control thus this approach enables the multiple pollutant gwf to consider the impacts of both pollution loads and ecological impairment in the wf of products this perspective can promote gwf as an environmental indicator and extend its application for decision making keywords agriculture eutrophication grey water footprint gwf swat water quality water management 1 introduction water footprint wf is the embodied freshwater volume consumed directly and indirectly in production processes this indicator includes blue green and grey components that can calculate the hidden water of agricultural productions with different perspectives hoekstra et al 2011 blue water footprint bwf is the water consumed by irrigation per production which is abstracted from groundwater or surface water and is not returned to the same basin water footprint network 2021 green water footprint gnwf is the precipitated water stored in soil consumed by plants and transpired hoekstra and chapagain 2006 in a recent review by lovarelli et al 2016 they concluded that most of the literature on wf assessment used only bwf and gnwf in their analysis in addition these two indicators are used for economic valuation and efficiency analysis of water systems bae and dall erba 2018 zhang et al 2019 or inter basin water transfer policies manshadi et al 2015 zhuo et al 2016 farmers can count on these two indicators for optimizing the cultivation patterns luan et al 2018 mojtabavi et al 2018 mubako 2018 they have also formed the main part of wf assessment for analyzing water security in times of climate change haida et al 2019 masud et al 2019 or regarding water food energy nexus lee et al 2018 xu et al 2019 the viewpoint of recent contributions implies that bwf and gnwf have evolved from water consumption indicators to decision making indicators however grey water footprint gwf is barely emphasized in the literature for wf assessment while it may similarly have the potential of development gwf is known as the equivalent volume of freshwater required for assimilating pollutants to meet specific water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 this definition is developed for reflecting the water quality issues in wf as contaminations have this potential to intensify the basin problems such as water scarcity and water allocation kariman et al 2017 pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016a equation 1 shows the conventional method cm of gwf assessment m3 ton 1 gwf 1 y max l c max c nat i where y is the production yield of crop or product ton ha l denotes the export pollution load ton ha of pollutant i discharged to the receiving water body cmax represents the maximum allowable concentration of the pollutant and cnat equals the concentration of the pollutant in the receiving water provided that the interferences of human activities are excluded here the assimilative capacity is the difference between cmax and cnat hoekstra et al 2011 in this equation max selects the highest ratio of pollution load to the assimilative capacity among different pollutants despite the strengths of gwf its conventional approach has some shortcomings that limit the application of this indicator gwf has two major shortcomings first it is unable to capture the impacts of environmental concerns or probable ecological impairments of basins where the production process is located quinteiro et al 2018 emphasized that a production process may change land use lu and impose long term environmental impacts in a basin likewise a manufacturer may put the ecosystem at risk through overexploitation of water from the basin these two cases can violate the minimum environmental flow of river and degrade its water quality lovarelli et al 2018 it can also result in reduced self purification potential of river and change the value of cnat liu et al 2016 these examples show that the wfs of products need to be different between the environmentally clean areas and polluted or ecologically impaired areas secondly cmax can be defined by the global standards or ambient water quality standards awqs the global standards cannot represent the local environmental conditions of basins on the contrary awqs can be set locally oriented by an integrated modeling that simulates the quality and quantity of receiving water bodies in different conditions chukalla et al 2018 thus awqs is variable from one basin to another as a matter of differences in lus and ecosystems monfared et al 2017 van vliet et al 2017 wu et al 2016 it can also be modified over time due to the variations of pollution mitigation policies feizi ashtiani et al 2015 incera et al 2017 as well as features and methods in census and monitoring zhao et al 2018 note that in areas nations with strict water quality standards cmax is determined closer to cnat and thus gwf increases in comparison with other areas nations without strict cmax regardless of emitted pollution loads or current environmental status if gwf is used as an index for sustainable production this increase makes a paradox choosing stricter water quality standards by monitoring organizations an environmental movement can adversely reflect the unsustainability of productions in comparison with other areas nation which may disgrace the productions this may mislead decision makers in trading the wfs of products captured by the conventional gwf assessment regarding these shortcomings the methodology of gwf accounting has been recently developed by jamshidi 2019 in order to consider the environmental impairment of rivers in gwf accordingly some amendments are introduced for accounting gwf in fish farming it is also emphasized that the application of integrated simulation tools is inevitable for awqs determination however the applicability of the developed methodology dm has been only verified in river systems for one specific aquatic product the question is whether it can be used for lake basins or for multiple agricultural productions or with different simulation tools for example the soil and water assessment tool swat is known as an integrated modeling tool for wf assessment on the basin scale where farmlands are the dominated lus ahmadzadeh et al 2016 jamshidi et al 2020 this study primarily aims to answer the aforementioned question and present a state of the art application for gwf as an environmental indicator for this purpose the swat model is used for basin simulation and crop wf assessment here the multiple pollutant gwf is calculated by both the conventional cm and developed methodology dm the comparative study explains how gwf enables accounting basin environmental problems in the wf assessment of agricultural productions note that the proposed methodology can be simply used in any cases nevertheless zrebar lake basin has been chosen as the study area for verification where eutrophication is its main ecological concern this basin has been previously modeled by imani et al 2017 we updated the swat model and used the calibrated results to extract data required for measuring the blue green and grey wfs of 10 agricultural productions the water footprint sustainability ws indicators are also evaluated for these crops to extend the application of the dm the results are subsequently discussed in different scenarios of standard limits and compared with the results of other studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology the methodology of this research has three consecutive steps as shown in fig 1 the first step focuses on basin simulation by the swat model as described in 2 2 the second step uses the outcomes of the swat model for the conventional wf accounting of crops as described in 2 3 finally this study uses the developed methodology dm to consider the environmental concerns in wf assessment as described in section 2 4 note that the methodology is thoroughly similar to jamshidi 2019 however it has three main differences first the swat model is used for basin simulation tool instead of qual2kw this is due to the fact that the study area is a lake basin where diffuse sources such as farmlands are the main lus accordingly the pollution loads evapotranspiration and yields of each crop are calculated secondly bwf gnwf and gwf of 10 agricultural productions are calculated third gwf is recalculated based on multiple pollutants of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp to address eutrophication as the main water quality impairment in the study area finally ws indicators are calculated for both the agricultural productions and the basin in which the application of developed gwf is discussed the presented methodology is verified in zrebar lake basin western iran the basin is rather small 90 km2 and is mainly covered with farmlands 20 km2 other lus of this area are pastures and oak trees 29 km2 and rural areas without wastewater treatment plants less than 1 km2 fig 2 b the water body and surrounding wetlands include the remaining area here the average temperature and precipitation are 13 2 c and 1050 mm respectively the application of manures nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers in this area for agriculture are 15000 kg ha 170 kg ha and 75 kg ha on average respectively these fertilizers can be partially washed out and nutrients are leached to the lake in addition nutrients can be discharged from pastures through sewage and sediments transported by the ghezelchesoo canal gzc upstream imani et al 2017 have previously used swat modeling to determine the impacts of best management practices bmps on agricultural discharges and nutrients concentrations of lake it was found that the nutrient content of lake can be reduced by farm management practices nevertheless the incomes of farmers are not sufficient to afford all of pollution abatement strategies as a result 60 reduction of tn and tp of lake was set as short term applicable waste load allocation wla strategy this ratio is used in this study to set the cmax of tn and tp awqs in the lake 2 2 setup and parameterization of simulation model 2 2 1 simulation the swat is a semi distributed model that uses topography and climate data soil properties and lus as inputs for basin simulation the required background dataset table 1 and the process of simulation calibration have followed the same method of imani et al 2017 here the simulation was carried out for a 14 year period 2000 2013 for 1100 hydrological response units hrus in 26 sub basins fig 2c the sensitivity analysis was also carried out by the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup developed by abbaspour et al 2007 it can reduce the time required for justifications in modeling the swat model uses complex processes of the water cycle on a basin scale as recently discussed by rivas tabares et al 2019 it also employs the nitrogen n and phosphor p cycles to consider the interactions of these pollutants in water soil and crops for example it considers the losses of organic n and p in the top layer of soil sediment yield and nitrate leaching in the form of runoff lateral flow and percolation imani et al 2019 thus the n cycles emphasized by hu et al 2018 for gwf assessment of agricultural productions are automatically addressed by the swat model in addition this integrated modeling approach satisfies the requirement for estimating the leaching runoff fractions for crops wf accounting franke et al 2013 martinez paz et al 2018 furthermore recent studies have verified that swat modeling is accurate in the simulation of basins with lack of data leh et al 2018 romagnoli et al 2017 2 2 2 calibration and validation the swat model is calibrated simultaneously based on inflow m3 s nitrate and phosphate concentrations mg l of the lake the observed data include daily data of inflow 2006 2013 in addition to daily or weekly nutrients sampled data of lake 2006 2007 2010 2013 however their monthly averages were used for calibration and validation by the swat cup fig 3 r2 rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr index and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are used to validate the calibration as shown in table 2 it should be noted that the lake is presented as a reservoir in the swat model its surface area changes in accordance with the inflow volume here an area volume curve was developed using the experimental data derived from the operation of primary and emergency spillways of the embankment dam in zrebar lake equation 2 it required a modification in the swat code to simulate the reservoir surface area as previously carried out by tegegne et al 2013 and imani et al 2017 2 sa 146 0 0068 v 0 0005 v 2 in which sa is the surface area of the water body ha and v is the volume of water in the reservoir m3 in the study area the rain fed rf crops are rf wheat rf barley rf pea and rf grape while the irrigated crops are wheat barley tomato tobacco alfalfa and apple these crops were introduced to the swat model whose effective parameters were adjusted table 3 the following steps are carried out for crop analysis 1 specify planting and harvesting dates of major crops in the model 2 adjust the parameters affecting actual evapotranspiration et and crop yields 3 simulate and calibrate et and the crops yield these two parameters were adjusted in simulation such that the average yields of crops fig 4 a and the average evapotranspiration of irrigated crops in wet years fig 4b were matched to the observed data reported by iranian ministry of agriculture table 1 here it is assumed that the average annual et for wet years equals to the maximum et as it is similarly recommended by ahmadzadeh et al 2016 2 3 conventional grey water footprint this study follows the standard method introduced by hoekstra et al 2011 and franke et al 2013 for the conventional wf accounting of crops in this step wf equation 3 is the aggregate of grey equation 1 green equation 4 and blue equation 5 wfs 3 wf g n w f b w f g w f 4 gnwf 10 et a y 5 bwf 10 e t b et a y 6 wf a w f y 0 01 7 gr gwf 100 wf in these equations gnwf bwf and gwf are green blue and grey wfs m3 ton respectively eta denotes the annually average evapotranspiration mm of the agricultural productions that only use precipitation and stored water in soil like rf crops etb represents the annually average evapotranspiration mm of crops that use irrigation with precipitation and soil moisture hoekstra et al 2011 these data have been derived from the 14 year simulation period by the swat model here number 10 converts the unit of wf to m3 ha wfa also restates the water footprint of agricultural productions per area m3 km2 where the role of production yield is removed equation 6 gr is also the ratio of gwf to wf in equation 7 2 4 developed grey water footprint this study introduces a new dimensionless coefficient in wf assessment λ for considering the environmental impairments of receiving water bodies thus equation 3 is altered to equation 8 as follows 8 wf g n w f b w f λ g w f 9 λ 1 i f ω 1 1 ω i f ω 1 10 ω m i n ω 1 q act q env ω 2 do act do std ω 3 n req o r p req n act o r p act ω 4 ec req ec act ω 5 mp req mp act where λ is the altering coefficient that can convert probable environmental damages ambient problems into equivalent embedded freshwater volume by multiplying gwf meanwhile it relies on ω as equation 9 which is also dimensionless ω classifies typical environmental damages in five categories and separately quantifies their impacts regarding the actual and required level of related parameters in the receiving water bodies ω1 to ω5 whenever any of these five indicators are calculated below 1 it means that kind of environmental impairment requires some embedded freshwater volume for recovery and rehabilitation this volume shows how severe the environment of productions is impaired and hence reflects it in their wfs in equation 10 ω is the minimum of these indicators which maximizes λ and intensifies gwf here the main five ecological concerns are 1 the minimum environmental flow e flow of rivers ω1 2 the minimum oxygen level required for the aquatic life ω2 3 eutrophication and algal bloom ω3 saline intrusion ω4 and eco toxicity ω5 which are defined as follows and as table 4 ω1 highlights the importance of minimum e flow in water resources this indicator evaluates the embedded freshwater required for enhancing the actual flow qact to the minimum required e flow in receiving water body qenv this indicator is indispensable in basins where the water body experiences over water allocations for agricultural and industrial productions unsustainable operation of dams or long term drought if the average river flow qact exceeds the annual e flow qenv at hotspots ω1 is not critical and can be neglected ω2 emphasizes the basic water quality condition for preserving the ecosystem in surface waters dostd is the minimum concentration of dissolved oxygen do required for the conservation of aquatic life it is usually assumed above 5 mg l in basins where the actual do doact degrades below dostd some embedded freshwater is required for enhancing doact to dostd level it means that crops and other productions in this basin should consider the lack of do in their wfs as an environmental impairment ω3 specifically points to the eutrophication problem of lakes reservoirs and estuaries in case a crop is produced in a lake basin with eutrophic conditions some embedded freshwater volume is required for virtual dilution of nutrients and water quality rehabilitation of lake thus the n and p concentrations of lake nact or pact should be abated by adding some embedded freshwater volume such that the trophic state of lake improves at least one level nreq or preq for instance the eutrophic condition of lake is enough to be improved from eutrophic to the mesotrophic condition in this condition the minimum n and p concentrations of the mesotrophic state are defined as nreq and preq respectively in ω3 ω4 points to the problem of saline intrusion in water resources this is a common phenomenon in coastal areas or aquifers under water stress the over pumping and extraction of groundwater for agricultural or industrial applications can cause salinity intrusion with the dm perspective some embedded freshwater volume should be virtually charged to groundwater to reduce the actual electro conductivity ecact to the required levels ecreq this indicator can be accounted in basins where crops are irrigated by groundwater with the risks of saline intrusion ω5 is attributed to the eco toxicity of water resources it points to the concentrations of toxins and micropollutants mps in the receiving water bodies mps may directly or indirectly cause health and ecological risks or remain for long term in the ecosystem different products manufactured by industries or agricultural crops may partially discharge toxic materials in the production processes such as heavy metals micro plastics or even pharmaceuticals to the water resources herrebrugh 2018 martínez alcalá et al 2018 thus it is recommended that some embedded freshwater volume should be allocated for these basins to virtually dilute the actual mps mpact below the limits that may expose health or environmental risks in the short or long run mpreq note that in all of the five aforementioned classifications an agricultural production may not discharge mps nutrients or it may not be even responsible for lack of do although the production process is not in charge of impaired environment it still requires considering ω in wf assessment this is due to the fact that these products have consumed the natural resources of a basin where the ecosystem is already impaired and needs recovery accordingly gwf can be promoted by the dm perspective as an environmental indicator zrebar lake is mainly impaired by eutrophication due to nutrient discharges among five classifications ω3 can be directly used for gwf assessment in this area however it does not mean other four classifications should not be used for wf assessment the dm recommends that whenever reliable data is available or environmental damages are observed more than one classification can be chosen for gwf assessment in this area there is lack of reliable data for mps ec is not a threat for the environment and do ranges between 4 4 and 7 mg l 2011 2013 which can be slightly ignored the e flow is satisfied and ω1 is also neglected as the lake is located in humid area without considerable effects of dams operation upstream therefore ω is calculated here based on one class only 2 5 water footprint sustainability assessment ws can be introduced as a supplementary environmental indicator in the wf assessment of agricultural productions this index estimates whether the current water uses wfs in basin assure the availability of water for future generations pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016b ws can assess the environmental sustainability of agricultural productions based on the three indicators of green water scarcity gnws blue water scarcity bws and water pollution level wpl these indicators are calculated by equations 11 12 13 respectively if these indicators are higher than 1 the use of wfs in the basin is unsustainable while in lower values than 1 the water availability would be enough to meet green blue or grey wfs 11 gnws g n w f y gnwa 12 bws b w f y bwa 13 wpl g w f y r act in these equations gnwa is the green water availability calculated by equation 14 bwa is the blue water availability calculated by equation 15 and ract is the actual streamflows in the basin during the same period of wf assessment it includes the aggregate of the natural runoff rnat and irrigation water withdrawal in which the discharges of wastewater treatment plants are excluded d ambrosio et al 2018 gnwf bwf gwf and y are defined earlier 14 gnwa et a et env et upd 15 bwa r nat q env here etenv is the evapotranspiration of ecologically protected areas or areas with ecological interests and etupd is the evapotranspiration of unproductive areas such as barelands or areas with poor soil quality for agricultural purposes rnat eta and qenv are defined previously all these parameters are generally calculated in the basin scale however for the ws assessment of agricultural productions based on the swat model this study recommends that gnwa can directly be derived from the model outcomes for each agricultural lu in addition the calculation basically lacks the soil moisture which should be added to equation 14 rnat can also be directly derived from the swat model according to the not irrigated scenario qenv is also estimated in this study by the montana method tennant 1976 3 results 3 1 swat modeling the simulation results in calibration validation period show that the tn concentration of zrebar lake grows from 2007 to 2013 while tp is rather constant fig 5 tn increases from 4 mg l to 9 mg l mainly due to the overconsumption of fertilizers in farmlands conversely tp is variable around 0 64 mg l which can arise from the agricultural sediment transport to the lake on average farmlands annually export 204 kgn ha and 3 7 kgp ha to the lake table 5 here the maximum nutrient loads discharged by agricultural lus are attributed to apple 536 2 kgn ha and tobacco 11 16 kgp ha respectively table 5 also shows that agricultural productions are rather different regarding the multiple pollutant discharged loads for example the p n ratio of discharges ranges between 0 0038 apple and 34 3 pea it implies that the gwf of agricultural productions can be variable according to the multiple pollutant assessment in addition the highest eta and etb are attributed to apple 472 mm and alfalfa 1204 mm respectively note that the rf crops such as peas grapes rf barley and rf wheat require no irrigation and therefore their eta equals etb as explained by hoekstra et al 2011 fig 5 illustrates that the zrebar lake contains high tn and tp concentrations which verifies eutrophication problem regarding the trophic state index tsi nouri et al 2010 thus the cmax of tn and tp in the lake is set as 3 5 mg l and 0 25 mg l respectively these concentrations are 60 less see section 2 1 than the simulated concentrations in 2013 fig 5 which were 9 mgn l nact and 0 64 mgp l pact note that cmax is set for short term awqs by considering the economic limitations of farm management practices imani et al 2017 the concentrations are ultimately required to be reduced to 3mgn l nreq and 0 1mgp l preq in long term where the tsi factor of lake promotes at least one level nouri et al 2010 cnat is also determined as 0 4 mgn l and 0 01 mgp l based on vollenweider data dodds and smith 2016 wetzel 2001 and the supporting guideline of gwf accounting franke et al 2013 according to these assumptions wfs are calculated for each crop in two approaches of cm and dm 3 2 water footprint assessment in order to quantify the impacts of developing grey water accounting the wfs of agricultural products are evaluated in two scenarios the wfs are initially assessed by the cm where no amendment is included in gwf and hence λ 1 afterwards the wfs are assessed by the dm taking eutrophication into account as an environmental impairment here λ is quantified by the proposed equations λ 1 according to the results of first step it can be realized that most crops are n related as gwfn is greater than gwfp table 6 in addition the conventional gwf includes a very small share of wf for all crops gr ranges between 0 2 tomato and 2 4 rf barley which is 1 3 on average it shows that the conventional gwf is rather insignificant for crops in comparison with bwf and gnwf thus gwf can hardly indicate the environmental problem of this area as it is limited and can be easily neglected in the second step ωn and ωp are calculated by equation 10 these parameters equal 0 33 and 0 156 as ω3 respectively as a result λ equals 6 4 equation 9 it means that λ is p related as p is more critical for environmental recovery in the study area ωp ωn while the gwfs of crops are n related according to their gwfn gwfn gwfp it points to the fact that the conventional gwf focuses only on pollution discharges while the new method also takes the environmental issues into account thus dm increases the average of gwfs and total wfs of crops in the study area from 34 m3 ton and 2907 5 m3 ton to 217 4 m3 ton and 3090 9 m3 ton respectively the average wfs of cereals rf crops and irrigated crops rise to about 10 7 8 9 and 5 8 respectively gr also ranges between 1 tomato and 13 6 rf barley the dm can increase the average gr from 1 3 λ 1 to 7 6 λ 1 the concept of correcting factor in the dm can be explained through an example the gwf of alfalfa increases from 23 7 m3 ton to 152 m3 ton by the dm it means that producing alfalfa would embed grey water of 23 7 m3 ton only if it was produced in an area with environmentally accepted conditions however it now requires extra 127 9 m3 ton of embedded grey water as it is cultivated in a lake basin with hyper eutrophic conditions this example implies that cultivating crops or manufacturing products in the vicinity of environmentally impaired lakes rivers and estuaries needs extra embedded freshwater in wf assessment this enhancement of crops wf in environmentally impaired areas can raise the awareness of producers and decision makers about the local ecological problems using this approach the applicability of gwf can be developed from a pollution discharge indicator to an environmental indicator this concept can also be interpreted by wfa which calculates the wf of agricultural productions per area as equation 6 the dm can increase the wfa of all agricultural productions in an environmentally impaired area as demonstrated in fig 6 here the average wfa of agricultural productions grows from 67 8 to 71 7 m3 km2 it means that in basins with ecological concerns or impaired environment any production requires some embedded freshwater unless the producers cooperate for the rehabilitation of surrounding environment this concept can be used for land use management and economic evaluation of projects 3 3 water footprint sustainability assessment the impact of the dm is also evaluated on the ws of agricultural productions in this basin table 7 shows that the dm increases the wpls of all agricultural productions in this basin with impaired environment nevertheless all the crops are reported as sustainable product according to their wpl 1 this table also illustrates that the gnws of all crops are less than 1 while the bws of irrigated crops are higher than 1 it means that this basin has theoretically available green and grey water for these crops in future generations whereas it lacks available water for irrigated crops as similarly highlighted by mekonnen and hoekstra 2020 in global scale it is noteworthy to say that these calculations are carried out according to the swat model outcomes for each lu in basin scale gnws bws and wpl are calculated as 0 74 0 26 and 0 16 with dm respectively by the cm wpl in the basin would be limited to 0 03 here the overall rnat ract and qenv for in basin are calculated about 13 5 13 8 and 3 5 mcm respectively by the swat model here the minimum qenv is 3 mcm by montana method 4 discussion in the recent decade studies for example by rodrigues et al 2014 or veettil and mishra 2016 have used bwf and gnwf as indicators of water scarcity and vulnerability at the basin level for integrated water management based on the results of this research gwf can now be similarly claimed as an environmental indicator at the basin level it can be used for integrated decision making for controlling pollution discharges regarding basin ecological background likewise d ambrosio et al 2020 have recently recommended gwf as a sustainability indicator on the basin scale although they accurately used the swat model for crop wf assessment the uncertainties were reported as the main challenge of gwf assessment uncertainties can originate from the input data water quality background and multiple pollutant assessment the latter is emphasized by de girolamo et al 2019 where the n related gwf revealed larger uncertainty than p related gwf of crops the method of regulating water quality standards can also impose additional uncertainties to gwf assessment table 8 re evaluates the average gwf of this research in scenarios with different cmax and creq s1 s3 here s1 quantifies gwf with different regulation strategies a c by the cm λ 1 both s2 and s3 consider the eutrophication problem of basin regarding the dm λ 1 however s3 applies stricter limits creq for lake rehabilitation in these scenarios cmax is derived by three strategies a awqs 3 5mgn l 0 25mgp l b maximum limits required for mesotrophic conditions of the lake 1 5mgn l 0 035mgp l and c limits of eutrophic conditions of the lake 6mgn l 0 1mgp l istvánovics 2009 wetzel 2001 based on the comparative data table 8 it can be concluded that the dm adds more complexity to gwf assessment by introducing creq nevertheless it can provide flexibility in standard regulations for example cmax is not necessarily required to be set environmentally ideal in basins this study recommends that cmax should be determined as locally oriented and practical strategy a if the basin has been damaged ecologically and requires rehabilitation as eutrophication the effects must separately be included in gwf of products by creq and λ this study recommends that the determination of cmax follows strategy a the eutrophication problem is then included in gwf by λ 6 4 s2a the latter accounts the embedded freshwater required for the water quality enhancement of zrebar lake for only one eutrophication class see the descriptions of equation 10 as such 9 m3 km2 would be the embedded freshwater required for achieving awqs s1a while 38 m3 km2 would be the remaining embedded freshwater required for basin ecological rehabilitation the aggregate is 47 m3 km2 s2a if the lake is required to be recovered two eutrophication classes creq can be set stricter as λ 18 3 s3a in this condition the total embedded freshwater required for simultaneously meeting the standard limits and basin ecological rehabilitation is 160 m3 km2 s3a the comparison between s1b and s3a shows that the embedded freshwater required for ideal environmental condition is far more reflected by the dm s3a 160 m3 km2 rather than cm s1b 25 m3 km2 gr also grows from 4 2 to 18 5 except s2a and s3a the other scenarios are not recommended as they ignore the problem of lake eutrophication s1 nor are the standard limits reachable or compatible with the basin characteristics s2b s2c s3b and s3c since nact and pact are modeled respectively as 9 and 0 64 mg l the cmax of strategy b may not be simply satisfied 85 reduction in short term or without imposing high costs to the diffuse pollution sources the cmax of strategy c also emphasizes p while n is drastically increasing in the basin as shown in fig 5 yet all these scenarios verify that gwf gr and the embedded freshwater can range significantly across different water quality regulation strategies table 8 shows that assuming different limits for cmax and creq have significant impacts on gr it may also turn the multiple pollutant gwf from n related to p related and vice versa in this study scenarios s2a and s3a gwfs of rf pea tobacco and tomato are p related 3 out of 10 while the others are n related the domination of n related gwf is similar to the results of chukalla et al 2018 however the results of pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2018 and de girolamo et al 2019 have shown that crops gwf are mostly p related this controversy can be justified by the standardization uncertainties it also implies that the multiple pollutant gwf of crops is regionally specific and depends on a set of variables for example aldaya et al 2020 have concluded that about 60 of n related gwf of diffuse sources originate from chemical fertilizers or from cereals changing the farming pattern may have impacts on the total gwf of basin likewise the current study shows that the gr of cereals wheat and barley is about 11 4 which is 2 2 times more than that of non cereal crops 5 1 gr has also been quantified between 7 8 s2a and 18 5 s3a in this study while it has been reported 4 by d ambrosio et al 2020 1 7 7 7 for 70 year assessment of irrigated crops by martínez paz et al 2018 20 in segura river basin south eastern spain pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2018 18 for cereals in iran ababaei and etedali 2017 or less than 15 globally by the reports published by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 furthermore in this study the gr of rf crops are calculated as 9 5 while this ratio is 6 4 for irrigated crops a similar trend has been reported by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 where the gr of rf crops is 10 4 while it is 9 1 for the irrigated crops however ababaei and etedali 2017 obtained this ratio as about 4 20 for rain fed and 17 35 for irrigated cereals this study also showed that the swat model outcomes can be used for the ws assessment of agricultural productions for each lu and for basin the capabilities of this complex model can facilitate these calculations d ambrosio et al 2020 used the swat model outcomes for annual ws assessment in river basin they concluded that this integrated model can provide the main inputs required for both wf and ws assessment jamshidi et al 2020 showed that water quality calibration by the concentrations of pollutants in the reservoir as a checkpoint can present reliable inputs for wf assessment this conclusion can be extended for ws assessment through the current research the swat model simulates surface and groundwater flows and their interactions uses complex hydrological and nutrient cycles considers return flows and interbasin transfers and can be calibrated in both runoffs and hotspots imani et al 2019 2017 these advantages reduce the estimations required for ws assessment however some recommendations are 1 bwa can be calculated by the etb overall evapotranspiration from precipitation irrigation and soil moisture multiplied by area and subtracted by gnwa instead of estimating rnat and qenv as verified by abbasi et al 2020 2 the soil moisture should be added to eta not irrigated scenario for accounting gnwa and 3 the dm should be used for accounting wpl instead of the cm the dm includes the environmental status in both wf and ws assessment here the wpl of basin is 0 03 by the cm while it is 0 16 by the dm the wpl based on the cm 0 03 is not an appropriate indicator to show the sustainability of zrebar lake as it currently encounters high eutrophication level this controversy can be decreased by the dm and is recommended in further studies it should be noted that the dm includes the main environmental status of area within the gwf of products for better decision making while wpl introduces an extra index for wfs to show their sustainability in a period accordingly the bwfs of irrigated crops in zrebar lake basin particularly apple tomato and alfalfa are pointed as unsustainable bws 1 while the gnwf and gwf of all crops are sustainable gnws 1 wpl 1 low wpl is one example implies that ws assessment may cause misinterpretation about the environmental impairment in basins 5 conclusions this study verified that the dm can be used for wf assessment of agricultural productions it also found that the applicability of the dm is not limited to a certain case product or even simulation tool nonetheless the swat model is recommended for crops wf and ws assessment as it provides the required data on the basin scale furthermore this research concludes that the dm introduces a new application for gwf it is promoted from a pollution discharge calculator to an environmental indicator that can also regionally reflect the status of impaired environment in the wfs of products the impacts of pollution loads emissions and the local environmental status ambient are accumulated in the dm for the quantification of multiple pollutant gwf this advantage has been highlighted in this study as tp becomes critical for controlling eutrophication ambient based despite the fact that crops gwfs are n related emission based thus the equivalent embedded freshwater required for environmental rehabilitation is separately quantified by the dm in addition to the embedded freshwater required for water quality assimilation cm this approach increases the insignificant gr values in regions where λ 1 and increases the wpl of environmentally impaired basin to become a more real index for sustainability assessment it was comprehensively discussed that the quantification of gwf relies on water quality standard regulations and policies which can increase the uncertainties dm is recommended to be used in further evaluations with respect to its possible impacts on the estimated values of the wfs and wss of products this approach may motivate cmax selection more regionally and add possible environmental impairments by this perspective therefore more research can evaluate this point of view and also consider the impacts of bmps critical source areas csas water recycling and reuse and the uncertainties originating from local regulations and wla credit authorship contribution

3679,the annual streamflow in the upper yangtze river uyr declined by 36 6 billion m3 from 1961 to 2015 however the contributions to this streamflow decline from different tributaries and the underlying causes remain unclear here we quantify the streamflow decline in the uyr and the impacts of climate change and human activities using a distributed hydrological model and statistical methods results show that the streamflow decline increased from the upstream to downstream regions combining hydrological simulation and statistical analysis the contributions of climate change human water consumption reservoir impoundment and human induced vegetation change on streamflow decline are estimated to be 62 5 19 7 18 4 and 1 8 respectively specifically human water consumption growth is consistent with the spatial pattern of population growth and industrial development and the reservoir impoundments are mainly located in the middle and lower parts of the mainstream in the jialingjiang the tributary with the largest drainage area in the uyr human activities account for 63 6 of the streamflow decline with the largest decline induced by human water consumption growth under climate change and population growth the population under water stress water resources available less than 1000 m3 capita yr increases in the mintuojiang and jialingjiang where the major cities are centralized and the population density is high this study provides a new perspective for understanding the status of water resources in the uyr and offers insights into the sustainable utilization of water resources in the future keywords the upper yangtze river streamflow decline climate change human activities water security 1 introduction with the influences of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance streamflow changes have aroused broad attention globally roderick and farquhar 2011 ahn and merwade 2014 feng et al 2016 dey and mishra 2017 li et al 2020 wu et al 2020 in china many rivers have experienced significant streamflow decreases over the past several decades xu et al 2014 dai et al 2015 gao et al 2016b for example as the longest river by length and the largest river by drainage area in china the yangtze river feeds approximately 36 of china s population zhu et al 2020 however a significant decrease in annual streamflow since the late 20th century has been reported in the upper yangtze river uyr yang et al 2015c zhao et al 2015 wang et al 2019 threatening the water supply for the large population living in the upstream and downstream regions the causes of the streamflow decline in the uyr are multiple and complicated the yangtze river originates from the tibetan plateau and there is widespread permafrost and glacier in the source region climate change not only directly affects streamflow by precipitation and air temperature changes but also exerts impacts via glacier retreat and permafrost degradation cuo et al 2015 wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 in addition to climate change intensified human activities have also played an important role in modulating streamflow rapid population growth from 80 million in 1961 to 173 million in 2015 in the uyr and economic development have led to a drastic increase in water withdrawal and consumption jun and chen 2001 li et al 2019b wang et al 2019 besides numerous hydropower projects have been constructed in the uyr since the 1950s cai et al 2018 tan et al 2019 including the world s largest hydropower station to date the three gorges dam lai et al 2013 gao et al 2018a several reservoirs with a total storage capacity of approximately twice that of the three gorges reservoir have also been built in the uyr in recent years chen et al 2016 which could reduce streamflow at their initial impoundment stages additionally ecological restoration programs such as the grain for green project in the uyr has led to significant vegetation coverage recovery kong et al 2018 qu et al 2018 which is also reported to be related to streamflow reduction farley et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 luo et al 2020 due to its role in enhancing soil infiltration and evapotranspiration brown et al 2005 li et al 2018 previous studies have attempted to uncover the causes of the streamflow decline in the tributaries of uyr zhou et al 2020b found that human activities were the primary factor leading to the runoff decline while climate change played a secondary role in the jialingjiang a tributary of the yangtze river based on multiple double mass curves hou et al 2018 stated that human activities were the dominant factor for streamflow decline during 1970 2012 in the upper reaches of the minjiang the largest tributary by volume in the uyr based on the double mass curves and a distributed hydrological model wu et al 2017b concluded that the impact of precipitation on runoff change was larger than 50 in yinjiang which also flows into the yangtze river based on five statistical methods these studies often focused on a certain tributary without a full picture of the entire uyr and failed to compare the roles of different tributaries in the streamflow decline of the uyr in addition they didn t comprehensively quantify the impact of different climate and non climate factors including the growth in water consumption reservoir impoundments and ecological projects as mentioned before besides most of the previous studies focused on the total water volume changes in the uyr but overlooked the socio economic effects of streamflow decline considering the unevenly distributed nature of water resources in the uyr and its ability to fulfill the needs in densely populated areas for example chengdu city is experiencing water resource shortages jointly due to a decline in water supply and a surge in industrial and domestic water demand with rapid urbanization xue and you 2018 water resources have also been reported as an important constraint of economic development in chongqing city wu et al 2017a more attention is needed for the water security issues in the uyr due to the stress placed both on the water supply side and the water demand side to fill the existing knowledge gap this study examines the long term streamflow changes in the uyr and endeavors to unravel the causes and assess the impacts of the streamflow decline in recent decades the objectives of this study are to i reveal the spatial pattern of the streamflow decline during 1961 2015 in the uyr ii quantify the impacts of climate change human water consumption reservoir impoundment and human induced vegetation change on the streamflow decline and iii assess the regional water security in the uyr as streamflow declines 2 study area the yangtze river originates from the tibetan plateau with a drainage area of 1 8 106 km2 wang et al 2013 chen et al 2016 the uyr refers to the region upstream of the yichang hydrological station which is located 40 km downstream of the three gorges dam wang et al 2020a the uyr has a drainage area of one million km2 and contributes approximately 50 of the total streamflow to the yangtze river sun et al 2013 yang et al 2015c we divided the uyr into seven subregions including three main stream regions the upper jinshajiang m1 lower jinshajiang m2 and the main stream from pingshan station to yichang station m3 and four tributaries yalongjiang t1 mintuojiang t2 jialingjiang t3 and wujiang t4 fig 1 the uyr spans a large elevation range from 38 m a s l in the east to 7000 m a s l in the west yang et al 2019 the annual precipitation varies between 200 mm and 1600 mm shen and xiong 2016 3 methods and data 3 1 methods 3 1 1 detecting the streamflow change year this study combined the sequential mann kendall test modarres and sarhadi 2009 sonali and nagesh kumar 2013 and pettitt test pettitt 1978 pohlert 2015 to detect the possible change year in streamflow at yichang station the sequential mann kendall test constructs a sequence u t firstly 1 u t i 1 t s i 2 s i s g n q i q j 1 i f q i q j 0 i f q i q j j 1 2 i where q i and q j are observed streamflow values at time i and j respectively the statistic u f t is defined as follows 3 uf t u t e u t v a r u t t 1 2 n u f 1 0 e u t n n 1 4 v a r u t n n 1 2 n 5 72 u b t is calculated starting from the end of the series if there is an intersection between u f t and u b t and the intersection is within two critical lines then the time corresponding to the intersection is when the abrupt change occurs the pettitt test constructs a sequence u t n as follows 4 u t n u i 1 t i 1 t s g n q i q j t 2 3 n the statistic kt is defined as k t m a x u t n where n is the number of samples the time when k t is achieved can be regarded as the most possible abrupt change point 3 1 2 brief introduction to the physically based model the geomorphology based ecohydrological model gbehm is adopted by this study for simulating the spatio temporal variations of runoff in the uyr and attribution analysis gbehm is a physically based distributed hydrological model based on the catchment topography yang et al 2004 yang et al 2015a which utilizes a series of hillslope valley units to depict the processes of runoff generation and routing yang et al 2015a the adoption of the hillslope valley units and the river routing based on horton strahler ordering system enables the model to be computationally simplified while retaining advantages of the distributed hydrological model in addition gbehm describes the processes of soil freeze thaw and glacier melt by energy balance equations gao et al 2018b hence it can better reflect the coupled water heat transfer in the cold regions affected by cryospheric processes this study runs gbehm at an hourly time step the details of gbehm are described by yang et al 2015b gao et al 2016a and qin et al 2017 a dynamic vegetation module was used to simulate the climate driven leaf area index lai change based on the coupled water carbon processes yang et al 2020 the photosynthesis process is described by a biochemistry based photosynthetic model farquhar et al 1980 collatz et al 1991 collatz et al 1992 and the photosynthetic rate a μ m o l c o 2 m 2 s is calculated as follows 5 a m i n w c w j where w c is the carboxylation rate limited by the rubisco enzyme w j is the maximum rate of carboxylation limited by the electron transport the phenological transition from dormancy to recovery of vegetation growth is judged by growing degree days gdd weng and luo 2008 the growth process of vegetation is to allocate carbon pool to leaves stems and roots and to produce litter using the similar methodology as in lpj sitch et al 2003 and teco weng and luo 2008 model lai is calculated as the product of leaf biomass c leaf and specific leaf area sla more details can be found in yang et al 2020 the observations of daily streamflow are used to calibrate and validate the model the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias are chosen as indicators to evaluate the model performance moriasi et al 2007 the evaluation indexes are defined as follows 6 nse 1 t 1 t q t obs q t sim 2 t 1 t q t obs q obs 2 7 pbias t 1 t q t obs q t sim t 1 t q t obs 100 where q t obs and q t sim are the observed and simulated streamflow values at time t respectively t is the length of the time series and q obs is the average value of the observed streamflow during period t similarly the nse and pbias for lai simulation can also be calculated 3 1 3 attribution of the streamflow changes the observed streamflow changes reflect the overall impact of climate change and human factors climate change includes variations in meteorological forcing variables precipitation air temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine duration and climate induced natural vegetation variations human factors mainly refer to human induced vegetation change human water consumption and reservoir impoundment fig 2 the decomposition of streamflow changes before and after the change year induced by different factors can be expressed as follows 8 δ r obs δ r clim δ r hum δ r clim δ r veg h u m δ w consum δ s reservoir ε where δ r clim is the impact of climate change on streamflow change δ r hum is the total impacts of human activities on streamflow change which is estimated as δ r veg h u m the streamflow changes caused by human induced vegetation change subtracted by δ w consum the human water consumption increases and δ s reservoir the reservoir storage capacity increment ε is the residual which may be related to simulation error data uncertainty and other factors not considered in this study we set the following two model experiments to separate δ r clim and δ r veg h u m i case 1 gbehm forced by time varying climate forcing and observed lai series ii case 2 gbehm forced by time varying climate forcing and climate driven simulated lai the streamflow changes from case 2 run between the two periods δ r c a s e 2 reflect the impact of climate change on streamflow change δ r clim which includes the changes caused by climate forcing δ r clim f o r c i n g and natural vegetation variations δ r veg c l i m 9 δ r c a s e 2 δ r clim δ r clim f o r c i n g δ r veg n a t the streamflow results of case 1 between the two periods δ r c a s e 1 reflect the response to climate forcing changes δ r clim f o r c i n g and observed vegetation changes and the latter one can be further divided into climate induced δ r veg c l i m and human induced δ r veg h u m changes 10 δ r c a s e 1 δ r clim f o r c i n g δ r veg n a t δ r veg h u m δ r c a s e 2 δ r veg h u m thus the results from δ r c a s e 1 minus δ r c a s e 2 can indicate δ r veg h u m δ w consum is mainly composed of three elements 11 δ w consum δ w domest δ w agricu δ w indust where w domest δ w agricu and δ w indust are the increases in streamflow withdrawal used for domestic agricultural and industrial water uses respectively human water consumption refers to the amount of water withdrawal that cannot be returned to surface water or groundwater aquifers which is estimated by the product of water withdrawal and water consumption rate 3 1 4 analysis of reasons for water resources per capita change in order to assess the impact of streamflow decline on the regional water security we calculate the water resources per capita wp defined as 12 w p w pop where w is the water resources available estimated as the total runoff generated within a region unit m3 and pop is the population in the region unit persons when wp is less than 1000 m3 or 500 m3 this region is regarded to experience chronic or absolute water scarcity rijsberman 2006 falkenmark 2013 wang et al 2021 we further analyze the wp change caused by water supply change and population growth from period 1 to period 2 change in water resources per capita δ w p can be calculated as follows 13 δ w p wp 2 wp 1 w 2 pop 2 w 1 pop 1 w 2 pop 2 w 1 pop 2 w 1 pop 2 w 1 pop 1 δ w p w δ w p p where wp 1 wp 2 w 1 w 2 pop 1 pop 2 are water resources per capita water resources available and population in period 1 and period 2 respectively w 2 pop 2 w 1 pop 2 represents the impact of streamflow change δ w p w and w 1 pop 2 w 1 pop 1 represents the impact of population change δ w p p on water resources per capita respectively 3 2 data the data used in this study included basic geographic information for building the hydrological model and meteorological data and vegetation parameters to force the hydrological model human water use data socioeconomic data and reservoir storage capacities we also collected observed daily river discharge for model validation meteorological forcing data were downloaded from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn daily meteorological observations from 89 meteorological stations within the study area were used including air temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine duration gridded datasets with a resolution of 8 km were produced by interpolating meteorological observations using the angular distance weighting method yang et al 2004 the dataset of gridded daily precipitation from 1961 to 2015 developed by shen and xiong 2016 was adopted and resampled to an 8 km resolution soil hydraulic parameters including the soil hydraulic conductivity saturated and residual soil moistures and parameters in the van genuchten model were collected from the china dataset of soil hydraulic parameters dai et al 2013 the soil texture data including the amount of sand clay and soil organic matter were provided by shangguan et al 2013 the digital elevation model dem was collected from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm database with a spatial resolution of 90 m jarvis et al 2008 the vegetation parameters lai and fpar produced by zhu et al 2013 were utilized in this study the land use map was provided by the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn the river discharge data at the shigu pingshan gaochang fushun beibei wulong and yichang gauging stations during 1961 2015 were utilized to validate the model specifically the river discharge data at yichang station over a longer period of 1890 2015 were collected to reflect long term streamflow changes in the uyr streamflow in the lower jinshajiang m2 and main stream m3 were calculated by subtracting the streamflow at the upper stream stations from that at the lower stream station considering the extraction of a large amount of hydropower tailwater from the jinpingyiji and jinpingerji hydropower stations since 2013 the streamflow at luning station yalongjiang was reconstructed by multiplying the streamflow at the downstream tongzilin station by the ratio of simulated streamflow between the two stations after 2013 data on domestic agricultural and industrial water use in each city from 1965 to 2013 were collected from zhou et al 2020a and extended to the periods 1961 to 1964 and 2014 to 2015 based on the population effective irrigation area and electric energy production alcamo et al 2003 wang et al 2019 and corresponding unit water use the spatial distribution information of socioeconomic and irrigation data was based on the gridded population land use map and gross domestic production gdp in 2000 with resolutions of 1 km xu 2017b xu 2017a the domestic agricultural and industrial water use in each grid was calculated by multiplying the corresponding water use data in each city by the ratio of population farmland area and gdp values in each grid to the total value of the city in which it is located the water consumption rates for domestic agricultural and industrial water were obtained from a previous study by deng et al 2011 data on population effective irrigation area and electric energy production in nine provinces namely qinghai tibet yunnan sichuan guizhou gansu shanxi chongqing and hubei were collected from statistical yearbooks of the corresponding provinces similarly the population effective irrigation area and electric energy production in each grid were estimated by multiplying the data in the corresponding province by the ratio of population farmland area and gdp values in each grid to the total value of the province in which it was located forty eight reservoirs with storage capacities larger than 100 million m3 were considered in this study and their fundamental information is shown in table s2 gao et al 2018a tan et al 2019 zhou et al 2020b 4 results 4 1 model validation the model performance in simulating daily streamflow indicated by nse and pbias at seven gauging stations in the calibration period 1961 1970 and validation period 1971 1980 are shown in table 1 specifically the comparisons between the observed and simulated daily river discharge at shigu pingshan and yichang along the main stream are shown in fig 3 the nse values are larger than 0 75 at all of the 7 stations in the validation period and the pbias values are in the range of 3 0 in the validation period indicating that the model can well replicate the streamflow variations in the uyr the streamflow results are from the case 1 run similarly the nse values for simulated lai from the case 2 run are not lower than 0 84 at all of the 6 vegetation types table s1 and the pbias values are in the range of 3 5 during 1982 2000 as we assume the human disturbances on vegetation like ecological restoration program before 2000 is relatively small ren et al 2015 chen et al 2021 the observed and simulated lai of coniferous forest grass and broadleaf forest for the period of 1982 2000 also reflect similar seasonal patterns as shown in fig s1 4 2 streamflow decline and contribution of different subregions during 1961 2015 the mean annual streamflow in the uyr decreased at a rate of 9 0 billion m3 10a with a total decrease of 49 5 billion m3 fig 4 the sequential mann kendall test indicates abrupt change occurred around 1975 and around 2000 fig s2a pettitt test detects the most possible abrupt change point in 2000 fig s2b thus we divided the study period into two periods 1961 2000 period 1 and 2001 2015 period 2 the mean annual streamflow in the entire uyr decreased from 437 3 billion m3 in period 1 to 400 7 billion m3 in period 2 with a total decrease of 33 6 billion m3 between the two periods the streamflow contributions of seven subregions to the entire uyr and their changes from period 1 to period 2 are shown in table 2 mintuojiang t2 contributes the largest volume of the streamflow to the entire uyr among the seven subregions where the contribution ratio remains stable 22 4 in period 1 22 5 in period 2 despite a streamflow decrease of 8 1 billion m3 from period 1 to period 2 the second largest streamflow contributor to the entire uyr is main stream m3 with a contribution ratio of 17 2 which also experienced the largest decrease in streamflow volume 11 9 billion m3 35 4 of the total decline in the uyr from period 1 to period 2 this disproportionate decline caused its streamflow contribution ratio to the entire uyr to decrease from 17 8 in period 1 to 16 5 in period 2 wujiang t4 is another subregion that has seen a decline in streamflow contribution ratio between the two periods 11 6 in period 1 10 7 in period 2 in comparison the streamflow contribution ratios to the entire uyr increased by 1 1 0 4 and 0 6 from period 1 to period 2 at upper jishajiang m1 yalongjiang t1 and lower jinshajiang m2 upper jishajiang m1 is the only subregion where streamflow increased slightly from period 1 to period 2 table 2 4 3 attribution of the streamflow decline based on the observations we have detected consistent streamflow decreases in all subregions of the uyr except upper jishajiang m1 and this section will further examine the causes of the streamflow changes combing the results from gbehm case 1 and case 2 run climate induced streamflow decline δ r clim was estimated to be 22 89 billion m3 equivalent to 62 5 of the total streamflow reduction from period 1 to period 2 for the entire uyr δ r veg h u m was estimated to be 0 67 billion m3 1 8 of the total streamflow reduction which was mostly from the massive ecological restoration programs δ w consum was estimated to be 7 21 billion m3 from period 1 to period 2 accounting for 19 7 of the streamflow decline with the increases in domestic agricultural industrial water consumption of 2 71 1 51 and 3 00 respectively the mean annual reservoir storage increments in period 1 and period 2 were 0 33 and 7 07 billion m3 respectively with δ s reservoir equal to 6 74 billion m3 which accounted for 18 4 of the streamflow decline in the uyr in terms of different subregions climate change dominated the streamflow changes in the upstream jinshajiang m1 and m2 while in the relatively downstream subregions the importance of non climate human factors impacts on the streamflow reductions increased human activities accounted for 40 5 in the downstream main stream m3 and 63 6 in the jialingjiang t3 a downstream tributary that has the largest drainage area in the uyr fig 5 climate change contributed to the streamflow decline at all subregions except upper jinshajiang m1 fig 6 a streamflow decline caused by human induced vegetation change was larger in the downstream while human induced vegetation change tended to increase streamflow in the upstream subregions m1 m2 and t1 fig 6b as for water consumption for the seven subregions jialingjiang t3 had the largest increase in water consumption which accounted for 37 of the streamflow decrease from period 1 to period 2 fig 6c domestic and industrial water consumption had similar growth patterns while agricultural water consumption decreased slightly in some areas fig 7 we also collected the storage capacity of large reservoirs and their starting operation years in the uyr table s2 the total storage capacity of these reservoirs was approximately 120 km3 and most reservoirs started operation after 2000 fig s3 the reservoir impoundments were mainly located in the middle and lower reaches of the mainstream such as m2 and m3 fig 6d 4 4 impact of streamflow decline on regional water security climate change and economic development affect the water supply and water demand in the uyr respectively and fig 8 shows the changes in water resources available population and water resources per capita from period 1 to period 2 along the flow length to yichang station li et al 2019a the water resources available here are obtained from the streamflow simulated from the gbehm case 1 run without the impacts of reservoir and human water consumption from period 1 to period 2 the water resources per capita further decreased due to the decline in water resources available and increase in population in most flow length intervals the population and water resources available both peak in regions with 500 1500 km flow distance from the yichang station where elevation is lower than 1500 m the cheng yu economic zone is located in this region where the population and economy increase rapidly in recent years and the water resources per capita values are the smallest despite the large amount of water resources available fig 8 here we focus on densely populated subregions in the uyr which are minjiang tuojiang and jialingjiang fig 9 where domestic water consumption also increased the most fig 6d minjiang consists of daduhe and the main stream of minjiang and jialinjiang consists of fujiang the main stream of jialingjiang and qujiang fig 9 from period 1 to period 2 with the simulated runoff change and the population growth fig s4a the water resources per capita decreased considerably in these regions table 3 particularly the water resources per capita were 808 and 937 m3 capita yr during 2001 2015 in fujiang and tuojiang respectively which indicated the population living in these two tributaries experienced chronic water scarcity less than1000 m3 capita yr after 2000 we further analyzed the contribution of water supply decline and population growth to the reduction in water resources per capita from 1961 to 2000 to 2001 2015 table 4 the results showed that population growth was the main cause of the elevated water resource decrease in the 6 densely populated subregions and climate change exacerbated the water resource decrease in most tributaries of mintuojiang and jialingjiang the decreases in the water resources per capita induced by climate change were no less than 18 at four of the six subregions and above 20 in tuojiang and the main stream of minjiang 5 discussion previous studies have attempted to explain the reasons for the streamflow decline in the uyr yang et al 2015c wang et al 2019 while this study provides a comprehensive evaluation to quantify the causes of streamflow decrease including climate change and anthropogenic factors compared with studies of hou et al 2018 wu et al 2017b and zhou et al 2020b this study reveals the spatial heterogeneity of streamflow changes and varying impacts of human activities on streamflow change at different subregions of the uyr according to our results climate change was the major influencing factor on streamflow change accounting for 62 5 in the uyr consistent with previous studies by wang et al 2019 and yang et al 2015c despite the differences in the study period or study area furthermore according to the simulation results of case 2 run the spatial patterns of changes in runoff and runoff ratio from period 1 to period 2 were similar to that of the precipitation change with a decrease in the southeastern uyr and an increase in the northwestern uyr fig s5 indicating the climate change impacts largely controlled by precipitation changes precipitation change may be related to variations in the pacific decadal oscillation pdo phase and enso miao et al 2019 li et al 2021 in addition this study also quantifies the streamflow change due to different anthropogenic factors including water consumption reservoir impoundment and human induced vegetation change the growth of domestic and industrial water consumption was mainly driven by population growth and industrial development respectively fig s4 the slowest growth of agricultural water consumption might be due to an improvement in irrigation efficiency apart from the existing reservoirs a number of cascade reservoirs are still under planning or construction in the uyr wang et al 2020b which may further decrease streamflow in the future via impoundment we also found that the streamflow decline due to human induced lai increase was mainly located in jialingjiang t3 and the main stream m3 fig 6b and this is consistent with the reported location of ecological restoration programs such as the afforestation qu et al 2018 and migration from three gorges reservoir area while streamflow increase due to human induced lai was found in m1 m2 and t1 which might be related to the grassland degradation in the tibetan plateau induced by the combined effects of over grazing construction disturbance and permafrost degradation yu et al 2012 luo et al 2018 despite the relative abundance of water resources if the historical streamflow decreasing trend continues in the future the yangtze river basin will face great challenges in addition to the water supply decline the surge in population and industrial water use also posed great stress on water resources zhou et al 2020a gong et al 2021 our study shows that water resources per capita decreased by more than 25 in four of the six subregions in minjiang and tuojiang table 3 water security issues have become a major concern in sichuan and chongqing and the regional water shortage can be further exacerbated due to the mismatch between water resources and population distribution wu et al 2017a xue and you 2018 therefore water diversion from the upper tributaries to the lower tributaries of mintuojiang and jialingjiang has been planned by the sichuan water resources department http slt sc gov cn to ensure the water supply for economic development in the cheng yu economic zone which may alleviate the water resource stress in the future there are some limitations in our study although our methods analyzed multiple reasons for the streamflow change in the uyr there were still differences between the sum of estimated impacts of climate change and human activities and the observed streamflow changes fig 5 also expressed as the residual ε in eq 8 the discrepancy may arise from data and model errors and some physical processes that we have not considered such as land use change in addition although we separated the impacts of human activities on runoff through vegetation through the dynamic vegetation module we did not consider the impacts of nitrogen deposition on vegetation change which may cause some uncertainty it should be noted that this study only evaluated the direct impacts of human activities while the indirect human impacts via greenhouse gas emissions which affected the climate were not analyzed further studies are needed in the future to better reflect the interactions between the impacts of different climatic and anthropogenic factors on the water cycle despite the limitations this study provided a holistic picture of the streamflow response to climate change and multiple human activities at different subregions of the uyr combining observations and numerical modelling approaches and assessed its impact on the socio economic development in the context of climate change population growth and rapid urbanization 6 conclusions this study investigated the long term streamflow changes in the uyr during 1961 2015 and quantified the changes induced by climate change and anthropogenic factors we also analyzed the impact on water security combining the water supply and water demand according to the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the streamflow of the uyr decreased by 36 6 billion m3 from period 1 1961 2000 to period 2 2001 2015 two major tributaries mintuojiang and wujiang contributed 22 1 and 20 5 to this streamflow decline respectively 2 the impacts of climate change human water consumption water impoundment and human induced vegetation change explained 62 5 19 7 18 4 and 1 8 of the streamflow decline in the uyr respectively 3 climate change explained most of the streamflow decline in the relatively upstream subregions while human activities played more important roles in the downstream subregions specifically human water consumption and reservoir impoundments led to the greatest streamflow decline in yalongjiang and jialingjiang among different subregions 4 under climate change and population growth the water resources per capita decreased significantly in mintuojiang and jialingjiang and the population living in tuojiang and fujiang began to experience chronic water scarcity after 2000 the water resources per capita decreased the most 27 7 in the main stream of minjiang jointly induced by a decline in water supply and an increase in water demand our analysis provides a comprehensive analysis of the causes of streamflow change and the possible impacts on water security in the uyr the findings help deepen the understanding of hydrological changes in the context of climate change and intense human disturbance highlight the importance of adaptation measures to alleviate regional water scarcity and call for strategic water resources management in large river basins like the

3679,the annual streamflow in the upper yangtze river uyr declined by 36 6 billion m3 from 1961 to 2015 however the contributions to this streamflow decline from different tributaries and the underlying causes remain unclear here we quantify the streamflow decline in the uyr and the impacts of climate change and human activities using a distributed hydrological model and statistical methods results show that the streamflow decline increased from the upstream to downstream regions combining hydrological simulation and statistical analysis the contributions of climate change human water consumption reservoir impoundment and human induced vegetation change on streamflow decline are estimated to be 62 5 19 7 18 4 and 1 8 respectively specifically human water consumption growth is consistent with the spatial pattern of population growth and industrial development and the reservoir impoundments are mainly located in the middle and lower parts of the mainstream in the jialingjiang the tributary with the largest drainage area in the uyr human activities account for 63 6 of the streamflow decline with the largest decline induced by human water consumption growth under climate change and population growth the population under water stress water resources available less than 1000 m3 capita yr increases in the mintuojiang and jialingjiang where the major cities are centralized and the population density is high this study provides a new perspective for understanding the status of water resources in the uyr and offers insights into the sustainable utilization of water resources in the future keywords the upper yangtze river streamflow decline climate change human activities water security 1 introduction with the influences of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance streamflow changes have aroused broad attention globally roderick and farquhar 2011 ahn and merwade 2014 feng et al 2016 dey and mishra 2017 li et al 2020 wu et al 2020 in china many rivers have experienced significant streamflow decreases over the past several decades xu et al 2014 dai et al 2015 gao et al 2016b for example as the longest river by length and the largest river by drainage area in china the yangtze river feeds approximately 36 of china s population zhu et al 2020 however a significant decrease in annual streamflow since the late 20th century has been reported in the upper yangtze river uyr yang et al 2015c zhao et al 2015 wang et al 2019 threatening the water supply for the large population living in the upstream and downstream regions the causes of the streamflow decline in the uyr are multiple and complicated the yangtze river originates from the tibetan plateau and there is widespread permafrost and glacier in the source region climate change not only directly affects streamflow by precipitation and air temperature changes but also exerts impacts via glacier retreat and permafrost degradation cuo et al 2015 wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 in addition to climate change intensified human activities have also played an important role in modulating streamflow rapid population growth from 80 million in 1961 to 173 million in 2015 in the uyr and economic development have led to a drastic increase in water withdrawal and consumption jun and chen 2001 li et al 2019b wang et al 2019 besides numerous hydropower projects have been constructed in the uyr since the 1950s cai et al 2018 tan et al 2019 including the world s largest hydropower station to date the three gorges dam lai et al 2013 gao et al 2018a several reservoirs with a total storage capacity of approximately twice that of the three gorges reservoir have also been built in the uyr in recent years chen et al 2016 which could reduce streamflow at their initial impoundment stages additionally ecological restoration programs such as the grain for green project in the uyr has led to significant vegetation coverage recovery kong et al 2018 qu et al 2018 which is also reported to be related to streamflow reduction farley et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 luo et al 2020 due to its role in enhancing soil infiltration and evapotranspiration brown et al 2005 li et al 2018 previous studies have attempted to uncover the causes of the streamflow decline in the tributaries of uyr zhou et al 2020b found that human activities were the primary factor leading to the runoff decline while climate change played a secondary role in the jialingjiang a tributary of the yangtze river based on multiple double mass curves hou et al 2018 stated that human activities were the dominant factor for streamflow decline during 1970 2012 in the upper reaches of the minjiang the largest tributary by volume in the uyr based on the double mass curves and a distributed hydrological model wu et al 2017b concluded that the impact of precipitation on runoff change was larger than 50 in yinjiang which also flows into the yangtze river based on five statistical methods these studies often focused on a certain tributary without a full picture of the entire uyr and failed to compare the roles of different tributaries in the streamflow decline of the uyr in addition they didn t comprehensively quantify the impact of different climate and non climate factors including the growth in water consumption reservoir impoundments and ecological projects as mentioned before besides most of the previous studies focused on the total water volume changes in the uyr but overlooked the socio economic effects of streamflow decline considering the unevenly distributed nature of water resources in the uyr and its ability to fulfill the needs in densely populated areas for example chengdu city is experiencing water resource shortages jointly due to a decline in water supply and a surge in industrial and domestic water demand with rapid urbanization xue and you 2018 water resources have also been reported as an important constraint of economic development in chongqing city wu et al 2017a more attention is needed for the water security issues in the uyr due to the stress placed both on the water supply side and the water demand side to fill the existing knowledge gap this study examines the long term streamflow changes in the uyr and endeavors to unravel the causes and assess the impacts of the streamflow decline in recent decades the objectives of this study are to i reveal the spatial pattern of the streamflow decline during 1961 2015 in the uyr ii quantify the impacts of climate change human water consumption reservoir impoundment and human induced vegetation change on the streamflow decline and iii assess the regional water security in the uyr as streamflow declines 2 study area the yangtze river originates from the tibetan plateau with a drainage area of 1 8 106 km2 wang et al 2013 chen et al 2016 the uyr refers to the region upstream of the yichang hydrological station which is located 40 km downstream of the three gorges dam wang et al 2020a the uyr has a drainage area of one million km2 and contributes approximately 50 of the total streamflow to the yangtze river sun et al 2013 yang et al 2015c we divided the uyr into seven subregions including three main stream regions the upper jinshajiang m1 lower jinshajiang m2 and the main stream from pingshan station to yichang station m3 and four tributaries yalongjiang t1 mintuojiang t2 jialingjiang t3 and wujiang t4 fig 1 the uyr spans a large elevation range from 38 m a s l in the east to 7000 m a s l in the west yang et al 2019 the annual precipitation varies between 200 mm and 1600 mm shen and xiong 2016 3 methods and data 3 1 methods 3 1 1 detecting the streamflow change year this study combined the sequential mann kendall test modarres and sarhadi 2009 sonali and nagesh kumar 2013 and pettitt test pettitt 1978 pohlert 2015 to detect the possible change year in streamflow at yichang station the sequential mann kendall test constructs a sequence u t firstly 1 u t i 1 t s i 2 s i s g n q i q j 1 i f q i q j 0 i f q i q j j 1 2 i where q i and q j are observed streamflow values at time i and j respectively the statistic u f t is defined as follows 3 uf t u t e u t v a r u t t 1 2 n u f 1 0 e u t n n 1 4 v a r u t n n 1 2 n 5 72 u b t is calculated starting from the end of the series if there is an intersection between u f t and u b t and the intersection is within two critical lines then the time corresponding to the intersection is when the abrupt change occurs the pettitt test constructs a sequence u t n as follows 4 u t n u i 1 t i 1 t s g n q i q j t 2 3 n the statistic kt is defined as k t m a x u t n where n is the number of samples the time when k t is achieved can be regarded as the most possible abrupt change point 3 1 2 brief introduction to the physically based model the geomorphology based ecohydrological model gbehm is adopted by this study for simulating the spatio temporal variations of runoff in the uyr and attribution analysis gbehm is a physically based distributed hydrological model based on the catchment topography yang et al 2004 yang et al 2015a which utilizes a series of hillslope valley units to depict the processes of runoff generation and routing yang et al 2015a the adoption of the hillslope valley units and the river routing based on horton strahler ordering system enables the model to be computationally simplified while retaining advantages of the distributed hydrological model in addition gbehm describes the processes of soil freeze thaw and glacier melt by energy balance equations gao et al 2018b hence it can better reflect the coupled water heat transfer in the cold regions affected by cryospheric processes this study runs gbehm at an hourly time step the details of gbehm are described by yang et al 2015b gao et al 2016a and qin et al 2017 a dynamic vegetation module was used to simulate the climate driven leaf area index lai change based on the coupled water carbon processes yang et al 2020 the photosynthesis process is described by a biochemistry based photosynthetic model farquhar et al 1980 collatz et al 1991 collatz et al 1992 and the photosynthetic rate a μ m o l c o 2 m 2 s is calculated as follows 5 a m i n w c w j where w c is the carboxylation rate limited by the rubisco enzyme w j is the maximum rate of carboxylation limited by the electron transport the phenological transition from dormancy to recovery of vegetation growth is judged by growing degree days gdd weng and luo 2008 the growth process of vegetation is to allocate carbon pool to leaves stems and roots and to produce litter using the similar methodology as in lpj sitch et al 2003 and teco weng and luo 2008 model lai is calculated as the product of leaf biomass c leaf and specific leaf area sla more details can be found in yang et al 2020 the observations of daily streamflow are used to calibrate and validate the model the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias are chosen as indicators to evaluate the model performance moriasi et al 2007 the evaluation indexes are defined as follows 6 nse 1 t 1 t q t obs q t sim 2 t 1 t q t obs q obs 2 7 pbias t 1 t q t obs q t sim t 1 t q t obs 100 where q t obs and q t sim are the observed and simulated streamflow values at time t respectively t is the length of the time series and q obs is the average value of the observed streamflow during period t similarly the nse and pbias for lai simulation can also be calculated 3 1 3 attribution of the streamflow changes the observed streamflow changes reflect the overall impact of climate change and human factors climate change includes variations in meteorological forcing variables precipitation air temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine duration and climate induced natural vegetation variations human factors mainly refer to human induced vegetation change human water consumption and reservoir impoundment fig 2 the decomposition of streamflow changes before and after the change year induced by different factors can be expressed as follows 8 δ r obs δ r clim δ r hum δ r clim δ r veg h u m δ w consum δ s reservoir ε where δ r clim is the impact of climate change on streamflow change δ r hum is the total impacts of human activities on streamflow change which is estimated as δ r veg h u m the streamflow changes caused by human induced vegetation change subtracted by δ w consum the human water consumption increases and δ s reservoir the reservoir storage capacity increment ε is the residual which may be related to simulation error data uncertainty and other factors not considered in this study we set the following two model experiments to separate δ r clim and δ r veg h u m i case 1 gbehm forced by time varying climate forcing and observed lai series ii case 2 gbehm forced by time varying climate forcing and climate driven simulated lai the streamflow changes from case 2 run between the two periods δ r c a s e 2 reflect the impact of climate change on streamflow change δ r clim which includes the changes caused by climate forcing δ r clim f o r c i n g and natural vegetation variations δ r veg c l i m 9 δ r c a s e 2 δ r clim δ r clim f o r c i n g δ r veg n a t the streamflow results of case 1 between the two periods δ r c a s e 1 reflect the response to climate forcing changes δ r clim f o r c i n g and observed vegetation changes and the latter one can be further divided into climate induced δ r veg c l i m and human induced δ r veg h u m changes 10 δ r c a s e 1 δ r clim f o r c i n g δ r veg n a t δ r veg h u m δ r c a s e 2 δ r veg h u m thus the results from δ r c a s e 1 minus δ r c a s e 2 can indicate δ r veg h u m δ w consum is mainly composed of three elements 11 δ w consum δ w domest δ w agricu δ w indust where w domest δ w agricu and δ w indust are the increases in streamflow withdrawal used for domestic agricultural and industrial water uses respectively human water consumption refers to the amount of water withdrawal that cannot be returned to surface water or groundwater aquifers which is estimated by the product of water withdrawal and water consumption rate 3 1 4 analysis of reasons for water resources per capita change in order to assess the impact of streamflow decline on the regional water security we calculate the water resources per capita wp defined as 12 w p w pop where w is the water resources available estimated as the total runoff generated within a region unit m3 and pop is the population in the region unit persons when wp is less than 1000 m3 or 500 m3 this region is regarded to experience chronic or absolute water scarcity rijsberman 2006 falkenmark 2013 wang et al 2021 we further analyze the wp change caused by water supply change and population growth from period 1 to period 2 change in water resources per capita δ w p can be calculated as follows 13 δ w p wp 2 wp 1 w 2 pop 2 w 1 pop 1 w 2 pop 2 w 1 pop 2 w 1 pop 2 w 1 pop 1 δ w p w δ w p p where wp 1 wp 2 w 1 w 2 pop 1 pop 2 are water resources per capita water resources available and population in period 1 and period 2 respectively w 2 pop 2 w 1 pop 2 represents the impact of streamflow change δ w p w and w 1 pop 2 w 1 pop 1 represents the impact of population change δ w p p on water resources per capita respectively 3 2 data the data used in this study included basic geographic information for building the hydrological model and meteorological data and vegetation parameters to force the hydrological model human water use data socioeconomic data and reservoir storage capacities we also collected observed daily river discharge for model validation meteorological forcing data were downloaded from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn daily meteorological observations from 89 meteorological stations within the study area were used including air temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine duration gridded datasets with a resolution of 8 km were produced by interpolating meteorological observations using the angular distance weighting method yang et al 2004 the dataset of gridded daily precipitation from 1961 to 2015 developed by shen and xiong 2016 was adopted and resampled to an 8 km resolution soil hydraulic parameters including the soil hydraulic conductivity saturated and residual soil moistures and parameters in the van genuchten model were collected from the china dataset of soil hydraulic parameters dai et al 2013 the soil texture data including the amount of sand clay and soil organic matter were provided by shangguan et al 2013 the digital elevation model dem was collected from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm database with a spatial resolution of 90 m jarvis et al 2008 the vegetation parameters lai and fpar produced by zhu et al 2013 were utilized in this study the land use map was provided by the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn the river discharge data at the shigu pingshan gaochang fushun beibei wulong and yichang gauging stations during 1961 2015 were utilized to validate the model specifically the river discharge data at yichang station over a longer period of 1890 2015 were collected to reflect long term streamflow changes in the uyr streamflow in the lower jinshajiang m2 and main stream m3 were calculated by subtracting the streamflow at the upper stream stations from that at the lower stream station considering the extraction of a large amount of hydropower tailwater from the jinpingyiji and jinpingerji hydropower stations since 2013 the streamflow at luning station yalongjiang was reconstructed by multiplying the streamflow at the downstream tongzilin station by the ratio of simulated streamflow between the two stations after 2013 data on domestic agricultural and industrial water use in each city from 1965 to 2013 were collected from zhou et al 2020a and extended to the periods 1961 to 1964 and 2014 to 2015 based on the population effective irrigation area and electric energy production alcamo et al 2003 wang et al 2019 and corresponding unit water use the spatial distribution information of socioeconomic and irrigation data was based on the gridded population land use map and gross domestic production gdp in 2000 with resolutions of 1 km xu 2017b xu 2017a the domestic agricultural and industrial water use in each grid was calculated by multiplying the corresponding water use data in each city by the ratio of population farmland area and gdp values in each grid to the total value of the city in which it is located the water consumption rates for domestic agricultural and industrial water were obtained from a previous study by deng et al 2011 data on population effective irrigation area and electric energy production in nine provinces namely qinghai tibet yunnan sichuan guizhou gansu shanxi chongqing and hubei were collected from statistical yearbooks of the corresponding provinces similarly the population effective irrigation area and electric energy production in each grid were estimated by multiplying the data in the corresponding province by the ratio of population farmland area and gdp values in each grid to the total value of the province in which it was located forty eight reservoirs with storage capacities larger than 100 million m3 were considered in this study and their fundamental information is shown in table s2 gao et al 2018a tan et al 2019 zhou et al 2020b 4 results 4 1 model validation the model performance in simulating daily streamflow indicated by nse and pbias at seven gauging stations in the calibration period 1961 1970 and validation period 1971 1980 are shown in table 1 specifically the comparisons between the observed and simulated daily river discharge at shigu pingshan and yichang along the main stream are shown in fig 3 the nse values are larger than 0 75 at all of the 7 stations in the validation period and the pbias values are in the range of 3 0 in the validation period indicating that the model can well replicate the streamflow variations in the uyr the streamflow results are from the case 1 run similarly the nse values for simulated lai from the case 2 run are not lower than 0 84 at all of the 6 vegetation types table s1 and the pbias values are in the range of 3 5 during 1982 2000 as we assume the human disturbances on vegetation like ecological restoration program before 2000 is relatively small ren et al 2015 chen et al 2021 the observed and simulated lai of coniferous forest grass and broadleaf forest for the period of 1982 2000 also reflect similar seasonal patterns as shown in fig s1 4 2 streamflow decline and contribution of different subregions during 1961 2015 the mean annual streamflow in the uyr decreased at a rate of 9 0 billion m3 10a with a total decrease of 49 5 billion m3 fig 4 the sequential mann kendall test indicates abrupt change occurred around 1975 and around 2000 fig s2a pettitt test detects the most possible abrupt change point in 2000 fig s2b thus we divided the study period into two periods 1961 2000 period 1 and 2001 2015 period 2 the mean annual streamflow in the entire uyr decreased from 437 3 billion m3 in period 1 to 400 7 billion m3 in period 2 with a total decrease of 33 6 billion m3 between the two periods the streamflow contributions of seven subregions to the entire uyr and their changes from period 1 to period 2 are shown in table 2 mintuojiang t2 contributes the largest volume of the streamflow to the entire uyr among the seven subregions where the contribution ratio remains stable 22 4 in period 1 22 5 in period 2 despite a streamflow decrease of 8 1 billion m3 from period 1 to period 2 the second largest streamflow contributor to the entire uyr is main stream m3 with a contribution ratio of 17 2 which also experienced the largest decrease in streamflow volume 11 9 billion m3 35 4 of the total decline in the uyr from period 1 to period 2 this disproportionate decline caused its streamflow contribution ratio to the entire uyr to decrease from 17 8 in period 1 to 16 5 in period 2 wujiang t4 is another subregion that has seen a decline in streamflow contribution ratio between the two periods 11 6 in period 1 10 7 in period 2 in comparison the streamflow contribution ratios to the entire uyr increased by 1 1 0 4 and 0 6 from period 1 to period 2 at upper jishajiang m1 yalongjiang t1 and lower jinshajiang m2 upper jishajiang m1 is the only subregion where streamflow increased slightly from period 1 to period 2 table 2 4 3 attribution of the streamflow decline based on the observations we have detected consistent streamflow decreases in all subregions of the uyr except upper jishajiang m1 and this section will further examine the causes of the streamflow changes combing the results from gbehm case 1 and case 2 run climate induced streamflow decline δ r clim was estimated to be 22 89 billion m3 equivalent to 62 5 of the total streamflow reduction from period 1 to period 2 for the entire uyr δ r veg h u m was estimated to be 0 67 billion m3 1 8 of the total streamflow reduction which was mostly from the massive ecological restoration programs δ w consum was estimated to be 7 21 billion m3 from period 1 to period 2 accounting for 19 7 of the streamflow decline with the increases in domestic agricultural industrial water consumption of 2 71 1 51 and 3 00 respectively the mean annual reservoir storage increments in period 1 and period 2 were 0 33 and 7 07 billion m3 respectively with δ s reservoir equal to 6 74 billion m3 which accounted for 18 4 of the streamflow decline in the uyr in terms of different subregions climate change dominated the streamflow changes in the upstream jinshajiang m1 and m2 while in the relatively downstream subregions the importance of non climate human factors impacts on the streamflow reductions increased human activities accounted for 40 5 in the downstream main stream m3 and 63 6 in the jialingjiang t3 a downstream tributary that has the largest drainage area in the uyr fig 5 climate change contributed to the streamflow decline at all subregions except upper jinshajiang m1 fig 6 a streamflow decline caused by human induced vegetation change was larger in the downstream while human induced vegetation change tended to increase streamflow in the upstream subregions m1 m2 and t1 fig 6b as for water consumption for the seven subregions jialingjiang t3 had the largest increase in water consumption which accounted for 37 of the streamflow decrease from period 1 to period 2 fig 6c domestic and industrial water consumption had similar growth patterns while agricultural water consumption decreased slightly in some areas fig 7 we also collected the storage capacity of large reservoirs and their starting operation years in the uyr table s2 the total storage capacity of these reservoirs was approximately 120 km3 and most reservoirs started operation after 2000 fig s3 the reservoir impoundments were mainly located in the middle and lower reaches of the mainstream such as m2 and m3 fig 6d 4 4 impact of streamflow decline on regional water security climate change and economic development affect the water supply and water demand in the uyr respectively and fig 8 shows the changes in water resources available population and water resources per capita from period 1 to period 2 along the flow length to yichang station li et al 2019a the water resources available here are obtained from the streamflow simulated from the gbehm case 1 run without the impacts of reservoir and human water consumption from period 1 to period 2 the water resources per capita further decreased due to the decline in water resources available and increase in population in most flow length intervals the population and water resources available both peak in regions with 500 1500 km flow distance from the yichang station where elevation is lower than 1500 m the cheng yu economic zone is located in this region where the population and economy increase rapidly in recent years and the water resources per capita values are the smallest despite the large amount of water resources available fig 8 here we focus on densely populated subregions in the uyr which are minjiang tuojiang and jialingjiang fig 9 where domestic water consumption also increased the most fig 6d minjiang consists of daduhe and the main stream of minjiang and jialinjiang consists of fujiang the main stream of jialingjiang and qujiang fig 9 from period 1 to period 2 with the simulated runoff change and the population growth fig s4a the water resources per capita decreased considerably in these regions table 3 particularly the water resources per capita were 808 and 937 m3 capita yr during 2001 2015 in fujiang and tuojiang respectively which indicated the population living in these two tributaries experienced chronic water scarcity less than1000 m3 capita yr after 2000 we further analyzed the contribution of water supply decline and population growth to the reduction in water resources per capita from 1961 to 2000 to 2001 2015 table 4 the results showed that population growth was the main cause of the elevated water resource decrease in the 6 densely populated subregions and climate change exacerbated the water resource decrease in most tributaries of mintuojiang and jialingjiang the decreases in the water resources per capita induced by climate change were no less than 18 at four of the six subregions and above 20 in tuojiang and the main stream of minjiang 5 discussion previous studies have attempted to explain the reasons for the streamflow decline in the uyr yang et al 2015c wang et al 2019 while this study provides a comprehensive evaluation to quantify the causes of streamflow decrease including climate change and anthropogenic factors compared with studies of hou et al 2018 wu et al 2017b and zhou et al 2020b this study reveals the spatial heterogeneity of streamflow changes and varying impacts of human activities on streamflow change at different subregions of the uyr according to our results climate change was the major influencing factor on streamflow change accounting for 62 5 in the uyr consistent with previous studies by wang et al 2019 and yang et al 2015c despite the differences in the study period or study area furthermore according to the simulation results of case 2 run the spatial patterns of changes in runoff and runoff ratio from period 1 to period 2 were similar to that of the precipitation change with a decrease in the southeastern uyr and an increase in the northwestern uyr fig s5 indicating the climate change impacts largely controlled by precipitation changes precipitation change may be related to variations in the pacific decadal oscillation pdo phase and enso miao et al 2019 li et al 2021 in addition this study also quantifies the streamflow change due to different anthropogenic factors including water consumption reservoir impoundment and human induced vegetation change the growth of domestic and industrial water consumption was mainly driven by population growth and industrial development respectively fig s4 the slowest growth of agricultural water consumption might be due to an improvement in irrigation efficiency apart from the existing reservoirs a number of cascade reservoirs are still under planning or construction in the uyr wang et al 2020b which may further decrease streamflow in the future via impoundment we also found that the streamflow decline due to human induced lai increase was mainly located in jialingjiang t3 and the main stream m3 fig 6b and this is consistent with the reported location of ecological restoration programs such as the afforestation qu et al 2018 and migration from three gorges reservoir area while streamflow increase due to human induced lai was found in m1 m2 and t1 which might be related to the grassland degradation in the tibetan plateau induced by the combined effects of over grazing construction disturbance and permafrost degradation yu et al 2012 luo et al 2018 despite the relative abundance of water resources if the historical streamflow decreasing trend continues in the future the yangtze river basin will face great challenges in addition to the water supply decline the surge in population and industrial water use also posed great stress on water resources zhou et al 2020a gong et al 2021 our study shows that water resources per capita decreased by more than 25 in four of the six subregions in minjiang and tuojiang table 3 water security issues have become a major concern in sichuan and chongqing and the regional water shortage can be further exacerbated due to the mismatch between water resources and population distribution wu et al 2017a xue and you 2018 therefore water diversion from the upper tributaries to the lower tributaries of mintuojiang and jialingjiang has been planned by the sichuan water resources department http slt sc gov cn to ensure the water supply for economic development in the cheng yu economic zone which may alleviate the water resource stress in the future there are some limitations in our study although our methods analyzed multiple reasons for the streamflow change in the uyr there were still differences between the sum of estimated impacts of climate change and human activities and the observed streamflow changes fig 5 also expressed as the residual ε in eq 8 the discrepancy may arise from data and model errors and some physical processes that we have not considered such as land use change in addition although we separated the impacts of human activities on runoff through vegetation through the dynamic vegetation module we did not consider the impacts of nitrogen deposition on vegetation change which may cause some uncertainty it should be noted that this study only evaluated the direct impacts of human activities while the indirect human impacts via greenhouse gas emissions which affected the climate were not analyzed further studies are needed in the future to better reflect the interactions between the impacts of different climatic and anthropogenic factors on the water cycle despite the limitations this study provided a holistic picture of the streamflow response to climate change and multiple human activities at different subregions of the uyr combining observations and numerical modelling approaches and assessed its impact on the socio economic development in the context of climate change population growth and rapid urbanization 6 conclusions this study investigated the long term streamflow changes in the uyr during 1961 2015 and quantified the changes induced by climate change and anthropogenic factors we also analyzed the impact on water security combining the water supply and water demand according to the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the streamflow of the uyr decreased by 36 6 billion m3 from period 1 1961 2000 to period 2 2001 2015 two major tributaries mintuojiang and wujiang contributed 22 1 and 20 5 to this streamflow decline respectively 2 the impacts of climate change human water consumption water impoundment and human induced vegetation change explained 62 5 19 7 18 4 and 1 8 of the streamflow decline in the uyr respectively 3 climate change explained most of the streamflow decline in the relatively upstream subregions while human activities played more important roles in the downstream subregions specifically human water consumption and reservoir impoundments led to the greatest streamflow decline in yalongjiang and jialingjiang among different subregions 4 under climate change and population growth the water resources per capita decreased significantly in mintuojiang and jialingjiang and the population living in tuojiang and fujiang began to experience chronic water scarcity after 2000 the water resources per capita decreased the most 27 7 in the main stream of minjiang jointly induced by a decline in water supply and an increase in water demand our analysis provides a comprehensive analysis of the causes of streamflow change and the possible impacts on water security in the uyr the findings help deepen the understanding of hydrological changes in the context of climate change and intense human disturbance highlight the importance of adaptation measures to alleviate regional water scarcity and call for strategic water resources management in large river basins like the
