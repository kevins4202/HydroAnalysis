1165,applying ecohydrological principles to catchment management provides an opportunity for two distinct but complementary strategies a basis for the interpretation of ecosystem health and a guide for the selection of ecohydrological tools for catchment management the latter include a number of biotechnologies that can support the sustainability of key ecosystem services effectively lake naivasha has been an economic development hub of kenya since pre colonial times now it is dominated by geothermal power production horticulture and floriculture hotel and hospitality small and medium enterprises around the lake together with intensive smallholder cultivations and pasture in the catchment natural resources in the basin have continually attracted diverse local and foreign investments advancement in technologies together with a rapid rise in human population have exacerbated pressure upon the basin s natural capital conflicts between interest groups have often erupted due to fluctuations in water availability and limitations of access to private land flower growers pastoralists fisher folk hoteliers upper catchment and lower catchment communities often accuse one another of engaging in malpractices over resource use these conflicts have more recently resulted in partnerships in resource management however which have helped in the implementation of research informed mitigation measures the most important is the formation of an umbrella organisation imarisha naivasha a quasi government body set up to catalyse sustainability moves it sought to achieve this with a sustainable development action plan sdap 2012 17 and with funding mainly from the dutch government an integrated water resource allocation plan iwrap for catchment wide use of surface and ground waters on smaller scales successful case studies have demonstrated practical ways forward a payment for ecosystem services pes programme in one sub catchment has reduced upper catchment erosion restoration of small dams in another has provided more reliable and cleaner rural water flood retention and enhanced biodiversity around the lake promotion of artificial wetlands that now treat effluent waters from about half the horticultural enterprises recently proposed new mega projects by both the national and the nakuru county governments have brought uncertainty upon the future state of the lake and its catchment plans to develop an industrial park and an inland container port for the new kenyan standard gauge railway from mombasa to naivasha together with the proposal to develop and market naivasha further as an ecotourism and conferencing destination have enhanced speculation on investment opportunities and demographic trends attracting new investors and jobseekers within the framework of ecohydrology we summarise proposed developments and the management challenges they pose and provide examples of ecohydrological tools recommended to contain the negative impacts on fundamental ecosystem processes we review the probability of the successful application of such tools keywords ecohydrology citizen science conflict resolution partnership proactive mitigation sustainability 1 introduction ecohydrology underlines the mutual links existing between hydrological flows and ecosystem functioning mediated via processes that occur through both aquatic and terrestrial vegetation defined by three fundamental hypotheses table 1 changes to discharge and to water quality cause process changes in receiving ecosystems and impacts on vegetation within the catchment hypothesis 1 at the same time through their active role within the water cycle plants regulate hydrology by a evapotranspiration returning flow to the atmosphere which impacts on discharge b water infiltration which affects runoff time response and c water purification which enhances the chemical quality of runoff hypothesis 2 finally the regulatory activities of plants can be enhanced by practical management to benefit the human population e g through environmental flows so as to achieve sustainable development without compromising the ecological functioning of aquatic systems hypothesis 3 the implementation of ecohydrology thus offers a double opportunity as i it provides a strategy for the assessment of modifications to the water cycle and of their likely consequences ii it guides the selection of biotechnologies for integrated river basin management the scale of application of ecohydrological principles and practices is broad and it goes beyond single water bodies to encompass interactions that take place within whole catchments zalewski 2000 zalewski et al 2008 at catchment scale beneficial human alterations to the natural land cover influence large scale hydrological cycles with positive repercussions onto local climate biodiversity and people s health which can be achieved using ecohydrological tools examples are in stream wetlands for river discharge control and for water quality enhancement riparian zone restoration for enhanced water infiltration and protection of streamwater quality from allochthonous pollution reforestation on steep slopes to prevent soil erosion leading to water body siltation restoring catchment ecohydrology will improve essential ecosystem services for the benefit of human societies ma 2005 these are particularly provisional services measured in terms of quantities produced per hectare per year cultural services measured in terms of the cultural and social development of human communities and regulatory services that govern the durability of ecosystem processes without which the concept of sustainability itself would lose any practical meaning de groot et al 2002 this paper offers an overview of human activities that put lake naivasha basin under stress describes tools that have been shown to be promising for counteracting degradation and provides an update of the current state of management proposals we conclude by discussing the probability of management success in an ecohydrological context by providing a focus for assessment as well as a strategy to design solutions ecohydrology can drive resource use planning for the resilience of ecosystems and for the balanced development of local communities 2 ecohydrological characteristics of the naivasha catchment 2 1 hydrology a string of tectonic lakes have developed along the eastern branch of the great rift valley in kenya as a consequence of the tectonic activities that have formed the valley over the past 25 million years naivasha is the rift valley lake at the highest altitude 1888m a s l situated just below the equator it experiences a dual rainfall pattern with long rains occurring between march and may and short rains between october and november the timing and the quantity of precipitation are related in a complex way to the passage of the inter tropical convergence zone governed by the strength of the north easterly monsoon winds from the indian ocean and to seasonal changes in its temperature which provides the major origin of moisture global circulation models currently fail to explain climatic changes during the past millennium therefore climate predictions for this part of the continent are considered highly inaccurate klein et al 2016 much of the lake catchment fig 1 is dry sub humid with an extended annual period of moisture deficit due to high potential evaporation on average 1 32myear 1 odongo et al 2015 about 670mmyear 1 precipitation occurs at the lake shore less at the western catchment edge but significantly more up to around 1525mmyear 1 odongo et al 2015 in the upper catchment to the east and to the north starting from above 2300m which once was entirely covered by natural forests mutubio hydrological station located at 3150m a s l records the average precipitation at 1350mmyear 1 meins 2013 table 2 most of the lower catchment underlain by ancient lake sediments is covered by dry savannah bushes with scattered trees e g acacias and camphor bush which have been extensively converted to arable or horticulture except for the few large ranches to the immediate north of the lake and degraded pastures to the south the lake lies to the west of the nyandarua mountain range whose high plateau stretches in a north south direction its northern peak just below 4000m a s l the nyandarua range and its forest protected by the aberdare national park represent one of the main water towers of the country responsible for the supply of drinking water to nairobi south and east wards drainage as well as the hydrology of the central rift valley western drainage the catchment is under a rain shadow fig 2 meaning that while the eastern slopes of the nyandarua range receive most of rainfall coming from the indian ocean and give rise to the country s largest the tana river which flows eastwards towards the coast for over 800km the more modest runoff generated by the western slopes feeds into naivasha and north of the kinangop plateau lake ol bolossat one of the sources of the river ewaso njiro north naivasha is a remarkable exception to almost all the other lakes on the eastern rift floor which are saline alkaline due to evaporation exceeding inflow naivasha waters remain fresh thanks to lower evaporation at its higher altitude and to underground seepages both northwards and southwards that prevent salt accumulation within the basin gaudet and melack 1981 seepage was estimated to account for 15 of outflows bergner et al 2003 the naivasha catchment area is approximately 3376km2 meins 2013 but the surface area that can be considered hydrologically active i e contributing to maintain lake levels was estimated to be just over half that odongo et al 2014 its major sub catchment the malewa river 1730km2 flows from the northern steep forested eastern slopes of the nyandarua 3989m a s l onto the kinangop plateau 2483m a s l fig 2 its average annual rainfall is 1087 5mm its main tributary the turasha river which drains the southern nyandarua and contributes the greatest portion of runoff to the lake joins it at the foot of kipipiri mountain the gilgil river sub catchment 527km2 rises at 2772 on the bahati highlands where average annual rainfall reaches 1300mm and flows in a southerly direction between narrow ridges it begins as two streams the morendat the kiriũndũ which merge to become the gigil river and are then joined by the little gilgil at gilgil town its discharge tends to become very low during the dry season and once in a decade the main river may dry out completely during particularly severe droughts such as in 2009 and recently in early 2017 the karati temporary stream rises at 2648m in the southeast and drains 149km2 its runoff reaches the lake only during the rainy seasons few other highly seasonal streams drain the southern and western parts of the catchment 2 2 land use since the advent of colonisation the catchment has undergone intense deforestation and establishment of ranches within the lake edge and catchment but frequent lake level oscillations prevented successful farming within the immediate lakeshore further recent declines in forest 5 4 and bushland 26 4 have been recorded from the catchment between 1973 and 2011 using remote sensing techniques odongo et al 2014 today the largest portion of the catchment is occupied by smallholder as well as a few large farms table 3 in the early 1980s successful experiments in the production of cut flowers led to the development of a horticultural industry dependent upon irrigation which experienced rapid expansion in the past two decades up to at least 6000ha mostly around the lake and within 5km of its edge rural focus 2006 mutiba 2008 2 3 population population around the lake including naivasha town had more than doubled within a decade from 158 679 in 1999 to 376 243 in 2009 onywere et al 2012 it is currently speculated that it might now be above 500 000 this figure is expected to triple over the next decade if current planned investments take place official census data claim that before 2009 the entire catchment hosted 650 000 people knbs 2009 about a dozen different tribes make up the population a cultural enrichment but also a challenge because of the relative fragmentation of this relatively recent social assemblage three quarters of the population is self employed or not in employment the private sector employs 17 8 while government employs 7 3 real plan consultants 2015 the distribution of settlements across the catchment is unplanned with large informal linear settlements that have been developed along the nairobi nakuru the moi south lake and the kinangop roads they have developed around commercial nodes including the central business district cbd kayole karagita kinamba and kamere new towns fig 3 see below 2 4 lake ecology the lake pan is shallow with 3 3m average depth table 4 and a warm water column on average 23 c stirred by strong afternoon winds linked to convective evaporation the shallow morphology of the basin and reliance on distant sources of moisture indian ocean that are dependent on global circulation processes mean that the lake volume tends to undergo remarkable fluctuations during the last decade up to 30 year 1 with a shoreline change that in some years has exceeded 100myear 1 horizontal this characteristic is reflected in the lake s original maasai name enaiposha meaning moving waters the ecological history of the lake has been summarised in harper et al 1990 2002 2011 its ecology changed out of all recognition from its natural state up to 1975 due to a succession of alien species arrivals which have totally replaced aquatic macrophytes and fish applying ecohydrological thinking to this scenario would immediately draw attention to the key role of the vegetation in mountain forests as well as in stream and lake riparian zones for moderating the high natural variability of hydrological fluxes and chemical contaminants from humans as well as soil erosion 3 drivers of anthropogenic impact reconstructions based upon lake sediment cores proved that the first detectable human impacts onto the ecology of lake naivasha began around the mid xx century following the settlement of european colonisers along the lake shore and within the catchment mergeay et al 2004 stoof leichsenring et al 2011 these early changes induced an acceleration of the sedimentation rate and marked the start of a progressive eutrophication process that has been increasing ever since harper et al 1993 2004 direct abstractions from the lake and from the underlying aquifer supply two large industries irrigated horticulture agriculture and geothermal power a third large water consumer that is currently undergoing rapid growth is residential development groundwater levels around the lake area are now believed to be in serious decline reta 2011 cited by van oel et al 2013 rivers and groundwater are used to supply naivasha and gilgil towns as well as nakuru city which lies outside the basin 18 000m3 per day are taken from the turasha dam for nakuru otiang a owiti and oswe 2007 overall water abstractions were estimated to amount to approximately 40mm3 year 1 equivalent to ca 20 of the annual river inflow de jong 2011 cited in hogeboom et al 2015 it is estimated that collectively these abstractions have caused a steady lake level decline becht and harper 2002 averaged at 6cmyear 1 odongo et al 2015 over the past two decades a severe drought developed in the four years up to in 2009 at that time lake abstractions increased because of a lack of alternative water sources and the lake was 1m below its predicted natural level becht and harper loc cit it is estimated that the impact of water abstractions is keeping lake levels about 1m below natural level continuously van oel et al 2013 the rise in human population has also led to increased pressure on the lake riparian zone manifest in local deforestation of the riparian acacia xanthophloea woodland littoral water pollution illegal fishing cattle trampling and degradation of the papyrus cyperus papyrus littoral fringe that formerly encircled the entire lake harper and mavuti 2004 the proliferation of small scale agriculture in the wider basin has extended cultivation up to river banks and partly also within the lake shore with a consequent increase in erosion leading to enhanced lake sedimentation boar and harper 2002 3 1 flower farming kenya s cut flower industry is an economic success because it contributed an annual average of us 141 million in foreign exchange 7 of the value of kenyan exports over the period 1996 2005 and about us 352 million in 2005 alone mekkonen et al 2012 the industry has provided employment to up to 70 000 people kuhn et al 2016 and developed infrastructure such as schools and hospitals collectively naivasha producers have created one of the largest flower farm districts worldwide that accounts for 70 of the national flower exports kuhn et al 2016 the success of the industry is linked to the abundant up to now readily available water supplies and to the cool night temperatures at this altitude impacts caused by flower production have been high water abstraction enhanced evaporation virtual water export and perceived pesticide and nutrient pollution it has been estimated that 2 3 of the water abstraction from the entire lake basin is caused by the flower farms established around the lakeshore meins 2013 the overall catchment surface covered by flower production reached nearly 6000ha in 2007 mutiba 2008 unpublished thesis and has slowly increased since then pers obs most farms are in proximity to the lakeshore where 5025ha have riparian frontage kuhn et al 2016 the water footprint of one rose is estimated to be 7 13l mekkonen et al 2012 the total virtual water export by cut flower exports from the lake naivasha basin was thus 16mm3 year 1 during the period 1996 2005 22 green water 45 blue water 33 grey water mekkonen et al loc cit another estimate of overall water abstractions within the basin by the horticultural sector is 71 with cut flowers alone accounting for as much as 58 odongo et al 2014 3 2 power generation in the early 1930s a small scale geothermal power plant was originally developed at hell s gate near the shores of lake naivasha occupied by active volcanic fields by italian engineers who had just built a similar one in a volcanic portion of tuscany in central italy they simply installed a turbine on top of a geyser to convert hot steam into electricity the first plant of this kind in africa much later this plant was extended by the kenya government and 30 of kenya geothermal energy generating company kengen was privatised in 2006 followed by support from chinese government commencing 2010 at present kengen extracts water from the lake and pumps it to depths exceeding 1km reaching deep geological strata at high temperature this generates an artificial geyser whose thermal energy is then converted to electricity at the surface which is transferred to the national grid kengen owns 31 power generating plants across the country with a combined installed capacity of 1337mw out of which 365mw is geothermal www kengen co ke according to ogada et al 2017 the ol karia geothermal power plant has a potential of 162mw and generates about 15 of kenya s electric power recently published plans by kengen are to expand by 60mw and maybe more to be generated by a line of power plants along the rift valley from naivasha towards nakuru and beyond across national parks wildlife sanctuaries and gazetted forests hell s gate national park originally set up as an important site for 5 sympatric vulture species contains two large power generation stations within its boundaries the rare and threatened lammergeier gypaetus barbatus meridionalis was the first one to disappear followed by the critically endangered african white backed vulture gyps africanus endangered egyptian vulture neophron p percnopterus and endangered lappet faced vulture torgos t tracheliotus only few individuals of the critically endangered rüppell s griffon vulture gyps r rueppellii still persist birds have been electrocuted by high voltage power lines both birds and mammals have been poisoned by the caustic brines produced during power generation and mammals are regularly killed on the tarmac high speed roads used by transport within the park thornett 2017 apart from severe loss of biodiversity kengen operations are responsible for heavy water consumption during a survey of water consumption conducted in 2009 kengen was the sole water user within the basin that refused to declare its current water abstraction 3 3 informal settlements informal settlements have recently grown along the south lake road housing flower farm workers and their families fig 3 other centres are spreading close to naivasha town kihoto on the lake edge just south of naivasha town as well as in the north kasarani these centres lack adequate planning and basic urban infrastructure including lighting water supply runoff drainage and sewerage consequently the resident population makes full use of the lake riparian shores for vegetable gardens water abstraction and cattle drinking as well as for personal and clothes washing waste is dumped in large pits just beyond the riparian fringe open to grazing and scavenging domestic animals human excreta dumped in pit latrines slowly percolate into the lake aquifer naivasha town itself has also grown dramatically during the past 40 years such that only about a third of the urban area is served by sewerage the rest has the same sanitation as peri urban settlements pit latrines the sewage treatment plant on the lakeward side of the railway station serving this small fraction of the town is a modern activated sludge plant constructed as an aid package by a scandinavian country about 40 years ago its pumps were stolen shortly after construction and never replaced it has since opened operated at a fraction of its efficiency passing sewage through three treatment lagoons before being discharged into a ditch at the upper part of the riparian zone the liquid in the ditch disappears into the soils after few hundred metres only when the lake is at its highest water level does partly treated sewage enter it directly at all other times at least nutrients and possibly also enteric bacteria reach groundwater which is directly connected to the lake aquifer causing measurable eutrophication deoxygenation and fish kills in the proximal lake shore pacini unpublished 3 4 tourism and residential growth mild weather scenic lake views constant water supply high number of bird species and proximity to nairobi have given naivasha a global tourist reputation now supported by quality hotel and conference facilities new luxury hotels have been built on the south lake road while upper class gated residence estates are being built all around the riparian fringe with attractive lake views none of these developments is connected to a sewage treatment network but to individual septic tanks and their collective water consumption is unknown most developments within riparian frontage have cleared their papyrus fringes and all other riparian species because guests wish to see the lake water anonymous hotel manager comment campsites are expanding and lake edges are heavily used for boat rides 3 5 pastoralism traditional maasai pastoralism is the prominent land use in the central and western portion of the naivasha catchment on the rift valley floor where agriculture is more difficult without steady irrigation here groundwater is of low quality and the distance from the lake doesn t allow direct abstraction the number of cattle owned by herdsmen represents their personal wealth despite the condition of individual animals which can be very poor at times during dry seasons when other sources of water have dried up cattle are taken down to the lake edge where cows graze on papyrus umbels destroying the riparian fringe morrison and harper 2009 and some even consume alien water hyacinth up to 30 000 head of cattle could be seen grazing within the lake s riparian zone on a single day in 2009 harper et al 2011 extensive pastoralism is becoming common throughout kenya and a profitable way of investing money large herds managed by maasai boys are often the property of affluent politicians and businessmen based in nairobi impacts caused by pastoralism also include pollution of water resources damage to water resource infrastructure and roads pasture degradation soil erosion destruction of riparian vegetation along streams wetlands and lakes competition with wild herbivores for grazing as well as for water resources especially during drought 3 6 forest destruction charcoal provides 70 of the energy for the cooking needs of the average kenyan mewnr 2013 nationwide it is estimated that charcoal production and trade could be providing employment for a million people most of them transporters and vendors at such a level it should be included in economic calculations of the national economy mewnr 2013 within the naivasha basin charcoal is produced in forests as well as in the semi arid lowlands large amounts are transported towards the capital nairobi conversion of wood to charcoal is obtained by means of traditional earthen kilns with a conversion efficiency of only 10 14 mewnr 2013 severe deforestation has affected government gazetted forests despite a charcoal ban from government forests being included in the 2005 forest act such as in the mau and in eburru as well as the lowland a xanthophloea belt stretching some 3 10km towards the east and north of the lake but no estimate of charcoal production in the naivasha basin or its damage has ever been made a survey addressing ecosystem services value among upper catchment farming communities revealed that 73 of the respondents declared they were collecting firewood from nearby forests for daily use all commented that forest resources are declining mulatu et al 2014 deforestation and land cover degradation within the upper catchment was estimated to explain 57 of sediment deposition within the lake odongo et al 2014 landslides caused by forest destruction in 2015 led to loss of life near ol toroto village on the higher western slopes of the lake basin extensive deforestation can lead to significant local temperature increases which are independent from global climate changes hesslerova and pokorny 2010 the influence of trees on local microclimate can develop continental scale teleconnections van noordwijk et al 2014 4 policy framework for future sustainable management lake naivasha basin has undertaken a 25 year journey to its current management plan for 2012 22 anon 2012a the first management plan initiated by the lake naivasha riparian association lnra in 1993 was noteworthy to introduce codes of conduct for each group of lake users flower growers tourism operators beef and dairy producers urban developers geothermal power generation it resulted in the lake being declared a ramsar site in 1995 it was then adopted by the government in 2004 and the lnra was appointed as the secretariat to a lake management committee but the entire operation was stopped by a challenge in the courts in 2005 a new management plan drawing on much of the first was initiated by wetlands international and launched in 2010 anon 2010 then adopted as the tool of the imarisha wrma approach and re edited as the lake naivasha basin integrated management plan anon 2012a to be read alongside the imarisha sustainable development action plan 2012 17 sdap anon 2012b implementation of neither plan has yet occurred because of a number of major challenges the most substantial one is the absence of any funding for practical action at a scale appropriate to produce results both plans are well written particularly the sdap using carefully analysed logical frameworks to identify desirable outcomes pathways and confounding factors both identify organisations responsible for actions such as universities for research knowledge water resources management authority wrma for monitoring data both assume that every organisation involved in writing the plan will implement it yet universities come and go on three year time scales wrma and kenya wildlife service kws staff are rotated around the country on a similar time scale so capacity building recognised as essential is ineffective over a short term all organisations are expected to contribute to the plans without additional funding as an example the lake naivasha water resource users association lanawrua sub catchment management plan scmp was produced in 2009 and submitted to wrma for approval the plan set out proposed activities including water balance and water allocation resource and catchment protection institutional and infrastructural development poverty reduction strategies and tools for monitoring and development throughout its designated sub catchment despite presenting a detailed budget against its objectives the scmp has to date received only ksh 8m of the total ksh 500m requested from the water services trust fund and as such is struggling to fulfil its mandate secondly there is a considerable lack of knowledge and experience among the personnel of water resources users associations wruas and wrma which is partially addressed through training courses attempting to build up the required capacity provided by ngos such as naivasha basin sustainability initiative nbsi see below and worldwide fund for nature wwf wwf in particular has sought to address this problem through focussing upon the institutional partners of wrma and wruas wwf s integrated water resources action plan iwrap was a 4 year strategy 2012 16 directed towards seven defined objectives that effectively sought to implement the 4 broad proposed outcomes of the sdap objectives sought to support water governance institutions wrma and wruas improve technical capacity for resource management and monitoring increase headwater protection and security of water flows conserve riparian land in the catchment through promotion of the payment for ecosystem services pes schemes enhance sustainable floriculture through the adoption of standards strengthen imarisha s capacity to implement the sdap and contribute to the realisation of a long term financing mechanism for the lake naivasha basin a sustainable development fund sdf supported by 13 partner organisations the iwrap sought and received funds of ksh 420m from the dutch embassy to carry out its activities a stronger service providers better services for all in naivasha municipality bsfa management improvement programme was developed in response to wwf s iwrap programme it ran for 4 years 2012 16 and was funded to the tune of 5m jointly between vitens evides and the dutch embassy in nairobi the programme focussed on increasing supply of water to local residents enhancing use of naivasha s sewage treatment plant and supporting regional water sector governance bsfa was successful in enhancing the technical and hr capacity of naivawass the water and sewerage company improving the functioning of the sewage treatment plant increasing supplied water quality and raising the number of connections from 700 to 3600 it also attracted additional donor support for a further 2 years it is evident however that funding can more easily be found for training than for implementation thirdly experts and stakeholders have found gaps not only in this plan but also in the numerous kenyan national laws governing natural resource use across the country overlapping regulations crosscutting issues and rapid landuse changes within the basin have meant required frequent updates of regulations and development are needed to help address these actual and potential threats good examples of these are the lake naivasha catchment area protection order and the lake naivasha ground water conservation order published by wrma under the water act gazettement notices to help guide the exploitation of water resources stakeholders around the lake contributed in identifying gaps and crosscutting issues and initiated a dialogue to lobby for the harmonisation of national laws the 5 year sustainable development action plan 2012 2017 is now to be reviewed to enhance successful implementation of the 2012 2022 integrated management plan finally the baseline information necessary to build up a knowledge base from which the plans can work is lacking in crucial areas a fundamental data set necessary for ecohydrological management and implementation is the number location and volume of abstractions fig 4 elaborated from data collected by the lake naivasha wrua in 2010 showed for the first time that legal licenses to abstract were rare the vast majority of abstractions were from expired licences or were unlicensed the data collected did enable the total abstraction from the lake rivers and groundwater to be quantified however an essential first step further details can be found in de jong 2011 every wrua is now in the process of registering and updating all abstractors discovered in this survey some have been published with external assistance facilitated by wwf e g wrma did this in 2016 for the 4 main wruas of the malewa river while others are ongoing a recent abstraction survey report provides more accurate volumes and locations of abstractions but does not show significant improvement in legality yet abstraction data are essential for any lake ecohydrological model e g becht and harper 2002 effective ecohydrological management requires reliable data about the quantity of water being discharged from the catchment rivers held in the lake and groundwater reservoirs together with the abstraction data a water budget can then be calculated leading to the development of an abstraction policy for the total water resource lake rivers groundwater which includes minimum environmental flows for the rivers and levels in the lake and groundwaters following the basic data collection as above a voluntary abstraction policy was developed by the lake naivasha umbrella wrua and agreed with all the major water users which is based upon agreed lake levels it incorporates a traffic light system whereby at or above a level of 1892 8m above sea level all users agree to abstract up to the maximum of their licence green below this level down to 1885 3m all agreed to reduce their abstractions to a fraction of what they had been licenced to below 1885 3m all agreed to make abstraction an absolute minimum this system was agreed by 2011 when the lake was recovering from a 60 year low only in 2017 did the level of the lake begin declining from a 40 year high so the regulations have never been tested no equivalent system exists even voluntarily relating to river discharge or groundwater levels despite their obvious connection to lake levels a recently developed hydroeconomic model indicated that because of the high productivity of water achieved by modern hydroponic cultures that developed around the lake it seems highly unlikely that a voluntary system or even one based on moderate fines could effectively prevent water overexploitation during particularly dry years kuhn et al 2016 on the other hand controls imposition of heavy fines and enforcement are unlikely to be applicable 5 management response through stakeholder involvement lake naivasha became a unesco help basin in 2004 harper et al 2004 and an ecohydrology demonstration site in 2005 harper and mavuti 2004 this international attention came as recognition of attempts to counteract environmental degradation within the lake naivasha basin carried out by grass root associations and non governmental organisations supported by the scientific results of ecohydrological research over the previous decade these recognitions came in parallel to the growth in sales of cut flowers which led to major growers selling directly to large retailers in uk and other european countries in particular these single link sales as opposed to sales via the amsterdam flower auctions which render the source of flowers either anonymous or dutch made the flower growers susceptible to pressure through their buyers from consumer groups in the country of sale such pressure was fuelled by newspaper articles and international ngo reports about the economic state of workers in the industry and about the ecological state of the lake ecosystem the lake was under serious threat of eutrophication at the turn of the century highlighted by harper 2006 and exacerbated by lake level decline 2005 2009 such that fish deaths occurred in shallow water early 2010 these were almost certainly caused by deoxygenation from the bacterial oxygen demand of suspended sediment njiru et al 2015 whereas people without direct knowledge blindly wrote about pesticide poisoning e g maxey 2014 the consequences of the increased profile of naivasha regardless of the causes resulted in large sources of money being made available from the european cut flower retailers this coincided with the attention of the kenyan government whose prime minster lobbied the uk s prince charles in 2010 who sent a task force to investigate at the same time coincidentally the kenyan water act that had been passed in 2002 gazetted in 2005 was finally coming into effect the government agency wrma was beginning to function a major part of its role was to establish the innovative community based wruas ogada et al 2017 12 wruas were established within the basin fig 5 5 1 stakeholder associations the wruas are one kind of stakeholder association which represent bottom up involvement in the management of natural resources in the catchment but there are others working in partnership all of them are dependent upon the water cycle the four most important are described below 5 1 1 wruas the water resources users associations wruas were established to contribute to the design of site specific solutions to water supply and sanitation needs that are then developed into sub catchment management plans to be implemented in collaboration with government authorities as well as donors the law enables them to be funded by the retention of a fraction of an abstraction fee that is collected from licence holders within each sub catchment collected fees are wholly remitted to nairobi and what should be the wrua share is returned this is not yet happening nevertheless wruas have been strengthened by training provided through funds negotiated by wwf and by the netherlands government under the integrated water resources action plan 2012 2017 additional funding has been provided from cut flower retailers through imarisha see below further training has come as a consequence of ecohydrological restoration demonstration projects from nbsi see below 5 1 2 imarisha naivasha this quasi government organisation was created in 2010 under the initiative of hrh prince of wales international sustainability unit as an umbrella organisation to coordinate all existing governmental non governmental organisations with a concern about and responsibility for the lake and private enterprises involved in using lake resources and willing to contribute to sustainable management harper et al 2011 imarisha manages government ngo and private grants to fund and promote sustainable demonstration projects described below stages stakeholder forums and publishes a regular newsletter illustrating the projects completion as case studies documenting progress in catchment management imarisha naivasha news it operated initially from the prime minister s office but after the 2013 kenyan presidential elections it moved to the ministry of the environment considerable delays in its official re gazettment as part of this ministry have meant that its effectiveness has been blunted and many of the targets of its 5 year development plan imarisha naivasha 2012a 2012b had not been met by 2017 and are being rolled into the next 5 year plan 5 1 3 lnra the lake naivasha riparian association lnra is the oldest and for many years the only stakeholder group around the lake it was created in 1932 initially consisting solely of owners of land that had a riparian boundary as lnroa with the legal right to resolve disputes between adjacent landowners over their use of the dried lakebed when level retreated later it was re launched as lnra to extend to include non owners of riparian land enniskillen 2002 its members now include small individual plot owners large horticultural farmers dairy and ranching operators hotel owners pastoralists fishermen as well as kengen kws naivasha municipal council the ministry of water resources the national environmental management authority nema the fisheries department and the ministry of agriculture the association succeeded in designating the lake naivasha wetlands as a ramsar site in 1995 by developing the first management plan 1995 and two decades later participated in drafting the lake naivasha basin integrated management plan lmbimp 2012 its most relevant activity is the promotion of non infrastructural development within the riparian zone of the lake the association acts as a catalyst in water saving activities basin wide such as the introduction of drip feed irrigation and campaigns for upgrading the municipal sewage treatment works 5 1 4 nbsi the naivasha basin sustainability initiative nbsi was formed as a community based organisation cbo in 2011 regrouping a number of voluntary nature societies around the lake it was coordinated by the authors as part of their ecohydrological research and capacity building funded by two european cut flower retailers coop switzerland and rewe group germany 2010 15 nbsi was established to develop and promote case studies of successful ecohydrological activities which it undertook in parallel with training of wrua members in the knowledge necessary to make them competent citizen scientists under nbsi some of the authors of this article participated in the activities described under sections 6 2 6 3 6 9 6 11 and 6 10 5 2 citizen science the lake levels of naivasha have been recorded since 1905 by members of the yacht club and local landowners these represent a most valuable and long running data set collected by citizens no official collection of lake level exists local nature groups have grown up around the lake over the past decade harper et al 2011 supported by individuals such as a retired medical doctor who founded and supported one in the western edge of the lake and encouraged by the nature kenya kws annual water bird census which is undertaken by local volunteers who are given training the naivasha basin sustainability initiative was formed by these groups and money it raised trained them further to record simple water quality monitoring data transparency ph and conductivity information about the spreading of alien aquatic vegetation lakeshore biotope quality avifauna diversity and distribution along the lakeshore and to report any significant impacts onto the lake fauna birds or fish fig 6 data were collected monthly at six sites along the shores of the lake generating a record that provided information on the status and trends of ecological processes and motivated the participants to try to understand the ecology of the lake no other biological monitoring of the lake exists except the lake wide annual water bird count and the kws coordinated biannual mammal census illustrated in fig 7 are numbers of lesser flamingos phoeniconais minor which can only occur at oloidien lake apart from sporadic and short term sightings elsewhere and small numbers at the isolated volcanic crater lake sonachi in the west a small extinct crater in the south west connected to naivasha at high lake levels but separated without inflows during dry spells when its salinity increases progressively lesser flamingo numbers accurately reflect the salinity changes as salinity drives the arthrospira fusiformis cyanobacterial population upon which they feed flamingo populations rose to several hundred thousand in mid 2006 personal observation until early 2010 krienitz et al 2013 in the year of observation shown here 2012 lake levels were rising rapidly after heavy rains all the previous year salinity was decreasing with a fusiformis also decreasing and p minor numbers dropping as they left to find adequate food at another lake the lake level increases also fig 8 shows numbers of red knobbed coot fulica cristata a freshwater species increasing over the year at crescent island the deepest part of the lake basin but almost absent in the main lake at kamere beach this species feeds mainly on aquatic plants and littoral grasses so is strongly indicative of submerged macrophyte abundance the increase suggests recovery of submerged macrophytes inside crescent island coincident with lake level rise probably here but not kamere due to greater boat and people disturbance there leading to turbidity kamere beach is immediately below a town of about 30 000 people wrua members are being encouraged to act as citizen scientists to collect and maintain river discharge data for the river gauging network is being established by wrma with funding from the iwrap programme this is less successful because local volunteers dedication and commitments are undermined by lack of incentives for example volunteers were promised a small honorarium fee to be paid monthly however payments are irregular and sometimes not at all secondly certain rivers gauging stations become inaccessible during rainy seasons when water levels are high thirdly some gauging stations are dysfunctional due to vandalism fourthly the authenticity of the data collected by the volunteers is uncertain and due to lack of resources it has been difficult to verify the quality of the data a combination of all these constraints reduces the local community s role in research and monitoring to only the lake at present and only when regularly encouraged by professional interest leading to local publicity in newsletters 5 3 national and international ngos it has been shown in section 4 that the national institutional agencies have been unable to carry out their statutory functions without external training most of this has been provided by dutch and uk funding through the wwf kenya office wwf 2012 wwf have managed a programme in naivasha for 15 years now supporting programmes such as the pes section 6 4 as well as training new wrma and wrua officers through the iwrap project 6 implementation of ecohydrological tools local stakeholders initiatives across the basin are summarised here to demonstrate the extent to which ecohydrological tools have been implemented at local scale under this definition we include ecosystem biotechnologies sensu zalewski 2000 directed at enhancing overall ecosystem services by maximising the control of water quality nutrients contaminants and suspended sediments and quantity discharge delivery by riparian and aquatic vegetation as postulated by the fundamental tenets of ecohydrology cited in the introduction section 6 1 small dam rehabilitation there are over 900 small dams throughout the catchment the majority of which were constructed by farmers during the colonial period many have fallen into disrepair all but the very largest a weir across the turasha river which diverts water to supply the needs of nakuru city outside naivasha s watershed lack coordinated management because ownership is uncertain or disputed during the dry season small dams often represent the last source of water for rural communities and their livestock their presence contributes to maintaining moisture moderating local climate supporting biodiversity which are collectively of high ecohydrological value two case studies are described here to illustrate the benefits that can come from a larger scale rehabilitation of these important resources in future at the source of the gilgil river the morendat a public wooded garden has been established at the shore of a dam by the local community it is located so as to infiltrate any liquid effluent that would run downhill from an adjacent urban centre of gwakiongo towards the reservoir during the dry season the dam represents the sole water source for the neighbourhood of about 10 000 people the garden includes a tree nursery which provides labour to unemployed youth it offers educational opportunities for the local schools it provides important regulatory services such as climate moderation sediment retention water purification and biodiversity conservation the community jointly worked to address a challenge of erosion siltation and fenced off the dam to keep off livestock fodder grown under the trees in the garden is cut for livestock and fish from the reservoir are harvested and sold to supply funds for community development this case study represents the only known ecohydrological improvement in the catchment undertaken by a small scale community group without external funding and guidance a second project funded by cut flower retailers in europe zoned three sequential dams on a small tributary of the malewa to reduce water pollution and contamination by cattle and provide clear domestic water firstly the area was fenced to exclude livestock and a zone inside the fences was planted with a mixture of native and fast growing exotic trees to provide community income for management from 5 years hence the dam crests that in the past had been destroyed by high discharges were rehabilitated by extensive sandbag packing based on advice from a civil engineer the consequences were that wetland vegetation in the dam no longer grazed and excluded by light restriction of turbid water was supported and trapped sediment flows the rehabilitated dam increased residence time reduced nutrients and enhanced biodiversity an overflow was maintained at the side of each dam to prevent overtopping and dam damage a pipe was installed from the mid depths to ensure maintaining minimum flow even at times of low water level the tap provided drinking water on demand for humans and livestock and a concrete area provided for clothes washing together the three dams improved the quantity and quality of water supply to 15 000 people in the catchment in addition to local climate amelioration and flood control and provide working examples for future ecohydrological improvements the results were highlighted in the imarisha newsletter to enable other wruas to copy the approach 6 2 organic farming and integrated water harvesting agricultural intensification does not need necessarily to follow a path leading to catchment degradation through forced high inputs in a situation of scarce resources it can occur through a wise use of natural processes of which agroforestry is a key element carsan et al 2014 amidst the drier portion of the naivasha basin to the north of the lake lies a 2 ha farm part of the ndabibi environmental conservation centre a talented secondary school teacher jospat macharia practices sustainable farming in this water scarce area he manages all possible types of water harvesting including off roof and off road this guarantees moisture for his farm even during the dry season when other farmers queue in front of his water tank mixed cropping integrated with chicken bees goat and zero grazing enable the farm to become independent from external inputs productivity is high due to intensive labour and wise organic matter recycling to preserve high soil fertility this model farm is supported by a usa based charity and visited by small holder farming associations from the whole catchment and beyond as well as foreign agriculture experts and academics it has demonstrated that sound water and organic matter management can bring high yields in an apparently monotonous arid landscape of otherwise limited fertility necc farming generates no impacts and also contributes to enhance the cultural service value of the catchment resources necc 2015 6 3 dudutech an integrated pest management private company was created on the shores of lake naivasha in 2001 by the largest horticultural company to help reduce reliance on pesticide use and pesticide residues to address the social and environmental issues surrounding pesticide use to break pesticide resistance cycles in the crops and to promote long term sustainability www dudutech com it became a leading bio pesticide producer and distributor and a referral institute for integrated crop management icm in africa by identifying the major causes of pesticide use and designing integrated biological solutions to reduce reliance on chemicals dudutech facilitated a 90 reduction in synthetic pesticide use in roses between 2003 and 2013 www dudutech com some 17 products consisting of predatory insects fungi and nematodes are grown to supply zero residue biological control products to manage aphids spider mites bulb mites caterpillars cutworms mealy bugs thrips white flies snails and slugs among other pests dudutech solutions have been adopted by a large proportion of local farms within the catchment this improved the socio environmental footprint and mitigated the impacts of pesticide pollution on lake naivasha 6 4 payment for ecosystem services pes economic agreements between upland catchment farmers and riparian companies horticultural and tourist began in 2008 with the support of wwf kenya and care kenya to reduce the impact of farming activities on the steepest slopes in terms of sediment and nutrient export to streams the farms selected had no soil water conservation measures already in place additionally techniques such as livelihood assessment cost benefit analysis and environmental impact assessment were implemented farmers were trained on livelihood enhancement with focus on a soil and water conservation techniques to boost farm productivity b use of improved fodder storage techniques and c use of new higher value crops such as improved potato varieties tree tomatoes and apples they were requested to rehabilitate and maintain riparian zones establish grass strips terraces on their farms to reduce runoff and erosion on steep slopes reduce use of fertilisers and pesticides through integrated crop pest management introduce new improved crop varieties and practice agroforestry using native trees high yielding fruit trees and cover crops for improved farm productivity the project invested usd 20 000 distributed among 974 farmers chiramba et al 2011 long term benefits are expected through enhancement in streamwater quality and quantity improvement in soil fertility and support to biodiversity but none have yet been directly demonstrated because of lack of monitoring the programme has provided small financial benefits to the sellers the upper catchment smallholders but it could not demonstrate advantages for the buyers the lakeside industries largely because the lake is in a considerable distance from the farms and their collective area is a fraction of the catchment the pes scheme remains a successful demonstration which will require considerable up scaling to show buyer benefits as do all other projects 6 5 artificial wetlands for effluent treatment approximately 25 of the largest horticultural enterprises belong to the lake naivasha growers group a voluntary organisation with established a codes of conduct for cut flower standards as well as to demonstrate environmental and social awareness all fair trade certified companies belong to lngg most of these companies have built artificial wetlands to collect all untreated effluents released from their operations before entering the lake or rivers since 2005 when the largest two companies first constructed them artificial wetlands are poorly developed in east africa due to lack of awareness but offer a promising low cost solution to water quality issues kivaisi 2001 they typically consist of constructed lagoons typically positioned at the end of a chain of septic tanks and or waste stabilisation ponds in which effluents undergo enhanced biodegradation mimicking natural wetland processes aquatic vegetation such as water hyacinth cattail reeds papyrus and other cyperaceae are grown to enhance the settling of suspended particles to favour nitrogen removal by denitrification mara 2003 and to partially absorb soluble nutrients the addition of a bacterial mixture is provided to enhance biodigestion finally the partially treated water is pumped up from the lower portion of the lagoons into microfiltration plants that concentrate contaminants into a small volume before safe disposal it is hoped that following this model example more and more large farmers will adopt a no effluent policy to prevent water pollution monitoring conducted at one farm showed that water quality significantly improved from inlet to outlet with conductivity declining from 722μscm 1 to 514μscm 1 while total dissolved solids tds declined from 569 to 186mgl 1 kimani et al 2012 total suspended solids tss biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen and total phosphorus declined significantly p 0 05 from inlet to outlet kimani et al 2012 6 6 forest conservation the kenyan parliament passed a forest act in 2005 gazetted in 2008 which restructured the government forestry service and provided a structure for community involvement in joint management through community forest associations cfas cfas exist for the gazetted forest areas remaining in the upper catchment such as eburru forest in the north of the lake and forest areas outside the aberdare national park in the east this bottom up involvement of communities in the resources that provide the ecosystem services directly to them demonstrate a sustainable ecohydrological approach to management as the following case study illustrates the enaiboro ajijik community comprising about 2000 people holds the communal title deed to olosho rongai forest 650 acres situated between the mau and the eburru gazetted forest blocks this is a rare example of forest conservation entirely managed by local communities olosho rongai maasai meaning narrow ridge forest represents one of the few remaining intact portions of the formerly extensive mau eburru forest complex which was the largest single forest block within east africa the local maasai declare that guarding the forest is the only way to ensure that water keeps running even during the dry season while all other springs coming from deforested sub catchments dry out olosho rongai is represented by a mature stand of the so called red cedar juniperus procera associated with podocarpus spp polyscias spp olea africana prunus africana euphorbia spp dombeya spp and other closed canopy forest species mwinami et al 2016 6 7 biocorridors the concept of establishing wildlife corridors linking different ecosystems within the lake catchment is being developed and promoted by lnra in collaboration with kws and rhino ark as a means of mitigating the worst damage of new economic developments the eburru forest ecosystem is currently being connected to the lake s riparian land and lobbying is underway to connect riparian land owners to prioritise the land for use by wildlife biocorridor creation is meant to provide larger grazing grounds for the dispersion of ungulates that are increasingly encroaching onto riparian land as a consequence of deforestation and fencing throughout the catchment harper and mavuti 2004 biocorridors contribute to restore the natural buffer strip of the lake s riparian and cushion it from direct impacts of anthropogenic activities the creation of biocorridor protects biodiversity prevents land degradation preserves the vegetation and hydraulic soil properties 6 8 riparian stream restoration riparian ecotones have been shown for more than 30 years to be essential in protecting watercourses from the detrimental effects of intensive agriculture and grazing schiemer and zalewski 1992 within temperate zones it is estimated that about 30 of the riparian corridor needs to be kept in natural conditions for the biota within streams to represent unimpaired water quality a similar rule could be expected to hold for streams in kenya griffiths 2001 planting of indigenous trees along riparian streams has been conducted sporadically by local associations as well as local and international ngos the naivasha basin sustainability initiative funded by european cut flower retailers and the german cooperation agency giz implemented the first riparian assessment survey for the catchment to highlight critical portions in need for restoration action imarisha naivasha news issue no 3 2015 this survey highlighted the health status of stream riparian biotopes along three rivers draining the bahati highlands the morendat the kirundu gilgil and the nyairoko malewa and helped identify potential livelihood enhancing strategies that could catalyse successful riparian rehabilitation grazing by cattle and goats produced severe damage to trees planted in freely accessible riparian zones instead fenced riparian plots where farmers agreed to combine trees with crops produced on average 70 success in the rehabilitated areas riparian vegetation controls water temperature as well as water quality the two are strictly connected as cool waters favour atmospheric oxygen invasion and this enhances the potential degradation of organic matter within streams riparian trees increase soil s infiltration capacity reducing surface runoff and sediment accumulation phosphorus tends to accumulate and becomes stored within riparian zones where it is adsorbed onto soils and sediments while bacterial denitrification is the main pathway reducing accumulated nitrogen through these processes and partially also through direct uptake riparian vegetation contributes to keep surface water bodies oligotrophic several other contaminants are also retained including organic pollutants and metals schachtschneider et al 2017 6 9 innovative cooking devices a project entitled jiko kisasa meaning standard cooking stove was recently introduced as an innovative system to enhance the efficiency of fuelwood use for cooking kitui et al 2016 it replaces the traditional three stone fireplace with a stove that reduces the amount of firewood needed for the same output some two hundred artisans were trained in stove making installation and marketing a recent questionnaire distributed among jiko kisasa users demonstrated significant savings in time fuel and money invested in daily cooking as well as health benefits related to lessened respiratory complications and eye infections that are often caused by smoke from traditional fireplaces projects such as alternative means of cooking can have significant benefits for the preservation of forests and for the prevention of land degradation 6 10 papyrus restoration initiatives papyrus has been extensively lost and destroyed from the lake s riparian zone harper and zalewski 2001 harper and mavuti 2004 since 2013 several attempts have been carried out to enlarge the papyrus swamp and to re establish papyrus in shore sections where it had become scarce steps have been taken to approach local farmers willing to give some of their riparian land back to the swamp by artificially enhancing flooding in addition floating islands made of recycled plastic waste material were imported from floating island international usa and planted with papyrus to be set within the lake in places where the shoreline had been spoiled these devices are a case study to provide amenity an extended biotope for fishing communities spawning areas invertebrate food and serve as small treatment wetlands where communities collected drinking water fig 9 6 11 endemic tree nurseries tree diversity can be an important driver of ecosystem service provision ordonez et al 2014 african forest http african forest net a social enterprise situated at soysambu northern edge of the basin promotes seed collection and replanting of endemic forest species to be re established through forest restoration projects the nursery holds currently ca 80 species of endemic trees many of which are employed in the development of new products including foods nutritional food additives medicines and cosmetics african forest s knowledge derives from a science based smart combination of african oral traditions recent scientific recognition of the value of tree derived natural products and originally designed experiments more than 100 000 trees grown by african forest have been planted within the naivasha basin and beyond 7 discussion all of the solutions being implemented mentioned above to counteract the negative effects of recent land use changes can be considered ecohydrological in nature sensu zalewski 2000 2015 as they have sought to re establish water sediment and nutrient retention in soils by promoting water infiltration and by slowing down runoff response to precipitation tables 3 and 5 in these processes the presence of plant roots is vital to maintain optimal soil properties therefore tree plantations and restoring near pristine vegetation are very important measures vegetated riparian areas around lakes and along streams provide a necessary buffer that not only moderates transport of sediments and nutrients from the catchment towards lake and stream water but also influences evapotraspiration and therefore local climate methods designed to monitor stream and lake riparian buffers through the participation of local youth groups have multiple advantages in providing a record of the state of riparian corridors indicating locations that could be targeted by future restoration and motivating the local community towards greater involvement in environmental protection citizen science not only provides an avenue for data collection but also enables the locals to better understand the influences of anthropogenic activities on ecohydrological cycles a well informed community offers greater security in sustaining environmental flows and biodiversity conservation none of the measures described have been evaluated in terms of their benefits because of the significant cost involved in the intensive monitoring of water and sediment transport and of chemical absorption retention nearly all of the above tools have developed spontaneously through local initiatives without the intervention of institutions they are examples of empirical implementation strategies with no previous knowledge their success is remarkable but very difficult to measure at these small scales their value can be interpreted by better documented case studies elsewhere in the ecohydrological literature this can serve the purpose of assisting their replication at other sites within the basin so as to progressively move towards a holistic ecohydrological approach to catchment management there is an urgent need to upscale the successes rather than continue piecemeal small scale actions however it is the usual pathway of environmental conservation across the world to undertake small scale ad hoc actions such as river restoration projects in the developed world palmer et al 2010 the basin s natural dynamics act at a scale that has not yet been practically measured but they must be managed the origin of the rain is remote capricious from far away and dependent upon processes that cannot be controlled from within the basin kuhn et al 2016 global change modellers have not found it easy to predict precipitation over east africa for decades odongo et al 2015 management must therefore take a precautionary approach and maximise the vegetation buffer effect trying to protect riparian zones along streams wetlands and lakes the important knowledge we need is where to apply the tools most effectively this strategy follows the implementation of the precautionary principle established at the rio convention in 1992 the knowledge base in naivasha needs now to be selectively improved to contribute to effective ecohydrological management the department of invertebrate zoology at the national museums of kenya is developing an index of water quality based on stream macroinvertebrates this tool could be implemented within the basin and research conducted by nbsi can provide useful background information the health of the stream bank vegetation is critical to keep erosion and nutrient transport in check therefore riparian zones should be surveyed and restored conserved a targeted risk assessment approach is needed to keep the potential impacts of intensive industrial activities such as existing large greenhouse horticulture and geothermal the proposed industrial development and inland container port within the tolerance of the ecosystem lake fish fillet should be regarded as a key assessment endpoint because people eat it nutrient loads impacting onto water quality should be surveyed and known pollution problems such as naivasha s sewage treatment plant and poor domestic waste disposal should be addressed rather than simply monitored especially with the expected influx of people some form of long term biodiversity monitoring birds riparian vegetation aquatic and terrestrial insects is warranted to enable alertness to degradation trends new threats are represented by the on going eutrophication which could develop into dangerous cyanobacterial blooms producing neurotoxins within the lake as well as within dams for example turasha and wetlands bordering intensive agriculture nyachiro et al 2016 at lake naivasha increasing economic interests have sparked a difficult political confrontation a number of locally founded as well as international organisations have been carrying out activities to counteract catchment degradation debates over stakeholder representativeness bogged down some early attempts at implementing management plans harper et al 2011 the lake produces substantial economic benefits amongst the highest us per litre of water in the world these can be evaluated in terms of the quantity of flowers the number of tourists visiting the lake and the proportion of national electricity produced all these benefits are supported by clean water stored and purified through terrestrial ecosystems as well as wetlands rivers and the lake beside this the upper catchment is part of the national dairy belt which exports milk potatoes and vegetables to the whole nakuru district as well as to nairobi in relation to the high value of the products exported from the basin the level of monitoring and risk assessment which takes place is to say the least inadequate despite the management and action plans the sustainability of most production practices including industrial horticulture geothermal power production and small scale agriculture is questionable pollution and water abstraction go hand in hand with inadequate impact mitigation and insufficient monitoring of potential impacts the great value obtained and the complex links existing between ecosystem health and economic activities within the basin imply that management cannot be simply supported by standard national legislation similarly major decisions cannot be left to become the responsibility of local or even district authorities alone naivasha is no standard lake its high value output makes it a special case which needs immediate government endorsement and implementation of a management plan to include highly targeted monitoring for example horticultural pesticides in fish and meat consumed by humans an extension of the plan should also design and implement eco hydrological restoration measures these must address first of all the protection and restoration of the shoreline papyrus fringe some monitoring has been achieved through the involvement of citizen science as nbsi has shown through the activities carried out in collaboration with five nature groups around the lake this positive experience has however revealed that despite widespread voluntary commitment no long term objectives can be achieved without the financial contribution of those making profits in horticulture power generation and tourism because of the economic weakness that characterises the great majority of the resident stakeholders most of which are underemployed or living as subsistence farmers on small portions of farmland just over a decade ago lake naivasha and its basin hit the national headlines and a great deal of research predicted rapidly declining natural capital through lack of science based management while the only management plan was inaccessible through a legal injunction harper et al 2011 since that time a wider understanding of the real risks has resulted in a plethora of basin plans but action limited to only small scales during that decade the lake went from the lowest since 1945 in 2009 to the highest since 1969 in 2013 the high lake level pushed all the perceived problems to the back of most people s minds now 2017 the lake is declining once more the current drought is inevitably leading to greatly increased abstraction and the management plans and voluntary agreements are about to be tested an ecohydrological solution remains as far away as ever conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgements none funding body none 
1165,applying ecohydrological principles to catchment management provides an opportunity for two distinct but complementary strategies a basis for the interpretation of ecosystem health and a guide for the selection of ecohydrological tools for catchment management the latter include a number of biotechnologies that can support the sustainability of key ecosystem services effectively lake naivasha has been an economic development hub of kenya since pre colonial times now it is dominated by geothermal power production horticulture and floriculture hotel and hospitality small and medium enterprises around the lake together with intensive smallholder cultivations and pasture in the catchment natural resources in the basin have continually attracted diverse local and foreign investments advancement in technologies together with a rapid rise in human population have exacerbated pressure upon the basin s natural capital conflicts between interest groups have often erupted due to fluctuations in water availability and limitations of access to private land flower growers pastoralists fisher folk hoteliers upper catchment and lower catchment communities often accuse one another of engaging in malpractices over resource use these conflicts have more recently resulted in partnerships in resource management however which have helped in the implementation of research informed mitigation measures the most important is the formation of an umbrella organisation imarisha naivasha a quasi government body set up to catalyse sustainability moves it sought to achieve this with a sustainable development action plan sdap 2012 17 and with funding mainly from the dutch government an integrated water resource allocation plan iwrap for catchment wide use of surface and ground waters on smaller scales successful case studies have demonstrated practical ways forward a payment for ecosystem services pes programme in one sub catchment has reduced upper catchment erosion restoration of small dams in another has provided more reliable and cleaner rural water flood retention and enhanced biodiversity around the lake promotion of artificial wetlands that now treat effluent waters from about half the horticultural enterprises recently proposed new mega projects by both the national and the nakuru county governments have brought uncertainty upon the future state of the lake and its catchment plans to develop an industrial park and an inland container port for the new kenyan standard gauge railway from mombasa to naivasha together with the proposal to develop and market naivasha further as an ecotourism and conferencing destination have enhanced speculation on investment opportunities and demographic trends attracting new investors and jobseekers within the framework of ecohydrology we summarise proposed developments and the management challenges they pose and provide examples of ecohydrological tools recommended to contain the negative impacts on fundamental ecosystem processes we review the probability of the successful application of such tools keywords ecohydrology citizen science conflict resolution partnership proactive mitigation sustainability 1 introduction ecohydrology underlines the mutual links existing between hydrological flows and ecosystem functioning mediated via processes that occur through both aquatic and terrestrial vegetation defined by three fundamental hypotheses table 1 changes to discharge and to water quality cause process changes in receiving ecosystems and impacts on vegetation within the catchment hypothesis 1 at the same time through their active role within the water cycle plants regulate hydrology by a evapotranspiration returning flow to the atmosphere which impacts on discharge b water infiltration which affects runoff time response and c water purification which enhances the chemical quality of runoff hypothesis 2 finally the regulatory activities of plants can be enhanced by practical management to benefit the human population e g through environmental flows so as to achieve sustainable development without compromising the ecological functioning of aquatic systems hypothesis 3 the implementation of ecohydrology thus offers a double opportunity as i it provides a strategy for the assessment of modifications to the water cycle and of their likely consequences ii it guides the selection of biotechnologies for integrated river basin management the scale of application of ecohydrological principles and practices is broad and it goes beyond single water bodies to encompass interactions that take place within whole catchments zalewski 2000 zalewski et al 2008 at catchment scale beneficial human alterations to the natural land cover influence large scale hydrological cycles with positive repercussions onto local climate biodiversity and people s health which can be achieved using ecohydrological tools examples are in stream wetlands for river discharge control and for water quality enhancement riparian zone restoration for enhanced water infiltration and protection of streamwater quality from allochthonous pollution reforestation on steep slopes to prevent soil erosion leading to water body siltation restoring catchment ecohydrology will improve essential ecosystem services for the benefit of human societies ma 2005 these are particularly provisional services measured in terms of quantities produced per hectare per year cultural services measured in terms of the cultural and social development of human communities and regulatory services that govern the durability of ecosystem processes without which the concept of sustainability itself would lose any practical meaning de groot et al 2002 this paper offers an overview of human activities that put lake naivasha basin under stress describes tools that have been shown to be promising for counteracting degradation and provides an update of the current state of management proposals we conclude by discussing the probability of management success in an ecohydrological context by providing a focus for assessment as well as a strategy to design solutions ecohydrology can drive resource use planning for the resilience of ecosystems and for the balanced development of local communities 2 ecohydrological characteristics of the naivasha catchment 2 1 hydrology a string of tectonic lakes have developed along the eastern branch of the great rift valley in kenya as a consequence of the tectonic activities that have formed the valley over the past 25 million years naivasha is the rift valley lake at the highest altitude 1888m a s l situated just below the equator it experiences a dual rainfall pattern with long rains occurring between march and may and short rains between october and november the timing and the quantity of precipitation are related in a complex way to the passage of the inter tropical convergence zone governed by the strength of the north easterly monsoon winds from the indian ocean and to seasonal changes in its temperature which provides the major origin of moisture global circulation models currently fail to explain climatic changes during the past millennium therefore climate predictions for this part of the continent are considered highly inaccurate klein et al 2016 much of the lake catchment fig 1 is dry sub humid with an extended annual period of moisture deficit due to high potential evaporation on average 1 32myear 1 odongo et al 2015 about 670mmyear 1 precipitation occurs at the lake shore less at the western catchment edge but significantly more up to around 1525mmyear 1 odongo et al 2015 in the upper catchment to the east and to the north starting from above 2300m which once was entirely covered by natural forests mutubio hydrological station located at 3150m a s l records the average precipitation at 1350mmyear 1 meins 2013 table 2 most of the lower catchment underlain by ancient lake sediments is covered by dry savannah bushes with scattered trees e g acacias and camphor bush which have been extensively converted to arable or horticulture except for the few large ranches to the immediate north of the lake and degraded pastures to the south the lake lies to the west of the nyandarua mountain range whose high plateau stretches in a north south direction its northern peak just below 4000m a s l the nyandarua range and its forest protected by the aberdare national park represent one of the main water towers of the country responsible for the supply of drinking water to nairobi south and east wards drainage as well as the hydrology of the central rift valley western drainage the catchment is under a rain shadow fig 2 meaning that while the eastern slopes of the nyandarua range receive most of rainfall coming from the indian ocean and give rise to the country s largest the tana river which flows eastwards towards the coast for over 800km the more modest runoff generated by the western slopes feeds into naivasha and north of the kinangop plateau lake ol bolossat one of the sources of the river ewaso njiro north naivasha is a remarkable exception to almost all the other lakes on the eastern rift floor which are saline alkaline due to evaporation exceeding inflow naivasha waters remain fresh thanks to lower evaporation at its higher altitude and to underground seepages both northwards and southwards that prevent salt accumulation within the basin gaudet and melack 1981 seepage was estimated to account for 15 of outflows bergner et al 2003 the naivasha catchment area is approximately 3376km2 meins 2013 but the surface area that can be considered hydrologically active i e contributing to maintain lake levels was estimated to be just over half that odongo et al 2014 its major sub catchment the malewa river 1730km2 flows from the northern steep forested eastern slopes of the nyandarua 3989m a s l onto the kinangop plateau 2483m a s l fig 2 its average annual rainfall is 1087 5mm its main tributary the turasha river which drains the southern nyandarua and contributes the greatest portion of runoff to the lake joins it at the foot of kipipiri mountain the gilgil river sub catchment 527km2 rises at 2772 on the bahati highlands where average annual rainfall reaches 1300mm and flows in a southerly direction between narrow ridges it begins as two streams the morendat the kiriũndũ which merge to become the gigil river and are then joined by the little gilgil at gilgil town its discharge tends to become very low during the dry season and once in a decade the main river may dry out completely during particularly severe droughts such as in 2009 and recently in early 2017 the karati temporary stream rises at 2648m in the southeast and drains 149km2 its runoff reaches the lake only during the rainy seasons few other highly seasonal streams drain the southern and western parts of the catchment 2 2 land use since the advent of colonisation the catchment has undergone intense deforestation and establishment of ranches within the lake edge and catchment but frequent lake level oscillations prevented successful farming within the immediate lakeshore further recent declines in forest 5 4 and bushland 26 4 have been recorded from the catchment between 1973 and 2011 using remote sensing techniques odongo et al 2014 today the largest portion of the catchment is occupied by smallholder as well as a few large farms table 3 in the early 1980s successful experiments in the production of cut flowers led to the development of a horticultural industry dependent upon irrigation which experienced rapid expansion in the past two decades up to at least 6000ha mostly around the lake and within 5km of its edge rural focus 2006 mutiba 2008 2 3 population population around the lake including naivasha town had more than doubled within a decade from 158 679 in 1999 to 376 243 in 2009 onywere et al 2012 it is currently speculated that it might now be above 500 000 this figure is expected to triple over the next decade if current planned investments take place official census data claim that before 2009 the entire catchment hosted 650 000 people knbs 2009 about a dozen different tribes make up the population a cultural enrichment but also a challenge because of the relative fragmentation of this relatively recent social assemblage three quarters of the population is self employed or not in employment the private sector employs 17 8 while government employs 7 3 real plan consultants 2015 the distribution of settlements across the catchment is unplanned with large informal linear settlements that have been developed along the nairobi nakuru the moi south lake and the kinangop roads they have developed around commercial nodes including the central business district cbd kayole karagita kinamba and kamere new towns fig 3 see below 2 4 lake ecology the lake pan is shallow with 3 3m average depth table 4 and a warm water column on average 23 c stirred by strong afternoon winds linked to convective evaporation the shallow morphology of the basin and reliance on distant sources of moisture indian ocean that are dependent on global circulation processes mean that the lake volume tends to undergo remarkable fluctuations during the last decade up to 30 year 1 with a shoreline change that in some years has exceeded 100myear 1 horizontal this characteristic is reflected in the lake s original maasai name enaiposha meaning moving waters the ecological history of the lake has been summarised in harper et al 1990 2002 2011 its ecology changed out of all recognition from its natural state up to 1975 due to a succession of alien species arrivals which have totally replaced aquatic macrophytes and fish applying ecohydrological thinking to this scenario would immediately draw attention to the key role of the vegetation in mountain forests as well as in stream and lake riparian zones for moderating the high natural variability of hydrological fluxes and chemical contaminants from humans as well as soil erosion 3 drivers of anthropogenic impact reconstructions based upon lake sediment cores proved that the first detectable human impacts onto the ecology of lake naivasha began around the mid xx century following the settlement of european colonisers along the lake shore and within the catchment mergeay et al 2004 stoof leichsenring et al 2011 these early changes induced an acceleration of the sedimentation rate and marked the start of a progressive eutrophication process that has been increasing ever since harper et al 1993 2004 direct abstractions from the lake and from the underlying aquifer supply two large industries irrigated horticulture agriculture and geothermal power a third large water consumer that is currently undergoing rapid growth is residential development groundwater levels around the lake area are now believed to be in serious decline reta 2011 cited by van oel et al 2013 rivers and groundwater are used to supply naivasha and gilgil towns as well as nakuru city which lies outside the basin 18 000m3 per day are taken from the turasha dam for nakuru otiang a owiti and oswe 2007 overall water abstractions were estimated to amount to approximately 40mm3 year 1 equivalent to ca 20 of the annual river inflow de jong 2011 cited in hogeboom et al 2015 it is estimated that collectively these abstractions have caused a steady lake level decline becht and harper 2002 averaged at 6cmyear 1 odongo et al 2015 over the past two decades a severe drought developed in the four years up to in 2009 at that time lake abstractions increased because of a lack of alternative water sources and the lake was 1m below its predicted natural level becht and harper loc cit it is estimated that the impact of water abstractions is keeping lake levels about 1m below natural level continuously van oel et al 2013 the rise in human population has also led to increased pressure on the lake riparian zone manifest in local deforestation of the riparian acacia xanthophloea woodland littoral water pollution illegal fishing cattle trampling and degradation of the papyrus cyperus papyrus littoral fringe that formerly encircled the entire lake harper and mavuti 2004 the proliferation of small scale agriculture in the wider basin has extended cultivation up to river banks and partly also within the lake shore with a consequent increase in erosion leading to enhanced lake sedimentation boar and harper 2002 3 1 flower farming kenya s cut flower industry is an economic success because it contributed an annual average of us 141 million in foreign exchange 7 of the value of kenyan exports over the period 1996 2005 and about us 352 million in 2005 alone mekkonen et al 2012 the industry has provided employment to up to 70 000 people kuhn et al 2016 and developed infrastructure such as schools and hospitals collectively naivasha producers have created one of the largest flower farm districts worldwide that accounts for 70 of the national flower exports kuhn et al 2016 the success of the industry is linked to the abundant up to now readily available water supplies and to the cool night temperatures at this altitude impacts caused by flower production have been high water abstraction enhanced evaporation virtual water export and perceived pesticide and nutrient pollution it has been estimated that 2 3 of the water abstraction from the entire lake basin is caused by the flower farms established around the lakeshore meins 2013 the overall catchment surface covered by flower production reached nearly 6000ha in 2007 mutiba 2008 unpublished thesis and has slowly increased since then pers obs most farms are in proximity to the lakeshore where 5025ha have riparian frontage kuhn et al 2016 the water footprint of one rose is estimated to be 7 13l mekkonen et al 2012 the total virtual water export by cut flower exports from the lake naivasha basin was thus 16mm3 year 1 during the period 1996 2005 22 green water 45 blue water 33 grey water mekkonen et al loc cit another estimate of overall water abstractions within the basin by the horticultural sector is 71 with cut flowers alone accounting for as much as 58 odongo et al 2014 3 2 power generation in the early 1930s a small scale geothermal power plant was originally developed at hell s gate near the shores of lake naivasha occupied by active volcanic fields by italian engineers who had just built a similar one in a volcanic portion of tuscany in central italy they simply installed a turbine on top of a geyser to convert hot steam into electricity the first plant of this kind in africa much later this plant was extended by the kenya government and 30 of kenya geothermal energy generating company kengen was privatised in 2006 followed by support from chinese government commencing 2010 at present kengen extracts water from the lake and pumps it to depths exceeding 1km reaching deep geological strata at high temperature this generates an artificial geyser whose thermal energy is then converted to electricity at the surface which is transferred to the national grid kengen owns 31 power generating plants across the country with a combined installed capacity of 1337mw out of which 365mw is geothermal www kengen co ke according to ogada et al 2017 the ol karia geothermal power plant has a potential of 162mw and generates about 15 of kenya s electric power recently published plans by kengen are to expand by 60mw and maybe more to be generated by a line of power plants along the rift valley from naivasha towards nakuru and beyond across national parks wildlife sanctuaries and gazetted forests hell s gate national park originally set up as an important site for 5 sympatric vulture species contains two large power generation stations within its boundaries the rare and threatened lammergeier gypaetus barbatus meridionalis was the first one to disappear followed by the critically endangered african white backed vulture gyps africanus endangered egyptian vulture neophron p percnopterus and endangered lappet faced vulture torgos t tracheliotus only few individuals of the critically endangered rüppell s griffon vulture gyps r rueppellii still persist birds have been electrocuted by high voltage power lines both birds and mammals have been poisoned by the caustic brines produced during power generation and mammals are regularly killed on the tarmac high speed roads used by transport within the park thornett 2017 apart from severe loss of biodiversity kengen operations are responsible for heavy water consumption during a survey of water consumption conducted in 2009 kengen was the sole water user within the basin that refused to declare its current water abstraction 3 3 informal settlements informal settlements have recently grown along the south lake road housing flower farm workers and their families fig 3 other centres are spreading close to naivasha town kihoto on the lake edge just south of naivasha town as well as in the north kasarani these centres lack adequate planning and basic urban infrastructure including lighting water supply runoff drainage and sewerage consequently the resident population makes full use of the lake riparian shores for vegetable gardens water abstraction and cattle drinking as well as for personal and clothes washing waste is dumped in large pits just beyond the riparian fringe open to grazing and scavenging domestic animals human excreta dumped in pit latrines slowly percolate into the lake aquifer naivasha town itself has also grown dramatically during the past 40 years such that only about a third of the urban area is served by sewerage the rest has the same sanitation as peri urban settlements pit latrines the sewage treatment plant on the lakeward side of the railway station serving this small fraction of the town is a modern activated sludge plant constructed as an aid package by a scandinavian country about 40 years ago its pumps were stolen shortly after construction and never replaced it has since opened operated at a fraction of its efficiency passing sewage through three treatment lagoons before being discharged into a ditch at the upper part of the riparian zone the liquid in the ditch disappears into the soils after few hundred metres only when the lake is at its highest water level does partly treated sewage enter it directly at all other times at least nutrients and possibly also enteric bacteria reach groundwater which is directly connected to the lake aquifer causing measurable eutrophication deoxygenation and fish kills in the proximal lake shore pacini unpublished 3 4 tourism and residential growth mild weather scenic lake views constant water supply high number of bird species and proximity to nairobi have given naivasha a global tourist reputation now supported by quality hotel and conference facilities new luxury hotels have been built on the south lake road while upper class gated residence estates are being built all around the riparian fringe with attractive lake views none of these developments is connected to a sewage treatment network but to individual septic tanks and their collective water consumption is unknown most developments within riparian frontage have cleared their papyrus fringes and all other riparian species because guests wish to see the lake water anonymous hotel manager comment campsites are expanding and lake edges are heavily used for boat rides 3 5 pastoralism traditional maasai pastoralism is the prominent land use in the central and western portion of the naivasha catchment on the rift valley floor where agriculture is more difficult without steady irrigation here groundwater is of low quality and the distance from the lake doesn t allow direct abstraction the number of cattle owned by herdsmen represents their personal wealth despite the condition of individual animals which can be very poor at times during dry seasons when other sources of water have dried up cattle are taken down to the lake edge where cows graze on papyrus umbels destroying the riparian fringe morrison and harper 2009 and some even consume alien water hyacinth up to 30 000 head of cattle could be seen grazing within the lake s riparian zone on a single day in 2009 harper et al 2011 extensive pastoralism is becoming common throughout kenya and a profitable way of investing money large herds managed by maasai boys are often the property of affluent politicians and businessmen based in nairobi impacts caused by pastoralism also include pollution of water resources damage to water resource infrastructure and roads pasture degradation soil erosion destruction of riparian vegetation along streams wetlands and lakes competition with wild herbivores for grazing as well as for water resources especially during drought 3 6 forest destruction charcoal provides 70 of the energy for the cooking needs of the average kenyan mewnr 2013 nationwide it is estimated that charcoal production and trade could be providing employment for a million people most of them transporters and vendors at such a level it should be included in economic calculations of the national economy mewnr 2013 within the naivasha basin charcoal is produced in forests as well as in the semi arid lowlands large amounts are transported towards the capital nairobi conversion of wood to charcoal is obtained by means of traditional earthen kilns with a conversion efficiency of only 10 14 mewnr 2013 severe deforestation has affected government gazetted forests despite a charcoal ban from government forests being included in the 2005 forest act such as in the mau and in eburru as well as the lowland a xanthophloea belt stretching some 3 10km towards the east and north of the lake but no estimate of charcoal production in the naivasha basin or its damage has ever been made a survey addressing ecosystem services value among upper catchment farming communities revealed that 73 of the respondents declared they were collecting firewood from nearby forests for daily use all commented that forest resources are declining mulatu et al 2014 deforestation and land cover degradation within the upper catchment was estimated to explain 57 of sediment deposition within the lake odongo et al 2014 landslides caused by forest destruction in 2015 led to loss of life near ol toroto village on the higher western slopes of the lake basin extensive deforestation can lead to significant local temperature increases which are independent from global climate changes hesslerova and pokorny 2010 the influence of trees on local microclimate can develop continental scale teleconnections van noordwijk et al 2014 4 policy framework for future sustainable management lake naivasha basin has undertaken a 25 year journey to its current management plan for 2012 22 anon 2012a the first management plan initiated by the lake naivasha riparian association lnra in 1993 was noteworthy to introduce codes of conduct for each group of lake users flower growers tourism operators beef and dairy producers urban developers geothermal power generation it resulted in the lake being declared a ramsar site in 1995 it was then adopted by the government in 2004 and the lnra was appointed as the secretariat to a lake management committee but the entire operation was stopped by a challenge in the courts in 2005 a new management plan drawing on much of the first was initiated by wetlands international and launched in 2010 anon 2010 then adopted as the tool of the imarisha wrma approach and re edited as the lake naivasha basin integrated management plan anon 2012a to be read alongside the imarisha sustainable development action plan 2012 17 sdap anon 2012b implementation of neither plan has yet occurred because of a number of major challenges the most substantial one is the absence of any funding for practical action at a scale appropriate to produce results both plans are well written particularly the sdap using carefully analysed logical frameworks to identify desirable outcomes pathways and confounding factors both identify organisations responsible for actions such as universities for research knowledge water resources management authority wrma for monitoring data both assume that every organisation involved in writing the plan will implement it yet universities come and go on three year time scales wrma and kenya wildlife service kws staff are rotated around the country on a similar time scale so capacity building recognised as essential is ineffective over a short term all organisations are expected to contribute to the plans without additional funding as an example the lake naivasha water resource users association lanawrua sub catchment management plan scmp was produced in 2009 and submitted to wrma for approval the plan set out proposed activities including water balance and water allocation resource and catchment protection institutional and infrastructural development poverty reduction strategies and tools for monitoring and development throughout its designated sub catchment despite presenting a detailed budget against its objectives the scmp has to date received only ksh 8m of the total ksh 500m requested from the water services trust fund and as such is struggling to fulfil its mandate secondly there is a considerable lack of knowledge and experience among the personnel of water resources users associations wruas and wrma which is partially addressed through training courses attempting to build up the required capacity provided by ngos such as naivasha basin sustainability initiative nbsi see below and worldwide fund for nature wwf wwf in particular has sought to address this problem through focussing upon the institutional partners of wrma and wruas wwf s integrated water resources action plan iwrap was a 4 year strategy 2012 16 directed towards seven defined objectives that effectively sought to implement the 4 broad proposed outcomes of the sdap objectives sought to support water governance institutions wrma and wruas improve technical capacity for resource management and monitoring increase headwater protection and security of water flows conserve riparian land in the catchment through promotion of the payment for ecosystem services pes schemes enhance sustainable floriculture through the adoption of standards strengthen imarisha s capacity to implement the sdap and contribute to the realisation of a long term financing mechanism for the lake naivasha basin a sustainable development fund sdf supported by 13 partner organisations the iwrap sought and received funds of ksh 420m from the dutch embassy to carry out its activities a stronger service providers better services for all in naivasha municipality bsfa management improvement programme was developed in response to wwf s iwrap programme it ran for 4 years 2012 16 and was funded to the tune of 5m jointly between vitens evides and the dutch embassy in nairobi the programme focussed on increasing supply of water to local residents enhancing use of naivasha s sewage treatment plant and supporting regional water sector governance bsfa was successful in enhancing the technical and hr capacity of naivawass the water and sewerage company improving the functioning of the sewage treatment plant increasing supplied water quality and raising the number of connections from 700 to 3600 it also attracted additional donor support for a further 2 years it is evident however that funding can more easily be found for training than for implementation thirdly experts and stakeholders have found gaps not only in this plan but also in the numerous kenyan national laws governing natural resource use across the country overlapping regulations crosscutting issues and rapid landuse changes within the basin have meant required frequent updates of regulations and development are needed to help address these actual and potential threats good examples of these are the lake naivasha catchment area protection order and the lake naivasha ground water conservation order published by wrma under the water act gazettement notices to help guide the exploitation of water resources stakeholders around the lake contributed in identifying gaps and crosscutting issues and initiated a dialogue to lobby for the harmonisation of national laws the 5 year sustainable development action plan 2012 2017 is now to be reviewed to enhance successful implementation of the 2012 2022 integrated management plan finally the baseline information necessary to build up a knowledge base from which the plans can work is lacking in crucial areas a fundamental data set necessary for ecohydrological management and implementation is the number location and volume of abstractions fig 4 elaborated from data collected by the lake naivasha wrua in 2010 showed for the first time that legal licenses to abstract were rare the vast majority of abstractions were from expired licences or were unlicensed the data collected did enable the total abstraction from the lake rivers and groundwater to be quantified however an essential first step further details can be found in de jong 2011 every wrua is now in the process of registering and updating all abstractors discovered in this survey some have been published with external assistance facilitated by wwf e g wrma did this in 2016 for the 4 main wruas of the malewa river while others are ongoing a recent abstraction survey report provides more accurate volumes and locations of abstractions but does not show significant improvement in legality yet abstraction data are essential for any lake ecohydrological model e g becht and harper 2002 effective ecohydrological management requires reliable data about the quantity of water being discharged from the catchment rivers held in the lake and groundwater reservoirs together with the abstraction data a water budget can then be calculated leading to the development of an abstraction policy for the total water resource lake rivers groundwater which includes minimum environmental flows for the rivers and levels in the lake and groundwaters following the basic data collection as above a voluntary abstraction policy was developed by the lake naivasha umbrella wrua and agreed with all the major water users which is based upon agreed lake levels it incorporates a traffic light system whereby at or above a level of 1892 8m above sea level all users agree to abstract up to the maximum of their licence green below this level down to 1885 3m all agreed to reduce their abstractions to a fraction of what they had been licenced to below 1885 3m all agreed to make abstraction an absolute minimum this system was agreed by 2011 when the lake was recovering from a 60 year low only in 2017 did the level of the lake begin declining from a 40 year high so the regulations have never been tested no equivalent system exists even voluntarily relating to river discharge or groundwater levels despite their obvious connection to lake levels a recently developed hydroeconomic model indicated that because of the high productivity of water achieved by modern hydroponic cultures that developed around the lake it seems highly unlikely that a voluntary system or even one based on moderate fines could effectively prevent water overexploitation during particularly dry years kuhn et al 2016 on the other hand controls imposition of heavy fines and enforcement are unlikely to be applicable 5 management response through stakeholder involvement lake naivasha became a unesco help basin in 2004 harper et al 2004 and an ecohydrology demonstration site in 2005 harper and mavuti 2004 this international attention came as recognition of attempts to counteract environmental degradation within the lake naivasha basin carried out by grass root associations and non governmental organisations supported by the scientific results of ecohydrological research over the previous decade these recognitions came in parallel to the growth in sales of cut flowers which led to major growers selling directly to large retailers in uk and other european countries in particular these single link sales as opposed to sales via the amsterdam flower auctions which render the source of flowers either anonymous or dutch made the flower growers susceptible to pressure through their buyers from consumer groups in the country of sale such pressure was fuelled by newspaper articles and international ngo reports about the economic state of workers in the industry and about the ecological state of the lake ecosystem the lake was under serious threat of eutrophication at the turn of the century highlighted by harper 2006 and exacerbated by lake level decline 2005 2009 such that fish deaths occurred in shallow water early 2010 these were almost certainly caused by deoxygenation from the bacterial oxygen demand of suspended sediment njiru et al 2015 whereas people without direct knowledge blindly wrote about pesticide poisoning e g maxey 2014 the consequences of the increased profile of naivasha regardless of the causes resulted in large sources of money being made available from the european cut flower retailers this coincided with the attention of the kenyan government whose prime minster lobbied the uk s prince charles in 2010 who sent a task force to investigate at the same time coincidentally the kenyan water act that had been passed in 2002 gazetted in 2005 was finally coming into effect the government agency wrma was beginning to function a major part of its role was to establish the innovative community based wruas ogada et al 2017 12 wruas were established within the basin fig 5 5 1 stakeholder associations the wruas are one kind of stakeholder association which represent bottom up involvement in the management of natural resources in the catchment but there are others working in partnership all of them are dependent upon the water cycle the four most important are described below 5 1 1 wruas the water resources users associations wruas were established to contribute to the design of site specific solutions to water supply and sanitation needs that are then developed into sub catchment management plans to be implemented in collaboration with government authorities as well as donors the law enables them to be funded by the retention of a fraction of an abstraction fee that is collected from licence holders within each sub catchment collected fees are wholly remitted to nairobi and what should be the wrua share is returned this is not yet happening nevertheless wruas have been strengthened by training provided through funds negotiated by wwf and by the netherlands government under the integrated water resources action plan 2012 2017 additional funding has been provided from cut flower retailers through imarisha see below further training has come as a consequence of ecohydrological restoration demonstration projects from nbsi see below 5 1 2 imarisha naivasha this quasi government organisation was created in 2010 under the initiative of hrh prince of wales international sustainability unit as an umbrella organisation to coordinate all existing governmental non governmental organisations with a concern about and responsibility for the lake and private enterprises involved in using lake resources and willing to contribute to sustainable management harper et al 2011 imarisha manages government ngo and private grants to fund and promote sustainable demonstration projects described below stages stakeholder forums and publishes a regular newsletter illustrating the projects completion as case studies documenting progress in catchment management imarisha naivasha news it operated initially from the prime minister s office but after the 2013 kenyan presidential elections it moved to the ministry of the environment considerable delays in its official re gazettment as part of this ministry have meant that its effectiveness has been blunted and many of the targets of its 5 year development plan imarisha naivasha 2012a 2012b had not been met by 2017 and are being rolled into the next 5 year plan 5 1 3 lnra the lake naivasha riparian association lnra is the oldest and for many years the only stakeholder group around the lake it was created in 1932 initially consisting solely of owners of land that had a riparian boundary as lnroa with the legal right to resolve disputes between adjacent landowners over their use of the dried lakebed when level retreated later it was re launched as lnra to extend to include non owners of riparian land enniskillen 2002 its members now include small individual plot owners large horticultural farmers dairy and ranching operators hotel owners pastoralists fishermen as well as kengen kws naivasha municipal council the ministry of water resources the national environmental management authority nema the fisheries department and the ministry of agriculture the association succeeded in designating the lake naivasha wetlands as a ramsar site in 1995 by developing the first management plan 1995 and two decades later participated in drafting the lake naivasha basin integrated management plan lmbimp 2012 its most relevant activity is the promotion of non infrastructural development within the riparian zone of the lake the association acts as a catalyst in water saving activities basin wide such as the introduction of drip feed irrigation and campaigns for upgrading the municipal sewage treatment works 5 1 4 nbsi the naivasha basin sustainability initiative nbsi was formed as a community based organisation cbo in 2011 regrouping a number of voluntary nature societies around the lake it was coordinated by the authors as part of their ecohydrological research and capacity building funded by two european cut flower retailers coop switzerland and rewe group germany 2010 15 nbsi was established to develop and promote case studies of successful ecohydrological activities which it undertook in parallel with training of wrua members in the knowledge necessary to make them competent citizen scientists under nbsi some of the authors of this article participated in the activities described under sections 6 2 6 3 6 9 6 11 and 6 10 5 2 citizen science the lake levels of naivasha have been recorded since 1905 by members of the yacht club and local landowners these represent a most valuable and long running data set collected by citizens no official collection of lake level exists local nature groups have grown up around the lake over the past decade harper et al 2011 supported by individuals such as a retired medical doctor who founded and supported one in the western edge of the lake and encouraged by the nature kenya kws annual water bird census which is undertaken by local volunteers who are given training the naivasha basin sustainability initiative was formed by these groups and money it raised trained them further to record simple water quality monitoring data transparency ph and conductivity information about the spreading of alien aquatic vegetation lakeshore biotope quality avifauna diversity and distribution along the lakeshore and to report any significant impacts onto the lake fauna birds or fish fig 6 data were collected monthly at six sites along the shores of the lake generating a record that provided information on the status and trends of ecological processes and motivated the participants to try to understand the ecology of the lake no other biological monitoring of the lake exists except the lake wide annual water bird count and the kws coordinated biannual mammal census illustrated in fig 7 are numbers of lesser flamingos phoeniconais minor which can only occur at oloidien lake apart from sporadic and short term sightings elsewhere and small numbers at the isolated volcanic crater lake sonachi in the west a small extinct crater in the south west connected to naivasha at high lake levels but separated without inflows during dry spells when its salinity increases progressively lesser flamingo numbers accurately reflect the salinity changes as salinity drives the arthrospira fusiformis cyanobacterial population upon which they feed flamingo populations rose to several hundred thousand in mid 2006 personal observation until early 2010 krienitz et al 2013 in the year of observation shown here 2012 lake levels were rising rapidly after heavy rains all the previous year salinity was decreasing with a fusiformis also decreasing and p minor numbers dropping as they left to find adequate food at another lake the lake level increases also fig 8 shows numbers of red knobbed coot fulica cristata a freshwater species increasing over the year at crescent island the deepest part of the lake basin but almost absent in the main lake at kamere beach this species feeds mainly on aquatic plants and littoral grasses so is strongly indicative of submerged macrophyte abundance the increase suggests recovery of submerged macrophytes inside crescent island coincident with lake level rise probably here but not kamere due to greater boat and people disturbance there leading to turbidity kamere beach is immediately below a town of about 30 000 people wrua members are being encouraged to act as citizen scientists to collect and maintain river discharge data for the river gauging network is being established by wrma with funding from the iwrap programme this is less successful because local volunteers dedication and commitments are undermined by lack of incentives for example volunteers were promised a small honorarium fee to be paid monthly however payments are irregular and sometimes not at all secondly certain rivers gauging stations become inaccessible during rainy seasons when water levels are high thirdly some gauging stations are dysfunctional due to vandalism fourthly the authenticity of the data collected by the volunteers is uncertain and due to lack of resources it has been difficult to verify the quality of the data a combination of all these constraints reduces the local community s role in research and monitoring to only the lake at present and only when regularly encouraged by professional interest leading to local publicity in newsletters 5 3 national and international ngos it has been shown in section 4 that the national institutional agencies have been unable to carry out their statutory functions without external training most of this has been provided by dutch and uk funding through the wwf kenya office wwf 2012 wwf have managed a programme in naivasha for 15 years now supporting programmes such as the pes section 6 4 as well as training new wrma and wrua officers through the iwrap project 6 implementation of ecohydrological tools local stakeholders initiatives across the basin are summarised here to demonstrate the extent to which ecohydrological tools have been implemented at local scale under this definition we include ecosystem biotechnologies sensu zalewski 2000 directed at enhancing overall ecosystem services by maximising the control of water quality nutrients contaminants and suspended sediments and quantity discharge delivery by riparian and aquatic vegetation as postulated by the fundamental tenets of ecohydrology cited in the introduction section 6 1 small dam rehabilitation there are over 900 small dams throughout the catchment the majority of which were constructed by farmers during the colonial period many have fallen into disrepair all but the very largest a weir across the turasha river which diverts water to supply the needs of nakuru city outside naivasha s watershed lack coordinated management because ownership is uncertain or disputed during the dry season small dams often represent the last source of water for rural communities and their livestock their presence contributes to maintaining moisture moderating local climate supporting biodiversity which are collectively of high ecohydrological value two case studies are described here to illustrate the benefits that can come from a larger scale rehabilitation of these important resources in future at the source of the gilgil river the morendat a public wooded garden has been established at the shore of a dam by the local community it is located so as to infiltrate any liquid effluent that would run downhill from an adjacent urban centre of gwakiongo towards the reservoir during the dry season the dam represents the sole water source for the neighbourhood of about 10 000 people the garden includes a tree nursery which provides labour to unemployed youth it offers educational opportunities for the local schools it provides important regulatory services such as climate moderation sediment retention water purification and biodiversity conservation the community jointly worked to address a challenge of erosion siltation and fenced off the dam to keep off livestock fodder grown under the trees in the garden is cut for livestock and fish from the reservoir are harvested and sold to supply funds for community development this case study represents the only known ecohydrological improvement in the catchment undertaken by a small scale community group without external funding and guidance a second project funded by cut flower retailers in europe zoned three sequential dams on a small tributary of the malewa to reduce water pollution and contamination by cattle and provide clear domestic water firstly the area was fenced to exclude livestock and a zone inside the fences was planted with a mixture of native and fast growing exotic trees to provide community income for management from 5 years hence the dam crests that in the past had been destroyed by high discharges were rehabilitated by extensive sandbag packing based on advice from a civil engineer the consequences were that wetland vegetation in the dam no longer grazed and excluded by light restriction of turbid water was supported and trapped sediment flows the rehabilitated dam increased residence time reduced nutrients and enhanced biodiversity an overflow was maintained at the side of each dam to prevent overtopping and dam damage a pipe was installed from the mid depths to ensure maintaining minimum flow even at times of low water level the tap provided drinking water on demand for humans and livestock and a concrete area provided for clothes washing together the three dams improved the quantity and quality of water supply to 15 000 people in the catchment in addition to local climate amelioration and flood control and provide working examples for future ecohydrological improvements the results were highlighted in the imarisha newsletter to enable other wruas to copy the approach 6 2 organic farming and integrated water harvesting agricultural intensification does not need necessarily to follow a path leading to catchment degradation through forced high inputs in a situation of scarce resources it can occur through a wise use of natural processes of which agroforestry is a key element carsan et al 2014 amidst the drier portion of the naivasha basin to the north of the lake lies a 2 ha farm part of the ndabibi environmental conservation centre a talented secondary school teacher jospat macharia practices sustainable farming in this water scarce area he manages all possible types of water harvesting including off roof and off road this guarantees moisture for his farm even during the dry season when other farmers queue in front of his water tank mixed cropping integrated with chicken bees goat and zero grazing enable the farm to become independent from external inputs productivity is high due to intensive labour and wise organic matter recycling to preserve high soil fertility this model farm is supported by a usa based charity and visited by small holder farming associations from the whole catchment and beyond as well as foreign agriculture experts and academics it has demonstrated that sound water and organic matter management can bring high yields in an apparently monotonous arid landscape of otherwise limited fertility necc farming generates no impacts and also contributes to enhance the cultural service value of the catchment resources necc 2015 6 3 dudutech an integrated pest management private company was created on the shores of lake naivasha in 2001 by the largest horticultural company to help reduce reliance on pesticide use and pesticide residues to address the social and environmental issues surrounding pesticide use to break pesticide resistance cycles in the crops and to promote long term sustainability www dudutech com it became a leading bio pesticide producer and distributor and a referral institute for integrated crop management icm in africa by identifying the major causes of pesticide use and designing integrated biological solutions to reduce reliance on chemicals dudutech facilitated a 90 reduction in synthetic pesticide use in roses between 2003 and 2013 www dudutech com some 17 products consisting of predatory insects fungi and nematodes are grown to supply zero residue biological control products to manage aphids spider mites bulb mites caterpillars cutworms mealy bugs thrips white flies snails and slugs among other pests dudutech solutions have been adopted by a large proportion of local farms within the catchment this improved the socio environmental footprint and mitigated the impacts of pesticide pollution on lake naivasha 6 4 payment for ecosystem services pes economic agreements between upland catchment farmers and riparian companies horticultural and tourist began in 2008 with the support of wwf kenya and care kenya to reduce the impact of farming activities on the steepest slopes in terms of sediment and nutrient export to streams the farms selected had no soil water conservation measures already in place additionally techniques such as livelihood assessment cost benefit analysis and environmental impact assessment were implemented farmers were trained on livelihood enhancement with focus on a soil and water conservation techniques to boost farm productivity b use of improved fodder storage techniques and c use of new higher value crops such as improved potato varieties tree tomatoes and apples they were requested to rehabilitate and maintain riparian zones establish grass strips terraces on their farms to reduce runoff and erosion on steep slopes reduce use of fertilisers and pesticides through integrated crop pest management introduce new improved crop varieties and practice agroforestry using native trees high yielding fruit trees and cover crops for improved farm productivity the project invested usd 20 000 distributed among 974 farmers chiramba et al 2011 long term benefits are expected through enhancement in streamwater quality and quantity improvement in soil fertility and support to biodiversity but none have yet been directly demonstrated because of lack of monitoring the programme has provided small financial benefits to the sellers the upper catchment smallholders but it could not demonstrate advantages for the buyers the lakeside industries largely because the lake is in a considerable distance from the farms and their collective area is a fraction of the catchment the pes scheme remains a successful demonstration which will require considerable up scaling to show buyer benefits as do all other projects 6 5 artificial wetlands for effluent treatment approximately 25 of the largest horticultural enterprises belong to the lake naivasha growers group a voluntary organisation with established a codes of conduct for cut flower standards as well as to demonstrate environmental and social awareness all fair trade certified companies belong to lngg most of these companies have built artificial wetlands to collect all untreated effluents released from their operations before entering the lake or rivers since 2005 when the largest two companies first constructed them artificial wetlands are poorly developed in east africa due to lack of awareness but offer a promising low cost solution to water quality issues kivaisi 2001 they typically consist of constructed lagoons typically positioned at the end of a chain of septic tanks and or waste stabilisation ponds in which effluents undergo enhanced biodegradation mimicking natural wetland processes aquatic vegetation such as water hyacinth cattail reeds papyrus and other cyperaceae are grown to enhance the settling of suspended particles to favour nitrogen removal by denitrification mara 2003 and to partially absorb soluble nutrients the addition of a bacterial mixture is provided to enhance biodigestion finally the partially treated water is pumped up from the lower portion of the lagoons into microfiltration plants that concentrate contaminants into a small volume before safe disposal it is hoped that following this model example more and more large farmers will adopt a no effluent policy to prevent water pollution monitoring conducted at one farm showed that water quality significantly improved from inlet to outlet with conductivity declining from 722μscm 1 to 514μscm 1 while total dissolved solids tds declined from 569 to 186mgl 1 kimani et al 2012 total suspended solids tss biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen and total phosphorus declined significantly p 0 05 from inlet to outlet kimani et al 2012 6 6 forest conservation the kenyan parliament passed a forest act in 2005 gazetted in 2008 which restructured the government forestry service and provided a structure for community involvement in joint management through community forest associations cfas cfas exist for the gazetted forest areas remaining in the upper catchment such as eburru forest in the north of the lake and forest areas outside the aberdare national park in the east this bottom up involvement of communities in the resources that provide the ecosystem services directly to them demonstrate a sustainable ecohydrological approach to management as the following case study illustrates the enaiboro ajijik community comprising about 2000 people holds the communal title deed to olosho rongai forest 650 acres situated between the mau and the eburru gazetted forest blocks this is a rare example of forest conservation entirely managed by local communities olosho rongai maasai meaning narrow ridge forest represents one of the few remaining intact portions of the formerly extensive mau eburru forest complex which was the largest single forest block within east africa the local maasai declare that guarding the forest is the only way to ensure that water keeps running even during the dry season while all other springs coming from deforested sub catchments dry out olosho rongai is represented by a mature stand of the so called red cedar juniperus procera associated with podocarpus spp polyscias spp olea africana prunus africana euphorbia spp dombeya spp and other closed canopy forest species mwinami et al 2016 6 7 biocorridors the concept of establishing wildlife corridors linking different ecosystems within the lake catchment is being developed and promoted by lnra in collaboration with kws and rhino ark as a means of mitigating the worst damage of new economic developments the eburru forest ecosystem is currently being connected to the lake s riparian land and lobbying is underway to connect riparian land owners to prioritise the land for use by wildlife biocorridor creation is meant to provide larger grazing grounds for the dispersion of ungulates that are increasingly encroaching onto riparian land as a consequence of deforestation and fencing throughout the catchment harper and mavuti 2004 biocorridors contribute to restore the natural buffer strip of the lake s riparian and cushion it from direct impacts of anthropogenic activities the creation of biocorridor protects biodiversity prevents land degradation preserves the vegetation and hydraulic soil properties 6 8 riparian stream restoration riparian ecotones have been shown for more than 30 years to be essential in protecting watercourses from the detrimental effects of intensive agriculture and grazing schiemer and zalewski 1992 within temperate zones it is estimated that about 30 of the riparian corridor needs to be kept in natural conditions for the biota within streams to represent unimpaired water quality a similar rule could be expected to hold for streams in kenya griffiths 2001 planting of indigenous trees along riparian streams has been conducted sporadically by local associations as well as local and international ngos the naivasha basin sustainability initiative funded by european cut flower retailers and the german cooperation agency giz implemented the first riparian assessment survey for the catchment to highlight critical portions in need for restoration action imarisha naivasha news issue no 3 2015 this survey highlighted the health status of stream riparian biotopes along three rivers draining the bahati highlands the morendat the kirundu gilgil and the nyairoko malewa and helped identify potential livelihood enhancing strategies that could catalyse successful riparian rehabilitation grazing by cattle and goats produced severe damage to trees planted in freely accessible riparian zones instead fenced riparian plots where farmers agreed to combine trees with crops produced on average 70 success in the rehabilitated areas riparian vegetation controls water temperature as well as water quality the two are strictly connected as cool waters favour atmospheric oxygen invasion and this enhances the potential degradation of organic matter within streams riparian trees increase soil s infiltration capacity reducing surface runoff and sediment accumulation phosphorus tends to accumulate and becomes stored within riparian zones where it is adsorbed onto soils and sediments while bacterial denitrification is the main pathway reducing accumulated nitrogen through these processes and partially also through direct uptake riparian vegetation contributes to keep surface water bodies oligotrophic several other contaminants are also retained including organic pollutants and metals schachtschneider et al 2017 6 9 innovative cooking devices a project entitled jiko kisasa meaning standard cooking stove was recently introduced as an innovative system to enhance the efficiency of fuelwood use for cooking kitui et al 2016 it replaces the traditional three stone fireplace with a stove that reduces the amount of firewood needed for the same output some two hundred artisans were trained in stove making installation and marketing a recent questionnaire distributed among jiko kisasa users demonstrated significant savings in time fuel and money invested in daily cooking as well as health benefits related to lessened respiratory complications and eye infections that are often caused by smoke from traditional fireplaces projects such as alternative means of cooking can have significant benefits for the preservation of forests and for the prevention of land degradation 6 10 papyrus restoration initiatives papyrus has been extensively lost and destroyed from the lake s riparian zone harper and zalewski 2001 harper and mavuti 2004 since 2013 several attempts have been carried out to enlarge the papyrus swamp and to re establish papyrus in shore sections where it had become scarce steps have been taken to approach local farmers willing to give some of their riparian land back to the swamp by artificially enhancing flooding in addition floating islands made of recycled plastic waste material were imported from floating island international usa and planted with papyrus to be set within the lake in places where the shoreline had been spoiled these devices are a case study to provide amenity an extended biotope for fishing communities spawning areas invertebrate food and serve as small treatment wetlands where communities collected drinking water fig 9 6 11 endemic tree nurseries tree diversity can be an important driver of ecosystem service provision ordonez et al 2014 african forest http african forest net a social enterprise situated at soysambu northern edge of the basin promotes seed collection and replanting of endemic forest species to be re established through forest restoration projects the nursery holds currently ca 80 species of endemic trees many of which are employed in the development of new products including foods nutritional food additives medicines and cosmetics african forest s knowledge derives from a science based smart combination of african oral traditions recent scientific recognition of the value of tree derived natural products and originally designed experiments more than 100 000 trees grown by african forest have been planted within the naivasha basin and beyond 7 discussion all of the solutions being implemented mentioned above to counteract the negative effects of recent land use changes can be considered ecohydrological in nature sensu zalewski 2000 2015 as they have sought to re establish water sediment and nutrient retention in soils by promoting water infiltration and by slowing down runoff response to precipitation tables 3 and 5 in these processes the presence of plant roots is vital to maintain optimal soil properties therefore tree plantations and restoring near pristine vegetation are very important measures vegetated riparian areas around lakes and along streams provide a necessary buffer that not only moderates transport of sediments and nutrients from the catchment towards lake and stream water but also influences evapotraspiration and therefore local climate methods designed to monitor stream and lake riparian buffers through the participation of local youth groups have multiple advantages in providing a record of the state of riparian corridors indicating locations that could be targeted by future restoration and motivating the local community towards greater involvement in environmental protection citizen science not only provides an avenue for data collection but also enables the locals to better understand the influences of anthropogenic activities on ecohydrological cycles a well informed community offers greater security in sustaining environmental flows and biodiversity conservation none of the measures described have been evaluated in terms of their benefits because of the significant cost involved in the intensive monitoring of water and sediment transport and of chemical absorption retention nearly all of the above tools have developed spontaneously through local initiatives without the intervention of institutions they are examples of empirical implementation strategies with no previous knowledge their success is remarkable but very difficult to measure at these small scales their value can be interpreted by better documented case studies elsewhere in the ecohydrological literature this can serve the purpose of assisting their replication at other sites within the basin so as to progressively move towards a holistic ecohydrological approach to catchment management there is an urgent need to upscale the successes rather than continue piecemeal small scale actions however it is the usual pathway of environmental conservation across the world to undertake small scale ad hoc actions such as river restoration projects in the developed world palmer et al 2010 the basin s natural dynamics act at a scale that has not yet been practically measured but they must be managed the origin of the rain is remote capricious from far away and dependent upon processes that cannot be controlled from within the basin kuhn et al 2016 global change modellers have not found it easy to predict precipitation over east africa for decades odongo et al 2015 management must therefore take a precautionary approach and maximise the vegetation buffer effect trying to protect riparian zones along streams wetlands and lakes the important knowledge we need is where to apply the tools most effectively this strategy follows the implementation of the precautionary principle established at the rio convention in 1992 the knowledge base in naivasha needs now to be selectively improved to contribute to effective ecohydrological management the department of invertebrate zoology at the national museums of kenya is developing an index of water quality based on stream macroinvertebrates this tool could be implemented within the basin and research conducted by nbsi can provide useful background information the health of the stream bank vegetation is critical to keep erosion and nutrient transport in check therefore riparian zones should be surveyed and restored conserved a targeted risk assessment approach is needed to keep the potential impacts of intensive industrial activities such as existing large greenhouse horticulture and geothermal the proposed industrial development and inland container port within the tolerance of the ecosystem lake fish fillet should be regarded as a key assessment endpoint because people eat it nutrient loads impacting onto water quality should be surveyed and known pollution problems such as naivasha s sewage treatment plant and poor domestic waste disposal should be addressed rather than simply monitored especially with the expected influx of people some form of long term biodiversity monitoring birds riparian vegetation aquatic and terrestrial insects is warranted to enable alertness to degradation trends new threats are represented by the on going eutrophication which could develop into dangerous cyanobacterial blooms producing neurotoxins within the lake as well as within dams for example turasha and wetlands bordering intensive agriculture nyachiro et al 2016 at lake naivasha increasing economic interests have sparked a difficult political confrontation a number of locally founded as well as international organisations have been carrying out activities to counteract catchment degradation debates over stakeholder representativeness bogged down some early attempts at implementing management plans harper et al 2011 the lake produces substantial economic benefits amongst the highest us per litre of water in the world these can be evaluated in terms of the quantity of flowers the number of tourists visiting the lake and the proportion of national electricity produced all these benefits are supported by clean water stored and purified through terrestrial ecosystems as well as wetlands rivers and the lake beside this the upper catchment is part of the national dairy belt which exports milk potatoes and vegetables to the whole nakuru district as well as to nairobi in relation to the high value of the products exported from the basin the level of monitoring and risk assessment which takes place is to say the least inadequate despite the management and action plans the sustainability of most production practices including industrial horticulture geothermal power production and small scale agriculture is questionable pollution and water abstraction go hand in hand with inadequate impact mitigation and insufficient monitoring of potential impacts the great value obtained and the complex links existing between ecosystem health and economic activities within the basin imply that management cannot be simply supported by standard national legislation similarly major decisions cannot be left to become the responsibility of local or even district authorities alone naivasha is no standard lake its high value output makes it a special case which needs immediate government endorsement and implementation of a management plan to include highly targeted monitoring for example horticultural pesticides in fish and meat consumed by humans an extension of the plan should also design and implement eco hydrological restoration measures these must address first of all the protection and restoration of the shoreline papyrus fringe some monitoring has been achieved through the involvement of citizen science as nbsi has shown through the activities carried out in collaboration with five nature groups around the lake this positive experience has however revealed that despite widespread voluntary commitment no long term objectives can be achieved without the financial contribution of those making profits in horticulture power generation and tourism because of the economic weakness that characterises the great majority of the resident stakeholders most of which are underemployed or living as subsistence farmers on small portions of farmland just over a decade ago lake naivasha and its basin hit the national headlines and a great deal of research predicted rapidly declining natural capital through lack of science based management while the only management plan was inaccessible through a legal injunction harper et al 2011 since that time a wider understanding of the real risks has resulted in a plethora of basin plans but action limited to only small scales during that decade the lake went from the lowest since 1945 in 2009 to the highest since 1969 in 2013 the high lake level pushed all the perceived problems to the back of most people s minds now 2017 the lake is declining once more the current drought is inevitably leading to greatly increased abstraction and the management plans and voluntary agreements are about to be tested an ecohydrological solution remains as far away as ever conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgements none funding body none 
1166,linking integrated water resources management iwrm and ecohydrology for the sustainance of watersheds and environmentally friendly economic activities is vital for ensuring continued water flow and a steady supply of watershed services for societal needs and the integrity of aquatic vegetation and animal species however regardless of the reforms in water policy and the water resources development programme and water resources management act to include provisions for iwrm tanzania is still facing several institutional challenges in the practical implementation of iwrm this study aimed at exploring the potentials and constraints for integrating ecohydrology and iwrm to develop an integrated institutional framework for providing a sustainable flow of ecosystem services for societal needs along the pangani river basin prb in tanzania the data was collected through socio economic methods including questionnaires surveys structured and semi structured interviews and a documentary review of secondary information logistic regression models were performed to analyse factors influencing watershed management integration logistic regression results showed that watershed management integration was significantly p 0 001 constrained by poor inter sectoral coordination at field level diverging interests of watershed stakeholders incompatibility between formal and informal institutions poor highland lowland integration development interventions population pressure inadequate political support and migration this together with power imbalances and the uncoordinated interests of multi stakeholders predispose the prb s watersheds to unsustainable management this state of affairs will continue to hamper national aspirations to effectively implement iwrm along the prb successful iwrm implementation would allow the country to meet its obligations towards sustainable watershed management it is recommended that an integrated institutional framework capable of integrating upstream and downstream communities be developed keywords ecohydrology practices watershed services sustainable forest management integrated watershed management societal challenges participatory management 1 introduction water provides important ecosystem services es for socio economic development and in the age of rapid population growth wise management of watersheds is essential gleick 2002 vörösmarty 2002 king and brown 2010 lalika 2017 furthermore these es represent both a livelihood support system and a means to regulate ecological integrity kashaigili et al 2007 the dependency of the human population on the integrity of natural systems to provide es has for quite some time necessitated the management of these sources of natural wealth to sustain the flow of es mea 2005 as the human population continues to grow the limited availability of clean freshwater is among the major constraints to further social and economic development king and brown 2010 the problem is vividly witnessed in developing countries where the supply of freshwater has been insufficient to support national development goals meet food needs safeguard the livelihoods of rural people and protect an increasingly degraded environment king and mccartney 2007 united nations 2007 in contrast the majority of developed countries have a well developed system of institutional social and economic systems often achieved at the expense of environmental resources furthermore while modern sustainable development may well focus on restoring es to various extents the ecosystems offering these es are steadily being degraded or diminished by development in recent years it has been documented that the pressure exerted by a growing human population on natural ecosystems has been threatening the basic foundation needed to ensure a steady supply of es essential for survival and ecological integrity lalika et al 2015a b 2017 lalika 2017 watershed ecosystems are under pressure due to increased competing demands for es from the burgeoning human population and from climate change and variability lalika et al 2015b which have led to complex institutional challenges for water management mbeyale 2009 msuya 2010 among others they include watershed conservation watershed governance environmental flow and the determination of the amount of water that can be taken from a river before its ability to meet social ecological and economic needs is hindered msuya 2010 lalika et al 2015a poor water governance lalika et al 2015b a weak link among water management institutions and water management for societal needs are some of the fundamental global problems concerning the steady provision of water related es the rising demand for water related es the deterioration of watersheds and water quality and reduction of water flow are contemporary serious threats to human well being global efforts towards forming integrated institutional approaches to provide solutions to major environmental problems represent a significant paradigm shift towards nature management focused on the sustained use of water resources in the water resources field this paradigm shift from conservation efforts towards knowledge based management has found expression in the form of ecohydrology and integrated water resources management iwrm ecohydrology is a discipline that aims to achieve integrative sustainability using the interactions between hydrology biota and natural processes as management tools to reinforce ecosystem services on a broad range of landscapes zalewski 2015 this integrative sustainability science is a basis for the development and application of market based approaches in watershed management being a sub discipline of hydrology that focusses on ecological processes occupying within the hydrological cycle ecohydrology strives for enhancing environmental sustainability in order to reverse water and ecosystem degradation to ensure a sustainable supply of es for society and restore ecological quality as an ecological tool for enhancement of sustainability ecohydrology practices increase the resilience of river basins by managing multi dimensional parameters such as water biodiversity ecosystem services for society and resilience to climate change wbsr in order to achieve sustainability in both ecosystems and the human population zalewski 2015 however the success of ecohydrology as a sustainability potential enhancement wbsr tool along river basins depends much on the holistic approach where the human component is essential therefore to find solutions for reversing the degradation of river basins for responding better to sustainable water resource policies and promoting social development with stakeholders participation at all levels it is crucial to integrate ecohydrology with iwrm iwrm allows holistic management of water resources without compromising the sustainability of ecosystems gwp 2000 and has since guided our understanding and strategies it aims at ensuring the co ordinated development and management of water land and related resources by maximizing economic and social welfare without compromising the sustainability of vital environmental systems gwp 2014 as is the case for ecohydrology iwrm strives to meet human requirements for the use of freshwater whilst maintaining hydrological and biological processes and biodiversity which are considered essential for the functioning of ecosystems the sustainable use of water resources and the maintenance of the es they provide this concept is being increasingly put into practice and incorporates much of the philosophical framework of ecosystem management the emergence of iwrm as a guiding philosophy for river basin management has gained popularity since the mid 20th century and the implementation of iwrm is guided by the four dublin principles through an emphasis on ecological institutional gender and instrument turton et al 2007 cited by funke et al 2007 these are key towards facilitating water management at the river basin scale for ecological integrity while ensuring a sustainable flow of societal benefits zalewski 2015 given the focus on vital ecosystems and natural resources iwrm is regarded as a promising approach insofar that it involves local communities residing along river basins dungumaro and madulu 2003 based on this premise iwrm is often proposed as the appropriate governance regime for sustainable water resources management however iwrm implementation and success is often challenged by a great variety of factors ranging from ecosystem sustainability and economic efficiency to social equity sokile 2005 the iwrm implementation triangle comprise other important issues such as institutional management and public participation in management activities dungumaro 2006 dungumaro and madulu 2003 institutions are perhaps the most important players in the implementation of iwrm cap net 2005 identifies 13 areas of change in iwrm which all seem to hang on the ability of institutions to ensure the effective implementation of iwrm three of the change areas fall under the enabling environment eight are categorized under management instruments and finally the last i e i creating an organizational framework and ii institutional capacity building fall under the institutional roles the argument is that once effective institutions are in place management instruments are developed and the enabling environment created this is particularly true if forms and functions of each organization are clearly stated and capacity building is done hence once a well functioning institutional set up is integrated with ecohydrological principles and practices then is possible to achieve a sustainable flow of ecosystem services while maintaining ecosystem integrity despite the importance of iwrm in water management little is known about the link between ecohydrology and iwrm along the pangani river basin prb in tanzania the current study attempts to clarify this missing link the objectives of this study were to i determine the factors influencing watershed management integration ii determine the factors constraining water and forest management integration and iii analyse the institutional constraints to iwrm implementation in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area 2 1 1 location the study was carried out in eight villages namely kyeri kikafu chini kisanjuni mbore kigonigoni ruvu mferejini kweminyasa and chekelei along the prb tanzania fig 1 the pangani river basin prb extends from the northern highlands to the north eastern coast of the country and lies between latitude 03 05 00 and 06 06 00 south and longitude 36 45 36 and 39 36 00 east it covers an area of about 43 650km2 of which 5 lies in kenya within the district of taita taveta iucn 2003 however since this is not a typical trans boundary study the concentration was more on the tanzanian side of the basin the terms prb and pangani basin pb have two different meanings the former refers to the basin of the pangani river only while the latter incorporates the prb and other three smaller basins umba msangazi and zigi river basins adjacent to the prb and covers a total area of about 56 000km2 iucn 2003 however this study is confined to the prb the prb is intersected by sixteen districts arusha urban arumeru siha hai rombo moshi rural and urban mwanga same simanjiro kiteto lushoto korogwe kilindi handeni muheza and pangani within the kilimanjaro manyara arusha and tanga regions 2 1 2 hydrology and drainage patterns the pangani river drains from the slopes of mount kilimanjaro mount meru the pare and usambara mountains and extends 450km to its outlet in the indian ocean the river is sourced from several river systems of which the majority of streams and springs originate from the highland areas within the prb there are several natural and man made lakes the largest man made lake is the nyumba ya mungu dam nymd which was constructed in 1968 it covers an area of 17 000ha originally this water body was constructed for water supply irrigation and water control but the purpose has now changed to hydropower generation the natural lakes include lake jipe 2800ha and lake chala 315ha near the kenyan border on the slopes of north pare mountains and mount kilimanjaro respectively iucn 2003 other manmade lakes with the construction year in brackets include kalimawe dam 1959 in same district chunguli 1965 in mwanga district cholo 1965 ukyashi 1962 and mworoworo 1961 in moshi rural district and chanika 1957 and kwenkambala 2003 in handeni district iucn 2003 over the years springs and streams in the basin have dried up as a result of watershed degradation and high water stress due to increased utilization pbwo iucn 2007 2 1 3 forest and vegetation types the vegetation of the prb is complex ranging from forests on mountain slopes to semi arid grasslands the major vegetation types include forests woodlands bushland grassland thicket and cultivated crops turpie et al 2005 the plantation forests have replaced natural forests in the highlands and the larger part of the lowlands is composed of woodland bushland grassland and thicket as dominant vegetation types it is worth noting here that the most important vegetation type with hydrological functions in the prb are the forests as they regulate run off prevent soil erosion store water and improve water quality iucn 2003 there are five main types of forests in the basin these include mangrove forests coastal forests afromontane forests riverine forests and miombo woodlands iucn 2003 the forests in the prb are subjected to intense utilisation pressure leading to varying levels of degradation according to lambrechts et al 2002 the forest degradation has led to a decline of the kilimanjaro natural forest by 41km2 between 1952 and 1982 in the same vein human disturbance has triggered loss of original forest cover by 77 in the eastern arc mountains between 1978 and 1998 newmark 1998 the main causes of forest degradation in the prb are encroachment for settlement and agricultural production increasing demand of forest products mainly timber and fuelwood contributing to deforestation inadequate enforcement of the rule of law and fire incidents iucn 2003 2 1 4 land use and socio economic activities land use in the basin is governed primarily by rainfall slope soils and water availability with most cultivation being on the lower mountain slopes around mount kilimanjaro and mount meru the foothills of the pare and usambara mountains and along narrow river floodplains the land cover within the prb has a reflection on land use the main economic activities in the prb are agriculture and livestock keeping the highlands are particularly favoured for coffee tea banana potato taro and vegetable cropping irrigation is a common practice both for small scale and large scale agriculture however traditional furrows are more used by small scale farmers and more advanced irrigation systems such as drip irrigation by large estates two forms of livestock use is can be observed in the study area zero grazing practised by highland communities and free grazing used by lowland communities the pastoralists particularly the maasai initially occupied the lowland floodplains where they found pastures for their animals mbeyale 2009 2 1 5 climate and ecological zones the basin is characterised by the contrast between the humid mountain ranges which receive annual rainfall amounts in the range of 1000 2500mm and the semi arid lowlands where annual rainfall is below 1000mm notter 2010 the coastal area receives annual rainfall amounts of 1000 1500mm due to the proximity of the indian ocean notter 2010 the basin has a bimodal pattern of rainfall with long rains between march and june and short rains from november to december temperatures are influenced by altitude with lower temperatures experienced in the highlands and higher temperatures in the lowlands at higher altitudes the temperature ranges between 10 c and 28 c while in the lowlands the range is between 24 c and 34 the highlands and lowlands are the two prominent ecological zones of the prb the highland zone is the most productive area with high amount of rainfall up to 3000mm per year the highest mountain in the african continent mount kilimanjaro 5895m a s l mount meru 4562m a s l and the north and south pare and usambara east and west mountains are found in the highland zone this zone is covered by natural and plantation forests of high catchment values ikeno 2007 mbeyale 2009 2 2 sampling procedure stratified and purposive sampling methods were used to select study villages first the five sub catchments of the prb i e the kikuletwa sub catchment the ruvu sub catchment the mkomazi sub catchment the pangani mainstem sub catchment and the luengera sub catchment were adopted as the sampling frame for this study fig 2 each individual sub catchment displays disparities in hydrological characteristics following this each sample frame was stratified into highland and lowland to capture highland and lowland interaction and at least one village was purposively selected from each stratum of each sample frame thus kyeeri highland and kikafu chini lowland was sampled from the kikuletwa sub catchment kisanjuni and mbore highland and kigonigoni lowland from the ruvu sub catchment ruvu mferejini in the pangani mainstem kweminyasa highland and chekelei lowland were sampled from the luengera sub catchment during the sampling process the unit of study was the household however since communities in the study villages were heterogeneous the households in each village were stratified into hamlets the households were therefore divided into different hamlets and random numbers were assigned to each household in each hamlet a list of random numbers was then generated to choose sample households for structured interviews thus a total of 345 households was selected randomly based on a sampling intensity ranging from 5 to 10 of the number of households table 1 2 3 data collection methods 2 3 1 structured questionnaires we used structured questionnaires as the main method for secondary data collection these structured questionnaires comprising of open and closed questions were administered to a sample of 345 households the target respondents were the heads of households however in the case of their absence other members of the households aged 18 were interviewed the questionnaire items included socio economic information perceptions on the past and present status of watershed management integration institutional interplay and performance with regard to watershed management integration enabling and constraining factors to watershed management integration information on stakeholders interests to water and forest resources and stakeholders initiatives in watershed management integration 2 3 2 semi structured and unstructured interviews this method was used to supplement the information gathered through structured questionnaires a checklist of questions was used to guide the discussion of water management issues whereas unstructured interviews involved talking casually with the respondents on particular research issues without prior appointment of the conversation this exercise was conducted to key informants who represented organisations with a stake in the use and management of watershed resources the key informants interviewed included the village leaders representatives from village natural resources committees village environmental committees village land use committees village water committees furrow committees irrigators associations and other water user groups others groups that we interviewed include traditional and ritual leaders selected local elites ward executive officers representatives from ngos agricultural extension workers and foresters private investors african highland initiative ahi traditional irrigation and environmental improvement organisation tip tanzania forest conservation group tfcg representatives of the pangani basin water office pbwo international union for conservation of nature iucn representative and

bern university of dar es salaam tanzania forestry research institute and the pbwo 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 quantitative data analysis the data collected through structured questionnaires was summarised coded cleaned and analysed using the statistical package for social sciences spss version 12 0 and microsoft excel descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were also carried out 2 4 2 description of variables and model specification to perform the inferential statistical analysis two logistic regression models were developed to show the influence of independent variables on water and forest management integration dependent variable one model was designed for water and forest management integration and another for constraining factors to water and forest management integration logistic regression a binary technique for estimating the probability of an event to occur was also used because of the dichotomous nature of the dependent variable and the nominal and numerical nature of independent variables wuensch 2008 2 4 3 dependent variable we measured water and forest management integration by weighing a number of indicators interpreted from good governance and iwrm principles organisation theory and community decoded indicators extent of conflict resolution through conceptual causal chains watershed water and forest management integration dependent variable was

coordination efficiency and fairness iwrm principles f holistic approach extent of water payment community decoded indicator f extent of conflict resolution the indices were combined into a composite index as indicated in the field sheet table 2 in measuring watershed management integration the decoded indices were given scores ranging from one to three and the mean score computed for each respondent with scores of 3 2 and 1 reflecting good fair and poor respectively the dependent variable is a dichotomous dummy variable determined by 1 for good integrative potential or 0 for otherwise therefore the mean scores were again assigned new codes to make the dependent variable dichotomous a mean value less than 0 5 was coded as zero and the rest were coded as one 2 4 4 independent variables the independent variables are the enabling and constraining factors which are likely to influence integration in water and forest management in showing the relationship between dependent

group discussions thereafter the factors which were common to all the study villages were included in a structured questionnaire for further questioning 2 4 7 the imperial model two logistic regression models were developed to model the probability of an event to occur the probability of the event not to occur is given as pro no event 1 pro event the logistic regression models comprising more than one independent variables are given as 1 y i 1 1 e z j 2 y i 1 1 e z k where y i dependent variable depicting integration in water and forest management z j the combination of enabling

exp 1 2 71828 p total number of independent variables x 1 to x p independent variables 2 4 8 description of independent variables 2 4 8 1 x j1 historical background on integration it is hypothesized that previous integration experience in water and forest management increases the likelihood of water and forest management integration this is due to the existence of remnants of integrative experience in the study area this is a dummy variable coded 1 for perception of previous integrative experience and 0 if otherwise the expected sign of regression coefficient is positive β 2 4 8 2 x j2 highland lowland livelihood interdependence this is a dummy variable expressed as 1 for yes if mutual inter dependence existed between the highland and the lowland communities in livelihood strategies and 0 for no if otherwise it was assumed that the highland communities depend on the lowland areas for food and employment while the lowland communities depend on the highland ecosystem for water used for irrigation domestic and other purposes this interdependence was assumed to have positive influence on the integrative potential in water and forest management and hence β coefficient is expected to be positive β 2 4 8 3 x j3 social capital social capital was expressed in terms of social relation and trust that facilitate cooperation between watershed stakeholders it is a dummy variable with a value of 1 for yes indicating good relationship and that trust exists between watershed stakeholders and 0 for no if otherwise social relations and trust entail the existence of collective action which has been institutionalised in local leadership when the local leadership is strong the chances of devising mechanisms geared to water and forest management are high collective action is one of the indicators of integrative initiatives with a positive effect on water and forest management integration thus social capital was assumed to have a positive regression coefficient β 2 4 8 4 x j4 age of respondents the age of respondents expressed in years was assumed to have positive influence on water and forest management integration it is assumed that an increase in age of the respondents increases the chances of collaboration and cooperation in water and forest management this is because the elders are assumed to have knowledge on the previous integrative experience which can boost integration of water and forest management this is a numerical variable with expected positive sign of β coefficient β 2 4 8 5 x j5 dependence on water resource it was assumed that increased dependence on water resources in the study area influenced integration in water and forest management the reason behind this could be the existing positive correlation between increased water use intensities and water shortage this is therefore expected to motivate water users to support activities geared to watershed protection dependence on water resource was coded 1 for yes if the respondent depends on water for more than one uses and 0 for no if otherwise the regression coefficient for this dummy variable was expected to be positive β 2 4 8 6 x j6 participatory approaches in water and forest management this is a dummy variable expressed as the perception of the respondents with a value of 1 for the presence of participatory approaches in both water and forest management and 0 for otherwise introduction of participatory approaches was assumed to enhance integration of water and forest management this is due to the fact that an increase in participation could facilitate collaboration between water and forestry based local institutions which could then trigger some form of initiatives geared to integrated management of water and forest resources the expected sign for beta value is positive β 2 4 8 7 x k1 poor inter sectoral coordination at field level the existing formal governance structure influences the sectoral approach in the management of watershed resources in this case it was assumed that different sectors with different interests in watershed resources i e those with interests in water and those interested in forest resources approach local communities independently without coordination this was assumed to reduce integration of water and forest management this factor was expressed as dummy value of 1 yes for insufficient coordination and 0 no if otherwise this variable was assumed to have a negative value for the β coefficient β 2 4 8 8 x k2 household size this is a numerical variable expressed in terms of the number of household members it is hypothesized that larger households exert greater pressure on watershed resources than otherwise this was assumed to increase degradation in the forests and increase water demand this situation was assumed to influence the development of new uncoordinated water and forest oriented institutions as it is assumed to have a negative influence on water and forest management integration the expected sign of the regression coefficient was negative β 2 4 8 9 x k3 diverging interests of watershed stakeholders the presence of diverging interests for watershed stakeholders was assumed to have negative influence on water and forest management integration this is because greater divergence of stakeholder interests increases the likelihood of forming local organisations with poorly coordinated interests in watershed resources this increases the chance of separation in watershed resource management this is a dummy variable with a value of 1 for yes if the divergence of stakeholders interests influence negatively the integration of water and forest management and 0 for no if otherwise the regression coefficient was expected to be negative β 2 4 8 10 x k4 incompatibility between formal and informal institutions this is a dummy variable expressed as the perception of the respondents with a value of 1 for yes if incompatibility existed between formal and informal institutions and 0 for no if otherwise incompatibility between formal and informal institutions was assumed to impede integration of water and forest management because such incompatibility can reduce the likelihood of collaboration and cooperation between them the beta value was expected to be negative β 2 4 8 11 x k5 existence of development interventions this is a nominal variable expressed as a dummy with a value of 1 yes for the presence of development interventions i e projects irrigation schemes ngos and cbos and 0 no if otherwise development interventions were assumed to negatively influence integration in the management of watershed resources this was attributed to poor coordination resulting from the independent nature of most of the development interventions intended to facilitate development of multiple social organisations at a local level which predisposed them to favour whoever facilitated their formation the regression coefficient was expected to be negative β 2 4 8 12 x k6 lack of highland lowland integration this is a nominal variable expressed as a dummy with a value of 1 for yes if the highland and lowland stakeholders and watershed resources are poorly integrated and 0 for no if otherwise this variable was assumed to have a negative coefficient β as poor integration would reduce integrative potential of water and forest management the existence of administrative boundaries exemplified by village wards division and district and organisations separating the lowland areas from the highlands was assumed to contribute to poor highland lowland integration and therefore weaken watershed management integration 2 4 8 13 x k7 inadequate political support inadequate political support was expressed in terms of respondents perception this factor was hypothesised to lessen the integrative potential of water and forest management since poor political support was assumed to reduce integrative initiatives of local organisations it was expressed as dummy variable with a value of 1 for yes if there was inadequate political support to watershed management integrative initiatives and 0 for no if otherwise the variable was assumed to have a negative regression coefficient β 2 4 8 14 x k8 migration level migration level was expressed in terms of the mean value between immigration and emigration immigration was expressed as the number of non indigenous family members and emigration as the number of household members residing outside the households the mean score between immigration and emigration was used as an independent variable in logistic regression i e it is a than the indigenous residents the variable was assumed to have a negative β coefficient β numerical variable migration was assumed to increase cultural dilution and hence reduces the potential for water and forest management integration due to the fact that newcomers and those residing outside the areas are assumed to have less integrative knowledge the hypotheses tested were h 0 β 0 implying that the value of regression coefficients is equal to zero and thus the independent variables enabling and constraining factors have no influence on dependent variables water and forest management integration h 1 β 0 implying that the regression coefficients are not equal to zero and thus the independent variables have either positive or negative influence on the dependent water and forest management integration 2 4 9 qualitative data analysis secondary data synthesised from reports policy legal and regulatory documents including the forest policy water policy land policy agricultural policy wildlife policy and national environmental policy and their subsequent strategies and acts was examined to identify the provisions for institutional performance indicators interpreted from good governance characteristics organisational theory and iwrm principles the formal and informal institutional performance in watershed management integration at the local level was analysed based on community based indicators organisational theory ackroyd 2002 good governance characteristics unescap 2007 and iwrm principles gwp 2000 3 results 3 1 factors influencing watershed management integration table 3 presents the results logistic regression of enabling factors for water and forest management integration the logistic regression model fits well to the data p 0 01 the 2 log likelihood of 86 362 implies good fitness of data to the model whereas the overall percentage of 88 1 signifies correct predictions of independent variables by the model 3 1 1 historical background on integration the results revealed a positive correlation between the existing history of watershed management integration and integration of water and forest management β 2 598 this implies that retrieving the history of integration is likely to significantly p 0 000 increase the magnitude of water and forest management integration by a factor of 10 547 3 1 2 dependence on water resource an increasing dependence on water resource significantly p 0 001 increases the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 7 549 table 4 table 4 shows high dependence on water resource for various uses all the respondents depend on water for domestic purposes drinking cooking and washing whereas 74 depend on water for irrigation 70 for livestock 25 for fishing and 12 for other purposes including transport and rituals local communities have started to realise the importance of paying for water and their interest in supporting watershed protection are growing for instance the lowlanders represented by 35 58 and 43 of the respondents from kikafu chini kigonigoni and chekelei villages respectively have showed interest of participating in watershed protection but they are constrained by lack of formalised mechanisms for participation 3 1 3 highland lowland livelihood inter dependence the highland lowland livelihood inter dependence significantly p 0 005 improves the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 5 818 table 4 this was substantiated by 48 of the respondents from kyeeri village 57 from kisanjuni 79 from mbore and 40 from kweminyasa village who reported to have been cultivating crops in the lowland areas also the majority of the respondents from the highland villages of kisanjuni 88 and mbore 69 were depending on food crops maize produced in the lowland areas on the other hand water used by the lowland communities for irrigation and other uses is sourced from the highland areas and the highlanders have participated in its management this is exemplified by the chunguli reservoir 246 600m3 located in kisanjuni village which was built in the highlands to store water used for irrigation in the lowland areas during the dry season the sources of water feeding this reservoir are protected in five clan based sacred forests micro catchments namely kishengweni 4 0ha owned by the wafinanga clan kwa mochani 2 0ha mrakama 1 5ha mghamba 2 5ha and mbale 4 0ha all under the wasuya clan 3 1 4 social capital table 4 shows a positive regression coefficient β 1 153 of social capital implying that an increase in one unit of social relations and trust increases the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 3 649 increasing social relations and trust increase the chance for cooperation between stakeholders and local organisations regardless of sectoral affiliation for instance in kikafu chini through social relations and trust the village leaders and leaders of the irrigators association uwakichi have reached an informal agreement to integrate management of irrigation water and riverine forests in that vein uwakichi is contributing a portion of water use fees 500 000 shillings for conservation of forests along the kikafu river while the village leaders play the actual forest conservation role along the kikafu river 3 1 5 age of respondents table 4 shows that an increase in the age significantly p 0 021 increases the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 2 900 this is probably due to the integrative style used by the elders in the management of traditional forests particularly those with catchment values and irrigation water allocation since pre independence times the respondents age structure fig 3 shows a small proportion of elders above 65 years in the household composition 3 1 6 participatory approaches in water and forest management as indicated in table 4 participatory approaches in water and forest management did not significantly influence water management however the results indicate that introduction of participatory approaches are likely to enhance integration in water and forest management by a factor of 1 488 this implies that proper participation facilitates some initiatives geared at integrating water and forest management 3 2 factors constraining water and forest management integration table 5 shows logistic regression results on the factors constraining integration of water and forest management the high value of the overall percentage 77 4 indicates that high proportion of the cases was correctly predicted by the model the chi square value of 41 55 at p 0 001 implies the independent variables have a significant influence on the dependent variable the 2 log likelihood of 186 4 implies a good fit between the model and the data the wald statistics determine whether particular independent variables have significant effect on the dependent variable in that regard all the factors except inadequate political support and the level of migration are significantly likely to constrain the integration of water and forest management 3 2 1 poor inter sectoral coordination at field level poor inter sectoral coordination at field level significantly p 0 000 reduces the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 0 272 table 5 the existence of separate line ministries responsible for water management ministry of water and irrigation and forest management ministry of natural resources and tourism and prime minister s office regional administration and local government at macro level contributes to poor coordination and collaboration in water and forest management at the basin and local levels this is because each ministry has its own policy law and programme whose implementation exacerbates the formation of sector specific organisations at basin and local levels apparently there is insufficient coordination when the forest and water based institutions interact with local communities the activities of the forest authorities catchment forest project and district forest departments and the water authorities pbwo and district water departments are not coordinated each of these water and forest entities interacts with local communities independently thereby contributing to the formation of sectoral affiliated local organisations it is said that insufficient cooperation and coordination among and between different water and forest based entities is the major bottleneck for integrated management of watershed resources sangameswaran 2008 3 2 2 diverging interests of watershed stakeholders the diverging interests of watershed stakeholders is negatively related to integration of water and forest management with a negative regression coefficient β 1 145 and a large wald statistics value 9 347 this implies a significant p 0 005 decrease of the likelihood of water and forest management integration for every unit increase in the magnitude of divergence of stakeholder interests with an increasing deviation of stakeholder interests there is an increased likelihood of forming different local organisations with different interests in the use and management of water and forest resources this has an implication on the formation of multiple sectoral oriented formal organisations at the local level which are not compatible with the existing customary authorities as the number of water based and forest oriented local organisations increases the opportunities for integrating the management of water and forest resources decreases the results from semi structured interview and focus groups discussions revealed a high diversity of stakeholders with diverging interests to water and forest resources they include smallholder water users large scale water users formal and informal water user groups committees and associations the basin water office district councils forest resource users village natural resources and environmental committees village government catchment forest managers and various facilitators ngos this increases ambiguity in watershed management integration due to difficulties in convincing multiple stakeholders to forego their interests for the sake of forming an integrated forum currently an institutional mechanism to coordinate the activities of multiple stakeholders is lacking in the basin frederiksen 2007 contends that integration in the management of watershed resources is very challenging in a situation where each resource is managed independently and the stakeholders have multiple and diverging interests to these resources 3 2 3 incompatibility between formal and informal institutions increasing incompatibility between formal and informal institutions was found to significantly p 0 010 reduce the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 0 363 a plausible explanation is the existing deference and power between formal and informal institutions the formal institutions are empowered by formal laws while the informal ones are governed by customary laws there are also disparities in sanctioning mechanisms between the two while the former is based on the court of law the latter is based on traditional sanctions in this case watershed stakeholders governed through customary rules are normally reluctant to change to formal governance and those stakeholders governed by formal rules usually disregard the customary governance system in the study area this polarisation is exemplified by an ongoing process of formalisation of informal institutions whereby the newly formed formal institutions are often not accepted by local communities in areas dominated by custom based informal institutions for instance the ruvu farmers irrigation cooperative society limited rufaicos a new formal water governance institution in ruvu mferejini village has been rejected due to incompatibility with the existing customary watershed governance institution naururu irrigators association nia in kyeeri villagers were reluctant to apply for water rights since they have relied on customary water use arrangements since pre colonial times in fact formal water governance arrangements are considered as competitors to customary arrangements sokile 2005 sokile et al 2003 this intensifies the incompatibility between formal and informal institutions and hence reduces chances for integration 3 2 4 lack of highland lowland integration the likelihood of water and forest management integration decreases significantly p 0 015 by a factor of 0 424 with an increasing separation of the highland and lowland stakeholders and watershed resources this has been exacerbated by the increasing institutional disparities between the highland and lowland areas at present a mechanism in regulating the use and management of watershed resources between highland and lowland areas is lacking this increases the likelihood of forming highland and lowland oriented watershed organisations which are not coordinated the results from ssi point out that the natural resources committees are commonly formed in the highland areas on the contrary since irrigation is more practised in the lowland areas water related entities are mostly formed in the lowlands this reduces the chances of water and forest management integration the existence of administrative units separating the lowlands from the highlands also contributes to this separation for instance three study villages from ruvu sub catchment kisanjuni mbore and kigonigoni are affiliated to three different divisions regardless of their inter dependence in watershed resource use and management kisanjuni is located in ugweno mbore is found in usangi while kigonigoni is affiliated to jipendea division this contradicts the former boundaries which were set based on the interdependence of ecological social and economic resource use between highlands and lowlands which have consequently reduced the likelihood of integration in the management of watershed resources similarly mbeyale 2009 contends that highland lowland administrative disparities hamper integration in the management of common pool resources in the mkomazi sub catchment 3 2 5 development interventions development interventions significantly p 0 023 impede integration of water and forest management this implies that for every unit increase in the magnitude of development interventions there is a reduction of the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 0 453 fig 4 development interventions in prb include private investments irrigation schemes activities funded by sectoral programmes autonomous water authorities and projects donor funded activities and ngo and cbo activities 3 2 6 household size table 5 shows significant p 0 044 negative relationships between the household size and integration of water and forest management the population increase is also expressed in terms of mean household size in the study villages compared to the average household size of the overall prb which is five members according to human population census of 2002 urt 2003 3 2 7 migration level the results from table 5 shows that migration is negatively β 0 626 related to integration in water and forest management however this relationship is not significant p 0 280 the negative relationship indicates that as the level of migration increases the likelihood of integration declines by an odds ratio factor of 0 616 as table 6 shows 67 of the respondents had a household size greater than the basin average while all the study villages had a mean household size greater than the basin average increase in household size is likely to increase water use intensity demand for forest products and land for settlements and cultivation these aspects play a role in the degradation of catchment forests and the declining sizes of traditionally forests as exemplified by the kinyala and mbale sacred forests in the kisanjuni village 3 3 institutional challenges to iwrm implementation according to table 7 the five institutional challenges to iwrm implementation identified at micro level the majority of respondents reported the multiplicity of water based institutions 75 followed by poor inter sectoral coordination 67 a lack of any forum for coordinating multiple stakeholders and institutions 58 a lack of highland lowland integration 49 and poor compatibility between formal and informal institutions 40 with the exception of poor compatibility between formal and informal institutions all other constraining factors to iwrm implementation were reported more in the lowland villages than in the highlands table 7 4 discussion 4 1 factors influencing watershed management integration the chi square score of 62 109 at seven degrees of freedom and p 0 001 implies that the independent variables have a significant influence on the dependent variable the wald statistics determine whether particular independent variables have a significant effect on the dependent variable in that regard all the factors except participatory approaches in water and forest management are significantly likely to enhance the integration of water and forest management table 3 4 1 1 historical background on integration the history of watershed management integration in the study area can be traced back to the pre colonial era whereby it was possible to integrate water and forest management through the chiefdom system the chiefs delegated mandates regarding water and forest management to the headmen it was possible to have one headman ruling the highland and lowland communities and the resources for instance in the mkomazi and ruvu sub catchments through customary rules governed by chiefdom the highland communities were required to protect water sources and use water in the daytime for irrigation but leave the water to flow downstream in the night for the lowland communities although the colonialism ujamaa and villagisation programme all interfered with the integration of water and forest management the historical background of integration has been the basis for the existing initiatives for water and forest management integration in the study area see section 3 1 the results are supported by msuya 2010 who correlate the historical integration of water and forest management to the existing community based integrative initiatives for water and forest management in mwanga and same districts 4 1 2 dependence on water resource the plausible explanation of results in table 3 is that as dependence on water resource increases stakeholders are likely to devise new strategies for managing water and associated resources holistically this implies that high dependence on water resources increases the realisation and the need for water users to participate in the protection of water sources it is evident that water shortage in prb is accelerated by increasing degradation of catchment forests hastened by inadequate financial and human resources and poor collaboration and cooperation between the forest conservator forest sector and the water abstractor water sector hans 2002 iucn 2003 kulindwa 2005 as per the results in table 4 local communities have begun to realise the importance of water payment and their interest in supporting watershed protection are growing for instance the lowlanders represented by 35 58 and 43 of the respondents from kikafu chini kigonigoni and chekelei villages respectively have showed an interest in participating in watershed protection but they are constrained by lack of formalised mechanisms for participation experience from nepal indicates that increased water shortage and high dependence on water resources have increased realisation of integration in water and forest management among rural communities pant et al 2005 4 1 3 highland lowland livelihood inter dependence the highland lowland livelihood inter dependence in table 3 implies the existence of inter dependence between the highland and lowland communities in employment food and water for various purposes the highland communities depend on the lowland areas for employment and food production or purchase conversely water used by the lowland communities for irrigation and other uses is sourced from the highland areas and the upstream communities have participated in its management water is just reserved waiting to be released for irrigation in the lowlands mainly in kigonigoni and butu ugweno villages during the dry season highland lowland livelihood interdependence may foster some form of highland lowland integration through financial contributions by the downstream communities to aid the protection of water sources in the highlands for example as water use fees this integrative initiative needs to be strengthened through the development of integrative platforms or fora such highland lowland interdependencies express themselves differently but with similar basic patterns in many areas of the world hurni 2010 4 1 4 social capital social capital comprises social relations and trust that have been developed through networks to facilitate coordination and cooperation collective action for mutual benefit pretty and ward 2001 social relations and trust increase the possibilities for devising some initiatives geared to integrating management of watershed resources in spite of the parallelistic and dualistic nature of watershed institutional structure in kyeeri kisanjuni mbore kigonigoni ruvu mferejini and kweminyasa villages the village government leaders and traditionally based leadership authorities complement each other in the management of micro catchment forests and water distribution through customary rules the council of elders in kyeeri wameku kisanjuni mbore and kigonigoni vyaghosi ruvu mferejini ekingwanan and kweminyasa vyaghoshi synergised the management of forest and water resources however in some instances where the traditional leadership authorities face difficulties in enforcing customary punishment to wrongdoers the village leaders use by laws to force the culprits to comply with customary punishment this contributes not only to formal and informal institutional linkage but also the integration of water and forest management 4 1 5 age of respondents the elders not only take care of traditional forests but they also manage water bodies along these catchment forests thus the presence of elders in the communities is vital in improving watershed management integration because the elders are the ones owning integrative indigenous knowledge and norms the age structure of the respondents as indicated in fig 3 shows a small proportion of elders above 65 years in the household composition however what matters in watershed management integration is not the number of elders but their commitments and effectiveness as an initiative to enhance integration of forest and water management elder councils in nepal have played a commendable role in linking water user groups and forest groups pant et al 2005 4 1 6 participatory approaches in water and forest management participatory forest management has necessitated the formation of village natural resources committees and or village environmental committees while in the case of water management a participatory approach has resulted in the formation of irrigators associations domestic water committees cooperative societies wuas and various water user groups since members of these organisations come from the same communities they are likely to initiate some form of integration in water and forest management for example in kyeeri village the sub village hamlet leaders are members of both furrow committees and village environmental committee thus they play an important role in both water and forest management in a way the natural resources committees or environmental committees participating in catchment forest management integrate water and forest management unknowingly as the two resources co exist in catchment forests thus when these committees are participating in managing forest resources they also manage water resource the findings endorse the views of previous studies that because they are often the same group of stakeholders local communities integrate water and forest management activities either directly or indirectly even though initial development efforts are highly segregated along sectoral lines pant et al 2005 msuya et al 2009 4 2 constraining factors to water and forest management integration as indicated in table 5 poor inter sectoral coordination at field level diverging interests of watershed stakeholders incompatibility between formal and informal institutions lack of highland lowland integration development interventions household size inadequate political support and migration levels are the constraining factors to water and forest management integration identified in the study area apart from inadequate political support and the level of migration other factors significantly constrain the integration of water and forest management 4 2 1 poor inter sectoral coordination at field level the existence of separate sectoral ministries dealing with water management ministry of water and irrigation and forest management i e ministry of natural resources and tourism and prime minister s office regional administration and local government at macro level contributes to poor coordination and collaboration in water and forest management at the basin and local levels this is because each ministry has its own policy law and programme whose implementation exacerbates the formation of sector specific organisations at basin and local levels apparently there is insufficient coordination when the forest and water based institutions interact with local communities the activities of the forest authorities catchment forest project and district forest departments and those of water authorities pbwo and district water departments are not coordinated each of these water and forest entities interacts with local communities independently thereby contributing to the formation of sectoral affiliated local organisations it is said that insufficient cooperation and coordination among and between different water and forest based entities is the major bottleneck for integrated management of watershed resources sangameswaran 2008 4 2 2 diverging interests of watershed stakeholders with an increasing deviation of stakeholders interests there is an increased likelihood of forming different local organisations with different interests in the use and management of water and forest resources this has an implication on the formation of multiple sectoral oriented formal organisations at local level which are not compatible with the existing customary authorities as the number of water based and forest oriented local organisations increases the opportunities for integrating management of water and forest resources decreases the results from semi structured interview and focus group discussions revealed a high diversity of stakeholders with diverging interests to water and forest resources they include smallholder water users large scale water users formal and informal water user groups committees and associations basin water office district councils forest resource users village natural resources and environmental committees village government catchment forest managers and various facilitators ngos this increases ambiguity in watershed management integration due to difficulties in convincing multiple stakeholders to forego their interests for the sake of forming an integrated forum currently the basin lacks an institutional mechanism to coordinate the activities of multiple stakeholders frederiksen 2007 asserts that integration in the management of watershed resources in a situation where each resource is managed independently and the stakeholders have multiple and diverging interests to these resources is very challenging 4 2 3 incompatibility between formal and informal institutions the plausible explanation for the increasing incompatibility between formal and informal institutions is that the existing power difference between formal and informal institutions is the deference of the latter towards the former the formal institutions are empowered by formal laws while the informal ones are governed by customary laws there are also disparities in sanctioning mechanisms between the two while the former is based on the court of law the latter is based on traditional sanctions in this case watershed stakeholders governed through customary rules are normally reluctant to change to formal governance and those stakeholders governed by formal rules usually disregard the customary governance system in the study area this polarisation is exemplified by an ongoing process of formalisation of informal institutions whereby the newly formed formal institutions in areas dominated by customary based informal institutions are often not accepted by local communities for instance the new formal water governance institution in ruvu mferejini village called ruvu farmers irrigation cooperative society limited rufaicos has been rejected due to incompatibility with the existing customary watershed governance institution naururu irrigators association nia in kyeeri villagers were reluctant to apply for water rights since they have relied on customary water use arrangements since pre colonial times in fact formal water governance arrangements are considered as competitors to customary arrangements sokile 2005 this intensifies the incompatibility between formal and informal institutions and hence reduces chances for integration 4 2 4 lack of highland lowland integration the increasing gap between the highland and lowland stakeholders and watershed resources has been fuelled by the increasing institutional disparities between the two locations at present a mechanism in regulating the use and management of watershed resources between highland and lowland areas is lacking this increases the likelihood of forming highland and lowland oriented watershed institutions that are not coordinated on the contrary since irrigation is more practised in the lowland areas water related entities are mostly formed in the lowlands this reduces the chances of water and forest management integration the existence of administrative units separating the lowlands from the highlands also contributes to this separation for instance three study villages from ruvu sub catchment kisanjuni mbore and kigonigoni are affiliated to three different divisions regardless of their inter dependence in watershed resources use and management kisanjuni is located in ugweno mbore is found in usangi while kigonigoni is affiliated to jipendea division this contradicts the former boundaries which were set based on the ecological socio economic and resource interdependence between highlands and lowlands which has consequently reduced the likelihood of watershed resource management integration similarly mbeyale 2009 contends that highland lowland administrative disparities hamper integration in the management of common pool resources in the mkomazi sub catchment 4 2 5 development interventions the increasing numbers of water dependent investors implies increasing water use competition and power struggles between investors and local communities this is due to the inverse relationships between the increasing number of water users and the quantity of water available in the basin pbwo and iucn 2007 moreover the establishment of the pbwo in 1991 increased complexity in watershed management integration the basin office is charging water use fees even to the communities who are playing a great role in watershed protection on the other hand the catchment forest project under the forest and beekeeping division fbd plays a managerial role in catchment forests in the basin ironically the mechanism has been put in place for the basin office pbwo to pay for watershed protection despite the recommendations of a feasibility study on designing mechanisms to enhance payment for environmental services kulindwa 2005 this increases the likelihood of disintegration in water and forest management in the study area 4 2 6 household size the negative relationships between the household size and integration of water and forest management implies that for every increase of one member of the family there is a decrease in the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 0 456 an increase in household size indicates population growth the population increase is also expressed as mean household size in the study villages compared to the average household size of the overall prb an increase in household size is likely to increase water use intensities demand for forest products and land for settlements and cultivation these aspects have effect on the degradation of catchment forests and the declining sizes of traditional forests as exemplified by the kinyala and mbale sacred forests in kisanjuni village 4 2 7 migration level the negative integration in water and forest management suggests that as the level of migration increases the likelihood of integration declines by an odds ratio of 0 616 this is because both immigration and emigration are likely to cause erosion of traditional watershed management institutions known to embrace integration thus it is high time to enhance ecohydrology and iwrm so as to ensure a sustainable supply of es at the river basin scale 4 3 institutional challenges to iwrm implementation with the exception of poor compatibility between formal and informal institutions all other constraining factors to iwrm implementation were reported more in the lowland villages than in the highlands table 7 this may be due to the fact that the majority of socio economic activities that depend largely on water are found in lowland areas in highland areas water typically originates from watersheds in protected areas the diversity of water based institutions at local levels confuses actors local communities it has been observed that various institutions focusing on water management are present in the study villages these institutions sometimes mislead villagers thus retarding watershed restoration efforts similarly along the prb there is poor coordination and few links between the institutions dedicated to watershed management each institution seems to fulfill its own purpose and objective thus working in isolation while fighting to achieve the same goal in turn this greatly hampers the implementation of iwrm the other institutional challenges confronting the smooth operation of the iwrm along the prb include the lack of any forum for coordinating multiple stakeholders and institutions the overlap of institutions with interests in water resources use and management and poor compatibility between formal and informal institutions therefore incorporating ecohydrology and iwrm seems to be the ideal solution for watershed restoration and water management in the study areas however much effort is needed to disseminate information to stakeholders about the potential for linking the two for watershed management along the prb and other areas facing similar problems 5 conclusion effective iwrm implementation can promote sustainable management of water resources for societal needs and biota since nature protection and water management are addressed as two sides of the same coin management of watershed resources has to be integrated with ecohydrological principles and follow the sustainability potential enhancement zalewski 2015 approach in that regard watershed resources along the prb have to be managed as a single ecosystem this can be attained through retaining natural vegetation and trees at the upper watersheds along the entire river basin and by protection of a mangrove forest at the pangani river estuary this conforms also with the holistic approach as stipulated in iwrm gwp 2000 therefore integrating ecohydrology and iwrm to allow full inter sectoral integration through an ecosystem approach is crucial for sustainable watershed management equitable water access and a steady flow of es lalika 2017 engineering solutions zalewski 2015 that meet society needs and ensure biota and ecosystems sustainability geared towards water management could be alternatives as they have multiple benefits achieving this is possible if the four dublin principles on iwrm are enforced and adequately implemented furthermore the presence of a number of stumbling blocks prevent effective implementation of iwrm along the prb under the current institutional structure proper stakeholder participation for integrating ecohydrology and ecological approaches for water resource management is hindered to a great degree by the lack of a platform for coordinating multiple stakeholders and institutions at different levels this is triggered by lack of a basin level forum for coordinating multiple stakeholders and institutions with diverse interests and the presence of imbalanced power to water resources management therefore it is high time for incorporating ecohydrology principles and practices in the implementation of iwrm along the prb for ecological integrity societal requirements and sustainable flow of es similarly the fate of sustainable watershed management along the prb depends largely on how successfully watershed management iwrm and ecohydrology practices can be developed and integrated in an institutional framework and be implemented on the ground for river basin sustainability a well developed integrated institutional framework is a roadmap for sustainable watershed management for ecological sustainability sustainable watershed management economic sustainability improving water use efficiency and social sustainability equitable water access through proper stakeholder representation in decision making therefore effective integration and subsequent implementation of iwrm and ecohydrology in tanzania can lead to watershed sustainability and a steady flow of watershed es the successful iwrm operationalization along the prb depends largely on the mitigation pathways of the factors constraining iwrm implementation therefore the government of tanzania particularly the ministry of water and the ministry of natural resources and tourism should work together in linking ecohydrology and iwrm along the prb for sustainable flow of es ecological sustainability and environmental flow at large moreover the current study on ecohydrology iwrm and the institutional framework represents yet another opportunity for sustainable watershed management through ecological approaches studies carried out along various river basins in tanzania e g rufiji kashaigili et al 2007 wami ruvu 2014 and pangani hans 2002 have either focused on water flow or water allocation and supply at the expense of the key aspect of ecohydrology i e harmonization of the enhanced ecosystem potential with societal needs through the use of ecosystem properties as management tool in a multidimensional framework wbsr zalewski 2015 the current study therefore forms the basis for linking ecohydrology and nature based solutions with an institutional framework to ensure sustainability of water flow and to satisfy the society needs rather than advocating conventional mechanical management methods therefore as well as encouraging the use of ecological conservation methods we also call upon researchers to identify biotechnological approaches for improving water resources for societal needs and sustainability as well as to support implementing the sustainable management framework being a problem solving science ecohydrology as a discipline could be integrated with iwrm in order to maximize the multiple benefits from ecosystems in the form of es through water biota interactions the use of ecological biological approaches in ecosystem management could enhance the sustainable management of forest and provide a steady flow of provisioning supporting and regulating es while ensuring environmental flow i e water quantity quality and timing with an institutional framework in place in the country guided by sectoral policies dedicated to natural resource management e g environmental forest water wildlife beekeeping and land policies and favourable political will it is believed that sustainable flow of es could be achieved however as advocated by zalewski 2015 to have these ecological and socio economic achievement for societal needs it is high time to change the ways of thinking not only about water and the environment but also in relation to human activities economy engineering and technological development environmental management and education in general conflict of

1166,linking integrated water resources management iwrm and ecohydrology for the sustainance of watersheds and environmentally friendly economic activities is vital for ensuring continued water flow and a steady supply of watershed services for societal needs and the integrity of aquatic vegetation and animal species however regardless of the reforms in water policy and the water resources development programme and water resources management act to include provisions for iwrm tanzania is still facing several institutional challenges in the practical implementation of iwrm this study aimed at exploring the potentials and constraints for integrating ecohydrology and iwrm to develop an integrated institutional framework for providing a sustainable flow of ecosystem services for societal needs along the pangani river basin prb in tanzania the data was collected through socio economic methods including questionnaires surveys structured and semi structured interviews and a documentary review of secondary information logistic regression models were performed to analyse factors influencing watershed management integration logistic regression results showed that watershed management integration was significantly p 0 001 constrained by poor inter sectoral coordination at field level diverging interests of watershed stakeholders incompatibility between formal and informal institutions poor highland lowland integration development interventions population pressure inadequate political support and migration this together with power imbalances and the uncoordinated interests of multi stakeholders predispose the prb s watersheds to unsustainable management this state of affairs will continue to hamper national aspirations to effectively implement iwrm along the prb successful iwrm implementation would allow the country to meet its obligations towards sustainable watershed management it is recommended that an integrated institutional framework capable of integrating upstream and downstream communities be developed keywords ecohydrology practices watershed services sustainable forest management integrated watershed management societal challenges participatory management 1 introduction water provides important ecosystem services es for socio economic development and in the age of rapid population growth wise management of watersheds is essential gleick 2002 vörösmarty 2002 king and brown 2010 lalika 2017 furthermore these es represent both a livelihood support system and a means to regulate ecological integrity kashaigili et al 2007 the dependency of the human population on the integrity of natural systems to provide es has for quite some time necessitated the management of these sources of natural wealth to sustain the flow of es mea 2005 as the human population continues to grow the limited availability of clean freshwater is among the major constraints to further social and economic development king and brown 2010 the problem is vividly witnessed in developing countries where the supply of freshwater has been insufficient to support national development goals meet food needs safeguard the livelihoods of rural people and protect an increasingly degraded environment king and mccartney 2007 united nations 2007 in contrast the majority of developed countries have a well developed system of institutional social and economic systems often achieved at the expense of environmental resources furthermore while modern sustainable development may well focus on restoring es to various extents the ecosystems offering these es are steadily being degraded or diminished by development in recent years it has been documented that the pressure exerted by a growing human population on natural ecosystems has been threatening the basic foundation needed to ensure a steady supply of es essential for survival and ecological integrity lalika et al 2015a b 2017 lalika 2017 watershed ecosystems are under pressure due to increased competing demands for es from the burgeoning human population and from climate change and variability lalika et al 2015b which have led to complex institutional challenges for water management mbeyale 2009 msuya 2010 among others they include watershed conservation watershed governance environmental flow and the determination of the amount of water that can be taken from a river before its ability to meet social ecological and economic needs is hindered msuya 2010 lalika et al 2015a poor water governance lalika et al 2015b a weak link among water management institutions and water management for societal needs are some of the fundamental global problems concerning the steady provision of water related es the rising demand for water related es the deterioration of watersheds and water quality and reduction of water flow are contemporary serious threats to human well being global efforts towards forming integrated institutional approaches to provide solutions to major environmental problems represent a significant paradigm shift towards nature management focused on the sustained use of water resources in the water resources field this paradigm shift from conservation efforts towards knowledge based management has found expression in the form of ecohydrology and integrated water resources management iwrm ecohydrology is a discipline that aims to achieve integrative sustainability using the interactions between hydrology biota and natural processes as management tools to reinforce ecosystem services on a broad range of landscapes zalewski 2015 this integrative sustainability science is a basis for the development and application of market based approaches in watershed management being a sub discipline of hydrology that focusses on ecological processes occupying within the hydrological cycle ecohydrology strives for enhancing environmental sustainability in order to reverse water and ecosystem degradation to ensure a sustainable supply of es for society and restore ecological quality as an ecological tool for enhancement of sustainability ecohydrology practices increase the resilience of river basins by managing multi dimensional parameters such as water biodiversity ecosystem services for society and resilience to climate change wbsr in order to achieve sustainability in both ecosystems and the human population zalewski 2015 however the success of ecohydrology as a sustainability potential enhancement wbsr tool along river basins depends much on the holistic approach where the human component is essential therefore to find solutions for reversing the degradation of river basins for responding better to sustainable water resource policies and promoting social development with stakeholders participation at all levels it is crucial to integrate ecohydrology with iwrm iwrm allows holistic management of water resources without compromising the sustainability of ecosystems gwp 2000 and has since guided our understanding and strategies it aims at ensuring the co ordinated development and management of water land and related resources by maximizing economic and social welfare without compromising the sustainability of vital environmental systems gwp 2014 as is the case for ecohydrology iwrm strives to meet human requirements for the use of freshwater whilst maintaining hydrological and biological processes and biodiversity which are considered essential for the functioning of ecosystems the sustainable use of water resources and the maintenance of the es they provide this concept is being increasingly put into practice and incorporates much of the philosophical framework of ecosystem management the emergence of iwrm as a guiding philosophy for river basin management has gained popularity since the mid 20th century and the implementation of iwrm is guided by the four dublin principles through an emphasis on ecological institutional gender and instrument turton et al 2007 cited by funke et al 2007 these are key towards facilitating water management at the river basin scale for ecological integrity while ensuring a sustainable flow of societal benefits zalewski 2015 given the focus on vital ecosystems and natural resources iwrm is regarded as a promising approach insofar that it involves local communities residing along river basins dungumaro and madulu 2003 based on this premise iwrm is often proposed as the appropriate governance regime for sustainable water resources management however iwrm implementation and success is often challenged by a great variety of factors ranging from ecosystem sustainability and economic efficiency to social equity sokile 2005 the iwrm implementation triangle comprise other important issues such as institutional management and public participation in management activities dungumaro 2006 dungumaro and madulu 2003 institutions are perhaps the most important players in the implementation of iwrm cap net 2005 identifies 13 areas of change in iwrm which all seem to hang on the ability of institutions to ensure the effective implementation of iwrm three of the change areas fall under the enabling environment eight are categorized under management instruments and finally the last i e i creating an organizational framework and ii institutional capacity building fall under the institutional roles the argument is that once effective institutions are in place management instruments are developed and the enabling environment created this is particularly true if forms and functions of each organization are clearly stated and capacity building is done hence once a well functioning institutional set up is integrated with ecohydrological principles and practices then is possible to achieve a sustainable flow of ecosystem services while maintaining ecosystem integrity despite the importance of iwrm in water management little is known about the link between ecohydrology and iwrm along the pangani river basin prb in tanzania the current study attempts to clarify this missing link the objectives of this study were to i determine the factors influencing watershed management integration ii determine the factors constraining water and forest management integration and iii analyse the institutional constraints to iwrm implementation in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area 2 1 1 location the study was carried out in eight villages namely kyeri kikafu chini kisanjuni mbore kigonigoni ruvu mferejini kweminyasa and chekelei along the prb tanzania fig 1 the pangani river basin prb extends from the northern highlands to the north eastern coast of the country and lies between latitude 03 05 00 and 06 06 00 south and longitude 36 45 36 and 39 36 00 east it covers an area of about 43 650km2 of which 5 lies in kenya within the district of taita taveta iucn 2003 however since this is not a typical trans boundary study the concentration was more on the tanzanian side of the basin the terms prb and pangani basin pb have two different meanings the former refers to the basin of the pangani river only while the latter incorporates the prb and other three smaller basins umba msangazi and zigi river basins adjacent to the prb and covers a total area of about 56 000km2 iucn 2003 however this study is confined to the prb the prb is intersected by sixteen districts arusha urban arumeru siha hai rombo moshi rural and urban mwanga same simanjiro kiteto lushoto korogwe kilindi handeni muheza and pangani within the kilimanjaro manyara arusha and tanga regions 2 1 2 hydrology and drainage patterns the pangani river drains from the slopes of mount kilimanjaro mount meru the pare and usambara mountains and extends 450km to its outlet in the indian ocean the river is sourced from several river systems of which the majority of streams and springs originate from the highland areas within the prb there are several natural and man made lakes the largest man made lake is the nyumba ya mungu dam nymd which was constructed in 1968 it covers an area of 17 000ha originally this water body was constructed for water supply irrigation and water control but the purpose has now changed to hydropower generation the natural lakes include lake jipe 2800ha and lake chala 315ha near the kenyan border on the slopes of north pare mountains and mount kilimanjaro respectively iucn 2003 other manmade lakes with the construction year in brackets include kalimawe dam 1959 in same district chunguli 1965 in mwanga district cholo 1965 ukyashi 1962 and mworoworo 1961 in moshi rural district and chanika 1957 and kwenkambala 2003 in handeni district iucn 2003 over the years springs and streams in the basin have dried up as a result of watershed degradation and high water stress due to increased utilization pbwo iucn 2007 2 1 3 forest and vegetation types the vegetation of the prb is complex ranging from forests on mountain slopes to semi arid grasslands the major vegetation types include forests woodlands bushland grassland thicket and cultivated crops turpie et al 2005 the plantation forests have replaced natural forests in the highlands and the larger part of the lowlands is composed of woodland bushland grassland and thicket as dominant vegetation types it is worth noting here that the most important vegetation type with hydrological functions in the prb are the forests as they regulate run off prevent soil erosion store water and improve water quality iucn 2003 there are five main types of forests in the basin these include mangrove forests coastal forests afromontane forests riverine forests and miombo woodlands iucn 2003 the forests in the prb are subjected to intense utilisation pressure leading to varying levels of degradation according to lambrechts et al 2002 the forest degradation has led to a decline of the kilimanjaro natural forest by 41km2 between 1952 and 1982 in the same vein human disturbance has triggered loss of original forest cover by 77 in the eastern arc mountains between 1978 and 1998 newmark 1998 the main causes of forest degradation in the prb are encroachment for settlement and agricultural production increasing demand of forest products mainly timber and fuelwood contributing to deforestation inadequate enforcement of the rule of law and fire incidents iucn 2003 2 1 4 land use and socio economic activities land use in the basin is governed primarily by rainfall slope soils and water availability with most cultivation being on the lower mountain slopes around mount kilimanjaro and mount meru the foothills of the pare and usambara mountains and along narrow river floodplains the land cover within the prb has a reflection on land use the main economic activities in the prb are agriculture and livestock keeping the highlands are particularly favoured for coffee tea banana potato taro and vegetable cropping irrigation is a common practice both for small scale and large scale agriculture however traditional furrows are more used by small scale farmers and more advanced irrigation systems such as drip irrigation by large estates two forms of livestock use is can be observed in the study area zero grazing practised by highland communities and free grazing used by lowland communities the pastoralists particularly the maasai initially occupied the lowland floodplains where they found pastures for their animals mbeyale 2009 2 1 5 climate and ecological zones the basin is characterised by the contrast between the humid mountain ranges which receive annual rainfall amounts in the range of 1000 2500mm and the semi arid lowlands where annual rainfall is below 1000mm notter 2010 the coastal area receives annual rainfall amounts of 1000 1500mm due to the proximity of the indian ocean notter 2010 the basin has a bimodal pattern of rainfall with long rains between march and june and short rains from november to december temperatures are influenced by altitude with lower temperatures experienced in the highlands and higher temperatures in the lowlands at higher altitudes the temperature ranges between 10 c and 28 c while in the lowlands the range is between 24 c and 34 the highlands and lowlands are the two prominent ecological zones of the prb the highland zone is the most productive area with high amount of rainfall up to 3000mm per year the highest mountain in the african continent mount kilimanjaro 5895m a s l mount meru 4562m a s l and the north and south pare and usambara east and west mountains are found in the highland zone this zone is covered by natural and plantation forests of high catchment values ikeno 2007 mbeyale 2009 2 2 sampling procedure stratified and purposive sampling methods were used to select study villages first the five sub catchments of the prb i e the kikuletwa sub catchment the ruvu sub catchment the mkomazi sub catchment the pangani mainstem sub catchment and the luengera sub catchment were adopted as the sampling frame for this study fig 2 each individual sub catchment displays disparities in hydrological characteristics following this each sample frame was stratified into highland and lowland to capture highland and lowland interaction and at least one village was purposively selected from each stratum of each sample frame thus kyeeri highland and kikafu chini lowland was sampled from the kikuletwa sub catchment kisanjuni and mbore highland and kigonigoni lowland from the ruvu sub catchment ruvu mferejini in the pangani mainstem kweminyasa highland and chekelei lowland were sampled from the luengera sub catchment during the sampling process the unit of study was the household however since communities in the study villages were heterogeneous the households in each village were stratified into hamlets the households were therefore divided into different hamlets and random numbers were assigned to each household in each hamlet a list of random numbers was then generated to choose sample households for structured interviews thus a total of 345 households was selected randomly based on a sampling intensity ranging from 5 to 10 of the number of households table 1 2 3 data collection methods 2 3 1 structured questionnaires we used structured questionnaires as the main method for secondary data collection these structured questionnaires comprising of open and closed questions were administered to a sample of 345 households the target respondents were the heads of households however in the case of their absence other members of the households aged 18 were interviewed the questionnaire items included socio economic information perceptions on the past and present status of watershed management integration institutional interplay and performance with regard to watershed management integration enabling and constraining factors to watershed management integration information on stakeholders interests to water and forest resources and stakeholders initiatives in watershed management integration 2 3 2 semi structured and unstructured interviews this method was used to supplement the information gathered through structured questionnaires a checklist of questions was used to guide the discussion of water management issues whereas unstructured interviews involved talking casually with the respondents on particular research issues without prior appointment of the conversation this exercise was conducted to key informants who represented organisations with a stake in the use and management of watershed resources the key informants interviewed included the village leaders representatives from village natural resources committees village environmental committees village land use committees village water committees furrow committees irrigators associations and other water user groups others groups that we interviewed include traditional and ritual leaders selected local elites ward executive officers representatives from ngos agricultural extension workers and foresters private investors african highland initiative ahi traditional irrigation and environmental improvement organisation tip tanzania forest conservation group tfcg representatives of the pangani basin water office pbwo international union for conservation of nature iucn representative and director of water resources department 2 3 3 desk documentary review desk studies were carried out to collect secondary data relevant published and unpublished documents were reviewed from a range of both online and offline sources including project reports ngos the pbwo database and various government offices the following libraries were searched sokoine university of agriculture university of bern university of dar es salaam tanzania forestry research institute and the pbwo 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 quantitative data analysis the data collected through structured questionnaires was summarised coded cleaned and analysed using the statistical package for social sciences spss version 12 0 and microsoft excel descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were also carried out 2 4 2 description of variables and model specification to perform the inferential statistical analysis two logistic regression models were developed to show the influence of independent variables on water and forest management integration dependent variable one model was designed for water and forest management integration and another for constraining factors to water and forest management integration logistic regression a binary technique for estimating the probability of an event to occur was also used because of the dichotomous nature of the dependent variable and the nominal and numerical nature of independent variables wuensch 2008 2 4 3 dependent variable we measured water and forest management integration by weighing a number of indicators interpreted from good governance and iwrm principles organisation theory and community decoded indicators extent of conflict resolution through conceptual causal chains watershed water and forest management integration dependent variable was found to be a function of good governance iwrm organisational theory and community decoded indicators as indicated here under water and forest management integration f good governance indicators iwrm principles organisation theory community decoded indicators good governance indicators f participation accountability equity rule of the law effectiveness and efficiency organisation theory f coordination efficiency and fairness iwrm principles f holistic approach extent of water payment community decoded indicator f extent of conflict resolution the indices were combined into a composite index as indicated in the field sheet table 2 in measuring watershed management integration the decoded indices were given scores ranging from one to three and the mean score computed for each respondent with scores of 3 2 and 1 reflecting good fair and poor respectively the dependent variable is a dichotomous dummy variable determined by 1 for good integrative potential or 0 for otherwise therefore the mean scores were again assigned new codes to make the dependent variable dichotomous a mean value less than 0 5 was coded as zero and the rest were coded as one 2 4 4 independent variables the independent variables are the enabling and constraining factors which are likely to influence integration in water and forest management in showing the relationship between dependent water and forest management integration and independent variables enabling and constraining factors the conceptual causal chains adopted from agrawal 2001 were developed as illustrated here under 2 4

development interventions household size inadequate political support and migration error the enabling and constraining factors to watershed management integration were first identified during focus group discussions thereafter the factors which were common to all the study villages were included in a structured questionnaire for further questioning 2 4 7 the imperial model two logistic regression models were developed to model the probability of an event to occur the probability of the event not to occur is given as pro no event 1 pro event the logistic regression models comprising more than one independent variables are given as 1 y i 1 1 e z j 2 y i 1 1 e z k where y i dependent variable depicting integration in water and forest management z j the combination of enabling

that previous integration experience in water and forest management increases the likelihood of water and forest management integration this is due to the existence of remnants of integrative experience in the study area this is a dummy variable coded 1 for perception of previous integrative experience and 0 if otherwise the expected sign of regression coefficient is positive β 2 4 8 2 x j2 highland lowland livelihood interdependence this is a dummy variable expressed as 1 for yes if mutual inter dependence existed between the highland and the lowland communities in livelihood strategies and 0 for no if otherwise it was assumed that the highland communities depend on the lowland areas for food and employment while the lowland communities depend on the highland ecosystem for water used for irrigation domestic and other purposes this interdependence was assumed to have positive influence on the integrative potential in water and forest management and hence β coefficient is expected to be positive β 2 4 8 3 x j3 social capital social capital was expressed in terms of social relation and trust that facilitate cooperation between watershed stakeholders it is a dummy variable with a value of 1 for yes indicating good relationship and that trust exists between watershed stakeholders and 0 for no if otherwise social relations and trust entail the existence of collective action which has been institutionalised in local leadership when the local leadership is strong the chances of devising mechanisms geared to water and forest management are high collective action is one of the indicators of integrative initiatives with a positive effect on water and forest management integration thus social capital was assumed to have a positive regression coefficient β 2 4 8 4 x j4 age of respondents the age of respondents expressed in years was assumed to have positive influence on water and forest management integration it is assumed that an increase in age of the respondents increases the chances of collaboration and cooperation in water and forest management this is because the elders are assumed to have knowledge on the previous integrative experience which can boost integration of water and forest management this is a numerical variable with expected positive sign of β coefficient β 2 4 8 5 x j5 dependence on water resource it was assumed that increased dependence on water resources in the study area influenced integration in water and forest management the reason behind this could be the existing positive correlation between increased water use intensities and water shortage this is therefore expected to motivate water users to support activities geared to watershed protection dependence on water resource was coded 1 for yes if the respondent depends on water for more than one uses and 0 for no if otherwise the regression coefficient for this dummy variable was expected to be positive β 2 4 8 6 x j6 participatory approaches in water and forest management this is a dummy variable expressed as the perception of the respondents with a value of 1 for the presence of participatory approaches in both water and forest management and 0 for otherwise introduction of participatory approaches was assumed to enhance integration of water and forest management this is due to the fact that an increase in participation could facilitate collaboration between water and forestry based local institutions which could then trigger some form of initiatives geared to integrated management of water and forest resources the expected sign for beta value is positive β 2 4 8 7 x k1 poor inter sectoral coordination at field level the existing formal governance structure influences the sectoral approach in the management of watershed resources in this case it was assumed that different sectors with different interests in watershed resources i e those with interests in water and those interested in forest resources approach local communities independently without coordination this was assumed to reduce integration of water and forest management this factor was expressed as dummy value of 1 yes for insufficient coordination and 0 no if otherwise this variable was assumed to have a negative value for the β coefficient β 2 4 8 8 x k2 household size this is a numerical variable expressed in terms of the number of household members it is hypothesized that larger households exert greater pressure on watershed resources than otherwise this was assumed to increase degradation in the forests and increase water demand this situation was assumed to influence the development of new uncoordinated water and forest oriented institutions as it is assumed to have a negative influence on water and forest management integration the expected sign of the regression coefficient was negative β 2 4 8 9 x k3 diverging interests of watershed stakeholders the presence of diverging interests for watershed stakeholders was assumed to have negative influence on water and forest management integration this is because greater divergence of stakeholder interests increases the likelihood of forming local organisations with poorly coordinated interests in watershed resources this increases the chance of separation in watershed resource management this is a dummy variable with a value of 1 for yes if the divergence of stakeholders interests influence negatively the integration of water and forest management and 0 for no if otherwise the regression coefficient was expected to be negative β 2 4 8 10 x k4 incompatibility between formal and informal institutions this is a dummy variable expressed as the perception of the respondents with a value of 1 for yes if incompatibility existed between formal and informal institutions and 0 for no if otherwise incompatibility between formal and informal institutions was assumed to impede integration of water and forest management because such incompatibility can reduce the likelihood of collaboration and cooperation between them the beta value was expected to be negative β 2 4 8 11 x k5 existence of development interventions this is a nominal variable expressed as a dummy with a value of 1 yes for the presence of development interventions i e projects irrigation schemes ngos and cbos and 0 no if otherwise development interventions were assumed to negatively influence integration in the management of watershed resources this was attributed to poor coordination resulting from the independent nature of most of the development interventions intended to facilitate development of multiple social organisations at a local level which predisposed them to favour whoever facilitated their formation the regression coefficient was expected to be negative β 2 4 8 12 x k6 lack of highland lowland integration this is a nominal variable expressed as a dummy with a value of 1 for yes if the highland and lowland stakeholders and watershed resources are poorly integrated and 0 for no if otherwise this variable was assumed to have a negative coefficient β as poor integration would reduce integrative potential of water and forest management the existence of administrative boundaries exemplified by village wards division and district and organisations separating the lowland areas from the highlands was assumed to contribute to poor highland lowland integration and therefore weaken watershed management integration 2 4 8 13 x k7 inadequate political support inadequate political support was expressed in terms of respondents perception this factor was hypothesised to lessen the integrative potential of water and forest management since poor political support was assumed to reduce integrative initiatives of local organisations it was expressed as dummy variable with a value of 1 for yes if there was inadequate political support to watershed management integrative initiatives and 0 for no if otherwise the variable was assumed to have a negative regression coefficient β 2 4 8 14 x k8 migration level migration level was expressed in terms of the mean value between immigration and emigration immigration was expressed as the number of non indigenous family members and emigration as the number of household members residing outside the households the mean score between immigration and emigration was used as an independent variable in logistic regression i e it is a than the indigenous residents the variable was assumed to have a negative β coefficient β numerical variable migration was assumed to increase cultural dilution and hence reduces the potential for water and forest management integration due to the fact that newcomers and those residing outside the areas are assumed to have less integrative knowledge the hypotheses tested were h 0 β 0 implying that the value of regression coefficients is equal to zero and thus the independent variables enabling and constraining factors have no influence on dependent variables water and forest management integration h 1 β 0 implying that the regression coefficients are not equal to zero and thus the independent variables have either positive or negative influence on the dependent water and forest management integration 2 4 9 qualitative data analysis secondary data synthesised from reports policy legal and regulatory documents including the forest policy water policy land policy agricultural policy wildlife policy and national environmental policy and their subsequent strategies and acts was examined to identify the provisions for institutional performance indicators interpreted from good governance characteristics organisational theory and iwrm principles the formal and informal institutional performance in watershed management integration at the local level was analysed based on community based indicators organisational theory ackroyd 2002 good governance characteristics unescap 2007 and iwrm principles gwp 2000 3 results 3 1 factors influencing watershed management integration table 3 presents the results logistic regression of enabling factors for water and forest management integration the logistic regression model fits well to the data p 0 01 the 2 log likelihood of 86 362 implies good fitness of data to the model whereas the overall percentage of 88 1 signifies correct predictions of independent variables by the model 3 1 1 historical background on integration the results revealed a positive correlation between the existing history of watershed management integration and integration of water and forest management β 2 598 this implies that retrieving the history of integration is likely to significantly p 0 000 increase the magnitude of water and forest management integration by a factor of 10 547 3 1 2 dependence on water resource an increasing dependence on water resource significantly p 0 001 increases the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 7 549 table 4 table 4 shows high dependence on water resource for various uses all the respondents depend on water for domestic purposes drinking cooking and washing whereas 74 depend on water for irrigation 70 for livestock 25 for fishing and 12 for other purposes including transport and rituals local communities have started to realise the importance of paying for water and their interest in supporting watershed protection are growing for instance the lowlanders represented by 35 58 and 43 of the respondents from kikafu chini kigonigoni and chekelei villages respectively have showed interest of participating in watershed protection but they are constrained by lack of formalised mechanisms for participation 3 1 3 highland lowland livelihood inter dependence the highland lowland livelihood inter dependence significantly p 0 005 improves the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 5 818 table 4 this was substantiated by 48 of the respondents from kyeeri village 57 from kisanjuni 79 from mbore and 40 from kweminyasa village who reported to have been cultivating crops in the lowland areas also the majority of the respondents from the highland villages of kisanjuni 88 and mbore 69 were depending on food crops maize produced in the lowland areas on the other hand water used by the lowland communities for irrigation and other uses is sourced from the highland areas and the highlanders have participated in its management this is exemplified by the chunguli reservoir 246 600m3 located in kisanjuni village which was built in the highlands to store water used for irrigation in the lowland areas during the dry season the sources of water feeding this reservoir are protected in five clan based sacred forests micro catchments namely kishengweni 4 0ha owned by the wafinanga clan kwa mochani 2 0ha mrakama 1 5ha mghamba 2 5ha and mbale 4 0ha all under the wasuya clan 3 1 4 social capital table 4 shows a positive regression coefficient β 1 153 of social capital implying that an increase in one unit of social relations and trust increases the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 3 649 increasing social relations and trust increase the chance for cooperation between stakeholders and local organisations regardless of sectoral affiliation for instance in kikafu chini through social relations and trust the village leaders and leaders of the irrigators association uwakichi have reached an informal agreement to integrate management of irrigation water and riverine forests in that vein uwakichi is contributing a portion of water use fees 500 000 shillings for conservation of forests along the kikafu river while the village leaders play the actual forest conservation role along the kikafu river 3 1 5 age of respondents table 4 shows that an increase in the age significantly p 0 021 increases the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 2 900 this is probably due to the integrative style used by the elders in the management of traditional forests particularly those with catchment values and irrigation water allocation since pre independence times the respondents age structure fig 3 shows a small proportion of elders above 65 years in the household composition 3 1 6 participatory approaches in water and forest management as indicated in table 4 participatory approaches in water and forest management did not significantly influence water management however the results indicate that introduction of participatory approaches are likely to enhance integration in water and forest management by a factor of 1 488 this implies that proper participation facilitates some initiatives geared at integrating water and forest management 3 2 factors constraining water and forest management integration table 5 shows logistic regression results on the factors constraining integration of water and forest management the high value of the overall percentage 77 4 indicates that high proportion of the cases was correctly predicted by the model the chi square value of 41 55 at p 0 001 implies the independent variables have a significant influence on the dependent variable the 2 log likelihood of 186 4 implies a good fit between the model and the data the wald statistics determine whether particular independent variables have significant effect on the dependent variable in that regard all the factors except inadequate political support and the level of migration are significantly likely to constrain the integration of water and forest management 3 2 1 poor inter sectoral coordination at field level poor inter sectoral coordination at field level significantly p 0 000 reduces the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 0 272 table 5 the existence of separate line ministries responsible for water management ministry of water and irrigation and forest management ministry of natural resources and tourism and prime minister s office regional administration and local government at macro level contributes to poor coordination and collaboration in water and forest management at the basin and local levels this is because each ministry has its own policy law and programme whose implementation exacerbates the formation of sector specific organisations at basin and local levels apparently there is insufficient coordination when the forest and water based institutions interact with local communities the activities of the forest authorities catchment forest project and district forest departments and the water authorities pbwo and district water departments are not coordinated each of these water and forest entities interacts with local communities independently thereby contributing to the formation of sectoral affiliated local organisations it is said that insufficient cooperation and coordination among and between different water and forest based entities is the major bottleneck for integrated management of watershed resources sangameswaran 2008 3 2 2 diverging interests of watershed stakeholders the diverging interests of watershed stakeholders is negatively related to integration of water and forest management with a negative regression coefficient β 1 145 and a large wald statistics value 9 347 this implies a significant p 0 005 decrease of the likelihood of water and forest management integration for every unit increase in the magnitude of divergence of stakeholder interests with an increasing deviation of stakeholder interests there is an increased likelihood of forming different local organisations with different interests in the use and management of water and forest resources this has an implication on the formation of multiple sectoral oriented formal organisations at the local level which are not compatible with the existing customary authorities as the number of water based and forest oriented local organisations increases the opportunities for integrating the management of water and forest resources decreases the results from semi structured interview and focus groups discussions revealed a high diversity of stakeholders with diverging interests to water and forest resources they include smallholder water users large scale water users formal and informal water user groups committees and associations the basin water office district councils forest resource users village natural resources and environmental committees village government catchment forest managers and various facilitators ngos this increases ambiguity in watershed management integration due to difficulties in convincing multiple stakeholders to forego their interests for the sake of forming an integrated forum currently an institutional mechanism to coordinate the activities of multiple stakeholders is lacking in the basin frederiksen 2007 contends that integration in the management of watershed resources is very challenging in a situation where each resource is managed independently and the stakeholders have multiple and diverging interests to these resources 3 2 3 incompatibility between formal and informal institutions increasing incompatibility between formal and informal institutions was found to significantly p 0 010 reduce the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 0 363 a plausible explanation is the existing deference and power between formal and informal institutions the formal institutions are empowered by formal laws while the informal ones are governed by customary laws there are also disparities in sanctioning mechanisms between the two while the former is based on the court of law the latter is based on traditional sanctions in this case watershed stakeholders governed through customary rules are normally reluctant to change to formal governance and those stakeholders governed by formal rules usually disregard the customary governance system in the study area this polarisation is exemplified by an ongoing process of formalisation of informal institutions whereby the newly formed formal institutions are often not accepted by local communities in areas dominated by custom based informal institutions for instance the ruvu farmers irrigation cooperative society limited rufaicos a new formal water governance institution in ruvu mferejini village has been rejected due to incompatibility with the existing customary watershed governance institution naururu irrigators association nia in kyeeri villagers were reluctant to apply for water rights since they have relied on customary water use arrangements since pre colonial times in fact formal water governance arrangements are considered as competitors to customary arrangements sokile 2005 sokile et al 2003 this intensifies the incompatibility between formal and informal institutions and hence reduces chances for integration 3 2 4 lack of highland lowland integration the likelihood of water and forest management integration decreases significantly p 0 015 by a factor of 0 424 with an increasing separation of the highland and lowland stakeholders and watershed resources this has been exacerbated by the increasing institutional disparities between the highland and lowland areas at present a mechanism in regulating the use and management of watershed resources between highland and lowland areas is lacking this increases the likelihood of forming highland and lowland oriented watershed organisations which are not coordinated the results from ssi point out that the natural resources committees are commonly formed in the highland areas on the contrary since irrigation is more practised in the lowland areas water related entities are mostly formed in the lowlands this reduces the chances of water and forest management integration the existence of administrative units separating the lowlands from the highlands also contributes to this separation for instance three study villages from ruvu sub catchment kisanjuni mbore and kigonigoni are affiliated to three different divisions regardless of their inter dependence in watershed resource use and management kisanjuni is located in ugweno mbore is found in usangi while kigonigoni is affiliated to jipendea division this contradicts the former boundaries which were set based on the interdependence of ecological social and economic resource use between highlands and lowlands which have consequently reduced the likelihood of integration in the management of watershed resources similarly mbeyale 2009 contends that highland lowland administrative disparities hamper integration in the management of common pool resources in the mkomazi sub catchment 3 2 5 development interventions development interventions significantly p 0 023 impede integration of water and forest management this implies that for every unit increase in the magnitude of development interventions there is a reduction of the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 0 453 fig 4 development interventions in prb include private investments irrigation schemes activities funded by sectoral programmes autonomous water authorities and projects donor funded activities and ngo and cbo activities 3 2 6 household size table 5 shows significant p 0 044 negative relationships between the household size and integration of water and forest management the population increase is also expressed in terms of mean household size in the study villages compared to the average household size of the overall prb which is five members according to human population census of 2002 urt 2003 3 2 7 migration level the results from table 5 shows that migration is negatively β 0 626 related to integration in water and forest management however this relationship is not significant p 0 280 the negative relationship indicates that as the level of migration increases the likelihood of integration declines by an odds ratio factor of 0 616 as table 6 shows 67 of the respondents had a household size greater than the basin average while all the study villages had a mean household size greater than the basin average increase in household size is likely to increase water use intensity demand for forest products and land for settlements and cultivation these aspects play a role in the degradation of catchment forests and the declining sizes of traditionally forests as exemplified by the kinyala and mbale sacred forests in the kisanjuni village 3 3 institutional challenges to iwrm implementation according to table 7 the five institutional challenges to iwrm implementation identified at micro level the majority of respondents reported the multiplicity of water based institutions 75 followed by poor inter sectoral coordination 67 a lack of any forum for coordinating multiple stakeholders and institutions 58 a lack of highland lowland integration 49 and poor compatibility between formal and informal institutions 40 with the exception of poor compatibility between formal and informal institutions all other constraining factors to iwrm implementation were reported more in the lowland villages than in the highlands table 7 4 discussion 4 1 factors influencing watershed management integration the chi square score of 62 109 at seven degrees of freedom and p 0 001 implies that the independent variables have a significant influence on the dependent variable the wald statistics determine whether particular independent variables have a significant effect on the dependent variable in that regard all the factors except participatory approaches in water and forest management are significantly likely to enhance the integration of water and forest management table 3 4 1 1 historical background on integration the history of watershed management integration in the study area can be traced back to the pre colonial era whereby it was possible to integrate water and forest management through the chiefdom system the chiefs delegated mandates regarding water and forest management to the headmen it was possible to have one headman ruling the highland and lowland communities and the resources for instance in the mkomazi and ruvu sub catchments through customary rules governed by chiefdom the highland communities were required to protect water sources and use water in the daytime for irrigation but leave the water to flow downstream in the night for the lowland communities although the colonialism ujamaa and villagisation programme all interfered with the integration of water and forest management the historical background of integration has been the basis for the existing initiatives for water and forest management integration in the study area see section 3 1 the results are supported by msuya 2010 who correlate the historical integration of water and forest management to the existing community based integrative initiatives for water and forest management in mwanga and same districts 4 1 2 dependence on water resource the plausible explanation of results in table 3 is that as dependence on water resource increases stakeholders are likely to devise new strategies for managing water and associated resources holistically this implies that high dependence on water resources increases the realisation and the need for water users to participate in the protection of water sources it is evident that water shortage in prb is accelerated by increasing degradation of catchment forests hastened by inadequate financial and human resources and poor collaboration and cooperation between the forest conservator forest sector and the water abstractor water sector hans 2002 iucn 2003 kulindwa 2005 as per the results in table 4 local communities have begun to realise the importance of water payment and their interest in supporting watershed protection are growing for instance the lowlanders represented by 35 58 and 43 of the respondents from kikafu chini kigonigoni and chekelei villages respectively have showed an interest in participating in watershed protection but they are constrained by lack of formalised mechanisms for participation experience from nepal indicates that increased water shortage and high dependence on water resources have increased realisation of integration in water and forest management among rural communities pant et al 2005 4 1 3 highland lowland livelihood inter dependence the highland lowland livelihood inter dependence in table 3 implies the existence of inter dependence between the highland and lowland communities in employment food and water for various purposes the highland communities depend on the lowland areas for employment and food production or purchase conversely water used by the lowland communities for irrigation and other uses is sourced from the highland areas and the upstream communities have participated in its management water is just reserved waiting to be released for irrigation in the lowlands mainly in kigonigoni and butu ugweno villages during the dry season highland lowland livelihood interdependence may foster some form of highland lowland integration through financial contributions by the downstream communities to aid the protection of water sources in the highlands for example as water use fees this integrative initiative needs to be strengthened through the development of integrative platforms or fora such highland lowland interdependencies express themselves differently but with similar basic patterns in many areas of the world hurni 2010 4 1 4 social capital social capital comprises social relations and trust that have been developed through networks to facilitate coordination and cooperation collective action for mutual benefit pretty and ward 2001 social relations and trust increase the possibilities for devising some initiatives geared to integrating management of watershed resources in spite of the parallelistic and dualistic nature of watershed institutional structure in kyeeri kisanjuni mbore kigonigoni ruvu mferejini and kweminyasa villages the village government leaders and traditionally based leadership authorities complement each other in the management of micro catchment forests and water distribution through customary rules the council of elders in kyeeri wameku kisanjuni mbore and kigonigoni vyaghosi ruvu mferejini ekingwanan and kweminyasa vyaghoshi synergised the management of forest and water resources however in some instances where the traditional leadership authorities face difficulties in enforcing customary punishment to wrongdoers the village leaders use by laws to force the culprits to comply with customary punishment this contributes not only to formal and informal institutional linkage but also the integration of water and forest management 4 1 5 age of respondents the elders not only take care of traditional forests but they also manage water bodies along these catchment forests thus the presence of elders in the communities is vital in improving watershed management integration because the elders are the ones owning integrative indigenous knowledge and norms the age structure of the respondents as indicated in fig 3 shows a small proportion of elders above 65 years in the household composition however what matters in watershed management integration is not the number of elders but their commitments and effectiveness as an initiative to enhance integration of forest and water management elder councils in nepal have played a commendable role in linking water user groups and forest groups pant et al 2005 4 1 6 participatory approaches in water and forest management participatory forest management has necessitated the formation of village natural resources committees and or village environmental committees while in the case of water management a participatory approach has resulted in the formation of irrigators associations domestic water committees cooperative societies wuas and various water user groups since members of these organisations come from the same communities they are likely to initiate some form of integration in water and forest management for example in kyeeri village the sub village hamlet leaders are members of both furrow committees and village environmental committee thus they play an important role in both water and forest management in a way the natural resources committees or environmental committees participating in catchment forest management integrate water and forest management unknowingly as the two resources co exist in catchment forests thus when these committees are participating in managing forest resources they also manage water resource the findings endorse the views of previous studies that because they are often the same group of stakeholders local communities integrate water and forest management activities either directly or indirectly even though initial development efforts are highly segregated along sectoral lines pant et al 2005 msuya et al 2009 4 2 constraining factors to water and forest management integration as indicated in table 5 poor inter sectoral coordination at field level diverging interests of watershed stakeholders incompatibility between formal and informal institutions lack of highland lowland integration development interventions household size inadequate political support and migration levels are the constraining factors to water and forest management integration identified in the study area apart from inadequate political support and the level of migration other factors significantly constrain the integration of water and forest management 4 2 1 poor inter sectoral coordination at field level the existence of separate sectoral ministries dealing with water management ministry of water and irrigation and forest management i e ministry of natural resources and tourism and prime minister s office regional administration and local government at macro level contributes to poor coordination and collaboration in water and forest management at the basin and local levels this is because each ministry has its own policy law and programme whose implementation exacerbates the formation of sector specific organisations at basin and local levels apparently there is insufficient coordination when the forest and water based institutions interact with local communities the activities of the forest authorities catchment forest project and district forest departments and those of water authorities pbwo and district water departments are not coordinated each of these water and forest entities interacts with local communities independently thereby contributing to the formation of sectoral affiliated local organisations it is said that insufficient cooperation and coordination among and between different water and forest based entities is the major bottleneck for integrated management of watershed resources sangameswaran 2008 4 2 2 diverging interests of watershed stakeholders with an increasing deviation of stakeholders interests there is an increased likelihood of forming different local organisations with different interests in the use and management of water and forest resources this has an implication on the formation of multiple sectoral oriented formal organisations at local level which are not compatible with the existing customary authorities as the number of water based and forest oriented local organisations increases the opportunities for integrating management of water and forest resources decreases the results from semi structured interview and focus group discussions revealed a high diversity of stakeholders with diverging interests to water and forest resources they include smallholder water users large scale water users formal and informal water user groups committees and associations basin water office district councils forest resource users village natural resources and environmental committees village government catchment forest managers and various facilitators ngos this increases ambiguity in watershed management integration due to difficulties in convincing multiple stakeholders to forego their interests for the sake of forming an integrated forum currently the basin lacks an institutional mechanism to coordinate the activities of multiple stakeholders frederiksen 2007 asserts that integration in the management of watershed resources in a situation where each resource is managed independently and the stakeholders have multiple and diverging interests to these resources is very challenging 4 2 3 incompatibility between formal and informal institutions the plausible explanation for the increasing incompatibility between formal and informal institutions is that the existing power difference between formal and informal institutions is the deference of the latter towards the former the formal institutions are empowered by formal laws while the informal ones are governed by customary laws there are also disparities in sanctioning mechanisms between the two while the former is based on the court of law the latter is based on traditional sanctions in this case watershed stakeholders governed through customary rules are normally reluctant to change to formal governance and those stakeholders governed by formal rules usually disregard the customary governance system in the study area this polarisation is exemplified by an ongoing process of formalisation of informal institutions whereby the newly formed formal institutions in areas dominated by customary based informal institutions are often not accepted by local communities for instance the new formal water governance institution in ruvu mferejini village called ruvu farmers irrigation cooperative society limited rufaicos has been rejected due to incompatibility with the existing customary watershed governance institution naururu irrigators association nia in kyeeri villagers were reluctant to apply for water rights since they have relied on customary water use arrangements since pre colonial times in fact formal water governance arrangements are considered as competitors to customary arrangements sokile 2005 this intensifies the incompatibility between formal and informal institutions and hence reduces chances for integration 4 2 4 lack of highland lowland integration the increasing gap between the highland and lowland stakeholders and watershed resources has been fuelled by the increasing institutional disparities between the two locations at present a mechanism in regulating the use and management of watershed resources between highland and lowland areas is lacking this increases the likelihood of forming highland and lowland oriented watershed institutions that are not coordinated on the contrary since irrigation is more practised in the lowland areas water related entities are mostly formed in the lowlands this reduces the chances of water and forest management integration the existence of administrative units separating the lowlands from the highlands also contributes to this separation for instance three study villages from ruvu sub catchment kisanjuni mbore and kigonigoni are affiliated to three different divisions regardless of their inter dependence in watershed resources use and management kisanjuni is located in ugweno mbore is found in usangi while kigonigoni is affiliated to jipendea division this contradicts the former boundaries which were set based on the ecological socio economic and resource interdependence between highlands and lowlands which has consequently reduced the likelihood of watershed resource management integration similarly mbeyale 2009 contends that highland lowland administrative disparities hamper integration in the management of common pool resources in the mkomazi sub catchment 4 2 5 development interventions the increasing numbers of water dependent investors implies increasing water use competition and power struggles between investors and local communities this is due to the inverse relationships between the increasing number of water users and the quantity of water available in the basin pbwo and iucn 2007 moreover the establishment of the pbwo in 1991 increased complexity in watershed management integration the basin office is charging water use fees even to the communities who are playing a great role in watershed protection on the other hand the catchment forest project under the forest and beekeeping division fbd plays a managerial role in catchment forests in the basin ironically the mechanism has been put in place for the basin office pbwo to pay for watershed protection despite the recommendations of a feasibility study on designing mechanisms to enhance payment for environmental services kulindwa 2005 this increases the likelihood of disintegration in water and forest management in the study area 4 2 6 household size the negative relationships between the household size and integration of water and forest management implies that for every increase of one member of the family there is a decrease in the likelihood of water and forest management integration by a factor of 0 456 an increase in household size indicates population growth the population increase is also expressed as mean household size in the study villages compared to the average household size of the overall prb an increase in household size is likely to increase water use intensities demand for forest products and land for settlements and cultivation these aspects have effect on the degradation of catchment forests and the declining sizes of traditional forests as exemplified by the kinyala and mbale sacred forests in kisanjuni village 4 2 7 migration level the negative integration in water and forest management suggests that as the level of migration increases the likelihood of integration declines by an odds ratio of 0 616 this is because both immigration and emigration are likely to cause erosion of traditional watershed management institutions known to embrace integration thus it is high time to enhance ecohydrology and iwrm so as to ensure a sustainable supply of es at the river basin scale 4 3 institutional challenges to iwrm implementation with the exception of poor compatibility between formal and informal institutions all other constraining factors to iwrm implementation were reported more in the lowland villages than in the highlands table 7 this may be due to the fact that the majority of socio economic activities that depend largely on water are found in lowland areas in highland areas water typically originates from watersheds in protected areas the diversity of water based institutions at local levels confuses actors local communities it has been observed that various institutions focusing on water management are present in the study villages these institutions sometimes mislead villagers thus retarding watershed restoration efforts similarly along the prb there is poor coordination and few links between the institutions dedicated to watershed management each institution seems to fulfill its own purpose and objective thus working in isolation while fighting to achieve the same goal in turn this greatly hampers the implementation of iwrm the other institutional challenges confronting the smooth operation of the iwrm along the prb include the lack of any forum for coordinating multiple stakeholders and institutions the overlap of institutions with interests in water resources use and management and poor compatibility between formal and informal institutions therefore incorporating ecohydrology and iwrm seems to be the ideal solution for watershed restoration and water management in the study areas however much effort is needed to disseminate information to stakeholders about the potential for linking the two for watershed management along the prb and other areas facing similar problems 5 conclusion effective iwrm implementation can promote sustainable management of water resources for societal needs and biota since nature protection and water management are addressed as two sides of the same coin management of watershed resources has to be integrated with ecohydrological principles and follow the sustainability potential enhancement zalewski 2015 approach in that regard watershed resources along the prb have to be managed as a single ecosystem this can be attained through retaining natural vegetation and trees at the upper watersheds along the entire river basin and by protection of a mangrove forest at the pangani river estuary this conforms also with the holistic approach as stipulated in iwrm gwp 2000 therefore integrating ecohydrology and iwrm to allow full inter sectoral integration through an ecosystem approach is crucial for sustainable watershed management equitable water access and a steady flow of es lalika 2017 engineering solutions zalewski 2015 that meet society needs and ensure biota and ecosystems sustainability geared towards water management could be alternatives as they have multiple benefits achieving this is possible if the four dublin principles on iwrm are enforced and adequately implemented furthermore the presence of a number of stumbling blocks prevent effective implementation of iwrm along the prb under the current institutional structure proper stakeholder participation for integrating ecohydrology and ecological approaches for water resource management is hindered to a great degree by the lack of a platform for coordinating multiple stakeholders and institutions at different levels this is triggered by lack of a basin level forum for coordinating multiple stakeholders and institutions with diverse interests and the presence of imbalanced power to water resources management therefore it is high time for incorporating ecohydrology principles and practices in the implementation of iwrm along the prb for ecological integrity societal requirements and sustainable flow of es similarly the fate of sustainable watershed management along the prb depends largely on how successfully watershed management iwrm and ecohydrology practices can be developed and integrated in an institutional framework and be implemented on the ground for river basin sustainability a well developed integrated institutional framework is a roadmap for sustainable watershed management for ecological sustainability sustainable watershed management economic sustainability improving water use efficiency and social sustainability equitable water access through proper stakeholder representation in decision making therefore effective integration and subsequent implementation of iwrm and ecohydrology in tanzania can lead to watershed sustainability and a steady flow of watershed es the successful iwrm operationalization along the prb depends largely on the mitigation pathways of the factors constraining iwrm implementation therefore the government of tanzania particularly the ministry of water and the ministry of natural resources and tourism should work together in linking ecohydrology and iwrm along the prb for sustainable flow of es ecological sustainability and environmental flow at large moreover the current study on ecohydrology iwrm and the institutional framework represents yet another opportunity for sustainable watershed management through ecological approaches studies carried out along various river basins in tanzania e g rufiji kashaigili et al 2007 wami ruvu 2014 and pangani hans 2002 have either focused on water flow or water allocation and supply at the expense of the key aspect of ecohydrology i e harmonization of the enhanced ecosystem potential with societal needs through the use of ecosystem properties as management tool in a multidimensional framework wbsr zalewski 2015 the current study therefore forms the basis for linking ecohydrology and nature based solutions with an institutional framework to ensure sustainability of water flow and to satisfy the society needs rather than advocating conventional mechanical management methods therefore as well as encouraging the use of ecological conservation methods we also call upon researchers to identify biotechnological approaches for improving water resources for societal needs and sustainability as well as to support implementing the sustainable management framework being a problem solving science ecohydrology as a discipline could be integrated with iwrm in order to maximize the multiple benefits from ecosystems in the form of es through water biota interactions the use of ecological biological approaches in ecosystem management could enhance the sustainable management of forest and provide a steady flow of provisioning supporting and regulating es while ensuring environmental flow i e water quantity quality and timing with an institutional framework in place in the country guided by sectoral policies dedicated to natural resource management e g environmental forest water wildlife beekeeping and land policies and favourable political will it is believed that

1167,in response to the recent efforts of the government to foster industrial transformation the number of industries in ethiopia have been growing and ensuring ecological safety is becoming a challenge as a consequence this study assesses the sustainability potential of industries in hawassa city lake hawassa and the cheleleka wetland ethiopia the study investigates the shrinkage rate of the open water portion of the cheleleka wetland over the last 45 years effluents from three large industries were collected and analyzed to measure the degree of stress on the ecosystem in addition the potential functional performance of the wetland was modeled based on fifteen field indicators in addition a scheme of the proposed constructed wetland system is conceptualized and the required theoretical treatment area of the proposed system is estimated using volumetric and areal based process design models the temporal trend analysis found that the open water portion of the cheleleka wetland to fall from 12km2 in 1972 to 5km2 in 1986 3km2 in 1995 and 1km2 in 2000 very little area remained in 2007 and 2016 the current functional performance is estimated to be high for water quality

city industries lake hawassa 1 introduction ethiopia has seen a steady increase in the number of industries following the efforts of the ethiopian government to foster a market based and socially inclusive industrial transformation altenburg 2010 however the environmental pollution associated with these industries has also presented a challenge for the country ghebretekle 2015 harmonizing such opposing interests calls for the use of logical strategic initiatives intended for the reduction or elimination of point and non point pollution sources which is not yet fully guaranteed in ethiopia and for the enhancement of the carrying capacity resistance and resilience of the environment which is usually neglected zalewski et al 1998 this situation can be considered from the perspective of decision making theory which is based on two fundamental conditions for successful strategic actions reducing threats and amplifying opportunities in this context controlling the water quality status of industrial effluents primary and secondary treatments is analogous to the elimination of threats whereas improving the carrying capacity of the ecosystem to the amplification of chances this study focuses on the latter and argues in favor of the use of ecohydrology to create harmony among the three components of the studied urban ecosystems these are hawassa city the capital city of the southern regional state of ethiopia lake hawassa a hydrologically closed urban lake and the cheleleka wetland located a few kilometers upstream of the lake the study assesses the existing wetland and proposes an alternative constructed wetland to supplement each other wetlands have been described as a living machine macdonald 1994 and the kidneys of the planet wallance 1998 recently hawassa city has been rapidly expanding industrial plants have been increasing in number and the natural wetland called cheleleka has been shrinking belete 2013 zalewski 1996 contends that ecohydrology allows those threats to be reduced and opportunities amplified in a system as noted above a strategy that addresses only one of these components cannot be successful kolodziejski 1995 the objective of this study is therefore to analyze the status of the wetland system over time and assess its ability to perform its expected natural functions from the input side the water quality status of three large industries brewery textile and soft drinks factories were analyzed with respect to the epa 2003 standard of the ethiopian government thus providing an understanding of the prevalent environmental stress occurring in the study area the study conceptualizes the application of ecohydrological solutions for the harmonization of industrialization with ecological safety in an urban environment finally it estimates the required theoretical treatment area of the proposed wetland system using volumetric and areal based process design models 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the wetland under study is delineated according to its hydrology hydrophytic vegetation and hydric soils as shown in fig 1 cheleleka wetland is located upstream of lake hawassa and at the outlet of the tikur wuha sub catchment in the ethiopian rift valley basin within the coordinates of 447 290m and 453 980m easting and 774 465m and 785 800m northing based on the wetland delineation procedure used in this study its size is about 34km2 cheleleka wetland qualifies as riverine flow through type wetland as defined by hydrogeomorphic classification smith et al 1995 brinson 1993 the predominant hydrophytic vegetation types found in the studied wetland are typha cattail which is emergent and herbaceous and nymphaea odorata water lily which is of the floating leaved type the vegetation prevailing in the buffer zone is listed in table 1 it was observed that all of the types of vegetation within the delineated boundary are facultative wetland plants that usually occur in wetlands 67 99 of the time but are occasionally found in upland areas jackson 1995 2 2 transect data and geographic information for wetland delineation prior to defining the geographic coordinates of the wetland under study its area was first determined based on the three attributes wetland hydrology where the water is at or near the surface or the land itself is covered by shallow water and which supports hydrophytic vegetation i e vegetation typically adapted to live in hydric soil saturated soil conditions delineation of the wetlands was first approximated by remote sensing off site identification using aerial photographs and satellite images this was followed by on site identification of the actual boundary by a transect walk along the likely boundaries assisted by the local community and the geographic information system gis the on site observation was performed by identifying the hydrologic breaks fig 2 defined as boundaries between saturated and unsaturated conditions in addition breaks in vegetation communities differentiating hydrophytes from terrestrial plants were identified this being the most obvious characteristic of wetlands tobe et al 1998 hydrophytes have specific morphological and physiological adaptations that allow their roots to tolerate and grow in oxygen deficient conditions sorrell et al 2000 this assumption is associated with the concept of continuum curtis 1959 whittaker 1967 which holds that vegetation changes gradually in response to environmental gradients in our case changes in hydrology and it is a useful basis for analyzing wetland boundaries null et al 2000 moreover changes in plant communities are related to competition among species pennings and callaway 1992 bertness 1991 the vegetational and hydrological data together would be used to indicate the soil condition of the area and hence its status as wetland this assumption is supported by ncsu accessed in 3 15 2017 which argues that for an ecological determination of the presence of a wetland all that may be required is the presence of hydrophytic vegetation that requires flooded or saturated conditions for survival 2 3 the semi quantitative method for performance assessment numerous methods have been developed to assess the potential function services of wetlands which call for different level of effort and expertise sutula et al 2006 these include the synoptic approach leibowitz et al 1992 the hydrogeomorphic method hgm smith et al 1995 the index of biotic integrity ibi karr 1981 the wetland rapid assessment procedure wrap miller and gunsalus 1999 the descriptive approach usace 1995 the habitat evaluation procedure hep usfws 1980 the new jersey watershed method zampella et al 1994 and the watershed science approach collins et al 1998 rapid assessment methods have to rely on easily observed characteristics that are correlated with actual environmental processes hruby et al 1999 most indicators are fixed characteristics that describe the structure of the ecosystem or its physical chemical and geological properties brinson et al 1995 the present study uses semi quantitative assessment methodology sam which is one of the rapid methods developed by cooke scientific services 2002 based in turn on a system developed by reppert et al 1979 for qualitatively determining which functions are being performed and to what degree table 2 shows the field indicators and acquisition techniques employed in this study 2 4 analysis of temporal variation in the open water portion of the wetland a topographic map with a scale of 1 50 000 was used to delineate the surface area of the open water portion of the cheleleka wetland in 1972 satellite images of the thematic mapper tm were used for 1986 and 1995 etm for 2000 spot5 for 2007 and google mapper for 2016 2 5 determination of the required treatment area all constructed wetland systems can be considered as attached growth biological reactors and their performance can be estimated with first order plug flow kinetics for bod and nitrogen removal reed et al 1995 the parameter that requires the largest treatment area for removal such as biological oxygen demand bod5 is the limiting design factor reed et al 1995 and that area is used for the design of our proposed system by this consideration the wetland should then provide acceptable treatment for all other parameters of concern the present study assesses the water quality of effluents and the corresponding release rate of the three major industries textile brewery and soft drinks among the water quality parameters bod5 was used as a targeting parameter the two design models used in this study are the volumetric process design model reed et al 1995 and areal based process design model kadlec and knight 1996 as shown

surface area of open water portion of the cheleleka wetland was 12km2 in 1986 it had shrunk to 5km2 the 1995 image shows that the surface was reduced to 3km2 and the 2000 image shows that it had shrunk to 1km2 the 2007 and 2016 images show complete disappearance 3 2 degree of stress on the ecosystem by industrial effluents in order to measure the stress on the ecosystem industrial effluents from three large industries brewery soft drinks and textiles were collected and analyzed using standard procedures table 3 presents the actual minimum and maximum concentrations of industrial effluents averaged over five consecutive working days the table also shows the acceptable values set by ethiopian epa 2003 and fig 4 shows raw data of the water quality parameters as shown in the above table conductivity temperature bod cod and sulphate concentration in the industrial effluents are quite far from the acceptable limits set by ethiopian epa 2003 implying that the industries do not conform with the expected standards the existing wastewater treatment infrastructure used by industries no longer seems sufficient to maintain environmental safety in terms of strategic actions it is evident that the elimination of threat is found to be insufficient to protect the environment against pollution and the other element of successful strategy amplification of opportunities is urgently needed to this end this study proposes the use of a constructed wetland that employs the concept of ecohydrology as it would be an effective approach to reduce the impact of the pollution in other words the traditional wastewater treatment plants need to be coupled with constructed wetlands to meet the basic standards which is a justification of the mentioned decision theory that implies amplification of opportunities in our case through application of ecohydrology the subsequent sub sections discuss the proposed ecohydrological system that potentially harmonizes industrialization urbanization and environmental safety 3 3 result of semi quantitative scoring for indicative performance evaluation table 4 shows the wetland characteristics and the corresponding semi quantitative scorings the models are fundamentally equivalent and expected to produce similar result however that is not the case partly due to the fact that they are developed from different datasets and also there are differences in the structure and content of the models crites et al 2006 the assessment effort implies that the cheleleka wetland has high potential for water quality improvement 2 3 out of 3 points 77 and medium potential for both ground water recharge 2 out of 3 points 67 and peak flood attenuation scores 1 2 out 3 points 40 as shown in table 4 some of the key attributes that favor better performance are related to the large size of the wetland as compared to its catchment about 5 44 and high vegetation coverage despite of this the wetland scores lower points due to its highly disturbed buffer condition location of the wetland at the lower end of the catchment and the condition of the outlet which is unconstrained and lets the water freely leave the wetland 3 4 conceptualizing the proposed wetland system as shown in table 4 above effluents of the tested industries were not fully purified by the existing primary and secondary treatments and so failed to comply with the national ambient water quality standards the stream that directly receives the industrial effluents 13km length with average flow velocity of 0 6m s directly drains into lake hawassa fig 4 without joining the proper wetland cheleleka thus failing to receive this natural treatment from the perspective of decision making theory the elimination of threat through the reduction of industrial point sources and its subsequent treatment by the conventional hydrotechnical solutions seems unrealistic for two reasons the excessive use of technology in the environment and the corresponding excessive costs this scenario should give way to amplification of opportunities by using natural systems as a management tool on the basis of understanding evolutionary established resistance and resilience to stress natural systems for the treatment and management of municipal and industrial wastewaters and residuals feature processes that use minimal energy and minimal or no chemicals and they produce relatively lower amounts of residual solids crites et al 2006 reed et al 1995 ecohydrology can reconcile the two often contradictory approaches to water resources management i e 1 hydrotechnical and 2 ecological zalewski 2015 it is an example of low cost and low energy green infrastructure it has also low greenhouse effects and requires little maintenance and operation fig 4 presents the conceptual scheme of the proposed ecohydrological system some of the expected processes responsible for pollutant removal in the proposed system include sedimentation chemical precipitation and adsorption microbial activities and macrophyte uptake vymazal 2001 kadlec and wallace 2009 3 5 result of treatment area determination table 5 presents the input and output variables of the volumetric and areal based process design model 4 conclusions our findings confirm that the existing wastewater treatment infrastructure of the local industries is insufficient for significantly reducing or eliminating point source pollutants as is the case in many parts of developing countries regardless of the basic reasons for this failure this study employs the other side of decision theory to amplify the chance of wastewater treatment by constructed wetlands implementing the principles of ecohydrology to develop a second line of defence appears to be feasible in this regard while determining the theoretically required treatment area it was found that the proposed wetland system will require a relatively large area of land fortunately land is not a limiting factor in the locality and the proposed system can be implemented in addition to wastewater purification correct implementation of the proposed system can also provide considerable aesthetic benefits wildlife habitats enhancement of the physical landscape and add a new tourism site the strategic location of the proposed site at the very back and lower part of elevated land can also be regarded as a favorable condition the hypothetical physical chemical and biological processes shown in the conceptual diagram are based on theoretical analyses and are not supported by evidence in this specific study area however those key processes are widely reported by previous studies around the globe and assumed to work in the study area as well however detailed environmental impact assessment is required before any further action in addition since ecohydrological processes are highly variable in both space and time actual direct quantification of the rates of ecosystem processes is recommended the economic value of wetlands or the importance of individual functions is also worth significant consideration conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the

1168,the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of effluents from traditional wet coffee processing plants on the downstream water quality in ethiopia composite water samples were collected from 11 rivers streams associated with wet coffee processing plants at the peak hours of coffee processing and water quality parameters were measured for the wastewater discharged as well as for the river water upstream and downstream of the discharge point acidic ph values were recorded for all plant effluents the organic content of the effluents varied from one plant to another but was considerably high overall with maximum values of 7200mg l and 871mg l for cod and bod5 respectively this high level of organic content in the effluents depleted the oxygen content to the level of 0 25mg l the organic load and the presence of nutrients invoke a large risk of eutrophication we found that variations in coffee bean soaking time pulp fermentation and the absence of appropriate treatment facilities were the major factors affecting the water pollutant parameters in general the measured values of effluent parameters significantly deviated from both the ethiopian epa and us epa guidelines thus water bodies and ecosystems located downstream of the traditional wet coffee processing plants are at an alarming risk of ecological disruption and there may also be severe health consequences for the nearby residents these findings raise the need for further research into the design and implementation of coffee waste valorization and treatment in view of sustainable coffee production keywords wet coffee processing wastewater discharge environmental pollution sustainable production 1 introduction coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world and second largest traded commodity after petroleum murthy and naidu 2012 it is cultivated in about 80 countries across the globe and gives rise to a huge business worldwide murthy and naidu 2012 according to united states department of agriculture data usda 2011 global coffee production in 2010 2011 is estimated to be above 8 2 million tons over 2 25 billion cups of coffee are consumed every day globally over 90 of coffee production takes place in developing countries whereas consumption is mainly in the industrialized economies ponte 2002 ethiopia is the origin of highland coffee coffea arabica linnaeus a plant earlier known as jasminum arabicum laurifolia jussieu this coffee tree species the only native coffee in the world has traditionally been tended and harvested as a wild tree in the highland forests of southwestern ethiopia schmitt 2006 mostly in the former kaffa province in ethiopia coffee plays a central role in the incomes of more than one million coffee growing households and the livelihood of over 15 million people directly or indirectly depends on this commodity crop lmc 2000 according to data from the ministry of agriculture and rural development moard of ethiopia for 2013 there were 1722 coffee processing wet and dry plants in ethiopia owned by private individuals cooperatives and the government furthermore according to data from the ethiopian coffee and tea development and marketing authority for 2016 17 the total number of coffee processing plants in ethiopia has now surged to 2156 ecta 2017 table 1 almost all wet coffee processing plants in ethiopia are located close to water bodies this is because a lot of water is needed for washing the beans removing the pulp and the mucilage but also in order to use the water bodies for direct disposal of the wastewater released from the wet coffee processing plants while there are some wet coffee processing plants that use disposal pits to stabilize the generated wastewater these disposal pits are constructed without following the correct design and dimensions in addition they lack the proper linings hdpe or cemented floor for example to protect against leakage of the effluents into the underground water and the holding capacity of the disposal pits is not taken into consideration during construction thus the coffee processing water and its wastewater are routinely discharged into nearby streams and rivers fig 1 illustrates disposal pits used by wet coffee processing plants in this regard proclamation number 602 2008 fdre 2008b and the council of ministers regulation number 159 2008 fdre 2008a of ethiopia proclaimed that coffee processors shall dispose waste without causing harm to the environment the public or individuals however in most cases there is a lack of continuous follow up and implementation industrial processing of coffee cherries for both dry and wet processes is outlined in fig 2 the wet coffee processing procedure requires mechanical removal of pulp with the help of water as a result of which it produces a considerable volume of wastewater in wet industrial processes a large amount about 29 dry weight of the whole coffee berry of coffee pulp is produced as the first byproduct corro et al 2013 it is obtained during wet processing of coffee and for every 2 tons of coffee processed 1 ton of coffee pulp is generated whereas in the dry process 0 18ton coffee husk is generated for every ton of fresh coffee cherries adams and dougan 1981 most of the coffee processing plants in ethiopia prefer to follow the wet processing method because wet processed coffee is considered superior in quality to dry processed coffee in addition it obtains higher prices and has a better aroma flavor than the coffee obtained by the dry processing method however wet coffee processing plants discharge untreated effluents into the nearby water bodies and open land in addition water consumption is high for this method in this regard kivaisi et al 2010 estimated that coffee processing is generating about 9 million m3 of wastewater and 600 000 tons of husks annually in the east africa region similarly devi et al 2008 indicated that the wastewater generated from coffee processing has high concentrations of organic pollutants like pectin proteins and sugars due to high pollutant content its disposal without treatment in water bodies has become undesirable due to the danger this poses for the water bodies and to human health the few existing case studies haddis and devi 2008 beyene et al 2012 endris et al 2008 indicate that disposing untreated coffee wastewater into local water bodies results in the pollution of downstream water sources and people residing in the vicinity of the wet coffee processing plants suffer from different types of diseases however there have been no detailed studies evaluating the impact of coffee wastewater effluents on the organic load nutrient enrichment and eutrophication of the nearby water bodies therefore this paper presents an assessment of effluent quality and the magnitude of impact on the downstream water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the jimma zone oromiya region ethiopia from the 18 districts of the jimma zone the limmu kossa manna and gomma districts were selected because these are the three leading districts in terms of wet coffee processing for the data collection 2 3 and 6 wet coffee processing plants were selected from the limmu kossa manna and gomma districts respectively because of their proximity to water sources for simplicity alphabetic letters ranging from a to k are used as codes throughout this paper of these 11 wet coffee processing plants only plants d and f have temporary disposal pits to stabilize the effluent whereas all the other plants discharge their effluent without any form of treatment fig 3 shows the area of study and the sampling points 2 2 sampling since wet coffee processing is a seasonal activity the study was conducted during the harvesting period for ripe coffee cherries which varies from year to year and usually falls between october and january to study the impact of these coffee processing industries on downstream water bodies water samples were taken from the upstream inlet water water used for washing depulping fermenting from the effluent wastewater after the depulping of the coffee beans removing the pulp and mucilage and from the nearest downstream water bodies that is after the effluent is discharged into the nearby river water however samples could not be taken in the downstream water bodies in two coffee plants downstream site of plants g and i due to road inaccessibility as a result a total of 31 sites were sampled all 3 sampling sites for 9 plants plus two sites for a further two plants to ensure that the sampling was representative composite samples of the wastewater released by the plants were collected at the peak hours of coffee processing in addition composite water samples were also taken from upstream and downstream rivers streams all samples were collected using clean polyethylene plastic bottles that were thoroughly washed with deionized water the water samples were filtered onsite before the analysis of no3 n nh 4 n tn and phosphorous as ortho phosphate then the samples were properly and carefully labeled sealed and transported to the laboratory of the department of environmental health sciences and technology jimma university ethiopia cold storage was maintained throughout the process until analysis was performed every sample was taken in triplicate and the average results were reported 2 3 water and wastewater analyses on site measurements of samples from the upstream and downstream river water and samples from wastewater for electrical conductivity ec ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do were carried out using a hach multi meter probe p n hq40d multi meter to measure total suspended solids tss and bod5 a gravimetric method by using glass microfiber gf a whatman filter paper having 4 7cm diameter and with pore size of 1 6μm and the azide modification of the winkler method by using aerator triton 2000cc china were used respectively for the remaining parameters cod no3 n nh 4 n tn and phosphorous as ortho phosphate lck test kits hach lange germany were used 3 discussion of results 3 1 general physico chemical characteristics of the upstream water and downstream the values of ph ec temperature and tss measured at the selected sampling points are presented in table 2 in fact since a correctional measurement of temperature at river sites is often misleading it is not the appropriate way to measure water temperature in river water the ph is generally lower in the effluent in all cases the ph is below 7 which indicates that all the effluents from wet coffee depulping processes lead to acidic conditions which can be toxic to the downstream ecosystem it was also observed that the ph of effluents from d f i and k plants factories were measured to be below 5 table 2 this may be due to the nature of the coffee bean itself the harvesting time of the bean the soaking duration of the depulped coffee bean the fermentation time to remove the mucilage and differences in processing the coffee bean for example the amount of water used for washing however at plant sites a b d and f the downstream ph value is higher than the corresponding upstream value this might be due to the self buffering capacity of the receiving water from the results it is evident that the ph in the effluent drops to 3 56 k indicating the active decomposition of organic matter this shows that there was fermentation of sugars in the mucilage in the presence of yeasts to alcohol and co2 as the organic waste oxidizes co2 is released and increases the acidic characteristics of the water decreasing the ph value below the range of 6 9 which is the surface water quality standard for ambient environment in ethiopia and 5 5 9 which is the us epa standards for discharge of environmental pollutants to inland surface waters table a1 in appendix the sugars contained in the mucilage ferment and the organic and acetic acids from the fermentation of the sugars make the wastewater acidic a condition in which higher plants and animals can hardly survive enden and calvert 2002 the acidic nature of wet coffee processing industry wastewater has also been reported elsewhere kefale et al 2012 beyene et al 2012 beyene et al 2014 the direct effects of ph changes involve alterations in the ionic and osmotic balance of individual organisms in particular changes in the rate and type of ion exchange across body surfaces this requires greater energy expenditure with subsequent effects such as slow growth and reduced fecundity becoming apparent efepa 2003 the relative increment of ph in downstream water bodies may be due to the buffering capacity of the receiving water however if this situation increases from time to time the self purification capacity of these water bodies will decline in general the wastewater of wet coffee processing plants has impacted the ph of downstream water bodies for example comparison of the upstream and downstream ph values clearly shows that the ph values were measured to be much lower at the downstream sites for plants h i j and k electrical conductivity ec can be regarded as a crude indicator of water quality for many purposes since it is related to the sum of all ionized solutes or total dissolved solid tds content the electrical conductivity of the water depends on the water temperature the higher the temperature the higher the electrical conductivity would be the trend of ec is not uniform but generally the ec values in the effluent are higher than for the upstream and downstream river sites the values are in the range from 63 2μs cm to 871μs cm table 2 the ec concentration of the effluent from plant factory i 3700μs cm d 3270μs cm and k 1134μs cm plants were observed to be higher than the other facilities this value is above the ethiopian surface water quality standard which is 1000μs cm table a1 in appendix this increment in ec may be due to the solubility decomposition of compounds during depulping and fermentation of the coffee pulp differences in the capacity of the coffee pulping mills may explain the differences between plants ec values downstream in the water bodies are lower due to dilution with water however this dilution may not always be sufficient this finding is consistent with similar studies done by endris et al 2008 and tekle et al 2015 generally we found that wet coffee processing wastewater has impacted the ec of downstream water bodies for example comparison of the ec values in the upstream and downstream clearly shows that the ec values were measured to be much higher at the downstream sites of the plants c d e f h j and k total suspended solids tss give a measure of the turbidity of the water it is a fact that ec is related to the ionic content of the sample which is in turn a function of the dissolved ionizable solids concentration tss values were indeed observed to follow approximately the trend of ec this increment in ec might be due to presence of inorganic compounds and floating particles having larger sizes the tss values ranged from 4 to 158mg l in upstream and 10 to 96mg l in downstream water bodies coffee mills f i k and d were found to have the maximum tss values of 2260mg l 1440mg l 1240mg l and 780mg l in their effluents respectively table 2 this may be due to the difference in soaking time washing frequency depulping and duration of fermentation of coffee beans in addition this may be due to the difference in the type of pulping machine used by the plants it is obvious that these values surpass by far the ethiopian surface water quality standards 50mg l and also the us epa standards for discharge of pollutants to inland surface waters 100mg l table a1 in appendix tss levels of 38mg l 2260mg l and 48mg l were measured in the upstream effluent and downstream site of plant f respectively the difference in upstream and downstream is only 10mg l which is not that high perhaps due to the functioning of the temporary disposal pit used by the plant the maximum value of tss in this study is larger 2260mg l than the maximum values reported by beyene et al 2012 which was 970mg l for the impacted sites and by devi et al 2008 which was 700mg l however it is consistent with values found in similar studies done by haddis and devi 2008 and tekle et al 2015 who reported 2080mg l in the effluent of coffee processing mills and 2504mg l in downstream waters respectively this high concentration of solids in suspension may lead to negative impacts in the ecosystem in turbid waters light penetration is reduced leading to a decrease in photosynthesis the resultant decrease in primary production reduces food availability for aquatic organisms higher up the food chain suspended solids may interfere with the feeding mechanisms of filter feeding organisms and the gill functioning foraging efficiency due to visual disturbances and growth of fish suspended solids that settle out may smother or abrade benthic plants and animals and may result in changes to the nature of the substratum this may then lead to changes in the structure of the biotic community through the decline of these organisms and their replacement with organisms which burrow in soft sediments sensitive species may be permanently eliminated if the source of the suspended solids is not removed efepa 2003 in addition as mentioned by tekle et al 2015 suspended solids may affect the use of water for various purposes by exacerbating the dissolved oxygen problem by sedimentation and forming oxygen demanding sludge deposits which may alter the habitat of aquatic microorganisms similarly as described by enden and calvert 2002 the suspended material especially the digested mucilage builds a crust on the surface clogging up waterways and further contributing to anaerobic conditions these tss concentrations automatically influence the quality of the receiving water bodies the elevated tss levels can be toxic to freshwater animals by causing osmotic stress and affecting the osmo regulatory capability of the organisms and can give rise to obnoxious odors from the decomposition of organic matter tekle et al 2015 in general we found that wet coffee processing plant wastewater impacted the tss of downstream water bodies for example comparison of the tss values for upstream and downstream clearly shows that the tss values were measured to increase in the downstream sites of plants a b c e f h and k 3 2 the state of organic load and dissolved oxygen the results of organic load measured in terms of biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and chemical oxygen demand cod and the level of dissolved oxygen do from upstream effluent and downstream sites are shown in table 3 the minimum dissolved oxygen concentration measured in the upstream water sources was found to be 5 15mg l plant h the decrement in do value might be due to the impact of different agricultural practices around the site the dissolved oxygen showed a significant decrease in all the coffee processing plants from upstream to downstream with values going down to 0 15mg l the do concentrations of the effluents from all the plants were found to be lower than the upstream water source which indicates that the oxygen is consumed during the decomposition of organic matter besides the do concentration of all the downstream sites is lower than the upstream sites this implies that the downstream water sources are compromised in addition plants j k h and f were found to have a do concentration of 0 15mg l 0 27mg l 1 5mg l and 1 75mg l respectively at the downstream water source this value is much below the ethiopian surface water quality standard which is a minimum do of 4 6mg l to support aquatic life table a1 in appendix which indicates the severe level of pollution of the rivers at the downstream sites typically it was observed that the do value depleted up to 0 15mg l in the downstream table 3 anoxic or hypoxic conditions may be lethal within short time scales minutes to hours the sensitivity of many species especially fish and invertebrates to changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations depends on the species and the life stages eggs larvae or adult and behavioral changes feeding and reproduction efepa 2003 the relative improvement of do downstream of plants b d e f and h might be due to the relative stabilization of the wastewater in the disposal pits self purification of aquatic systems and dilution of the effluents with downstream water sources on the other hand no improvements in do values were observed downstream of plants a c j and k thus self purification is not sufficient for every plant in this regard cox 2003 reported that self purification of streams and rivers require both biological and chemical processes oxygen is removed from the river water as organic material is oxidized by chemical processes cod and the biological activities of aquatic organisms bod5 sediment or benthic oxygen demand sod which results from organic matter being deposited and incorporated in the channel bed is another major cause of do deficiency in rivers cox 2003 lehman et al 2004 consequently low levels of do reduce the self purification capacity of rivers to recover from the waste impact during off season beyene et al 2012 do concentrations below 5mg l may also adversely affect the functioning and survival of biological communities us epa 1986 oxygen depletion can cause death of fish and create dead zones lapointe et al 2000 generally we found that wet coffee processing plant wastewater impacted the do content of downstream water bodies comparison of upstream and downstream do values clearly shows that the do values were measured to be much lower downstream of all the plants as can be expected the chemical oxygen demand cod of the effluent is consistently larger than the upstream and downstream values for all mills except the effluent from plant j this increment of cod downstream of plant j may be due to the impact of a polluted water source joining the effluent of the plant at the downstream side the increment of cod value in the effluent of the plants is due to the degradation of soluble compounds during the fermentation of the pulp and mucilage that is the increment in cod values in the effluents indicated that there is an increment in chemical and biological oxygen demanding waste during fermentation of coffee pulp and mucilage this indicates that the presence of organic matter consumes the oxygen which in turn contributes to high cod and bod5 it is also evident that the downstream cod value is larger than the upstream value the effluent cod values of plants i 7200mg l k 7200mg l f 7180mg l and d 6140mg l were found to be much higher than the other mills this difference in cod value may occur because of differences in the pulping capacity of the mills fermentation time to remove the mucilage and amount of water used in the process for washing the bean and for fermentation following the trend of cod values the bod5 values are also larger for the effluent than the upstream and downstream values in addition as can be seen from table 3 generally the bod5 value for downstream is greater than for upstream in this regard enden and calvert 2002 mentioned that the organic substances diluted in the wastewater break down very slowly by microbial processes using up oxygen from the water due to the decrease in dissolved oxygen content the demand for oxygen to breakdown organic material in the wastewater exceeds the supply thus creating anoxic conditions according to woldesenbet et al 2014 the cod bod5 ratio can be used as an indicator of biological degradability with ratios below 5 1 indicating a high digestibility in our case the ratios of cod bod5 values were below 5 1 which suggests the biological degradability of the coffee waste pulp and mucilage consume the oxygen in water resulting in the death of plants and animals due to the lack of oxygen or the increased acidity pandey et al 2000 this fact can later result in a proliferation of undesirable microorganisms bringing foul odors attracting flies and other insects and rendering the water undrinkable and useless for many other uses navia et al 2011 the minimum value of bod5 in the effluent and downstream sites of the plants was found to be 87mg l and 66mg l respectively even after stabilization in a pit similarly the minimum value of cod in the effluent and downstream site of the plants was found to be 142mg l and 82 9mg l respectively even after stabilization in a pit table 3 this indicates that large amounts of chemical and biological oxygen demanding substances in the effluent are released from the coffee processing wastewater into the rivers if these values are compared with the ethiopian surface water quality standards in which the bod5 is less than or equal to 5mg l and usepa standards for surface waters where the standard is 30mg l for bod5 and the maximum of 250mg l for cod table a1 in appendix there is a clear indication that these coffee mills are substantially affecting the downstream water source aquatic life and habitat the decrement in bod5 and cod values in the downstream water bodies may be due to a reduction of chemical and biological oxygen demanding wastes as the effluents pass through the disposal pits and due to the dilution of river water for surface water a bod5 greater than 10mg l usually indicates the presence of gross pollution nathanson 2000 in this study all the effluents and downstream water bodies show values exceeding this limit during the wet coffee processing season thus it was evident that the downstream water bodies were substantially polluted with organic matter this finding is consistent with other studies endris et al 2008 beyene et al 2012 beyene et al 2014 tekle et al 2015 haddis and devi 2008 reported values even as high as 10 800mg l bod5 and 15 780mg l cod for coffee processing effluents comparison of the bod5 and cod values we found for upstream and downstream clearly shows that both the bod5 and cod values increased in the downstream sites of plants a c d h j and k thus it can be concluded that the wet coffee processing plants wastewater has impacted the bod5 and cod of downstream water bodies 3 3 nutrient enrichment and eutrophication eutrophication is one of the most serious threats to the natural environment resulting from human activity and impact chmiel et al 2009 table 4 shows the values of concentration of nutrients in terms of nitrogen as no3 n nh 4 n and tn and phosphorous as ortho phosphate nitrogen and phosphorus content in the waters is a commonly used hydro chemical index for the assessment of the eutrophic potential of a river or lake chmiel et al 2009 normally all the wet coffee processing plants we studied do not use any inorganic or organic chemicals during processing as indicated in table 4 at most of the sampling sites the concentrations of no3 n nh4 n and tn increased from upstream of the coffee processing plant site to downstream of the effluent disposal site the no3 n nh4 n tn and po4 3 concentration levels were found to be within the range of 0mg l to 2 84mg l 0 041mg l to 0 96mg l 0 50mg l to 4 89mg l and 0 45mg l to 5 3mg l respectively table 4 the decline in the no3 n concentration to zero at the downstream sites of the plants c d f and h may be due to denitrification by microbial action high nitrate concentrations in these effluents may occur as a result of the deamination of ammonium nitrogen from nitrogenous material that can be oxidized to nitrate by the action of microbiological agents morrison et al 2001 the po4 3 concentrations of the effluents were estimated to be huge for instance po4 3 concentrations of 110 75mg l 28 25mg l 24mg l and 21 75mg l were measured for plants d f k and i respectively which is higher than the other plants this may be due to differences in pulping machines used by the plants fermentation time and the amount of water used by these plants the concentrations observed in this study are much greater than the findings of endris et al 2008 and tekle et al 2015 who reported a maximum po4 3 concentration of 9 9mg l and 18 5mg l respectively thus water bodies and ecosystems located downstream of the traditional wet coffee processing industries are at risk of eutrophication which may have a huge impact on nearby residents and downstream aquatic organisms hence urgent action should be taken particularly in integrated coffee waste treatment and disposal as well as water resource management in general comparison of the no3 n nh 4 n and tn and po4 3 values we found for upstream and downstream waters clearly shows that the no3 n nh 4 n and tn and po4 3 values increased in the downstream sites of certain plants for example no3 n was found to increase in the downstream sites of plants b and e nh4 n was also measured to be higher in the downstream sites of plants a b d e h j and k higher total nitrogen was measured at the downstream sites of plants a b e j and k finally higher po4 3 values were measured at the downstream sites of plants c d h j and k than at the upstream sites thus it can be concluded that wet coffee processing plant wastewater impacted the no3 n nh 4 n and tn and po4 3 concentration of downstream water bodies 4 conclusions overall the coffee processing mills we studied were found to be polluting water streams with high acidity organic load bod5 and cod nutrients nitrate and phosphate and suspended solids comparisons between upstream and downstream sites demonstrated deterioration in river water quality which may have an adverse effect on the aquatic life as a result of being a dumping site for untreated coffee processing wastewater from the present study it can be concluded that the wastewater released from wet coffee processing industries is not in agreement with either us epa or ethiopian epa guidelines involving higher than recommended concentrations of most of the measured physicochemical parameters as a result the polluting potential of the factories is enormous at locations below effluent discharge points even after stabilization in a disposal pit thus in order to comply with the environmental regulations and achieve a restoration of the environment it is necessary to find an economical and easily adaptable technology for the treatment of coffee processing wastewater conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards funding body the authors

these coffee processing industries on downstream water bodies water samples were taken from the upstream inlet water water used for washing depulping fermenting from the effluent wastewater after the depulping of the coffee beans removing the pulp and mucilage and from the nearest downstream water bodies that is after the effluent is discharged into the nearby river water however samples could not be taken in the downstream water bodies in two coffee plants downstream site of plants g and i due to road inaccessibility as a result a total of 31 sites were sampled all 3 sampling sites for 9 plants plus two sites for a further two plants to ensure that the sampling was representative composite samples of the wastewater released by the plants were collected at the peak hours of coffee processing in addition composite water samples were also taken from upstream and downstream rivers streams all samples were collected using clean polyethylene plastic bottles that were thoroughly washed with deionized water the water samples were filtered onsite before the analysis of no3 n nh 4 n tn and phosphorous as ortho phosphate then the samples were properly and carefully labeled sealed and transported to the laboratory of the department of environmental health sciences and technology jimma university ethiopia cold storage was maintained throughout the process until analysis was performed every sample was taken in triplicate and the average results were reported 2 3 water and wastewater analyses on site measurements of samples from the upstream and downstream river water and samples from wastewater for electrical conductivity ec ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do were carried out using a hach multi meter probe p n hq40d multi meter to measure total suspended solids tss and bod5 a gravimetric method by using glass microfiber gf a whatman filter paper having 4 7cm diameter and with pore size of 1 6μm and the azide modification of the winkler method by using aerator triton 2000cc china were used respectively for the remaining parameters cod no3 n nh 4 n tn and phosphorous as ortho phosphate lck test kits hach lange germany were used 3 discussion of results 3 1 general physico chemical characteristics of the upstream water and downstream the values of ph ec temperature and tss measured at the selected sampling points are presented in table 2 in fact since a correctional measurement of temperature at river sites is often misleading it is not the appropriate way to measure water temperature in river water the ph is generally lower in the effluent in all cases the ph is below 7 which indicates that all the effluents from wet coffee depulping processes lead to acidic conditions which can be toxic to the downstream ecosystem it was also observed that the ph of effluents from d f i and k plants factories were measured to be below 5 table 2 this may be due to the nature of the coffee bean itself the harvesting time of the bean the soaking duration of the depulped coffee bean the fermentation time to remove the mucilage and differences in processing the coffee bean for example the amount of water used for washing however at plant sites a b d and f the downstream ph value is higher than the corresponding upstream value this might be due to the self buffering capacity of the receiving water from the results it is evident that the ph in the effluent drops to 3 56 k indicating the active decomposition of organic matter this shows that there was fermentation of sugars in the mucilage in the presence of yeasts to alcohol and co2 as the organic waste oxidizes co2 is released and increases the acidic characteristics of the water decreasing the ph value below the range of 6 9 which is the surface water quality standard for ambient environment in ethiopia and 5 5 9 which is the us epa standards for discharge of environmental pollutants to inland surface waters table a1 in appendix the sugars contained in the mucilage ferment and the organic and acetic acids from the fermentation of the sugars make the wastewater acidic a condition in which higher plants and animals can hardly survive enden and calvert 2002 the acidic nature of wet coffee processing industry wastewater has also been reported elsewhere kefale et al 2012 beyene et al 2012 beyene et al 2014 the direct effects of ph changes involve alterations in the ionic and osmotic balance of individual organisms in particular changes in the rate and type of ion exchange across body surfaces this requires greater energy expenditure with subsequent effects such as slow growth and reduced fecundity becoming apparent efepa 2003 the relative increment of ph in downstream water bodies may be due to the buffering capacity of the receiving water however if this situation increases from time to time the self purification capacity of these water bodies will decline in general the wastewater of wet coffee processing plants has impacted the ph of downstream water bodies for example comparison of the upstream and downstream ph values clearly shows that the ph values were measured to be much lower at the downstream sites for plants h i j and k electrical conductivity ec can be regarded as a crude indicator of water quality for many purposes since it is related to the sum of all ionized solutes or total dissolved solid tds content the electrical conductivity of the water depends on the water temperature the higher the temperature the higher the electrical conductivity would be the trend of ec is not uniform but generally the ec values in the effluent are higher than for the upstream and downstream river sites the values are in the range from 63 2μs cm to 871μs cm table 2 the ec concentration of the effluent from plant factory i 3700μs cm d 3270μs cm and k 1134μs cm plants were observed to be higher than the other facilities this value is above the ethiopian surface water quality standard which is 1000μs cm table a1 in appendix this increment in ec may be due to the solubility decomposition of compounds during depulping and fermentation of the coffee pulp differences in the capacity of the coffee pulping mills may explain the differences between plants ec values downstream in the water bodies are lower due to dilution with water however this dilution may not always be sufficient this finding is consistent with similar studies done by endris et al 2008 and tekle et al 2015 generally we found that wet coffee processing wastewater has impacted the ec of downstream water bodies for example comparison of the ec values in the upstream and downstream clearly shows that the ec values were measured to be much higher at the downstream sites of the plants c d e f h j and k total suspended solids tss give a measure of the turbidity of the water it is a fact that ec is related to the ionic content of the sample which is in turn a function of the dissolved ionizable solids concentration tss values were indeed observed to follow approximately the trend of ec this increment in ec might be due to presence of inorganic compounds and floating particles having larger sizes the tss values ranged from 4 to 158mg l in upstream and 10 to 96mg l in downstream water bodies coffee mills f i k and d were found to have the maximum tss values of 2260mg l 1440mg l 1240mg l and 780mg l in their effluents respectively table 2 this may be due to the difference in soaking time washing frequency depulping and duration of fermentation of coffee beans in addition this may be due to the difference in the type of pulping machine used by the plants it is obvious that these values surpass by far the ethiopian surface water quality standards 50mg l and also the us epa standards for discharge of pollutants to inland surface waters 100mg l table a1 in appendix tss levels of 38mg l 2260mg l and 48mg l were measured in the upstream effluent and downstream site of plant f respectively the difference in upstream and downstream is only 10mg l which is not that high perhaps due to the functioning of the temporary disposal pit used by the plant the maximum value of tss in this study is larger 2260mg l than the maximum values reported by beyene et al 2012 which was 970mg l for the impacted sites and by devi et al 2008 which was 700mg l however it is consistent with values found in similar studies done by haddis and devi 2008 and tekle et al 2015 who reported 2080mg l in the effluent of coffee processing mills and 2504mg l in downstream waters respectively this high concentration of solids in suspension may lead to negative impacts in the ecosystem in turbid waters light penetration is reduced leading to a decrease in photosynthesis the resultant decrease in primary production reduces food availability for aquatic organisms higher up the food chain suspended solids may interfere with the feeding mechanisms of filter feeding organisms and the gill functioning foraging efficiency due to visual disturbances and growth of fish suspended solids that settle out may smother or abrade benthic plants and animals and may result in changes to the nature of the substratum this may then lead to changes in the structure of the biotic community through the decline of these organisms and their replacement with organisms which burrow in soft sediments sensitive species may be permanently eliminated if the source of the suspended solids is not removed efepa 2003 in addition as mentioned by tekle et al 2015 suspended solids may affect the use of water for various purposes by exacerbating the dissolved oxygen problem by sedimentation and forming oxygen demanding sludge deposits which may alter the habitat of aquatic microorganisms similarly as described by enden and calvert 2002 the suspended material especially the digested mucilage builds a crust on the surface clogging up waterways and further contributing to anaerobic conditions these tss concentrations automatically influence the quality of the receiving water bodies the elevated tss levels can be toxic to freshwater animals by causing osmotic stress and affecting the osmo regulatory capability of the organisms and can give rise to obnoxious odors from the decomposition of organic matter tekle et al 2015 in general we found that wet coffee processing plant wastewater impacted the tss of downstream water bodies for example comparison of the tss values for upstream and downstream clearly shows that the tss values were measured to increase in the downstream sites of plants a b c e f h and k 3 2 the state of organic load and dissolved oxygen the results of organic load measured in terms of biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and chemical oxygen demand cod and the level of dissolved oxygen do from upstream effluent and downstream sites are shown in table 3 the minimum dissolved oxygen concentration measured in the upstream water sources was found to be 5 15mg l plant h the decrement in do value might be due to the impact of different agricultural practices around the site the dissolved oxygen showed a significant decrease in all the coffee processing plants from upstream to downstream with values going down to 0 15mg l the do concentrations of the effluents from all the plants were found to be lower than the upstream water source which indicates that the oxygen is consumed during the decomposition of organic matter besides the do concentration of all the downstream sites is lower than the upstream sites this implies that the downstream water sources are compromised in addition plants j k h and f were found to have a do concentration of 0 15mg l 0 27mg l 1 5mg l and 1 75mg l respectively at the downstream water source this value is much below the ethiopian surface water quality standard which is a minimum do of 4 6mg l to support aquatic life table a1 in appendix which indicates the severe level of pollution of the rivers at the downstream sites typically it was observed that the do value depleted up to 0 15mg l in the downstream table 3 anoxic or hypoxic conditions may be lethal within short time scales minutes to hours the sensitivity of many species especially fish and invertebrates to changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations depends on the species and the life stages eggs larvae or adult and behavioral changes feeding and reproduction efepa 2003 the relative improvement of do downstream of plants b d e f and h might be due to the relative stabilization of the wastewater in the disposal pits self purification of aquatic systems and dilution of the effluents with downstream water sources on the other hand no improvements in do values were observed downstream of plants a c j and k thus self purification is not sufficient for every plant in this regard cox 2003 reported that self purification of streams and rivers require both biological and chemical processes oxygen is removed from the river water as organic material is oxidized by chemical processes cod and the biological activities of aquatic organisms bod5 sediment or benthic oxygen demand sod which results from organic matter being deposited and incorporated in the channel bed is another major cause of do deficiency in rivers cox 2003 lehman et al 2004 consequently low levels of do reduce the self purification capacity of rivers to recover from the waste impact during off season beyene et al 2012 do concentrations below 5mg l may also adversely affect the functioning and survival of biological communities us epa 1986 oxygen depletion can cause death of fish and create dead zones lapointe et al 2000 generally we found that wet coffee processing plant wastewater impacted the do content of downstream water bodies comparison of upstream and downstream do values clearly shows that the do values were measured to be much lower downstream of all the plants as can be expected the chemical oxygen demand cod of the effluent is consistently larger than the upstream and downstream values for all mills except the effluent from plant j this increment of cod downstream of plant j may be due to the impact of a polluted water source joining the effluent of the plant at the downstream side the increment of cod value in the effluent of the plants is due to the degradation of soluble compounds during the fermentation of the pulp and mucilage that is the increment in cod values in the effluents indicated that there is an increment in chemical and biological oxygen demanding waste during fermentation of coffee pulp and mucilage this indicates that the presence of organic matter consumes the oxygen which in turn contributes to high cod and bod5 it is also evident that the downstream cod value is larger than the upstream value the effluent cod values of plants i 7200mg l k 7200mg l f 7180mg l and d 6140mg l were found to be much higher than the other mills this difference in cod value may occur because of differences in the pulping capacity of the mills fermentation time to remove the mucilage and amount of water used in the process for washing the bean and for fermentation following the trend of cod values the bod5 values are also larger for the effluent than the upstream and downstream values in addition as can be seen from table 3 generally the bod5 value for downstream is greater than for upstream in this regard enden and calvert 2002 mentioned that the organic substances diluted in the wastewater break down very slowly by microbial processes using up oxygen from the water due to the decrease in dissolved oxygen content the demand for oxygen to breakdown organic material in the wastewater exceeds the supply thus creating anoxic conditions according to woldesenbet et al 2014 the cod bod5 ratio can be used as an indicator of biological degradability with ratios below 5 1 indicating a high digestibility in our case the ratios of cod bod5 values were below 5 1 which suggests the biological degradability of the coffee waste pulp and mucilage consume the oxygen in water resulting in the death of plants and animals due to the lack of oxygen or the increased acidity pandey et al 2000 this fact can later result in a proliferation of undesirable microorganisms bringing foul odors attracting flies and other insects and rendering the water undrinkable and useless for many other uses navia et al 2011 the minimum value of bod5 in the effluent and downstream sites of the plants was found to be 87mg l and 66mg l respectively even after stabilization in a pit similarly the minimum value of cod in the effluent and downstream site of the plants was found to be 142mg l and 82 9mg l respectively even after stabilization in a pit table 3 this indicates that large amounts of chemical and biological oxygen demanding substances in the effluent are released from the coffee processing wastewater into the rivers if these values are compared with the ethiopian surface water quality standards in which the bod5 is less than or equal to 5mg l and usepa standards for surface waters where the standard is 30mg l for bod5 and the maximum of 250mg l for cod table a1 in appendix there is a clear indication that these coffee mills are substantially affecting the downstream water source aquatic life and habitat the decrement in bod5 and cod values in the downstream water bodies may be due to a reduction of chemical and biological oxygen demanding wastes as the effluents pass through the disposal pits and due to the dilution of river water for surface water a bod5 greater than 10mg l usually indicates the presence of gross pollution nathanson 2000 in this study all the effluents and downstream water bodies show values exceeding this limit during the wet coffee processing season thus it was evident that the downstream water bodies were substantially polluted with organic matter this finding is consistent with other studies endris et al 2008 beyene et al 2012 beyene et al 2014 tekle et al 2015 haddis and devi 2008 reported values even as high as 10 800mg l bod5 and 15 780mg l cod for coffee processing effluents comparison of the bod5 and cod values we found for upstream and downstream clearly shows that both the bod5 and cod values increased in the downstream sites of plants a c d h j and k thus it can be concluded that the wet coffee processing plants wastewater has impacted the bod5 and cod of downstream water bodies 3 3 nutrient enrichment and eutrophication eutrophication is one of the most serious threats to the natural environment resulting from human activity and impact chmiel et al 2009 table 4 shows the values of concentration of nutrients in terms of nitrogen as no3 n nh 4 n and tn and phosphorous as ortho phosphate nitrogen and phosphorus content in the waters is a commonly used hydro chemical index for the assessment of the eutrophic potential of a river or lake chmiel et al 2009 normally all the wet coffee processing plants we studied do not use any inorganic or organic chemicals during processing as indicated in table 4 at most of the sampling sites the concentrations of no3 n nh4 n and tn increased from upstream of the coffee processing plant site to downstream of the effluent disposal site the no3 n nh4 n tn and po4 3 concentration levels were found to be within the range of 0mg l to 2 84mg l 0 041mg l to 0 96mg l 0 50mg l to 4 89mg l and 0 45mg l to 5 3mg l respectively table 4 the decline in the no3 n concentration to zero at the downstream sites of the plants c d f and h may be due to denitrification by microbial action high nitrate concentrations in these effluents may occur as a result of the deamination of ammonium nitrogen from nitrogenous material that can be oxidized to nitrate by the action of microbiological agents morrison et al 2001 the po4 3 concentrations of the effluents were estimated to be huge for instance po4 3 concentrations of 110 75mg l 28 25mg l 24mg l and 21 75mg l were measured for plants d f k and i respectively which is higher than the other plants this may be due to differences in pulping machines used by the plants fermentation time and the amount of water used by these plants the concentrations observed in this study are much greater than the findings of endris et al 2008 and tekle et al 2015 who reported a maximum po4 3 concentration of 9 9mg l and 18 5mg l respectively thus water bodies and ecosystems located downstream of the traditional wet coffee processing industries are at risk of eutrophication which may have a huge impact on nearby residents and downstream aquatic organisms hence urgent action should be taken particularly in integrated coffee waste treatment and disposal as well as water resource management in general comparison of the no3 n nh 4 n and tn and po4 3 values we found for upstream and downstream waters clearly shows that the no3 n nh 4 n and tn and po4 3 values increased in the downstream sites of certain plants for example no3 n was found to increase in the downstream sites of plants b and e nh4 n was also measured to be higher in the downstream sites of plants a b d e h j and k higher total nitrogen was measured at the downstream sites of plants a b e j and k finally higher po4 3 values were measured at the downstream sites of plants c d h j and k than at the upstream sites thus it can be concluded that wet coffee processing plant wastewater impacted the no3 n nh 4 n and tn and po4 3 concentration of downstream water bodies 4 conclusions overall the coffee processing mills we studied were found to be polluting water streams with high acidity organic load bod5 and cod nutrients nitrate and phosphate and suspended solids comparisons between upstream and downstream sites demonstrated deterioration in river water quality which may have an adverse effect on the aquatic life as a result of being a dumping site for untreated coffee processing wastewater from the present study it can be concluded that the wastewater released from wet coffee processing industries is not in agreement with either us epa or ethiopian epa guidelines involving higher than recommended concentrations of most of the measured physicochemical parameters as a result the polluting potential of the factories is enormous at locations below effluent discharge points even after stabilization in a disposal pit thus in order to comply with the environmental regulations and achieve a restoration of the environment it is necessary to find an economical and easily adaptable technology for the

1169,only a small proportion of addis ababa is served by conventional sewerage treatment systems most of the city relies upon on site sanitation while open defecation remains a common practice especially in slum areas this paper provides evidence of environmental pollution related to inadequate sanitation using a range of physicochemical and fecal contamination indicators and a mix of surveys of pit latrine contents soils and water sources some water sources including deep wells show indications of fecal contamination and soils are widely contaminated with the parasitic worm ascaris lumbricoides analysis of pit latrine contents shows a significant reduction in the number of a lumbricoides ova with depth but levels of ova at even the bottom of the pit suggest the need for proper sludge treatment wider awareness of environmental pollution gleaned from this research is intended to inform policy makers and their prioritization of actions to improve urban sanitation keywords fecal sludge sanitation pollution fecal contamination indicators addis ababa 1 introduction sub saharan africa had achieved only 30 sanitation coverage by 2015 with only a 4 percentage point increase from 1990 who 2016 here sanitation coverage means the percentage of people who have access to proper sanitation defined as a sanitation system that hygienically separates fecal waste from human contact who unicef 2008 a lack of access to proper sanitation is a serious concern because of the massive disease and health burden associated with poor sanitation and unsafe solid and liquid waste disposal un water 2014 the practice of open defecation is a primary cause of fecal borne disease transmission with children being the most vulnerable reducing by half the proportion of untreated wastewater has been established as a target in the un s recently released agenda 2030 for sustainable development goal 6 3 addis ababa is ethiopia s rapidly growing capital city covering an area of 527km2 and with more than 3 million residents it is one of the largest cities in africa over 80 of addis ababa s population live in slum districts with very poor housing that are overcrowded and have little or no urban service provision un habitat 2005 2014 only a small proportion of the city is served by conventional sewerage systems while most areas rely upon on site sanitation beyene et al 2015 open defecation remains a common practice especially in urban slum areas the small sewerage network commissioned in 1981 currently serves only the central part of the city alemayehu et al 2006 van rooijen and taddesse 2009 according to the waste water master plan of addis ababa water and sewerage authority aawsa 2002 this comprises about 30km of trunk sewer and 90km of secondary sewers serving about 40 000 people via 1800 connections most households about 75 have pit latrines that are either emptied when full or discharge to open drains about 15 have flush toilets and septic tanks again often discharging to open drains while a significant minority about 5 resort to open defecation csa 2005 public toilets are not common but communal pit latrines that are shared between several households are widespread on site technologies can provide viable and affordable options for sanitation but only if the entire service chain including collection transport treatment and safe end use or disposal is managed adequately bartram and cairncross 2010 without proper fecal sludge management fsm systems in place the construction of dry toilets does not safely contain wastes with most ending up directly in the local environment there is little advice support or standards available on the design and construction of dry latrine and other type of sanitation facilities households provided they can afford to pay can use government utility and private firms to empty latrine pits but it can be a challenge to get service on time diarrhea is the second most common cause of disease in addis ababa fig 1 and in 2016 the city suffered a major outbreak of acute watery diarrhea awd which has similar symptoms to cholera the main factors contributing to the spread of awd are open defecation and waste dumping including feces in public spaces especially rivers and river banks and streams floods and rain which have been above normal spread feces in water sources land areas and open spaces and thus increase the spread of awd almost all major rivers and streams of addis ababa were found to contain fecal matter and were confirmed positive for disease causing agents of awd while addis ababa clearly faces both severe pollution and sanitation related health problems there is a lack of information on the extent of fecal pollution the aim of this research was to provide further evidence on the occurrence and survival of pathogens in the fecal sludge of dry pit latrines and the degree of contamination of the wider environment soil and water 2 material and methods this paper presents findings from three main surveys a survey of pit latrines to assess characteristics of fecal sludge a survey of soils examining contamination using ascaris lumbricoides as an indicator and a survey of water sources including both surface and groundwater sources and their level of fecal contamination 2 1 survey and assessment of pit latrine contents pit latrines in addis ababa are typically unlined and 1 5 4m deep they are normally dry but water may be used in the case of some pour flush toilets the roof and the wall are usually made of corrugated iron sheet and less commonly of wood with mud or concrete the slab is usually made of mud plastered wooden materials and sometimes unreinforced concrete which provides a washable floor as most city residents are poor many shared communal toilets have been constructed by government and nongovernmental organizations to higher standards than household level pit latrines a total of 25 dry pit latrines in slum areas were sampled to study the parasite load in terms of a lumbricoides ova and provide some indication of the risks presented by fecal sludge from such latrines five 5 sub city areas were randomly selected from a total of 10 and in each sub city one district was randomly chosen in each district five dry pit latrines in the slum areas were purposively selected see the map at fig 2 and further details in beyene et al 2015 and considering only pit latrines with a fecal sludge depth above 1 5m samples were taken from three zones i from the top surface down to about 0 5m depth the aerobic degradation zone ii the facultative anaerobic zone 0 5 1 5m and iii the anaerobic zone 1 5m with samples taken 0 30 0 5m above the bottom of the pit the samples were collected in 500ml polyethylene plastic bottles using a clean spatula and placed in plastic bags the samples were stored in a cool box to avoid compositional changes and transported to the laboratory for analysis there samples were kept in a freezer until they were processed and analyzed except the samples for ascaris ova a lumbricoides counts per 10g dry fecal sludge sample were determined for each zone following the us epa protocol and methods described by buckley et al 2008 incubation and embryonation of a lumbricoides were performed by re suspending the solids in 4ml 0 1n h2so4 and pouring the suspension into a 20ml polyethylene scintillation vial or equivalent with loose caps before incubating the vials the liquid level in each vial was marked with a felt pen the vials along with control vials containing ascaris ova mixed with 4ml 0 1n h2so4 at 26ec were incubated for three to four weeks the liquid level in each vial was checked every day and reagent grade water added to maintain the initial liquid level after 18 days the vials were suspended by inversion and small aliquots of the control cultures were sampled once every 2 3 days the samples were examined when the majority of the control ascaris ova were fully embryonated then using a sedgwick rafter cell the concentrate was examined to enumerate the detected ova the ova were classified as either unembryonated or embryonated to the first second or third larval stage the ascaris ova count was determined using the equation 1 1 ova g dry wt no cv fv sp ts where no number of ova cv chamber volume 1ml fv final volume in ml sp sample processed in ml or g ts total solids and ts 100 moisture 2 2 survey and assessment of soils a total of seventy samples of soil were taken from yards or gardens and road banks and assessed for a lumbricoides to provide an indication of contamination and risk the samples were taken at accessible and shady sites without vegetation across the five sub cities sites were selected from areas close to the pit latrines at each location approximately 500g of top soil was taken using a small shovel from an area inside a square 25cm 25cm and 10cm in depth the soil samples were stored in sealed and marked plastic bags and transported to the laboratory the soil sample analysis procedure and procedure for assessment of a lumbricoides was similar to that used for the sludge samples 2 3 survey and assessment of water sources groundwater and surface water samples were collected from water sources upstream with little or no urban impact within and downstream of the city and analyzed to provide an assessment of levels of contamination of water sources fig 2 a total of 45 samples were taken and analyzed for selected microbial and chemical indicators of pollution this included all known shallow and deep wells while surface water samples were taken from accessible sites in the upstream middle and downstream reaches of rivers crossing the city the water samples were collected in sterile glass bottles stored in a cool box and transported to the laboratory microbial enumeration of water contamination indicators of human fecal origin total coliforms tc fecal coliforms fc and escherichia coli were performed using the membrane filtration mf technique and chemical quality was measured following standard methods apha 2012 we used the mf endo broth for 24h culture at 35 c for total coliform count and m fc broth with rosolic acid for 24h culture at 44 5 c for e coli count selected water chemistry indicators were chloride and nitrate levels both being relatively stable and long lived ammonia and nitrite provide good indicators of recent fecal contamination chloride provides a useful proxy indicator of groundwater pollution by fecal sludge since it is not strongly affected by adsorption or other physicochemical changes mcquillan 2005 unless one uses stable isotopes to identify specific sources of pollution aravena and robertson 1998 kim et al 2015 measurement of nitrate concentration cannot be used as a universal indicator of ground water contamination since it does not work in anoxic aquifers despite the general assumption that ground water has low dissolved oxygen levels most of the aquifers of addis ababa are fed by streams and rivers and they are mostly toxic aquifers consequently this study used nitrate as an indicator of fs pollution of ground water 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and survival of pathogens in fecal sludge analysis of the a lumbricoides counts with depth see fig 3 shows a considerable and significant p 0 05 reduction in the number of ova within the anaerobic zone as compared to the middle facultative anaerobic and near surface aerobic zones the highest counts were recorded at the top with a total ascaris ova count averaging 109 42 mean with sd median value 102 iqr 90 120 and range 29 205 per 10g of dry facial sludge at this layer the percentage of live ascaris ova averaged 85 11 mean with sd median value 86 iqr 74 94 and range 65 99 the lowest counts were recorded in the anaerobic zone at the bottom of the pits with the total ascaris ova count per 10g of dry fs sample averaging 24 12 mean with sd median value 22 iqr 16 31 and range 9 54 and the percentage of live ascaris ova being reduced to 34 10 mean with sd median value 32 iqr 28 39 and range 11 55 according to koné et al 2007 the major reason for such a decline in total and percentage live ova counts is likely to be solids reduction involving microorganisms and higher organisms feeding on the microbial biomass this creates a biomass reduction with depth and results in a reduction in the number of ascaris ova nevertheless survival at depth illustrates the need for proper treatment and disposal of sludge when pits are emptied mehl et al 2011 demonstrated the survival of helminths in composting toilets for periods of six months 3 2 occurrence and survival of pathogens in surface soils the average number of ascaris ova 100g found in the surface soil samples is summarized in table 1 there were high levels of ascaris ova in both yard or garden soils averaging 28 ova 100g and road banks 13 ova 100g this contamination presenting a serious risk to residents and especially children could potentially be related to open defecation or the unsafe disposal of sludge from full pit latrines 3 3 water pollution and fecal contamination 3 3 1 water chemistry indicators levels of chloride and nitrate in groundwater and surface waters are summarized in table 2 the concentration of chloride in shallow wells was found to be relatively high with a mean concentration of 41 5 65 2mg l compared to springs and deep wells with a mean concentration of 16 0 20 8mg l and 15 4 9 0mg l respectively there was about a two fold increase in chloride concentration at the mid catchment sites and a further doubling in the concentration at the downstream sites both shallow and deep wells were found to be rich in nitrate which suggests that even the deeper aquifer may be contaminated from fecal sludge even the protected spring waters that are usually assumed to be free from contamination were also found to be rich in nitrate there was a four fold increase in nitrate concentration from upstream to midstream sites where there is high volume of sewage discharge and then some reduction at downstream sites this pattern does not seem to reflect contamination from agricultural fertilizers which are likely to be more widely used in the upstream catchment area 3 3 2 fecal contamination indicators total coliform fecal coliform and e coli counts are summarized in table 3 water samples from many of the deep wells boreholes over 60m depth and at the study sites having a depth range of 84 250m were found to be contaminated by fecal matter about 50 of the deep and shallow well boreholes less than 60m deep samples were positive for tc with similar results for springs 40 while 25 of the samples from deep wells and 50 from shallow wells were positive for both fc and e coli the practice of well disinfection with chlorine would be expected to influence these results all surface water samples 100 were positive for tc and almost all with the exception of some upstream sites were positive for fc and e coli both the chemical and fecal contamination indicators indicate that fecal contamination of waters is severe in surface waters and worse than in the case of ground water sources the findings also show fecal water pollution to be relatively higher in shallow ground waters and springs compared to deep wells 4 conclusions our results confirm that there are serious risks related to poor sanitation and improper treatment of fecal waste in addis ababa fecal contamination of groundwater and surface waters is shown to be widespread with shallow wells compared to deeper boreholes and downstream sites presenting the highest risks when assessed using a range of chemical and microbial indicators soils are also shown to be highly contaminated with the near universal presence of a lumbricoides illustrating the risks of poor sanitation the need for proper treatment and disposal of pit latrine wastes is illustrated by the survival of pathogens even in the deep anaerobic zone of pit latrines it is therefore recommended that such results should be used to encourage policy makers to put improved household and urban sanitation and proper fecal sludge

1169,only a small proportion of addis ababa is served by conventional sewerage treatment systems most of the city relies upon on site sanitation while open defecation remains a common practice especially in slum areas this paper provides evidence of environmental pollution related to inadequate sanitation using a range of physicochemical and fecal contamination indicators and a mix of surveys of pit latrine contents soils and water sources some water sources including deep wells show indications of fecal contamination and soils are widely contaminated with the parasitic worm ascaris lumbricoides analysis of pit latrine contents shows a significant reduction in the number of a lumbricoides ova with depth but levels of ova at even the bottom of the pit suggest the need for proper sludge treatment wider awareness of environmental pollution gleaned from this research is intended to inform policy makers and their prioritization of actions to improve urban sanitation keywords fecal sludge sanitation pollution fecal contamination indicators addis ababa 1 introduction sub saharan africa had achieved only 30 sanitation coverage by 2015 with only a 4 percentage point increase from 1990 who 2016 here sanitation coverage means the percentage of people who have access to proper sanitation defined as a sanitation system that hygienically separates fecal waste from human contact who unicef 2008 a lack of access to proper sanitation is a serious concern because of the massive disease and health burden associated with poor sanitation and unsafe solid and liquid waste disposal un water 2014 the practice of open defecation is a primary cause of fecal borne disease transmission with children being the most vulnerable reducing by half the proportion of untreated wastewater has been established as a target in the un s recently released agenda 2030 for sustainable development goal 6 3 addis ababa is ethiopia s rapidly growing capital city covering an area of 527km2 and with more than 3 million residents it is one of the largest cities in africa over 80 of addis ababa s population live in slum districts with very poor housing that are overcrowded and have little or no urban service provision un habitat 2005 2014 only a small proportion of the city is served by conventional sewerage systems while most areas rely upon on site sanitation beyene et al 2015 open defecation remains a common practice especially in urban slum areas the small sewerage network commissioned in 1981 currently serves only the central part of the city alemayehu et al 2006 van rooijen and taddesse 2009 according to the waste water master plan of addis ababa water and sewerage authority aawsa 2002 this comprises about 30km of trunk sewer and 90km of secondary sewers serving about 40 000 people via 1800 connections most households about 75 have pit latrines that are either emptied when full or discharge to open drains about 15 have flush toilets and septic tanks again often discharging to open drains while a significant minority about 5 resort to open defecation csa 2005 public toilets are not common but communal pit latrines that are shared between several households are widespread on site technologies can provide viable and affordable options for sanitation but only if the entire service chain including collection transport treatment and safe end use or disposal is managed adequately bartram and cairncross 2010 without proper fecal sludge management fsm systems in place the construction of dry toilets does not safely contain wastes with most ending up directly in the local environment there is little advice support or standards available on the design and construction of dry latrine and other type of sanitation facilities households provided they can afford to pay can use government utility and private firms to empty latrine pits but it can be a challenge to get service on time diarrhea is the second most common cause of disease in addis ababa fig 1 and in 2016 the city suffered a major outbreak of acute watery diarrhea awd which has similar symptoms to cholera the main factors contributing to the spread of awd are open defecation and waste dumping including feces in public spaces especially rivers and river banks and streams floods and rain which have been above normal spread feces in water sources land areas and open spaces and thus increase the spread of awd almost all major rivers and streams of addis ababa were found to contain fecal matter and were confirmed positive for disease causing agents of awd while addis ababa clearly faces both severe pollution and sanitation related health problems there is a lack of information on the extent of fecal pollution the aim of this research was to provide further evidence on the occurrence and survival of pathogens in the fecal sludge of dry pit latrines and the degree of contamination of the wider environment soil and water 2 material and methods this paper presents findings from three main surveys a survey of pit latrines to assess characteristics of fecal sludge a survey of soils examining contamination using ascaris lumbricoides as an indicator and a survey of water sources including both surface and groundwater sources and their level of fecal contamination 2 1 survey and assessment of pit latrine contents pit latrines in addis ababa are typically unlined and 1 5 4m deep they are normally dry but water may be used in the case of some pour flush toilets the roof and the wall are usually made of corrugated iron sheet and less commonly of wood with mud or concrete the slab is usually made of mud plastered wooden materials and sometimes unreinforced concrete which provides a washable floor as most city residents are poor many shared communal toilets have been constructed by government and nongovernmental organizations to higher standards than household level pit latrines a total of 25 dry pit latrines in slum areas were sampled to study the parasite load in terms of a lumbricoides ova and provide some indication of the risks presented by fecal sludge from such latrines five 5 sub city areas were randomly selected from a total of 10 and in each sub city one district was randomly chosen in each district five dry pit latrines in the slum areas were purposively selected see the map at fig 2 and further details in beyene et al 2015 and considering only pit latrines with a fecal sludge depth above 1 5m samples were taken from three zones i from the top surface down to about 0 5m depth the aerobic degradation zone ii the facultative anaerobic zone 0 5 1 5m and iii the anaerobic zone 1 5m with samples taken 0 30 0 5m above the bottom of the pit the samples were collected in 500ml polyethylene plastic bottles using a clean spatula and placed in plastic bags the samples were stored in a cool box to avoid compositional changes and transported to the laboratory for analysis there samples were kept in a freezer until they were processed and analyzed except the samples for ascaris ova a lumbricoides counts per 10g dry fecal sludge sample were determined for each zone following the us epa protocol and methods described by buckley et al 2008 incubation and embryonation of a lumbricoides were performed by re suspending the solids in 4ml 0 1n h2so4 and pouring the suspension into a 20ml polyethylene scintillation vial or equivalent with loose caps before incubating the vials the liquid level in each vial was marked with a felt pen the vials along with control vials containing ascaris ova mixed with 4ml 0 1n h2so4 at 26ec were incubated for three to four weeks the liquid level in each vial was checked every day and reagent grade water added to maintain the initial liquid level after 18 days the vials were suspended by inversion and small aliquots of the control cultures were sampled once every 2 3 days the samples were examined when the majority of the control ascaris ova were fully embryonated then using a sedgwick rafter cell the concentrate was examined to enumerate the detected ova the ova were classified as either unembryonated or embryonated to the first second or third larval stage the ascaris ova count was determined using the equation 1 1 ova g dry wt no cv fv sp ts where no number of ova cv chamber volume 1ml fv final volume in ml sp sample processed in ml or g ts total solids and ts 100 moisture 2 2 survey and assessment of soils a total of seventy samples of soil were taken from yards or gardens and road banks and assessed for a lumbricoides to provide an indication of contamination and risk the samples were taken at accessible and shady sites without vegetation across the five sub cities sites were selected from areas close to the pit latrines at each location approximately 500g of top soil was taken using a small shovel from an area inside a square 25cm 25cm and 10cm in depth the soil samples were stored in sealed and marked plastic bags and transported to the laboratory the soil sample analysis procedure and procedure for assessment of a lumbricoides was similar to that used for the sludge samples 2 3 survey and assessment of water sources groundwater and surface water samples were collected from water sources upstream with little or no urban impact within and downstream of the city and analyzed to provide an assessment of levels of contamination of water sources fig 2 a total of 45 samples were taken and analyzed for selected microbial and chemical indicators of pollution this included all known shallow and deep wells while surface water samples were taken from accessible sites in the upstream middle and downstream reaches of rivers crossing the city the water samples were collected in sterile glass bottles stored in a cool box and transported to the laboratory microbial enumeration of water contamination indicators of human fecal origin total coliforms tc fecal coliforms fc and escherichia coli were performed using the membrane filtration mf technique and chemical quality was measured following standard methods apha 2012 we used the mf endo broth for 24h culture at 35 c for total coliform count and m fc broth with rosolic acid for 24h culture at 44 5 c for e coli count selected water chemistry indicators were chloride and nitrate levels both being relatively stable and long lived ammonia and nitrite provide good indicators of recent fecal contamination chloride provides a useful proxy indicator of groundwater pollution by fecal sludge since it is not strongly affected by adsorption or other physicochemical changes mcquillan 2005 unless one uses stable isotopes to identify specific sources of pollution aravena and robertson 1998 kim et al 2015 measurement of nitrate concentration cannot be used as a universal indicator of ground water contamination since it does not work in anoxic aquifers despite the general assumption that ground water has low dissolved oxygen levels most of the aquifers of addis ababa are fed by streams and rivers and they are mostly toxic aquifers consequently this study used nitrate as an indicator of fs pollution of ground water 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and survival of pathogens in fecal sludge analysis of the a lumbricoides counts with depth see fig 3 shows a considerable and significant p 0 05 reduction in the number of ova within the anaerobic zone as compared to the middle facultative anaerobic and near surface aerobic zones the highest counts were recorded at the top with a total ascaris ova count averaging 109 42 mean with sd median value 102 iqr 90 120 and range 29 205 per 10g of dry facial sludge at this layer the percentage of live ascaris ova averaged 85 11 mean with sd median value 86 iqr 74 94 and range 65 99 the lowest counts were recorded in the anaerobic zone at the bottom of the pits with the total ascaris ova count per 10g of dry fs sample averaging 24 12 mean with sd median value 22 iqr 16 31 and range 9 54 and the percentage of live ascaris ova being reduced to 34 10 mean with sd median value 32 iqr 28 39 and range 11 55 according to koné et al 2007 the major reason for such a decline in total and percentage live ova counts is likely to be solids reduction involving microorganisms and higher organisms feeding on the microbial biomass this creates a biomass reduction with depth and results in a reduction in the number of ascaris ova nevertheless survival at depth illustrates the need for proper treatment and disposal of sludge when pits are emptied mehl et al 2011 demonstrated the survival of helminths in composting toilets for periods of six months 3 2 occurrence and survival of pathogens in surface soils the average number of ascaris ova 100g found in the surface soil samples is summarized in table 1 there were high levels of ascaris ova in both yard or garden soils averaging 28 ova 100g and road banks 13 ova 100g this contamination presenting a serious risk to residents and especially children could potentially be related to open defecation or the unsafe disposal of sludge from full pit latrines 3 3 water pollution and fecal contamination 3 3 1 water chemistry indicators levels of chloride and nitrate in groundwater and surface waters are summarized in table 2 the concentration of chloride in shallow wells was found to be relatively high with a mean concentration of 41 5 65 2mg l compared to springs and deep wells with a mean concentration of 16 0 20 8mg l and 15 4 9 0mg l respectively there was about a two fold increase in chloride concentration at the mid catchment sites and a further doubling in the concentration at the downstream sites both shallow and deep wells were found to be rich in nitrate which suggests that even the deeper aquifer may be contaminated from fecal sludge even the protected spring waters that are usually assumed to be free from contamination were also found to be rich in nitrate there was a four fold increase in nitrate concentration from upstream to midstream sites where there is high volume of sewage discharge and then some reduction at downstream sites this pattern does not seem to reflect contamination from agricultural fertilizers which are likely to be more widely used in the upstream catchment area 3 3 2 fecal contamination indicators total coliform fecal coliform and e coli counts are summarized in table 3 water samples from many of the deep wells boreholes over 60m depth and at the study sites having a depth range of 84 250m were found to be contaminated by fecal matter about 50 of the deep and shallow well boreholes less than 60m deep samples were positive for tc with similar results for springs 40 while 25 of the samples from deep wells and 50 from shallow wells were positive for both fc and e coli the practice of well disinfection with chlorine would be expected to influence these results all surface water samples 100 were positive for tc and almost all with the exception of some upstream sites were positive for fc and e coli both the chemical and fecal contamination indicators indicate that fecal contamination of waters is severe in surface waters and worse than in the case
