2705,a robust and reliable chlorophyll a chla concentration algorithm is still lacking for optically complex waters due to the lack of understanding of the bio optical process machine learning approaches which excel at detecting potential complex nonlinear relationships provide opportunities to estimate chla accurately for optically complex waters however the uncertainties in atmospheric correction ac may be amplified in different chla algorithms here we aim to select one state of the art algorithm or establish a new algorithm based on machine learning approaches that less sensitive to ac uncertainties firstly nine state of the art empirical semianalytical and optical water types owt classification based chla algorithms were implemented these existing algorithms showed good performance by using in situ database however failed in actual olci applications due to their sensitivity to ac uncertainties thus four popular machine learning approaches random forest regression rfr extreme gradient boosting xgboost deep neural network dnn and support vector regression svr were then employed among them the rfr chla model performed the best and showed less sensitivity to ac uncertainties finally the chla spatiotemporal variations in 163 major lakes across eastern china were mapped from olci between may 2016 and april 2020 using the proposed rfr chla model generally the lakes in eastern china are severely eutrophic with an average chla concentration of 33 39 6 95 μg l spatially chla in the south of eastern china was significantly higher than those in northern lakes seasonally chla was high in the summer and autumn and low in the spring and winter this study provides a reference for water quality monitoring in turbid inland waters suffering certain ac uncertainties and supports aquatic management and sdg 6 reporting keywords chlorophyll a machine learning eutrophication turbid waters data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction lake ecosystems play essential roles in global biogeochemical cycles local ecological balance drinking water supply and socioeconomic development heino et al 2021 palmer et al 2015 qin et al 2010 however because of nutrient enrichment and global warming many lakes have experienced increasing eutrophication frequent blooms and deteriorating water quality ho et al 2019 therefore understanding the water quality changes in lakes is crucial these issues have attracted close attention from the public and thus water quality management authorities have formulated many monitoring strategies and environmental protection measures qin et al 2019 additionally the united nations un has incorporated water quality monitoring into the sustainable development goal sdg 6 water and sanitation indicator framework un 2015 therein sdg 6 3 2 tracks the proportion of water bodies with good ambient water quality and sdg 6 6 1 which tracks the change in the extent of water related ecosystems over time also focuses on the quality of water in ecosystems traditional field measurements and laboratory analysis obviously cannot meet the needs of monitoring lakes in large areas and satellite remote sensing is the primary tool because of its superior performance chlorophyll a chla a pigment present in all algal species is a proxy for a water body s trophic status carlson 1977 and is an indicator used by water quality monitoring frameworks schaeffer et al 2013 much work has been done on monitoring chla using satellite remote sensing which has advantages over traditional methods ioccg 2018 numerous chla algorithms have been developed for different waters and seasons using different sensors in turbid waters table 1 these algorithms include the two band ratio algorithm br dekker 1993 the three band algorithm tba dall olmo et al 2005 the four band algorithm fba le et al 2009 the baseline subtraction algorithm bs gower et al 2005 the nested band ratio algorithm nbr gons et al 2002 simis et al 2005 the quasi analytical algorithm qaa lee et al 2002 and qaa based algorithms liu et al 2020 xue et al 2019 the optical water types owt classification strategy is also an effective tool for optically complex waters and has been used to retrieve chla concentration from widely dispersed in situ data bi et al 2019 liu et al 2021 neil et al 2019 the proposed chla algorithms have been successfully applied to in situ measured reflectances and successfully tested on several satellite images of specific waters for which the algorithms were developed however the optical properties of inland waters are very complex and the concentrations of optically active components oacs vary widely in different lakes and seasons these algorithms may fail when applied to other areas or used with time series satellite data machine learning approaches which can detect potential complex nonlinear relationships without prior knowledge have been widely used for monitoring the water quality of oceanic coastal and inland waters jones and linder 2015 these approaches mainly include artificial neural network ann doerffer and schiller 2007 deep neural network dnn pahlevan et al 2020 pyo et al 2019 support vector regression svr guan et al 2020 he et al 2020 random forest regression rfr shen et al 2020 and extreme gradient boosting xgboost cao et al 2020 many studies have employed these approaches for estimations of the chla cao et al 2020 guan et al 2020 li et al 2021 suspended particulate matter pahlevan et al 2022 water clarity maciel et al 2021 phycocyanin o shea et al 2021 pyo et al 2018 primary production li et al 2022 etc applying state of the art machine learning approaches may provide a robust estimation of chla in optically complex waters however there are still challenges in atmospheric correction ac over optically complex inland waters schroeder et al 2022 in open ocean waters atmospheric effects can be easily removed by separating path radiance under the assumption of negligible water leaving radiance in the near infrared nir bands known as the black pixel hypothesis gordon and wang 1994 however optically complex inland waters are usually characterized by non negligible water signals in the nir bands and do not meet the black pixel hypothesis in order to re establish the black pixel hypothesis some studies employed an iterated method or shifted into the shortwave infrared swir 1000 3000 nm or ultraviolet uv 400 nm bands bailey et al 2010 he et al 2012 vanhellemont and ruddick 2015 wang 2007 wang and shi 2005 several other alternative ac methods are also developed such as spectral optimization steinmetz et al 2011 steinmetz and ramon 2018 and ann brockmann et al 2016 fan et al 2021 fan et al 2017 despite efforts having been devoted to removing atmospheric effects frouin et al 2019 ioccg 2010 significant uncertainties still remain in ac over optically complex inland waters with mean absolute percentage errors mape in the range of 7 440 in the visible region bi et al 2018 li et al 2019 shen et al 2020 vanhellemont and ruddick 2021 these uncertainties may be amplified in different chla algorithms thus resulting in the failure of satellite applications therefore it is worth discussing the applicability and sensitivity of the existing empirical and semianalytical algorithms and machine learning algorithms for chla estimations when suffering ac uncertainties eastern china a region east of the heihe tengchong line has a dense population and is the core region of china s economic and social development ma et al 2012 severe eutrophication problems have been found in most lakes across eastern china guan et al 2020 however operational satellite applications of chla retrievals have still not been realized in such an important area these results inspired us to deepen the understanding of lake chla concentration variability in eastern china to serve lake management this study s objectives were to 1 evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of nine previously established algorithms to ac uncertainties in turbid lakes across eastern china 2 establish a robust and reliable chla algorithm based on machine learning approaches if the traditional algorithms do not work and 3 reveal the spatiotemporal variation pattern of chla in large lakes 10 km2 across eastern china the algorithms are tuned for sentinel 3 ocean and land colour instrument olci data 2 data and methods 2 1 study area eastern china covers the northeastern plain and mountain lake npml zone 38 7 53 5 n 118 7 134 9 e and the eastern plain lake epl zone 18 1 42 6 n 104 5 122 7 e ma et al 2011 fig 1 eastern china is located in the east asian monsoon climate zone with a subtropical monsoon climate prevailing in the epl zone and a temperate monsoon climate in the npml zone lakes in the two lake zones are primarily turbid and shallow with an average depth of 0 44 to 8 1 m wang and dou 1998 as a result of climate change and rapid economic development the water quality of these lakes has deteriorated and suffered mesotrophic or eutrophic qin et al 2019 frequent cyanobacterial blooms in lakes such as lake taihu and lake chaohu have threatened drinking water safety duan et al 2009 duan et al 2017 considering the spatial resolution of olci data 300 m 163 major lakes 10 km2 118 in the epl zone and 45 in the npml zone in eastern china were studied table s1 notably chla concentrations were not retrieved in the icing period 2 2 field measurements field surveys were conducted in 24 lakes across eastern china fig 1 and table 2 water samples were collected at the surface 30 cm and stored in a dark and low temperature before the laboratory analyses remote sensing reflectance rrs was measured using a fieldspec pro dual visible and near infrared vnir spectroradiometer 350 1050 nm analytical spectral devices inc laboratory analyses the chla concentrations were determined using a shimadzu uv2600 spectrophotometer at 630 645 663 and 750 nm after extraction with 90 acetone gitelson et al 2008 the suspended particulate matter spm concentrations were gravimetrically determined from the samples cao et al 2017 remote sensing reflectance following the national aeronautics and space administration nasa protocols rrs was determined from an above water method with an azimuth angle of 135 from the sun and 40 from the nadir mueller et al 2003 rrs was calculated as follows 1 r rs l w e d 0 l sw r l sky l p π ρ p where lw lsw rlsky is the water leaving radiance lsw is the total water leaving radiance lsky is the diffuse sky radiance and r is fresnel reflectance at the water atmosphere interface 2 5 used here ed 0 lpπ ρp is the downwelling irradiance just above the water surface lp is the radiance of the gray panel and ρp is the reflectance of the standard reflectance panel then the in situ measured rrs was averaged using the spectral response function srf of olci after quality control 847 matchups of chla rrs in situ measurements were obtained two thirds of which were used as an in situ training dataset n 565 and the remaining 282 matchups of samples were used as in situ validation datasets 2 3 olci data the sentinel 3a b olci with its narrow spectral bands from 400 to 1020 nm 300 m spatial resolution and 1 4 days revisit for latitude 30 2 satellites constellation has been proven to have the excellent capability for monitoring inland waters donlon et al 2012 shen et al 2017 importantly olci is equipped with characteristic absorption or reflection bands of chla for turbid waters i e 665 nm and 709 nm liu et al 2020 sentinel 3a launched on 16 february 2016 and sentinel 3b launched on 25 april 2018 the two olci payloads show good consistency in monitoring inland water quality bourg et al 2020 shen et al 2022 olci level 1b full resolution fr images covering eastern china between may 2016 and april 2020 were downloaded from the copernicus open access hub these data were preprocessed as follows fig 2 atmospheric correction six commonly used ac processors designed for case 2 waters were compared in this study these processors include the nasa default black pixel hypothesis based algorithm bp gordon and wang 1994 the olci baseline atmospheric correction bac processor moore and lavender 2011 the management unit of the north seas mathematical models mumm ruddick et al 2000 the polynomial based algorithm applied to medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris polymer steinmetz et al 2011 the case 2 regional coast color processor c2rcc brockmann et al 2016 and the vector version of second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar spectrum correction scheme 6sv vermote et al 1997 bp bac mumm polymer and c2rcc were specially designed for water ac while the 6sv was terrestrial heritage and was adopted as an alternative to water ac for olci data in some recent studies shen et al 2020 the parameters of each ac processor were set as shown in table s2 mask water land boundaries were determined using previous lake boundaries ma et al 2011 and an automated water delineation algorithm wang et al 2014 two pixels 600 m near the land water boundary were removed to avoid land adjacency effects lae and land water mixed pixels hou et al 2017 cloud contaminated pixels were masked with the criteria of rayleigh corrected reflectance rrc rrc 865 0 25 and rrc 560 0 25 qi et al 2014b sunglint pixels were removed via the sunglint risk flag in olci level 1b product auxiliary data using the method proposed by hu 2009 we excluded the algal blooms that formed surface scums and aquatic vegetation with a threshold of 1 194 10 4 on the floating algae index fai the ice season of each lake was obtained from wang and dou 1998 and images of lakes during the ice season were excluded after masking sub optimal observations i e ice cloud sunglint etc an average of 280 90 high quality olci scenes were obtained for each lake fig 3 concurrent match the concurrent olci data and field measurements were matched with several criteria cao et al 2017 first an adequate time window of 6 h was adopted then at least half valid pixels were required in the 3 3 pixel window the coefficient of variation cv was required to be lower than 15 to assure spatial homogeneity after applying the above criteria we obtained 321 olci in situ concurrent matchups 245 stations for olci 3a and 76 stations for olci 3b two thirds of these concurrent matches n 214 163 for olci 3a and 51 for olci 3b were used as the concurrent training dataset the remaining 107 stations 82 for olci 3a and 25 for olci 3b were used as the concurrent validation dataset 2 4 existing chla algorithms nine previously established chla algorithms consisting of four empirical algorithms four semianalytical algorithms and one owt classification based algorithm were implemented for evaluation the empirical algorithms include br dekker 1993 tba dall olmo et al 2005 the fluorescence line height algorithm flh gower et al 1999 and the maximum chlorophyll index algorithm mci gower et al 2005 the semianalytical algorithms include two nested band ratio approaches namely gons gons et al 2002 and simis simis et al 2005 and two improved qaas namely qaa750e xue et al 2019 and tc2 liu et al 2020 the owt classification based algorithm was liu et al 2021 denoted as liu hereafter the steps of these algorithms tuned for olci data can be found in table 3 2 5 machine learning approaches we employed four popular machine learning approaches including dnn svr rfr and xgboost to estimate the chla of turbid waters using the scikit learn xgboost and tensorflow packages in python fig 4 these four machine learning approaches have been widely used in remote sensing estimation of inland turbid water bodies dnn is an ann with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers i e deep networks lecun et al 2015 compared with traditional shallow neural networks deep networks provide a higher level of nonlinear function approximation and can combine low level features to provide new knowledge and thus improve the estimation of the model dnn may provide higher accuracy than classic machine learning approaches under proper applications however the dnn usually requires a considerable sample size svr maps the original nonlinear data space to the high dimensional and linearly separable data space using kernel functions platt 2004 smola and schölkopf 2004 svr uses an optimal separation hyperplane to minimize the empirical loss function svr performs well in dealing with nonlinear problems and a small dataset but is susceptible to data noise and is inefficient when the sample size is large both rfr and xgboost are decision tree based ensemble learning methods breiman 2001 chen and guestrin 2016 rfr constructs many independent decision trees i e forests based on the bagging concept while xgboost adopts the boosting concept and generates a series of interdependent decision trees serially rfr integrates the decision tree results such as the averages to improve the accuracy of the model and xgboost continuously iteratively generates a new decision tree to fit the residuals of the previous prediction results sample and feature randomness are employed in both rfr and xgboost during the construction of each decision tree therefore rfr and xgboost are usually not easy to overfit and have a good tolerance for outliers and noise due to fitting the residuals in each iteration xgboost usually has superior performance under low noise conditions but is more sensitive than rfr to outliers he and hahn 2021 twelve experiments were conducted to optimize the approach and input variables of the chla retrievals each machine learning approach uses spectral bands model 1 spectral indices model 2 and both spectral bands and spectral indices model 3 as input variables where model refers to the rfr xgboost dnn or svr model spectral bands included bands 510 560 620 665 674 681 709 and 754 nm and indices included br tba flh and mci blue bands 413 443 and 490 nm are not critical in estimating chla in eutrophic and turbid waters and usually suffer large ac uncertainties so blue bands are not used the olci concurrent dataset instead of the in situ dataset was used to train machine learning approaches to partially eliminate the systematic patterns in ac uncertainties in model training the hyperparameters i e n estimators max depth etc for rfr and xgboost learning rate n hiddenlayers and n nerons for dnn γ and c for svr of machine learning approaches were optimized using a grid search strategy text s1 and table s3 2 6 model sensitivity to uncertainties in ac the monte carlo analysis is a numerical simulation method that relies on repeated random sampling to infer unknown numerical characteristics doubilet et al 1985 and excels at sensitivity analysis we quantified how chla algorithms respond to the various ac uncertainties for different input bands or indices using a monte carlo analysis qi et al 2020 this analysis determines the sensitivity of chla estimations to uncertainties in ac by superimposing a normal distribution of simulated errors to original inputs for each input band or indices the model sensitivity to ac uncertainties was determined with the following steps 1 assuming that the other input variables remained unchanged the monte carlo method was first used to simulate a series of normally distributed errors with different uncertainties quantified as the mean absolute percentage errors mape here for this input variable considering the correlations between spectral bands each spectral index br tba flh and mci was regarded as a whole independent variable 2 input variables with extra uncertainties were obtained by superimposing the simulation errors on each station 3 chla concentrations derived using the original inputs and inputs with additional uncertainties were compared to determine the model s sensitivity to input variable uncertainties the deviations were quantified using mape here each monte carlo analysis ran 10 000 simulations a wide range of ac uncertainties 2 5 1000 for different input variables was considered using a large number of monte carlo analyses so the deviations in different chla algorithms caused by various ac uncertainties can be determined for satellite applications 2 7 statistical analysis and accuracy assessment four statistical metrics were used to evaluate model accuracy the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mape and mean normalized bias mnb these indices are calculated as follows 2 r 2 x i x y i y 2 x i x 2 y i y 2 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 4 mape 1 n i 1 n y i x i x i 100 5 mnb 1 n i 1 n y i x i x i 100 xi is the i th in situ measured data yi is the i th modeled data and n is the number of matched pairs 3 results 3 1 uncertainties in ac the performance of each ac processor varied in different bands 413 443 490 510 560 620 665 674 681 709 754 and 779 nm in general the 6sv processor performed best the next performing processors were the mumm and c2rcc processors the bac and bp processors and the polymer processor which performed in order of performance worst fig 5 and table 4 in the blue bands 413 443 and 490 nm and green bands 510 560 nm all ac processors performed poorly r2 0 42 rmse 0 0082 sr 1 and mape 17 16 and the accuracy of the 6sv processor usually exceeded that of the other processors compared to the accuracy of each processor in the blue and green bands the accuracy of each processor in the red bands 620 665 674 681 709 nm was significantly improved the 6sv processor was more accurate than the other processors r2 0 59 rmse 0 0076 sr 1 mape 27 74 the next most accurate processors were the bp mumm bac and c2rcc processors r2 0 51 rmse 0 0091 sr 1 mape 36 03 while the polymer processor performed the worst rmse 0 0181 sr 1 mape 59 73 the scatters of the bp mumm bac c2rcc and polymer processors were distributed below the 1 1 line at each band thus showing a large underestimation with mnb ranging from 67 49 to 1 55 the scatters of the 6sv processor were more evenly distributed along the 1 1 line and showed a certain overestimation with mnb ranging from 1 68 to 69 45 except for the 560 nm band due to the processor s limitations such as the black assumption in swir bands processors such as bp mumm bac and polymer may obtain invalid results negative values no results etc the percentage of valid concurrent matches of these processors ranged between 86 01 and 97 61 spectral indices are often used to develop chla algorithms the performances of br tba flh and mci were also evaluated in this study fig 5 and table 5 for br rrs 709 rrs 665 the 6sv processor performed the best of all processors r2 0 53 rmse 0 1870 mape 19 94 while the other processors performed poorly r2 ranging from 0 to 0 21 and mape ranging from 15 40 to 155 06 all the processors performed poorly for the tba flh and mci indices tba and flh performed especially poorly with mape ranging between 179 03 and 1367 95 among the ac processors the 6sv processor performed the best and usually showed the best statistical indices overall the 6sv processor outperformed bp mumm bac c2rcc and polymer in bands and spectral indices and was optimal for olci data in lakes across eastern china 3 2 existing chla algorithms 3 2 1 performance the performance of the existing chla algorithms was first evaluated based on the in situ measured rrs the empirical coefficients were recalibrated using the in situ training dataset n 565 for empirical algorithms considering the differences in the specific absorption coefficient of chla the empirical relationships between the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton aph derived in semianalytical algorithms and the chla concentration were also recalibrated using the in situ training dataset the performances of the in situ validation dataset showed that liu performed best r2 0 73 rmse 10 96 μg l mape 39 20 and mnb 7 96 followed by br gons and simis r2 0 71 rmse 11 40 μg l mape 46 33 and mnb 16 61 then tba flh qaa750e and tc2 r2 0 66 0 62 0 64 and 0 65 rmse 12 50 13 16 13 06 and 13 10 μg l mape 48 37 66 20 48 29 and 42 29 mnb 27 91 19 69 25 36 and 22 30 mci performed the worst r2 0 41 rmse 16 21 μg l mape 66 20 and mnb 35 48 fig 6 and table 6 unfortunately the accuracy of each algorithm on the olci concurrent matchup dataset was low r2 0 4 rmse 22 06 μg l and mape 69 79 fig 6 and table 6 these algorithms were then recalibrated using the concurrent dataset to partially eliminate the influence of ac system errors however the accuracy of each algorithm was still low r2 0 4 rmse 20 53 μg l and mape 53 53 table 6 3 2 2 sensitivity to ac uncertainties the sensitivity of existing chla algorithms to various uncertainties of ac in the range of 2 5 1000 was determined using monte carlo analysis fig 7 the deviations quantified using mape here of all the algorithms increased with the increasing input uncertainties as expected fig 7 however the sensitivity to input uncertainty varies from algorithms and input bands or indices here we took the ac uncertainties in the 6sv ac processor stars in fig 7 as examples to discuss the sensitivity of different chla algorithms in a detailed manner the uncertainty of br in the 6sv was only 11 89 however this resulted in considerable deviations in chla estimation mape 70 44 the deviations of the remaining empirical algorithms tba flh and mci were also prominent mape 68 10 due to the sensitive response to large ac uncertainties mape 62 64 for the nbr approaches gons and simis the deviations by br uncertainties were significant mape 48 41 although the deviations by the 779 nm band were slight mape 10 86 for two qaa based algorithms qaa750e and tc2 the deviations caused by noncritical bands i e 443 and 560 nm were slight mape 11 35 but the deviations caused by the critical bands i e 665 674 709 nm and 754 nm were significant mape 38 33 in the owt classification based liu algorithms the deviations caused by noncritical bands i e 443 490 560 620 and 779 nm were slight mape 6 65 there were significant deviations mape 135 72 caused by the critical bands i e 665 and 709 nm since most in situ measurements owned the highest membership scores of owt which uses the br or gons algorithms these existing chla algorithms were sensitive to ac uncertainties especially critical input variables thus they cannot be widely promoted for satellite use to monitor eutrophic and turbid lakes across eastern china 3 3 machine learning approaches 3 3 1 training and validation the machine learning approaches outperformed the existing algorithms on the olci concurrent validation dataset fig 8 in a comparison of the four machine learning approaches with different inputs except for svr models that incorporate both spectral bands and spectral indices model 3 r2 0 63 rmse 15 35 μg l and mape 37 78 usually outperform models that use only spectral bands model 1 r2 0 63 rmse 15 30 μg l and mape 45 10 or only spectral indices model 2 r2 0 65 rmse 14 74 μg l and mape 41 76 when model 3 is used as an example to compare the four machine learning approaches rfr3 and xgboost3 performed the best rfr3 r2 0 73 rmse 12 99 μg l mape 36 91 and mnb 19 73 xgboost3 r2 0 73 rmse 13 03 μg l mape 36 62 and mnb 18 28 dnn3 followed next in performance r2 0 63 rmse 15 35 μg l mape 37 78 mnb 12 11 and the svr3 algorithm performed the worst r2 0 33 rmse 21 34 μg l mape 66 48 and mnb 24 71 in addition rfr3 and xgboost3 both showed higher accuracy on olci 3a and olci 3b rfr3 r2 0 70 and 0 84 respectively rmse 13 77 and 10 00 μg l respectively mape 39 64 and 27 93 respectively mnb 22 12 and 11 89 respectively xgboost3 r2 0 69 and 0 85 respectively rmse 13 93 and 9 47 μg l respectively mape 39 56 and 26 97 respectively and mnb 20 85 and 9 82 respectively these results showed that rfr3 and xgboost3 had great application potential in chla estimation over optically complex waters with large ac uncertainties 3 3 2 sensitivity to ac uncertainties the impacts of the various ac uncertainties in the range of 2 5 1000 on the machine learning approaches were also quantified using monte carlo simulation fig 9 the deviations quantified using mape here of machine learning approaches generally increased with the increasing input uncertainties but trends of increase followed by decrease were also found i e deviations caused by br uncertainties in svr and dnn as for the ac uncertainties in the 6sv ac processor stars in fig 9 rfr and xgboost showed similar sensitivity to the ac uncertainties the estimated deviation caused by the uncertainties of the spectral bands was slight rfr mape ranging between 4 34 and 10 90 xgboost mape ranging between 4 67 and 11 12 the deviation caused by the uncertainties of the spectral indices was significant rfr mape ranging between 7 56 and 18 23 and xgboost mape ranging between 10 29 and 22 92 for dnn except for the slight deviation caused by the uncertainties of the 620 nm band mape 7 84 the uncertainties of the other input variables all caused large estimation deviations mape in the range of 21 34 92 30 for svr the estimation deviation was mainly caused by br and tba uncertainties mape 59 71 and 34 87 respectively the deviation caused by the uncertainties of the spectral bands and the flh and mci indices is slight mape ranging between 0 43 and 4 93 compared with the four models dnn and svr were susceptible to the uncertainties of crucial input variables dnn3 maximum mape reaching 92 30 svr maximum mape reaching 59 73 in contrast rfr and xgboost were less sensitive to ac uncertainties rfr maximum mape 18 23 xgboost maximum mape 22 92 the rfr was slightly better between the two models overall rfr which uses both spectral bands and spectral indices as input variables was finally selected to retrieve the chla concentration for the olci data on eutrophic and turbid lakes across eastern china this model is denoted as the rfr chla model hereafter 3 3 3 rfr chla model in different scenarios on satellite images to better understand the applicability of our proposed rfr chla model we showed different scenarios on satellite images in three typical shallow lakes lake taihu lake hongze and lake shijiu with average in situ chla concentrations ranging from 5 03 μg l to 44 33 μg l fig 10 the results showed that the rfr chla model performed well in turbid lake hongze fig 10d f r2 0 92 rmse 7 28 μg l mape 24 70 or slight turbid waters lake shijiu fig 10g i r2 0 90 rmse 0 70 μg l mape 13 71 however the olci derived chla values were less accurate but acceptable when heavy bloom occurred in lake taihu fig 10a c r2 0 50 rmse 11 81 μg l mape 29 91 which may attribute to the adjacency effects of algal bloom generally we infer that the rfr chla model provides the ability to map realistic chla concentrations but has some challenges in bloom events 3 4 chla spatiotemporal patterns the rfr chla model and the 6sv corrected olci rrs data were employed to map the spatiotemporal patterns of chla concentrations in lakes in eastern china the olci derived chla demonstrated that the lakes in eastern china were severely eutrophic with an average chla concentration of 33 39 6 95 μg l fig 11 spatially the average chla concentration of the lakes in the study area showed significant distribution variations lakes with high chla concentrations were distributed mainly in the dense lakes in the middle reaches of the yangtze river in the epl zone and the song nen plain in the npml zone lakes with low chla concentrations were distributed mainly in the lower reaches of the yangtze river and the huai river basin in the epl zone each lake also showed significant inner variations for example the eastern area of lake dongting the western area of lake chaohu and the meiliang bay of lake taihu all showed higher chla concentrations within the lakes fig 11a numerically the frequency distribution of the average chla concentration showed a negative skewness distribution skewness 0 5697 0 with 71 1 of lakes showing chla concentrations higher than 30 μg l fig 11b for the two lake zones the average chla concentration of epl lakes 36 29 7 86 μg l was significantly higher than those of the npml lakes 33 60 7 41 μg l t test p 0 05 between may and october i e the ice free period of npml lakes fig 11c thus presenting a spatial pattern of high in the south and low in the north moreover smaller lakes were usually more eutrophic with higher chla concentrations lakes 50 km2 34 94 6 19 μg l 50 lakes 100 km2 34 00 7 25 μg l in comparison large lakes had lower chla concentrations 100 lakes 1000 km2 28 84 6 15 μg l lakes 1000 km2 24 05 4 90 μg l fig 11d small lakes in eastern china usually have aquaculture activities which promote the eutrophication of water bodies wang et al 2018 this finding was consistent with the results of guan et al 2020 and cao et al 2020 in terms of the temporal pattern the average chla concentration was often high in the summer june to august 35 61 7 48 μg l and autumn september to november 35 84 8 72 μg l the average chla concentration was next highest in the spring march to may 32 48 7 48 μg l and was the lowest in the winter december to the next february 27 89 7 44 μg l figs 12 13 however npml lakes usually showed a high value in may this result may be attributed to the melting of snow and ice carrying nutrients into the lakes the average chla concentration of lakes in eastern china was relatively stable during the four years from may 2016 to april 2020 and there were no significant interannual changes the seasonal patterns during the four years were the same i e higher in the summer and autumn low in the spring and winter fig 12 4 discussion 4 1 what sources of uncertainties in ac the water optical properties of the lakes in eastern china are complex with spm and colored dissolved organic matter cdom not covariant with chla concentrations xue et al 2017 thus waters in lakes across eastern china failed to meet the black pixel hypothesis and cannot be expressed with simple bio optical models wang et al 2019 ac processors such as bp bac mumm and polymer that rely on these assumptions failed in eastern china s eutrophic and turbid lakes for the ann based c2rcc processor the aph 443 in eastern china lakes could reach 455 32 m 1 shi et al 2019 far exceeding the maximum value for the training dataset of c2rcc 5 3 m 1 in addition aerosol models of current water ac processors are usually established for nonabsorbent or weakly absorptive aerosols and ignore absorptive aerosols in eastern china wang et al 2019 due to these invalid assumptions such as the black pixel hypothesis and suboptimal conditions cyanobacteria blooms absorptive aerosols land proximity effects etc in optically complex inland waters water based atmospheric algorithms usually fail to obtain high accuracy rrs from satellite measurements wang and gordon 2018 unexpectedly the terrestrial heritage i e the 6svprocessor vermote et al 1997 used in this study outperformed general water ac processors fig 5 and tables 4 5 the land based approach uses the aerosol optical depth from adjacent land pixels and avoids an a priori assumption of water composition and spectral response matthews et al 2010 kravitz et al 2020 also confirmed that the 6sv processor usually outperforms other ac processors in monitoring the water quality of inland turbid water we recommended the 6sv processor as an alternative in turbid waters like lakes across eastern china when general water ac processors failed however some uncertainties occurred in 6sv corrected rrs resulting from the following shen et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 1 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis aerosol optical depth aod products were used as inputs which inherently have certain uncertainties 2 a fixed aerosol model continental model and aod value were set for the whole lake without considering the spatial difference of aerosols and 3 the fresnel reflectance at the water atmosphere interface was not corrected in 6sv these uncertainties usually occur for large or clear lakes these deficiencies in satellite derived rrs will ultimately affect chla concentration estimation accuracy a high precision water ac processor is urgently needed to support water quality monitoring in turbid inland lakes across eastern china 4 2 why random forest previously established chla algorithms except for mci indices showed good application potential over turbid inland water bodies using in situ measured rrs fig 6 and table 6 if highly accurate satellite derived rrs are available these state of the art chla algorithms will have good potential in satellite monitoring however obtaining highly accurate satellite derived rrs products for inland turbid waters across eastern china is not easy the monte carlo analysis showed that the eight existing algorithms were sensitive to uncertainties in ac although the uncertainties of br indices in ac were small mape 11 89 in the 6sv the band ratio forms were particularly sensitive to the uncertainties in ac chen et al 2020 and the br indices showed considerable uncertainties in the large values fig 5 these large uncertainties inevitably led to large deviations in the estimated chla concentrations when applying a simple linear empirical algorithm similarly the estimated chla concentration of br based gons and simis algorithms also showed large deviations the significant uncertainties in ac mape 62 64 in the 6sv of the tba flh and mci indices resulted in large deviations of the corresponding algorithms for the two improved qaa algorithms qaa750e and tc2 the uncertainties in ac inevitably introduced specific errors for each step and finally led to large deviations in the estimated chla concentrations in the owt classification based liu algorithms as suggested above the selected empirical semianalytical algorithms should be inherently sensitive to ac uncertainties moreover the misclassification of owt resulting from ac uncertainties further led to larger deviations therefore previously established chla algorithms failed in satellite applications in our study area under the optimal accuracy of existing ac i e the 6sv processor instead machine learning approaches perform satisfactorily under the accuracy of 6sv corrected rrs since they can effectively capture and correct systematic patterns in ac uncertainties brazdil and konolige 2012 however for the dnn model the training sets used in this study are few and cannot meet the vast data demand the svr model is susceptible to ac random errors and performs poorly since samples with random errors may be selected as support vectors however if vast training data is accessible the dnn may perform well or high quality data with fewer random uncertainties are available svr may perform well in contrast the rfr and xgboost approaches can usually identify elements with random errors or ignore these elements in constructing the model especially the two types of randomness sample and feature make the model insensitive to random noise and outliers brazdil and konolige 2012 breiman 2001 due to fitting the residuals in each iteration xgboost is slightly more sensitive than rfr to outliers he and hahn 2021 therefore in the case of both small datasets and ac uncertainties tree based ensemble learning methods rfr and xgboost especially rfr have shown broad application prospects for satellite remote sensing monitoring of optically complex inland waters 5 conclusions accurate estimation of chla concentrations in turbid inland waters using satellite remote sensing has been challenging due to the complex optical properties of these waters and ac uncertainties nine state of the art empirical semianalytical and owt classification based chla algorithms i e br tba flh mci gons simis qaa750e tc2 and liu were first evaluated in lakes across eastern china monte carlo analysis showed large deviations caused by ac uncertainties to estimate chla concentrations in turbid inland lakes across eastern china by using olci observations four machine learning approaches rfr xgboost dnn and svr were employed in this study the rfr chla model trained with the olci concurrent dataset demonstrated the best performance the monte carlo simulations indicated that the rfr chla model deviations with ac uncertainties were acceptable with deviations close to or within the model validation accuracy thus the rfr chla model and 6sv corrected olci images provide the ability to map chla concentrations in turbid inland lakes across eastern china using olci observations the rfr chla model was finally employed to retrieve the spatial and temporal distributions of chla in turbid inland lakes across eastern china between may 2016 and april 2020 lakes in eastern china are severely eutrophic with chla concentrations that are high in the summer and autumn and low in the winter and spring the chla concentrations were significantly higher in lakes in the epl zone than in lakes in the npml zone this study provides a reference using the rfr model for water quality monitoring in turbid inland waters with certain ac uncertainties to support aquatic management and sdg 6

2705,a robust and reliable chlorophyll a chla concentration algorithm is still lacking for optically complex waters due to the lack of understanding of the bio optical process machine learning approaches which excel at detecting potential complex nonlinear relationships provide opportunities to estimate chla accurately for optically complex waters however the uncertainties in atmospheric correction ac may be amplified in different chla algorithms here we aim to select one state of the art algorithm or establish a new algorithm based on machine learning approaches that less sensitive to ac uncertainties firstly nine state of the art empirical semianalytical and optical water types owt classification based chla algorithms were implemented these existing algorithms showed good performance by using in situ database however failed in actual olci applications due to their sensitivity to ac uncertainties thus four popular machine learning approaches random forest regression rfr extreme gradient boosting xgboost deep neural network dnn and support vector regression svr were then employed among them the rfr chla model performed the best and showed less sensitivity to ac uncertainties finally the chla spatiotemporal variations in 163 major lakes across eastern china were mapped from olci between may 2016 and april 2020 using the proposed rfr chla model generally the lakes in eastern china are severely eutrophic with an average chla concentration of 33 39 6 95 μg l spatially chla in the south of eastern china was significantly higher than those in northern lakes seasonally chla was high in the summer and autumn and low in the spring and winter this study provides a reference for water quality monitoring in turbid inland waters suffering certain ac uncertainties and supports aquatic management and sdg 6 reporting keywords chlorophyll a machine learning eutrophication turbid waters data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction lake ecosystems play essential roles in global biogeochemical cycles local ecological balance drinking water supply and socioeconomic development heino et al 2021 palmer et al 2015 qin et al 2010 however because of nutrient enrichment and global warming many lakes have experienced increasing eutrophication frequent blooms and deteriorating water quality ho et al 2019 therefore understanding the water quality changes in lakes is crucial these issues have attracted close attention from the public and thus water quality management authorities have formulated many monitoring strategies and environmental protection measures qin et al 2019 additionally the united nations un has incorporated water quality monitoring into the sustainable development goal sdg 6 water and sanitation indicator framework un 2015 therein sdg 6 3 2 tracks the proportion of water bodies with good ambient water quality and sdg 6 6 1 which tracks the change in the extent of water related ecosystems over time also focuses on the quality of water in ecosystems traditional field measurements and laboratory analysis obviously cannot meet the needs of monitoring lakes in large areas and satellite remote sensing is the primary tool because of its superior performance chlorophyll a chla a pigment present in all algal species is a proxy for a water body s trophic status carlson 1977 and is an indicator used by water quality monitoring frameworks schaeffer et al 2013 much work has been done on monitoring chla using satellite remote sensing which has advantages over traditional methods ioccg 2018 numerous chla algorithms have been developed for different waters and seasons using different sensors in turbid waters table 1 these algorithms include the two band ratio algorithm br dekker 1993 the three band algorithm tba dall olmo et al 2005 the four band algorithm fba le et al 2009 the baseline subtraction algorithm bs gower et al 2005 the nested band ratio algorithm nbr gons et al 2002 simis et al 2005 the quasi analytical algorithm qaa lee et al 2002 and qaa based algorithms liu et al 2020 xue et al 2019 the optical water types owt classification strategy is also an effective tool for optically complex waters and has been used to retrieve chla concentration from widely dispersed in situ data bi et al 2019 liu et al 2021 neil et al 2019 the proposed chla algorithms have been successfully applied to in situ measured reflectances and successfully tested on several satellite images of specific waters for which the algorithms were developed however the optical properties of inland waters are very complex and the concentrations of optically active components oacs vary widely in different lakes and seasons these algorithms may fail when applied to other areas or used with time series satellite data machine learning approaches which can detect potential complex nonlinear relationships without prior knowledge have been widely used for monitoring the water quality of oceanic coastal and inland waters jones and linder 2015 these approaches mainly include artificial neural network ann doerffer and schiller 2007 deep neural network dnn pahlevan et al 2020 pyo et al 2019 support vector regression svr guan et al 2020 he et al 2020 random forest regression rfr shen et al 2020 and extreme gradient boosting xgboost cao et al 2020 many studies have employed these approaches for estimations of the chla cao et al 2020 guan et al 2020 li et al 2021 suspended particulate matter pahlevan et al 2022 water clarity maciel et al 2021 phycocyanin o shea et al 2021 pyo et al 2018 primary production li et al 2022 etc applying state of the art machine learning approaches may provide a robust estimation of chla in optically complex waters however there are still challenges in atmospheric correction ac over optically complex inland waters schroeder et al 2022 in open ocean waters atmospheric effects can be easily removed by separating path radiance under the assumption of negligible water leaving radiance in the near infrared nir bands known as the black pixel hypothesis gordon and wang 1994 however optically complex inland waters are usually characterized by non negligible water signals in the nir bands and do not meet the black pixel hypothesis in order to re establish the black pixel hypothesis some studies employed an iterated method or shifted into the shortwave infrared swir 1000 3000 nm or ultraviolet uv 400 nm bands bailey et al 2010 he et al 2012 vanhellemont and ruddick 2015 wang 2007 wang and shi 2005 several other alternative ac methods are also developed such as spectral optimization steinmetz et al 2011 steinmetz and ramon 2018 and ann brockmann et al 2016 fan et al 2021 fan et al 2017 despite efforts having been devoted to removing atmospheric effects frouin et al 2019 ioccg 2010 significant uncertainties still remain in ac over optically complex inland waters with mean absolute percentage errors mape in the range of 7 440 in the visible region bi et al 2018 li et al 2019 shen et al 2020 vanhellemont and ruddick 2021 these uncertainties may be amplified in different chla algorithms thus resulting in the failure of satellite applications therefore it is worth discussing the applicability and sensitivity of the existing empirical and semianalytical algorithms and machine learning algorithms for chla estimations when suffering ac uncertainties eastern china a region east of the heihe tengchong line has a dense population and is the core region of china s economic and social development ma et al 2012 severe eutrophication problems have been found in most lakes across eastern china guan et al 2020 however operational satellite applications of chla retrievals have still not been realized in such an important area these results inspired us to deepen the understanding of lake chla concentration variability in eastern china to serve lake management this study s objectives were to 1 evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of nine previously established algorithms to ac uncertainties in turbid lakes across eastern china 2 establish a robust and reliable chla algorithm based on machine learning approaches if the traditional algorithms do not work and 3 reveal the spatiotemporal variation pattern of chla in large lakes 10 km2 across eastern china the algorithms are tuned for sentinel

lake epl zone 18 1 42 6 n 104 5 122 7 e ma et al 2011 fig 1 eastern china is located in the east asian monsoon climate zone with a subtropical monsoon climate prevailing in the epl zone and a temperate monsoon climate in the npml zone lakes in the two lake zones are primarily turbid and shallow with an average depth of 0 44 to 8 1 m wang and dou 1998 as a result of climate change and rapid economic development the water quality of these lakes has deteriorated and suffered mesotrophic or eutrophic qin et al 2019 frequent cyanobacterial blooms in lakes such as lake taihu and lake chaohu have threatened drinking water safety duan et al 2009 duan et al 2017 considering the spatial resolution of olci data 300 m 163 major lakes 10 km2 118 in the epl zone and 45 in the npml zone in eastern china were studied table s1 notably chla concentrations were not retrieved in the icing period 2 2 field measurements field surveys were conducted in 24 lakes across eastern china fig 1 and table 2 water samples were collected at the surface 30 cm and stored in a dark and low temperature before the laboratory analyses remote sensing reflectance rrs was measured using a fieldspec pro dual visible and near infrared vnir spectroradiometer 350 1050 nm analytical spectral devices inc laboratory analyses the chla concentrations were determined using a shimadzu uv2600 spectrophotometer at 630 645 663 and 750 nm after extraction with 90 acetone gitelson et al 2008 the suspended particulate matter spm concentrations were gravimetrically determined from the samples cao et al 2017 remote sensing reflectance following the national aeronautics and space administration nasa protocols rrs was determined from an above water method with an azimuth angle of 135 from the sun and 40 from the nadir mueller et al 2003 rrs was calculated as follows 1 r rs l w e d 0 l sw r l sky l p π ρ p where lw lsw rlsky is the water leaving radiance lsw is the total water leaving radiance lsky is the diffuse sky radiance and r is fresnel reflectance at the water atmosphere interface 2 5 used here ed 0 lpπ ρp is the downwelling irradiance just above the water surface lp is the radiance of the gray panel and ρp is the reflectance of the standard reflectance panel then the in situ measured rrs was averaged using the spectral response function srf of olci after quality control 847 matchups of chla rrs in situ measurements were obtained two thirds of which were used as an in situ training dataset n 565 and the remaining 282 matchups of samples were used as in situ validation datasets 2 3 olci data the sentinel 3a b olci with its narrow spectral bands from 400 to 1020 nm 300 m spatial resolution and 1 4 days revisit for latitude 30 2 satellites constellation has been proven to have the excellent capability for monitoring inland waters donlon et al 2012 shen et al 2017 importantly olci is equipped with characteristic absorption or reflection bands of chla for turbid waters i e 665 nm and 709 nm liu et al 2020 sentinel 3a launched on 16 february 2016 and sentinel 3b launched on 25 april 2018 the two olci payloads show good consistency in monitoring inland water quality bourg et al 2020 shen et al 2022 olci level 1b full resolution fr images covering eastern china between may 2016 and april 2020 were downloaded from the copernicus open access hub these data were preprocessed as follows fig 2 atmospheric correction six commonly used ac processors designed for case 2 waters were compared in this study these processors include the nasa default black pixel hypothesis based algorithm bp gordon and wang 1994 the olci baseline atmospheric correction bac processor moore and lavender 2011 the management unit of the north seas mathematical models mumm ruddick et al 2000 the polynomial based algorithm applied to medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris polymer steinmetz et al 2011 the case 2 regional coast color processor c2rcc brockmann et al 2016 and the vector version of second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar spectrum correction scheme 6sv vermote et al 1997 bp bac mumm polymer and c2rcc were specially designed for water ac while the 6sv was terrestrial heritage and was adopted as an alternative to water ac for olci data in some recent studies shen et al 2020 the parameters of each ac processor were set as shown in table s2 mask water land boundaries were determined using previous lake boundaries ma et al 2011 and an automated water delineation algorithm wang et al 2014 two pixels 600 m near the land water boundary were removed to avoid land adjacency effects lae and land water mixed pixels hou et al 2017 cloud contaminated pixels were masked with the criteria of rayleigh corrected reflectance rrc rrc 865 0 25 and rrc 560 0 25 qi et al 2014b sunglint pixels were removed via the sunglint risk flag in olci level 1b product auxiliary data using the method proposed by hu 2009 we excluded the algal blooms that formed surface scums and aquatic vegetation with a threshold of 1 194 10 4 on the floating algae index fai the ice season of each lake was obtained from wang and dou 1998 and images of lakes during the ice season were excluded after masking sub optimal observations i e ice cloud sunglint etc an average of 280 90 high quality olci scenes were obtained for each lake fig 3 concurrent match the concurrent olci data and field measurements were matched with several criteria cao et al 2017 first an adequate time window of 6 h was adopted then at least half valid pixels were required in the 3 3 pixel window the coefficient of variation cv was required to be lower than 15 to assure spatial homogeneity after applying the above criteria we obtained 321 olci in situ concurrent matchups 245 stations for olci 3a and 76 stations for olci 3b two thirds of these concurrent matches n 214 163 for olci 3a and 51 for olci 3b were used as the concurrent training dataset the remaining 107 stations 82 for olci 3a and 25 for olci 3b were used as the concurrent validation dataset 2 4 existing chla algorithms nine previously established chla algorithms consisting of four empirical algorithms four semianalytical algorithms and one owt classification based algorithm were implemented for evaluation the empirical algorithms include br dekker 1993 tba dall olmo et al 2005 the fluorescence line height algorithm flh gower et al 1999 and the maximum chlorophyll index algorithm mci gower et al 2005 the semianalytical algorithms include two nested band ratio approaches namely gons gons et al 2002 and simis simis et al 2005 and two improved qaas namely qaa750e xue et al 2019 and tc2 liu et al 2020 the owt classification based algorithm was liu et al 2021 denoted as liu hereafter the steps of these algorithms tuned for olci data can be found in table 3 2 5 machine learning approaches we employed four popular machine learning approaches including dnn svr rfr and xgboost to estimate the chla of turbid waters using the scikit learn xgboost and tensorflow packages in python fig 4 these four machine learning approaches have been widely used in remote sensing estimation of inland turbid water bodies dnn is an ann with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers i e deep networks lecun et al 2015 compared with traditional shallow neural networks deep networks provide a higher level of nonlinear function approximation and can combine low level features to provide new knowledge and thus improve the estimation of the model dnn may provide higher accuracy than classic machine learning approaches under proper applications however the dnn usually requires a considerable sample size svr maps the original nonlinear data space to the high dimensional and linearly separable data space using kernel functions platt 2004 smola and schölkopf 2004 svr uses an optimal separation hyperplane to minimize the empirical loss function svr performs well in dealing with nonlinear problems and a small dataset but is susceptible to data noise and is inefficient when the sample size is large both rfr and xgboost are decision tree based ensemble learning methods breiman 2001 chen and guestrin 2016 rfr constructs many independent decision trees i e forests based on the bagging concept while xgboost adopts the boosting concept and generates a series of interdependent decision trees serially rfr integrates the decision tree results such as the averages to improve the accuracy of the model and xgboost continuously iteratively generates a new decision tree to fit the residuals of the previous prediction results sample and feature randomness are employed in both rfr and xgboost during the construction of each decision tree therefore rfr and xgboost are usually not easy to overfit and have a good tolerance for outliers and noise due to fitting the residuals in each iteration xgboost usually has superior performance under low noise conditions but is more sensitive than rfr to outliers he and hahn 2021 twelve experiments were conducted to optimize the approach and input variables of the chla retrievals each machine learning approach uses spectral bands model 1 spectral indices model 2 and both spectral bands and spectral indices model 3 as input variables where model refers to the rfr xgboost dnn or svr model spectral bands included bands 510 560 620 665 674 681 709 and 754 nm and indices included br tba flh and mci blue bands 413 443 and 490 nm are not critical in estimating chla in eutrophic and turbid waters and usually suffer large ac uncertainties so blue bands are not used the olci concurrent dataset instead of the in situ dataset was used to train machine learning approaches to partially eliminate the systematic patterns in ac uncertainties in model training the hyperparameters i e n estimators max depth etc for rfr and xgboost learning rate n hiddenlayers and n nerons for dnn γ and c for svr of machine learning approaches were optimized using a grid search strategy text s1 and table s3 2 6 model sensitivity to uncertainties in ac the monte carlo analysis is a numerical simulation method that relies on repeated random sampling to infer unknown numerical characteristics doubilet et al 1985 and excels at sensitivity analysis we quantified how chla algorithms respond to the various ac uncertainties for different input bands or indices using a monte carlo analysis qi et al 2020 this analysis determines the sensitivity of chla estimations to uncertainties in ac by superimposing a normal distribution of simulated errors to original inputs for each input band or indices the model sensitivity to ac uncertainties was determined with the following steps 1 assuming that the other input variables remained unchanged the monte carlo method was first used to simulate a series of normally distributed errors with different uncertainties quantified as the mean absolute percentage errors mape here for this input variable considering the correlations between spectral bands each spectral index br tba flh and mci was regarded as a whole independent variable 2 input variables with extra uncertainties were obtained by superimposing the simulation errors on each station 3 chla concentrations derived using the original inputs and inputs with additional uncertainties were compared to determine the model s sensitivity to input variable uncertainties the deviations were quantified using mape here each monte carlo analysis ran 10 000 simulations a wide range of ac uncertainties 2 5 1000 for different input variables was considered using a large number of monte carlo analyses so the deviations in different chla algorithms caused by various ac uncertainties can be determined for satellite applications 2 7 statistical analysis and accuracy assessment four statistical metrics were used to evaluate model accuracy the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mape and mean normalized bias mnb these indices are calculated as follows 2 r 2 x i x y i y 2 x i x 2 y i y 2 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 4 mape 1 n i 1 n y i x i x i 100 5 mnb 1 n i 1 n y i x i x i 100 xi is the i th in situ measured data yi is the i th modeled data and n is the number of matched pairs 3 results 3 1 uncertainties in ac the performance of each ac processor varied in different bands 413 443 490 510 560 620 665 674 681 709 754 and 779 nm in general the 6sv processor performed best the next performing processors were the mumm and c2rcc processors the bac and bp processors and the polymer processor which performed in order of performance worst fig 5 and table 4 in the blue bands 413 443 and 490 nm and green bands 510 560 nm all ac processors performed poorly r2 0 42 rmse 0 0082 sr 1 and mape 17 16 and the accuracy of the 6sv processor usually exceeded that of the other processors compared to the accuracy of each processor in the blue and green bands the accuracy of each processor in the red bands 620 665 674 681 709 nm was significantly improved the 6sv processor was more accurate than the other processors r2 0 59 rmse 0 0076 sr 1 mape 27 74 the next most accurate processors were the bp mumm bac and c2rcc processors r2 0 51 rmse 0 0091 sr 1 mape 36 03 while the polymer processor performed the worst rmse 0 0181 sr 1 mape 59 73 the scatters of the bp mumm bac c2rcc and polymer processors were distributed below the 1 1 line at each band thus showing a large underestimation with mnb ranging from 67 49 to 1 55 the scatters of the 6sv processor were more evenly distributed along the 1 1 line and showed a certain overestimation with mnb ranging from 1 68 to 69 45 except for the 560 nm band due to the processor s limitations such as the black assumption in swir bands processors such as bp mumm bac and polymer may obtain invalid results negative values no results etc the percentage of valid concurrent matches of these processors ranged between 86 01 and 97 61 spectral indices are often used to develop chla algorithms the performances of br tba flh and mci were also evaluated in this study fig 5 and table 5 for br rrs 709 rrs 665 the 6sv processor performed the best of all processors r2 0 53 rmse 0 1870 mape 19 94 while the other processors performed poorly r2 ranging from 0 to 0 21 and mape ranging from 15 40 to 155 06 all the processors performed poorly for the tba flh and mci indices tba and flh performed especially poorly with mape ranging between 179 03 and 1367 95 among the ac processors the 6sv processor performed the best and usually showed the best statistical indices overall the 6sv processor outperformed bp mumm bac c2rcc and polymer in bands and spectral indices and was optimal for olci data in lakes across eastern china 3 2 existing chla algorithms 3 2 1

for empirical algorithms considering the differences in the specific absorption coefficient of chla the empirical relationships between the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton aph derived in semianalytical algorithms and the chla concentration were also recalibrated using the in situ training dataset the performances of the in situ validation dataset showed that liu performed best r2 0 73 rmse 10 96 μg l mape 39 20 and mnb 7 96 followed by br gons and simis r2 0 71 rmse 11 40 μg l mape 46 33 and mnb 16 61 then tba flh qaa750e and tc2 r2 0 66 0 62 0 64 and 0 65 rmse 12 50 13 16 13 06 and 13 10 μg l mape 48 37 66 20 48 29 and 42 29 mnb 27 91 19 69 25 36 and 22 30 mci performed the worst r2 0 41 rmse 16 21 μg l mape 66 20 and mnb 35 48 fig 6 and table 6 unfortunately the accuracy of each algorithm on the olci concurrent matchup dataset was low r2 0 4 rmse 22 06 μg l and mape 69 79 fig 6 and table 6 these algorithms were then recalibrated using the concurrent dataset to partially eliminate the influence of ac system errors however the accuracy of each algorithm was still low r2 0 4 rmse 20 53 μg l and mape 53 53 table 6 3 2 2 sensitivity to ac uncertainties the sensitivity of existing chla algorithms to various uncertainties of ac in the range of 2 5 1000 was determined using monte carlo analysis fig 7 the deviations quantified using mape here of all the algorithms increased with the increasing input uncertainties as expected fig 7 however the sensitivity to input uncertainty varies from algorithms and input bands or indices here we took the ac uncertainties in the 6sv ac processor stars in fig 7 as examples to discuss the sensitivity of different chla algorithms in a detailed manner the uncertainty of br in the 6sv was only 11 89 however this resulted in considerable deviations in chla estimation mape 70 44 the deviations of the remaining empirical algorithms tba flh and mci were also prominent mape 68 10 due to the sensitive response to large ac uncertainties mape 62 64 for the nbr approaches gons and simis the deviations by br uncertainties were significant mape 48 41 although the deviations by the 779 nm band were slight mape 10 86 for two qaa based algorithms qaa750e and tc2 the deviations caused by noncritical bands i e 443 and 560 nm were slight mape 11 35 but the deviations caused by the critical bands i e 665 674 709 nm and 754 nm were significant mape 38 33 in the owt classification based liu algorithms the deviations caused by noncritical bands i e 443 490 560 620 and 779 nm were slight mape 6 65 there were significant deviations mape 135 72 caused by the critical bands i e 665 and 709 nm since most in situ measurements owned the highest membership scores of owt which uses the br or gons algorithms these existing chla algorithms were sensitive to ac uncertainties especially critical input variables thus they cannot be widely promoted for satellite use to monitor eutrophic and turbid lakes across eastern china 3 3 machine learning approaches 3 3 1 training and validation the machine learning approaches outperformed the existing algorithms on the olci concurrent validation dataset fig 8 in a comparison of the four machine learning approaches with different inputs except for svr models that incorporate both spectral bands and spectral indices model 3 r2 0 63 rmse 15 35 μg l and mape 37 78 usually outperform models that use only spectral bands model 1 r2 0 63 rmse 15 30 μg l and mape 45 10 or only spectral indices model 2 r2 0 65 rmse 14 74 μg l and mape 41 76 when model 3 is used as an example to compare the four machine learning approaches rfr3 and xgboost3 performed the best rfr3 r2 0 73 rmse 12 99 μg l mape 36 91 and mnb 19 73 xgboost3 r2 0 73 rmse 13 03 μg l mape 36 62 and mnb 18 28 dnn3 followed next in performance r2 0 63 rmse 15 35 μg l mape 37 78 mnb 12 11 and the svr3 algorithm performed the worst r2 0 33 rmse 21 34 μg l mape 66 48 and mnb 24 71 in addition rfr3 and xgboost3 both showed higher accuracy on olci 3a and olci 3b rfr3 r2 0 70 and 0 84 respectively rmse 13 77 and 10 00 μg l respectively mape 39 64 and 27 93 respectively mnb 22 12 and 11 89 respectively xgboost3 r2 0 69 and 0 85 respectively rmse 13 93 and 9 47 μg l respectively mape 39 56 and 26 97 respectively and mnb 20 85 and 9 82 respectively these results showed that rfr3 and xgboost3 had great application potential in chla estimation over optically complex waters with large ac uncertainties 3 3 2 sensitivity to ac uncertainties the impacts of the various ac uncertainties in the range of 2 5 1000 on the machine learning approaches were also quantified using monte carlo simulation fig 9 the deviations quantified using mape here of machine learning approaches generally increased with the increasing input uncertainties but trends of increase followed by decrease were also found i e deviations caused by br uncertainties in svr and dnn as for the ac uncertainties in the 6sv ac processor stars in fig 9 rfr and xgboost showed similar sensitivity to the ac uncertainties the estimated deviation caused by the uncertainties of the spectral bands was slight rfr mape ranging between 4 34 and 10 90 xgboost mape ranging between 4 67 and 11 12 the deviation caused by the uncertainties of the spectral indices was significant rfr mape ranging between 7 56 and 18 23 and xgboost mape ranging between 10 29 and 22 92 for dnn except for the slight deviation caused by the uncertainties of the 620 nm band mape 7 84 the uncertainties of the other input variables all caused large estimation deviations mape in the range of 21 34 92 30 for svr the estimation deviation was mainly caused by br and tba uncertainties mape 59 71 and 34 87 respectively the deviation caused by the uncertainties of the spectral bands and the flh and mci indices is slight mape ranging between 0 43 and 4 93 compared with the four models dnn and svr were susceptible to the uncertainties of crucial input variables dnn3 maximum mape reaching 92 30 svr maximum mape reaching 59 73 in contrast rfr and xgboost were less sensitive to ac uncertainties rfr maximum mape 18 23 xgboost maximum mape 22 92 the rfr was slightly better between the two models overall rfr which uses both spectral bands and spectral indices as input variables was finally selected to retrieve the chla concentration for the olci data on eutrophic and turbid lakes across eastern china this model is denoted as the rfr chla model hereafter 3 3 3 rfr chla model in different scenarios on satellite images to better understand the applicability of our proposed rfr chla model we showed different scenarios on satellite images in three typical shallow lakes lake taihu lake hongze and lake shijiu with average in situ chla concentrations ranging from 5 03 μg l to 44 33 μg l fig 10 the results showed that the rfr chla model performed well in turbid lake hongze fig 10d f r2 0 92 rmse 7 28 μg l mape 24 70 or slight turbid waters lake shijiu fig 10g i r2 0 90 rmse 0 70 μg l mape 13 71 however the olci derived chla values were less accurate but acceptable when heavy bloom occurred in lake taihu fig 10a c r2 0 50 rmse 11 81 μg l mape 29 91 which may attribute to the adjacency effects of algal bloom generally we infer that the rfr chla model provides the ability to map realistic chla concentrations but has some challenges in bloom events 3 4 chla spatiotemporal patterns the rfr chla model and the 6sv corrected olci rrs data were employed to map the spatiotemporal patterns of chla concentrations in lakes in eastern china the olci derived chla demonstrated that the lakes in eastern china were severely eutrophic with an average chla concentration of 33 39 6 95 μg l fig 11 spatially the average chla concentration of the lakes in the study area showed significant distribution variations lakes with high chla concentrations were distributed mainly in the dense lakes in the middle reaches of the yangtze river in the epl zone and the song nen plain in the npml zone lakes with low chla concentrations were distributed mainly in the lower reaches of the yangtze river and the huai river basin in the epl zone each lake also showed significant inner variations for example the eastern area of lake dongting the western area of lake chaohu and the meiliang bay of lake taihu all showed higher chla concentrations within the lakes fig 11a numerically the frequency distribution of the average chla concentration showed a negative skewness distribution skewness 0 5697 0 with 71 1 of lakes showing chla concentrations higher than 30 μg l fig 11b for the two lake zones the average chla concentration of epl lakes 36 29 7 86 μg l was significantly higher than those of the npml lakes 33 60 7 41 μg l t test p 0 05 between may and october i e the ice free period of npml lakes fig 11c thus presenting a spatial pattern of high in the south and low in the north moreover smaller lakes were usually more eutrophic with higher chla concentrations lakes 50 km2 34 94 6 19 μg l 50 lakes 100 km2 34 00 7 25 μg l in comparison large lakes had lower chla concentrations 100 lakes 1000 km2 28 84 6 15 μg l lakes 1000 km2 24 05 4 90 μg l fig 11d small lakes in eastern china usually have aquaculture activities which promote the eutrophication of water bodies wang et al 2018 this finding was consistent with the results of guan et al 2020 and cao et al 2020 in terms of the temporal pattern the average chla concentration was often high in the summer june to august 35 61 7 48 μg l and autumn september to november 35 84 8 72 μg l the average chla concentration was next highest in the spring march to may 32 48 7 48 μg l and was the lowest in the winter december to the next february 27 89 7 44 μg l figs 12 13 however npml lakes usually showed a high value in may this result may be attributed to the melting of snow and ice carrying nutrients into the lakes the average chla concentration of lakes in eastern china was relatively stable during the four years from may 2016 to april 2020 and there were no significant interannual changes the seasonal patterns during the four years were the same i e higher in the summer and autumn low in the spring and winter fig 12 4 discussion 4 1 what sources of uncertainties in ac the water optical properties of the lakes in eastern china are complex with spm and colored dissolved organic matter cdom not covariant with chla concentrations xue et al 2017 thus waters in lakes across eastern china failed to meet the black pixel hypothesis and cannot be expressed with simple bio optical models wang et al 2019 ac processors such as bp bac mumm and polymer that rely on these assumptions failed in eastern china s eutrophic and turbid lakes for the ann based c2rcc processor the aph 443 in eastern china lakes could reach 455 32 m 1 shi et al 2019 far exceeding the maximum value for the training dataset of c2rcc 5 3 m 1 in addition aerosol models of current water ac processors are usually established for nonabsorbent or weakly absorptive aerosols and ignore absorptive aerosols in eastern china wang et al 2019 due to these invalid assumptions such as the black pixel hypothesis and suboptimal conditions cyanobacteria blooms absorptive aerosols land proximity effects etc in optically complex inland waters water based atmospheric algorithms usually fail to obtain high accuracy rrs from satellite measurements wang and gordon 2018 unexpectedly the terrestrial heritage i e the 6svprocessor vermote et al 1997 used in this study outperformed general water ac processors fig 5 and tables 4 5 the land based approach uses the aerosol optical depth from adjacent land pixels and avoids an a priori assumption of water composition and spectral response matthews et al 2010 kravitz et al 2020 also confirmed that the 6sv processor usually outperforms other ac processors in monitoring the water quality of inland turbid water we recommended the 6sv processor as an alternative in turbid waters like lakes across eastern china when general water ac processors failed however some uncertainties occurred in 6sv corrected rrs resulting from the following shen et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 1 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis aerosol optical depth aod products were used as inputs which inherently have certain uncertainties 2 a fixed aerosol model continental model and aod value were set for the whole lake without considering the spatial difference of aerosols and 3 the fresnel reflectance at the water atmosphere interface was not corrected in 6sv these uncertainties usually occur for large or clear lakes these deficiencies in satellite derived rrs will ultimately affect chla concentration estimation accuracy a high precision water ac processor is urgently needed to support water quality monitoring in turbid inland lakes across eastern china 4 2 why random forest previously established chla algorithms except for mci indices showed good application potential over turbid inland water bodies using in situ measured rrs fig 6 and table 6 if highly accurate satellite derived rrs are available these state of the art chla algorithms will have good potential in satellite monitoring however obtaining highly accurate satellite derived rrs products for inland turbid waters across eastern china is not easy the monte carlo analysis showed that the eight existing algorithms were sensitive to uncertainties in ac although the uncertainties of br indices in ac were small mape 11 89 in the 6sv the band ratio forms were particularly sensitive to the uncertainties in ac chen et al 2020 and the br indices showed considerable uncertainties in the large values fig 5 these large uncertainties inevitably led to large deviations in the estimated chla concentrations when applying a simple linear empirical algorithm similarly the estimated chla concentration of br based gons and simis algorithms also showed large deviations the significant uncertainties in ac mape 62 64 in the 6sv of the tba flh and mci indices resulted in large deviations of the corresponding algorithms for the two improved qaa algorithms qaa750e and tc2 the uncertainties in ac inevitably introduced specific errors for each step and finally led to large deviations in the estimated chla concentrations in the owt classification based liu algorithms as suggested above the selected empirical semianalytical algorithms should be inherently sensitive to ac uncertainties moreover the misclassification of owt resulting from ac uncertainties further led to larger deviations therefore previously established chla algorithms failed in satellite applications in our study area under the optimal accuracy of existing ac i e the 6sv processor instead machine learning approaches perform satisfactorily under the accuracy of 6sv corrected rrs since they can effectively capture and correct systematic patterns in ac uncertainties brazdil and konolige 2012 however for the dnn model the training sets used in this study are few and cannot meet the vast data demand the svr model is susceptible to ac random errors and performs poorly since samples with random errors may be selected as support vectors however if vast training data is accessible the dnn may perform well or high quality data with fewer random uncertainties are available svr may perform well in contrast the rfr and xgboost approaches can usually identify elements with random errors or ignore these elements in constructing the model especially the two types of randomness sample and feature make the model insensitive to random noise and outliers brazdil and konolige 2012 breiman 2001 due to fitting the residuals in each iteration xgboost is slightly more sensitive than rfr to outliers he and hahn 2021 therefore in the case of both small datasets and ac uncertainties tree based ensemble learning methods rfr and xgboost especially rfr have shown broad application prospects for satellite remote sensing monitoring of optically complex inland waters 5 conclusions accurate estimation of chla concentrations in turbid inland waters using satellite remote sensing has been challenging due to the complex optical properties of these waters and ac uncertainties nine state of the art empirical semianalytical and owt classification based chla algorithms i e br tba flh mci gons simis qaa750e tc2 and liu were first evaluated in lakes across eastern china monte carlo analysis showed large deviations caused by ac uncertainties to estimate chla concentrations in turbid inland lakes across eastern china by using olci observations four machine learning approaches rfr xgboost dnn and svr were employed in this study the rfr chla model trained with the olci concurrent dataset demonstrated the best performance the monte carlo simulations indicated that the rfr chla model deviations with ac uncertainties were acceptable with deviations close to or within the model validation accuracy thus the rfr chla model and 6sv corrected olci images provide the ability to map chla concentrations in turbid inland lakes across eastern china using olci observations the rfr chla model was finally employed to retrieve the spatial and temporal distributions of chla in turbid inland lakes across eastern china between may 2016 and april 2020 lakes in eastern china are severely eutrophic with chla concentrations that are high in the summer and autumn and low in the winter and spring the chla concentrations were significantly higher in lakes in the epl zone than in lakes in the npml zone this study provides a reference using the rfr model for water quality monitoring in turbid inland waters with certain ac uncertainties to support aquatic management and sdg 6

2706,co2 is released to the atmosphere via sulfuric acid weathering of carbonate rocks affecting the flux of co2 drawdown via silicate weathering precisely quantifying the proportion of oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals to riverine sulfate is critical to improving the estimation of the global carbon budge sulfur and oxygen isotopic compositions of sulfate and major ion concentrations in river water samples collected monthly at 12 sampling sites from a small typical karstic catchment of southwest china were analyzed in order to quantify the relative contribution of sulfide oxidation to riverine sulfate and elucidate the factors affecting its changes results show that the sulfate concentration and δ34ssulfate and δ18osulfate values at most sampling sites have obvious seasonal changes with low values in the monsoon season and high values in the non monsoon season suggesting that the relative contributions of different sulfur sources to riverine sulfate are seasonally variable throughout of the year results from the beyesian isotope mixing model show that overall the fraction of sulfide derived sulfate to riverine sulfate ranges from 44 3 13 7 to 53 3 10 5 although it has a wide range for different sampling sites in addition the relative contribution of sulfide weathering displays a seasonal variation and is higher in the monsoon season which is mainly attributed to the influence of high rainfall in wet season this study indicates that an increase in rainfall intensity under climate change may lead to a raised sulfide oxidation rate in the karstic catchment which is important for assessment of global carbonate and silicate weathering in future keywords sulfate sulfur isotopes oxygen isotopes karst sulfide oxidation chemical weathering data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chemical weathering of crustal rocks regulates the atmospheric co2 concentration over geologic timescales and plays a critical role in the global carbon cycle and climate change walker et al 1981 gaillardet et al 1999 hilton and west 2020 the weathering of carbonate and silicate rocks consumes atmospheric co2 and is an important part of carbon sink walker et al 1981 liu et al 2010 although these chemical weathering processes are considered to be relatively well studied there remain significant uncertainties in the quantification of chemical weathering fluxes and their influences on the carbon cycle at different spatial and temporal scales one of important issues involving estimation of chemical weathering fluxes is the carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid h2so4 spence and telmer 2005 calmels et al 2007 torres et al 2014 relph et al 2021 oxidative weathering of sulfide e g pyrite generates h2so4 as following calmels et al 2007 torres et al 2014 1 4fes 2 15 o 2 14 h 2 o 4fe oh 3 8h 2 so 4 when carbonate minerals react with this h2so4 the carbon stored in sedimentary rocks is released to the ocean atmosphere system as co2 following the equations torres et al 2014 2 caco 3 h 2 so 4 co 2 g h 2 o ca 2 so 4 2 and 3 2caco 3 h 2 so 4 ca 2 so 4 2 2hco 3 thus carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid h2so4 may be regarded as a source of atmospheric co2 offsetting the co2 consumption via silicate weathering burke et al 2018 hence it is required to identify sources of riverine sulfate and calculate their relative proportions in order to quantify co2 release via sulfuric acid weathering dissolved sulfate in river may be derived from sulfide oxidation dissolution of evaporites atmospheric deposition and anthropogenic inputs mine drainage and sewage krouse and mayer 2000 stable sulfur and oxygen isotopes are useful for constraining sulfate sources in rivers because these different sulfate sources have distinct sulfur and oxygen isotope values calmels et al 2007 turchyn et al 2013 liu et al 2017 liu and han 2020 zhang et al 2020 kemeny et al 2021 relph et al 2021 the stable isotopic investigations have displayed that the proportions of sulfate derived from sulfide oxidation are 85 5 in the mackenzie river calmels et al 2007 85 7 in the kaoping river das et al 2012 100 in the headwater of the marsyandi river turchyn et al 2013 72 in the yalong river li et al 2014 74 10 in the mississippi river killingsworth et al 2018 and 62 100 in the langtang trisuli narayani river system kemeny et al 2021 while most these data are estimated based on water samples collected in the dry and wet seasons e g li et al 2014 only a few studies have investigated the seasonal variation in oxidative weathering of pyrite using high frequency sampling monthly sampling campaigns e g kemeny et al 2021 such studies may allow us to reduce uncertainties in calculation of chemical weathering fluxes from sulfuric acid dissolution and are required for better understanding biogeochemical sulfur and carbon cycles in the surface earth system and their feedback to modern global climate change in this work monthly water sampling campaigns are conducted throughout 2017 from 12 monitoring sites varying from surface river to underground stream located in a karst area of guizhou province china based on the high frequency sampling major ion chemistry as well as sulfur and oxygen isotopic compositions of sulfate in river water are analyzed in order to evaluate the seasonal changes in sulfur and oxygen isotopic compositions of sulfate partition the relative contributions of different sulfur sources to riverine sulfate and reveal the seasonal change in oxidative weathering of sulfide and its influencing factors this study would provide deeper insights into carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid and biogeochemical cycles of sulfur and carbon in river system 2 methods and materials 2 1 study

2019 torres martínez et al 2020 the model is expressed by the follow equations parnell et al 2010 4 x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij 5 s jk n μ jk ω 2 jk 6 c jk n λ jk τ 2 jk 7 ε ij n 0 σ 2 j where x ij is the observed isotope value j of the mixture i in which i 1 2 3 n and j 1 2 3 j s jk represents source value k on isotope j which is normally distributed with mean μ jk and standard deviation ω 2 jk

and standard deviation τ jk and ε ij is the residual error denoting the additional unquantified variation in individual mixtures which is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation σ 2 j the details of this model can be obtained from parnell et al 2010 in this work the mean sulfur isotope values of different sulfur sources μ jk and their standard deviation ω 2 jk are listed in table 1 it is assumed that the riverine sulfate in this study is mainly derived from atmospheric deposition evaporite dissolution and sulfide oxidation 3 results the chemical and isotopic data of surface river and underground stream in the houzhai catchment are listed in table s1 and table s2 respectively the main statistical parameters of chemical and isotopic data for the 12 sampling sites are displayed in table 2 the temperature in water of surface river varies from 8 6 to 28 2 c during the sampling period while it has narrow variations in underground stream ranging from 13 0 to 20 5 c for the year of 2017 the ph value of water in the surface river ranges from 7 5 to 9 5 with a mean value of 8 3 0 4 the ph value of water in the underground stream varies between 7 1 and 8 6 with a mean value of 7 8 0 4 the ca2 and mg2 concentrations in the surface river range from 0 9 to 3 4 mmol l mean 1 9 0 6 mmol l and from 0 5 to 1 5 mmol l mean 0 9 0 2 mmol l respectively the ca2 and mg2 account for 80 of the total cationic budget the ca2 and mg2 are also major cations in the underground stream with mean values of 2 5 0 8 and 1 1 0 4 mmol l respectively both the surface river water

4 to 2 4 mmol l having a mean value of 0 9 0 5 mmol l the sulfate concentrations at mz 5 hy 3 dz and hz 6 sites have obvious seasonal variations fig 2a with low values in wet season and high values in dry season the sulfate concentration in the underground stream water has a wide variation ranging from 0 2 to 4 7 mmol l the sulfate concentrations at hzu lht cc and cq sites also display a similar seasonal change while they remain constant throughout of the year at ct and mz 1 sites with mean values of 0 26 0 03 mmol l and 0 65 0 06 mmol l respectively fig 2d the δ34s and δ18o values of sulfate in the surface river range from 0 3 to 18 2 and from 5 6 to 12 6 respectively the δ34s and δ18o values at the hz 6 dz hy 3 and mz 5 sites have significant seasonal changes with low values in wet season mean δ34s value 7 6 3 2 and mean δ18o value 8 8 1 1 and high values in dry season mean δ34s value 12 4 4 6 and mean δ18o value 10 6 0 9 in addition the δ34s and δ18o values of sulfate in the underground stream vary from 2 9 to 25 8 and from 4 0 to 16 5 respectively the seasonal variations in sulfur and oxygen isotopes have also been observed at the huz lht cc and cq sites fig 2e f however the δ34s and δ18o values at the ct and mz 1 sites remain almost unchanged for the whole year with mean δ34s values of 2 1 0 7 n 9 and 0 8 0 7 n 9 as well as mean δ18o values of 5 7 0 8 n 9 and 7 4 0 2 n 9 for the two sites respectively 4 discussion 4 1 chemical weathering of rocks in the houzhai catchment chemical composition of rivers is mainly controlled by lithologies silicate carbonate and evaporite weathering could result in distinctly different elemental ratios ca2 na hco3 na mg2 na respectively gaillardet et al 1999 the elemental ratios between hco3 na and ca2 na in water samples of the surface river and the underground stream in this study are close to the end member of carbonate weathering fig 3a and fig 3c suggesting that the dissolved load of water is mainly derived from the weathering of carbonate rocks it is also confirmed by the elemental ratios of mg2 na and ca2 na fig 3b and fig 3d this is consistent with the fact that the exposed rocks in the study area are mainly carbonate rocks hco3 is the most abundant anion in the study area carbonate mineral dissolution by carbonic acid would lead to water chemistry featured with hco3 ca2 mg2 equivalent ratio of 1 0 based on the stoichiometry however the hco3 ca2 mg2 equivalent ratios observed in this work are much lower than 1 0 fig s1a b actually the addition sulfate ion is required for maintaining the ionic balance fig s1c d it indicates that sulfide oxidation and or gypsum dissolution are important chemical processes in this catchment 4 2 sources of sulfate to the surface river and the underground stream the distinct seasonal changes in δ34s and δ18o are observed at the hz 6 dz hy 3 and mz 5 sites for sulfate in the surface river and at the at the huz lht cc and cq sites for sulfate in the underground stream respectively fig 2 it may suggest that the relative contributions of different sulfur sources to riverine sulfate have a seasonal variation potential sources of sulfate are discussed and estimated in order to elucidate the seasonal changes in sulfur and oxygen isotopes the contribution of mine drainage and industrial sewage to riverine sulfate has been neglected in this study because the study area is a typical agricultural small catchment without industries hence atmospheric deposition dissolution of evaporites and sulfide oxidation are considered to be the main possible sources of riverine sulfate in this work atmospheric deposition could be an important source to riverine sulfate in general the relative contribution of sulfate from rainwater to river ranges from 5 to 30 but sometimes may reach up to 75 gaillardet et al 1999 moquet et al 2011 li et al 2014 relph et al 2021 it is observed that the sulfate concentrations in the sampling sites of the surface river the hz 6 dz hy 3 and mz 5 sites and the underground stream the hzu lht cc and cq sites have decreased significantly during the wet season from june to october fig 2 a and d due to the dilution effect of rainwater it may suggest that the sulfate in water collected from these sampling sites is influenced by atmospheric sulfate deposition it should be noted that the sulfate concentrations at the ct and mz 1 sites for the underground stream remain constant throughout of the year indicating that the relative contribution of atmospheric deposition to the underground stream is extremely low at these two sampling sites in the study area the sulfate concentration in rain water ranges from 0 01 to 0 66 mmol l with a mean value of 0 12 0 13 mmol l yan et al 2020 the mean δ34s and δ18o values of sulfate in rain during the monsoon period are 4 1 6 4 and 9 6 1 7 respectively yan et al 2020 however their mean values δ34s and δ18o during the non monsoon period are 3 4 3 4 and 12 4 1 6 respectively yan et al 2020 in this study it assumes that the water residence time is lower than 2 3 months considering the seasonal variations in sulfur and oxygen isotopes of rainwater sulfate the corresponding sulfur and oxygen isotope values are selected as an end member for calculating the relative contribution of atmospheric inputs to river in the monsoon and non monsoon period respectively table 1 the riverine sulfate with high δ34s and δ18o values in the study area fig 4 most likely originates from evaporite minerals previous study reported that near to the puding county the limestone intercalated with the gypsum occurs in the guanling formation of the middle triassic strata yaoru and cooper 1996 the δ34s values of evaporites in the southwest china during the triassic period have a wide range from 15 to 35 but most of them are in the range of 20 and 30 lin 2003 song et al 2010 it is close to these sulfur isotope values of the triassic evaporites throughout the world claypool et al 1980 strauss 1997 besides the contribution from evaporite dissolution the high δ34s values observed here can also result from sulfur isotopic fractionation due to bacterial sulfate reduction brunner et al 2005 turchyn et al 2013 the sulfate concentration in water would reduce with the increasing δ34s values of sulfate during the process of sulfate reduction in this work there are positive correlations between sulfate concentration and δ34s values for both the surface river and the underground stream fig s2 but a minor presence of sulfate reduction could exist and alter the simple correlation it indicates that there can be minimal presence of sulfate reduction in the study area sulfate from evaporite is typically more enriched in 18o most of δ18o values in evaporites during the triassic period range between 10 and 20 claypool et al 1980 hence the δ34s value of 25 5 and the δ18o value 15 5 for evaporite are used for proportion calculation in this work table 1 oxidative weathering of sulfide is also a critical source for sulfate in river system calmels et al 2007 turchyn et al 2013 kemeny et al 2021 the sulfate derived from sulfide oxidation inherits the δ34s value of sulfide mineral the mean δ34s value of pyrite from the triassic strata around the study area is 3 0 2 2 n 18 guo 1988 li et al 2021 which has been used for the sulfide derived sulfate end member in this study for the ct and mz 1 sites the constant sulfate concentrations in the water of the underground stream fig 2d have excluded the contribution of atmospheric deposition in addition the δ34s values of sulfate in the two sites are almost kept unchanged all year round fig 2e with mean values of 2 1 0 7 and 0 8 0 7 for the ct and mz 1 sites respectively these sulfur isotope values are very close to that of the sulfide derived sulfate end member but they are deviated from the δ34s values of evaporites 25 5 suggesting that almost all sulfate at the ct and mz 1 sites is derived from oxidative weathering of sulfide besides the aerobic sulfide oxidation eq 1 anoxic sulfide oxidation occurs in anoxic environments balci et al 2007 8 fes 2 14 fe 3 8h 2 o 15 fe 2 2so 4 2 16 h this reaction leads to sulfate with all the oxygen atoms derived from water of the river hence the δ18o value of sulfate derived from sulfide oxidation depends on the proportion between aerobic and anoxic oxidation of sulfide in other words the oxygen isotopic composition of sulfate from sulfide weathering is controlled by the relative contribution between atmospheric oxygen δ18o 23 kroopnick and craig 1972 and water oxygen based on chemical and microscopic analysis gu et al 2020 suggested that global pyrite weathering is mainly controlled by atmospheric oxygen as well as fracturing and erosion and highlighted the critical role of atmospheric oxygen in aerobic sulfide oxidation however triple oxygen isotope evidence displayed that the oxygen atoms in the pyrite derived sulfate in himalayan rivers mainly originate from meteoric water hemingway et al 2020 these studies indicate that there are large uncertainties in estimating the fraction between aerobic and anoxic oxidation of sulfide in rivers hence it is difficult to determine the δ18o value of sulfide derived sulfate as the end member however there are two special sampling sites i e the ct and mz 1 sites in this work for solving this issue according to the above discussion we assumed that all sulfate at the ct and mz 1 sites is derived from oxidative weathering of sulfide in addition the δ18o value of river water in the study area mean δ18o value 8 7 is constant zhang et al 2019 the δ18o value of sulfide derived sulfate can be used to constrain the relative contributions between atmospheric oxygen and water oxygen during oxidative weathering of sulfide balci et al 2007 kohl and bao 2011 relph et al 2021 based on the δ18o values of sulfate river water and atmospheric oxygen the relative contributions of aerobic and anoxic oxidation of sulfide to riverine sulfate have been calculated for the ct and mz 1 sites the results show the proportions of anoxic sulfide oxidation to river sulfate for the ct and mz 1 sites range from 44 9 to 54 2 and from 40 4 to 43 2 respectively it means that both aerobic and anoxic oxidation of sulfide play an important role in sulfide weathering of the study area therefore the mean δ18o value of sulfate in the two sites 6 5 1 0 is assumed to be the oxygen isotopic composition of sulfide derived sulfate end member for this study table 1 the proportions of atmospheric deposition evaporite dissolution and sulfide oxidation to riverine sulfate in the study area are calculated using the beyesian isotope mixing model results show that the relative contributions of atmospheric deposition evaporite dissolution and sulfide oxidation to the surface river are 14 1 36 5 7 3 49 6 and 28 9 75 8 respectively fig 5a c and their relative contributions to the underground stream are 0 31 5 3 3 64 4 and 14 3 96 7 respectively fig 5d f from dry season to wet season the relative contributions of sulfide oxidation to riverine sulfate at the most sampling sites have increased by 2 9 to 25 5 fig 5 for most sampling sites the relative contribution of sulfide oxidation to riverine sulfate has decreased in non monsoon while the relative contribution of evaporite dissolution has decreased in monsoon fig 5 4 3 enhanced sulfide oxidation by monsoon rainfall for most sampling sites the fraction of sulfide derived sulfate to riverine sulfate is higher in the monsoon season than that in the non monsoon season indicating that the oxidative weathering of sulfide in this catchment is enhanced during the wet season in addition the variations in sulfide derived sulfate fluxes at the hz 5 cc and cq sites are closely coincided with the sulfate and hco3 fluxes with higher values in monsoon season and low values in the non monsoon season fig 6 this is further evidence of intensification of sulfide oxidation previous studies have displayed that sulfide oxidation rate has a positive relationship with physical erosion rate calmels et al 2007 torres et al 2016 due to the high rainfall in the monsoon season the river discharge has increased in wet season fig s3 resulting in an increase in rock surface weathering and erosion cai et al 2008 the new fractures and rock fragments increase the contact area between sulfide minerals and oxygen in water and air promoting a higher weathering rate of sulfide gu et al 2020 it should be noted that the ph values of rainwater mean 5 4 0 8 during the sampling period are much lower than those of the surface river mean 8 3 0 4 and the underground stream mean 7 8 0 4 fig s4 experimental studies show that pyrite oxidation rate only slightly depend on the ph value of water moses et al 1987 kohl and bao 2011 however the high rainfall with low ph values in monsoon season would lead to an increase in weathering rate of carbonate eyssautier chuine et al 2016 huang et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 the dissolved co2 produced by this weathering promotes the dissolution of iron monosulfide which is often appeared in the fractured surface of pyrite kameia and ohmotob 2000 9 fes 4h 2 o fe 2 so 4 2 4h 2 this is one of three major reactions for pyrite decomposition kameia and ohmotob 2000 apart from the high rainfall in the monsoon season the temperature may be also an important factor affecting the rate of sulfide oxidation experimental study displays that the rate of pyrite oxidation is closely related with temperature and it increases as temperature increases schoonen et al 2000 for the surface river the water temperature at the sampling sites is usually above 20 c in the monsoon season which is higher than those in the non monsoon season however the water temperature of the underground stream is kept constant all the year hence for the underground stream the influence of temperature to sulfide oxidation rate can be ruled out it means that the high rainfall in the monsoon season plays a critical in the intensification of sulfide oxidation in the karstic catchment 5 conclusions in this work chemical and sulfur and oxygen isotopic data are displayed from water samples collected monthly at 12 sampling sites in a small typical karstic catchment of southwest china the obvious seasonal variations in sulfate concentration δ34s and δ18o are observed at most of the sampling sites a beyesian isotope mixing model was used for calculating the relative contributions of atmospheric deposition evaporite dissolution and sulfide oxidation to the riverine sulfate results show that the relative contribution of sulfide oxidation to riverine sulfate is significant as whole 44 3 13 7 53 3 10 5 but has a large range in addition the increase in the fraction of sulfide oxidation in the monsoon season is mainly responsible for the seasonal variations in sulfur and oxygen isotopes the high rainfall in the monsoon season may cause an enhanced sulfide oxidation in the catchment overall this study suggests that an increase in rainfall intensity due to climate change may result in an increasing sulfide oxidation rate in the karstic region this factor is needed to be considered in the quantification of carbonate and silicate weathering fluxes used for forecasting carbon budget

2706,co2 is released to the atmosphere via sulfuric acid weathering of carbonate rocks affecting the flux of co2 drawdown via silicate weathering precisely quantifying the proportion of oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals to riverine sulfate is critical to improving the estimation of the global carbon budge sulfur and oxygen isotopic compositions of sulfate and major ion concentrations in river water samples collected monthly at 12 sampling sites from a small typical karstic catchment of southwest china were analyzed in order to quantify the relative contribution of sulfide oxidation to riverine sulfate and elucidate the factors affecting its changes results show that the sulfate concentration and δ34ssulfate and δ18osulfate values at most sampling sites have obvious seasonal changes with low values in the monsoon season and high values in the non monsoon season suggesting that the relative contributions of different sulfur sources to riverine sulfate are seasonally variable throughout of the year results from the beyesian isotope mixing model show that overall the fraction of sulfide derived sulfate to riverine sulfate ranges from 44 3 13 7 to 53 3 10 5 although it has a wide range for different sampling sites in addition the relative contribution of sulfide weathering displays a seasonal variation and is higher in the monsoon season which is mainly attributed to the influence of high rainfall in wet season this study indicates that an increase in rainfall intensity under climate change may lead to a raised sulfide oxidation rate in the karstic catchment which is important for assessment of global carbonate and silicate weathering in future keywords sulfate sulfur isotopes oxygen isotopes karst sulfide oxidation chemical weathering data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chemical weathering of crustal rocks regulates the atmospheric co2 concentration over geologic timescales and plays a critical role in the global carbon cycle and climate change walker et al 1981 gaillardet et al 1999 hilton and west 2020 the weathering of carbonate and silicate rocks consumes atmospheric co2 and is an important part of carbon sink walker et al 1981 liu et al 2010 although these chemical weathering processes are considered to be relatively well studied there remain significant uncertainties in the quantification of chemical weathering fluxes and their influences on the carbon cycle at different spatial and temporal scales one of important issues involving estimation of chemical weathering fluxes is the carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid h2so4 spence and telmer 2005 calmels et al 2007 torres et al 2014 relph et al 2021 oxidative weathering of sulfide e g pyrite generates h2so4 as following calmels et al 2007 torres et al 2014 1 4fes 2 15 o 2 14 h 2 o 4fe oh 3 8h 2 so 4 when carbonate minerals react with this h2so4 the carbon stored in sedimentary rocks is released to the ocean atmosphere system as co2 following the equations torres et al 2014 2 caco 3 h 2 so 4 co 2 g h 2 o ca 2 so 4 2 and 3 2caco 3 h 2 so 4 ca 2 so 4 2 2hco 3 thus carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid h2so4 may be regarded as a source of atmospheric co2 offsetting the co2 consumption via silicate weathering burke et al 2018 hence it is required to identify sources of riverine sulfate and calculate their relative proportions in order to quantify co2 release via sulfuric acid weathering dissolved sulfate in river may be derived from sulfide oxidation dissolution of evaporites atmospheric deposition and anthropogenic inputs mine drainage and sewage krouse and mayer 2000 stable sulfur and oxygen isotopes are useful for constraining sulfate sources in rivers because these different sulfate sources have distinct sulfur and oxygen isotope values calmels et al 2007 turchyn et al 2013 liu et al 2017 liu and han 2020 zhang et al 2020 kemeny et al 2021 relph et al 2021 the stable isotopic investigations have displayed that the proportions of sulfate derived from sulfide oxidation are 85 5 in the mackenzie river calmels et al 2007 85 7 in the kaoping river das et al 2012 100 in the headwater of the marsyandi river turchyn et al 2013 72 in the yalong river li et al 2014 74 10 in the mississippi river killingsworth et al 2018 and 62 100 in the langtang trisuli narayani river system kemeny et al 2021 while most these data are estimated based on water samples collected in the dry and wet seasons e g li et al 2014 only a few studies have investigated the seasonal variation in oxidative weathering of pyrite using high frequency sampling monthly sampling campaigns e g kemeny et al 2021 such studies may allow us to reduce uncertainties in calculation of chemical weathering fluxes from sulfuric acid dissolution and are required for better understanding biogeochemical sulfur and carbon cycles in the surface earth system and their feedback to modern global climate change in this work monthly water sampling campaigns are conducted throughout 2017 from 12 monitoring sites varying from surface river to underground stream located in a karst area of guizhou province china based on the high frequency sampling major ion chemistry as well as sulfur and oxygen isotopic compositions of sulfate in river water are analyzed in order to evaluate the seasonal changes in sulfur and oxygen isotopic compositions of sulfate partition the relative contributions of different sulfur sources to riverine sulfate and reveal the seasonal change in oxidative weathering of sulfide and its influencing factors this study would provide deeper insights into carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid and biogeochemical cycles of sulfur and carbon in river system 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the exposed karst area of south china is 0 461 million km2 jiang and yuan 1999 the houzhai catchment n 26 12 26 26 17 20 e105 40 38 105 48 13 as a typical karst catchment is located in the puding

catchment fig 1 the water source of the houzhai surface river is from the muzhudong as an outlet of the underground stream the houzhai surface river flows through the qingshan reservoir and discharges at the hz 5 site with a mean annual discharge of 2 49 107 m3 chen et al 2005 the underground stream flows from the east of the study area and discharges at the hzu site with a mean annual discharge of 2 33 107 m3 chen et al 2005 the hz 6 site as the final outlet is the confluence of the surface river and the underground stream and accounts for 95 of the total water flux in this catchment 2 2

2019 torres martínez et al 2020 the model is expressed by the follow equations parnell et al 2010 4 x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij 5 s jk n μ jk ω 2 jk 6 c jk n λ jk τ 2 jk 7 ε ij n 0 σ 2 j where x ij is the observed isotope value j of the mixture i in which i 1 2 3 n and j 1 2 3 j s jk represents source value k on isotope j which is normally distributed with mean μ jk and standard deviation ω 2 jk p k represents the relative contribution of source k which is estimated by this model c jk is the isotopic fractionation factor of isotope j on source k which is normally distributed with mean λ jk and standard deviation τ jk and ε ij is the residual error denoting the additional unquantified variation in individual mixtures which is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation σ 2 j the details of this model can be obtained from parnell et al 2010 in this work the mean sulfur isotope values of different sulfur sources μ jk and their standard deviation ω 2 jk are listed in table 1 it is assumed that the riverine sulfate in this study is mainly derived from atmospheric deposition evaporite dissolution and sulfide oxidation 3 results the chemical and isotopic data of surface river and underground stream in the houzhai catchment are listed in table s1 and table s2 respectively the main statistical parameters of chemical and isotopic data for the 12 sampling sites are displayed in table 2 the temperature in water of surface river varies from 8 6 to 28 2 c during the sampling period while it has narrow variations in underground stream ranging from 13 0 to 20 5 c for the year of 2017 the ph value of water in the surface river ranges from 7 5 to 9 5 with a mean value of 8 3 0 4 the ph value of water in the underground stream varies between 7 1 and 8 6 with a mean value of 7 8 0 4 the ca2 and mg2 concentrations in the surface river range from 0 9 to 3 4 mmol l mean 1 9 0 6 mmol l and from 0 5 to 1 5 mmol l mean 0 9 0 2 mmol l respectively the ca2 and mg2 account for 80 of the total cationic budget the ca2 and mg2 are also major cations in the underground stream with mean values of 2 5 0 8 and 1 1 0 4 mmol l respectively both the surface river water and the underground stream water have high hco3 concentrations varying from 1 8 to 4 7 mmol l and from 3 3 to 5 2 mmol l respectively the sulfate concentration in the surface river water varies from 0 4 to 2 4 mmol l having a mean value of 0 9 0 5 mmol l the sulfate concentrations at mz 5 hy 3 dz and hz 6 sites have obvious seasonal variations fig 2a with low values in wet season and high values in dry season the sulfate concentration in the underground stream water has a wide variation ranging from 0 2 to 4 7 mmol l the sulfate concentrations at hzu lht cc and cq sites also display a similar seasonal change while they remain constant throughout of the year at ct and mz 1 sites with mean values of 0 26 0 03 mmol l and 0 65 0 06 mmol l respectively fig 2d the δ34s and δ18o values of sulfate in the surface river range from 0 3 to 18 2 and from 5 6 to 12 6 respectively the δ34s and δ18o values at the hz 6 dz hy 3 and mz 5 sites have significant seasonal changes with low values in wet season mean δ34s value 7 6 3 2 and mean δ18o value 8 8 1 1 and high values in dry season mean δ34s value 12 4 4 6 and mean δ18o value 10 6 0 9 in addition the δ34s and δ18o values of sulfate in the underground stream vary from 2 9 to 25 8 and from 4 0 to 16 5 respectively the seasonal variations in sulfur and oxygen isotopes have also been observed at the huz lht cc and cq sites fig 2e f however the δ34s and δ18o values at the ct and mz 1 sites remain almost unchanged for the whole year with mean δ34s values of 2 1 0 7 n 9 and 0 8 0 7 n 9 as well as mean δ18o values of 5 7 0 8 n 9 and 7 4 0 2 n 9 for the two sites respectively 4 discussion 4 1 chemical weathering of rocks in the houzhai catchment chemical composition of rivers is mainly controlled by lithologies silicate carbonate and evaporite weathering could result in distinctly different elemental ratios ca2 na hco3 na mg2 na respectively gaillardet et al 1999 the elemental ratios between hco3 na and ca2 na in water samples of the surface river and the underground stream in this study are close to the end member of carbonate weathering fig 3a and fig 3c suggesting that the dissolved load of water is mainly derived from the weathering of carbonate rocks it is also confirmed by the elemental ratios of mg2 na and ca2 na fig 3b and fig 3d this is consistent with the fact that the exposed rocks in the study area are mainly carbonate rocks hco3 is the most abundant anion in the study area carbonate mineral dissolution by carbonic acid would lead to water chemistry featured with hco3 ca2 mg2 equivalent ratio of 1 0 based on the stoichiometry however the hco3 ca2 mg2 equivalent ratios observed in this work are much lower than 1 0 fig s1a b actually the addition sulfate ion is required for maintaining the ionic balance fig s1c d it indicates that sulfide oxidation and or gypsum dissolution are important chemical processes in this catchment 4 2 sources of sulfate to the surface river and the underground stream the distinct seasonal changes in δ34s and δ18o are observed at the hz 6 dz hy 3 and mz 5 sites for sulfate in the surface river and at the at the huz lht cc and cq sites for sulfate in the underground stream respectively fig 2 it may suggest that the relative contributions of different sulfur sources to riverine sulfate have a seasonal variation potential sources of sulfate are discussed and estimated in order to elucidate the seasonal changes in sulfur and oxygen isotopes the contribution of mine drainage and industrial sewage to riverine sulfate has been neglected in this study because the study area is a typical agricultural small catchment without industries hence atmospheric deposition dissolution of evaporites and sulfide oxidation are considered to be the main possible sources of riverine sulfate in this work atmospheric deposition could be an important source to riverine sulfate in general the relative contribution of sulfate from rainwater to river ranges from 5 to 30 but sometimes may reach up to 75 gaillardet et al 1999 moquet et al 2011 li et al 2014 relph et al 2021 it is observed that the sulfate concentrations in the sampling sites of the surface river the hz 6 dz hy 3 and mz 5 sites and the underground stream the hzu lht cc and cq sites have decreased significantly during the wet season from june to october fig 2 a and d due to the dilution effect of rainwater it may suggest that the sulfate in water collected from these sampling sites is influenced by atmospheric sulfate deposition it should be noted that the sulfate concentrations at the ct and mz 1 sites for the underground stream remain constant throughout of the year indicating that the relative contribution of atmospheric deposition to the underground stream is extremely low at these two sampling sites in the study area the sulfate concentration in rain water ranges from 0 01 to 0 66 mmol l with a mean value of 0 12 0 13 mmol l yan et al 2020 the mean δ34s and δ18o values of sulfate in rain during the monsoon period are 4 1 6 4 and 9 6 1 7 respectively yan et al 2020 however their mean values δ34s and δ18o during the non monsoon period are 3 4 3 4 and 12 4 1 6 respectively yan et al 2020 in this study it assumes that the water residence time is lower than 2 3 months considering the seasonal variations in sulfur and oxygen isotopes of rainwater sulfate the corresponding sulfur and oxygen isotope values are selected as an end member for calculating the relative contribution of atmospheric inputs to river in the monsoon and non monsoon period respectively table 1 the riverine sulfate with high δ34s and δ18o values in the study area fig 4 most likely originates from evaporite minerals previous study reported that near to the puding county the limestone intercalated with the gypsum occurs in the guanling formation of the middle triassic strata yaoru and cooper 1996 the δ34s values of evaporites in the southwest china during the triassic period have a wide range from 15 to 35 but most of them are in the range of 20 and 30 lin 2003 song et al 2010 it is close to these sulfur isotope values of the triassic evaporites throughout the world claypool et al 1980 strauss 1997 besides the contribution from evaporite dissolution the high δ34s values observed here can also result from sulfur isotopic fractionation due to bacterial sulfate reduction brunner et al 2005 turchyn et al 2013 the sulfate concentration in water would reduce with the increasing δ34s values of sulfate during the process of sulfate reduction in this work there are positive correlations between sulfate concentration and δ34s values for both the surface river and the underground stream fig s2 but a minor presence of sulfate reduction could exist and alter the simple correlation it indicates that there can be minimal presence of sulfate reduction in the study area sulfate from evaporite is typically more enriched in 18o most of δ18o values in evaporites during the triassic period range between 10 and 20 claypool et al 1980 hence the δ34s value of 25 5 and the δ18o value 15 5 for evaporite are used for proportion calculation in this work table 1 oxidative weathering of sulfide is also a critical source for sulfate in river system calmels et al 2007 turchyn et al 2013 kemeny et al 2021 the sulfate derived from sulfide oxidation inherits the δ34s value of sulfide mineral the mean δ34s value of pyrite from the triassic strata around the study area is 3 0 2 2 n 18 guo 1988 li et al 2021 which has been used for the sulfide derived sulfate end member in this study for the ct and mz 1 sites the constant sulfate concentrations in the water of the underground stream fig 2d have excluded the contribution of atmospheric deposition in addition the δ34s values of sulfate in the two sites are almost kept unchanged all year round fig 2e with mean values of 2 1 0 7 and 0 8 0 7 for the ct and mz 1 sites respectively these sulfur isotope values are very close to that of the sulfide derived sulfate end member but they are deviated from the δ34s values of evaporites 25 5 suggesting that almost all sulfate at the ct and mz 1 sites is derived from oxidative weathering of sulfide besides the aerobic sulfide oxidation eq 1 anoxic sulfide oxidation occurs in anoxic environments balci et al 2007 8 fes 2 14 fe 3 8h 2 o 15 fe 2 2so 4 2 16 h this reaction leads to sulfate with all the oxygen atoms derived from water of the river hence the δ18o value of sulfate derived from sulfide oxidation depends on the proportion between aerobic and anoxic oxidation of sulfide in other words the oxygen isotopic composition of sulfate from sulfide weathering is controlled by the relative contribution between atmospheric oxygen δ18o 23 kroopnick and craig 1972 and water oxygen based on chemical and microscopic analysis gu et al 2020 suggested that global pyrite weathering is mainly controlled by atmospheric oxygen as well as fracturing and erosion and highlighted the critical role of atmospheric oxygen in aerobic sulfide oxidation however triple oxygen isotope evidence displayed that the oxygen atoms in the pyrite derived sulfate in himalayan rivers mainly originate from meteoric water hemingway et al 2020 these studies indicate that there are large uncertainties in estimating the fraction between aerobic and anoxic oxidation of sulfide in rivers hence it is difficult to determine the δ18o value of sulfide derived sulfate as the end member however there are two special sampling sites i e the ct and mz 1 sites in this work for solving this issue according to the above discussion we assumed that all sulfate at the ct and mz 1 sites is derived from oxidative weathering of sulfide in addition the δ18o value of river water in the study area mean δ18o value 8 7 is constant zhang et al 2019 the δ18o value of sulfide derived sulfate can be used to constrain the relative contributions between atmospheric oxygen and water oxygen during oxidative weathering of sulfide balci et al 2007 kohl and bao 2011 relph et al 2021 based on the δ18o values of sulfate river water and atmospheric oxygen the relative contributions of aerobic and anoxic oxidation of sulfide to riverine sulfate have been calculated for the ct and mz 1 sites the results show the proportions of anoxic sulfide oxidation to river sulfate for the ct and mz 1 sites range from 44 9 to 54 2 and from 40 4 to 43 2 respectively it means that both aerobic and anoxic oxidation of sulfide play an important role in sulfide weathering of the study area therefore the mean δ18o value of sulfate in the two sites 6 5 1 0 is assumed to be the oxygen isotopic composition of sulfide derived sulfate end member for this study table 1 the proportions of atmospheric deposition evaporite dissolution and sulfide oxidation to riverine sulfate in the study area are calculated using the beyesian isotope mixing model results show that the relative contributions of atmospheric deposition evaporite dissolution and sulfide oxidation to the surface river are 14 1 36 5 7 3 49 6 and 28 9 75 8 respectively fig 5a c and their relative contributions to the underground stream are 0 31 5 3 3 64 4 and 14 3 96 7 respectively fig 5d f from dry season to wet season the relative contributions of sulfide oxidation to riverine sulfate at the most sampling sites have increased by 2 9 to 25 5 fig 5 for most sampling sites the relative contribution of sulfide oxidation to riverine sulfate has decreased in non monsoon while the relative contribution of evaporite dissolution has decreased in monsoon fig 5 4 3 enhanced sulfide oxidation by monsoon rainfall for most sampling sites the fraction of sulfide derived sulfate to riverine sulfate is higher in the monsoon season than that in the non monsoon season indicating that the oxidative weathering of sulfide in this catchment is enhanced during the wet season in addition the variations in sulfide derived sulfate fluxes at the hz 5 cc and cq sites are closely coincided with the sulfate and hco3 fluxes with higher values in monsoon season and low values in the non monsoon season fig 6 this is further evidence of intensification of sulfide oxidation previous studies have displayed that sulfide oxidation rate has a positive relationship with physical erosion rate calmels et al 2007 torres et al 2016 due to the high rainfall in the monsoon season the river discharge has increased in wet season fig s3 resulting in an increase in rock surface weathering and erosion cai et al 2008 the new fractures and rock fragments increase the contact area between sulfide minerals and oxygen in water and air promoting a higher weathering rate of sulfide gu et al 2020 it should be noted that the ph values of rainwater mean 5 4 0 8 during the sampling period are much lower than those of the surface river mean 8 3 0 4 and the underground stream mean 7 8 0 4 fig s4 experimental studies show that pyrite oxidation rate only slightly depend on the ph value of water moses et al 1987 kohl and bao 2011 however the high rainfall with low ph values in monsoon season would lead to an increase in weathering rate of carbonate eyssautier chuine et al 2016 huang et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 the dissolved co2 produced by this weathering promotes the dissolution of iron monosulfide which is often appeared in the fractured surface of pyrite kameia and ohmotob 2000 9 fes 4h 2 o fe 2 so 4 2 4h 2 this is one of three major reactions for pyrite decomposition kameia and ohmotob 2000 apart from the high rainfall in the monsoon season the temperature may be also an important factor affecting the rate of sulfide oxidation experimental study displays that the rate of pyrite oxidation is closely related with temperature and it increases as temperature increases schoonen et al 2000 for the surface river the water temperature at the sampling sites is usually above 20 c in the monsoon season which is higher than those in the non monsoon season however the water temperature of the underground stream is kept constant all the year hence for the underground stream the influence of temperature to sulfide oxidation rate can be ruled out it means that the high rainfall in the monsoon season plays a critical in the intensification of sulfide oxidation in the karstic catchment 5 conclusions in this work chemical and sulfur and oxygen isotopic data are displayed from water samples collected monthly at 12 sampling sites in a small typical karstic catchment of southwest china the obvious seasonal variations in sulfate concentration δ34s and δ18o are observed at most of the sampling sites a beyesian isotope mixing model was used for calculating the relative contributions of atmospheric deposition evaporite dissolution and sulfide oxidation to the riverine sulfate results show that the relative contribution of sulfide oxidation to riverine sulfate is significant as whole 44 3 13 7 53 3 10 5 but has a large range in addition the increase in the fraction of sulfide oxidation in the monsoon season is mainly responsible for the seasonal variations in sulfur and oxygen isotopes the high rainfall in the monsoon season may cause an enhanced sulfide oxidation in the catchment overall this study suggests that an increase in rainfall intensity due to climate change may result in an increasing sulfide oxidation rate in the karstic region this factor is needed to be considered in the quantification of carbonate and silicate weathering fluxes used for forecasting carbon budget

2707,the water table fluctuations can cause a reciprocating advection of soil gas in the vertical direction known as vadose zone breathing in this study we developed a vadose zone breathing facilitated vapor intrusion vi model and applied it to evaluate the influence of napl non aqueous phase liquid impacted soils the developed model was first validated with data from previously conducted sand tank experiments and then used to simulate vi scenarios involving different fluctuation amplitudes and periods of the water table soil types building structures and source depths our results suggest that within one month of vadose zone breathing amplitude of 0 5 m and period of 4 d the indoor pollutant concentration varies by approximately seven orders of magnitude and the averaged concentration is nearly nine times larger than the steady state concentration the results also show that with the increase of mean soil particle size the indoor pollutant concentration tends to increase and becomes more sensitive to vadose zone breathing compared to the basement foundation buildings with a slab on grade foundation are less susceptible when the source depth exceeds 10 m the source depth plays an insignificant influence our findings highlight that vadose zone breathing can promote the vi risks of buildings with a basement foundation at sites with shallow water tables significant groundwater fluctuations and coarse textural soils keywords vapor intrusion residual napl groundwater fluctuation vadose zone breathing numerical model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction at sites contaminated by volatile organic compounds vocs contaminant soil gas can migrate into occupied buildings to threaten the health of residents a process known as vapor intrusion vi ma et al 2018 mchugh et al 2017 there are two major types of vi sources i e groundwater containing dissolved contaminants and napl non aqueous phase liquid impacted soils mcalary et al 2011 the latter is usually caused by the accumulation of napl floating on the water table or disseminated within the capillary fringe soucy and mumford 2017 yao et al 2019 which is believed to cause a much more significant vi risk as it usually represents a stronger vapor source verginelli et al 2016 in most vi studies the risk assessment for napl sources above the water table is the same as that for contaminated groundwater sources assuming an upward diffusion of vapors from subsurface sources johnson and ettinger 1991 man et al 2022 tillman and weaver 2005 verginelli and yao 2021 however soucy and mumford 2017 reported that the voc mass flux resulting from bubble facilitated transport increased with the supply of dissolved gas which was orders of magnitude higher than that under diffusion limited conditions ma et al 2019 also claimed that the diffusion limited model overestimated the completion time of mass transfer and underestimated the attenuation of pollutant concentrations to this end they developed an analytical bubble facilitated vi model however a constant water table was assumed in these studies which is inappropriate because the residual napl zones are usually induced by water table fluctuations he et al 2022 mclean and bledsoe 1992 groundwater fluctuations can induce temporal variations in the soil moisture content above the water table chen and hu 2004 guo 2015 qi et al 2020 qi et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 as a result the location of napl sources relative to the moving water table or capillary fringe has a significant impact on assessing site specific vi risk gupta et al 2019 yao et al 2019 guo et al 2019 revealed that for dissolved voc sources the oscillatory water table enhanced volatilization potential mainly in two ways changing the transport pathway and delivering the dissolved vocs to vadose zone soils moreover during water table fluctuations reciprocating advection of soil gas can be produced in the vertical direction known as vadose zone breathing especially in a coastal subsurface system with tidal variations jeng et al 2005 jiao and li 2004 such advection could play a significant role in the transport of soil gas released from napl sources through a one dimensional organic vapor transport model choi and smith 2005 compared the voc diffusive and advective fluxes under water table fluctuations the results indicated that the water table with a fluctuation amplitude of 0 1 m affected the advective flux as significantly as atmospheric pressure changes joun et al 2016 pointed out that compared to contaminated groundwater sources residual trichloroethylene tce sources produced slower response times but higher and longer lasting gas concentrations with oscillatory water tables among the recently reported studies zhang et al 2021 developed a two dimensional numerical model to explore the influence of groundwater table fluctuations on voc transport in the vadose zone man et al 2021 investigated the effect of vadose zone breathing on vi from groundwater contamination through numerical simulations these two works were conducted on dissolved phase groundwater plume and the location of the vapor source fluctuates with the water table on the other hand the location of the smear zone or a residual napl is relatively constant independent of the water table fluctuation qi et al 2020 formulated a one dimensional nonequilibrium multiphase flow model to simulate the release of voc from groundwater to the atmosphere in which the dnapl source was not above the groundwater table to better understand the role of vadose zone breathing in vi from a residual napl zone which is above the groundwater table at most moments we developed a two dimensional numerical model to simulate transient soil gas pollutant concentrations and corresponding indoor concentrations the model was first validated with the sandbox experimental data from joun et al 2016 and then applied to modeling vi scenarios with different water table fluctuations soil types building structures and source depths 2 methods 2 1 conceptual model in this study we considered the transport of tce impacted soil gas into the building within one month of vadose zone breathing where two building structures with a 2 m depth basement foundation or 0 2 m depth slab on grade foundation were involved in fig 1 we depict the schematic diagram and boundary conditions of the conceptual vi model using the building with a basement foundation as an example the study area was 24 m in length and 24 m in width and was built with a 10 m 10 m foundation there was a 0 15 m 0 001 m foundation crack which allowed soil gas to enter the building the pressure difference between the crack entrance and atmosphere is set to 5 pa here we assume a residual source with the gaseous tce concentration of 1 mol m3 located at the initial water table also the highest water table to achieve the maximum reasonable exposure concentration which is a common practice in vi risk assessment the residual source in the vadose zone is a belt zone in most actual fields in our simulations the belt zone was considered as a continuously released vapor source and used as the lower boundary represented by a line in the conceptual model since the study area is centrosymmetric about the building we only consider a quarter of the actual area in the simulations considering that tce is difficult to biodegrade under aerobic conditions kurt and spain 2013 ma et al 2020 usepa 2012 biodegradation was not considered in this study moreover we assumed that the system is isothermal and the solid liquid gas phase reaches equilibrium in the subsurface environment which is also the assumption generally adopted by most vi models costanza robinson et al 2013 luo et al 2015 yao et al 2013 2 2 governing equations of soil water and gas transport in our study comsol multiphysics multiphysics 1998 cross platform software for finite element analysis solver and multiphysics simulation was employed to simulate soil water and gas transport facilitated by vadose zone breathing in the process of vadose zone breathing the vertical movement of soil water and gas is dominant when the water table starts fluctuations the unsaturated flow in the soil can be simulated by richards equation richards 1931 i e 1 θ w h t k h h k h z where is the laplace operator t is the time t z is the vertical spatial coordinate l θ w h lwater 3 lsoil 3 and k h l t are the volumetric soil water content and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in the form of the pressure head h l the relationship of which can be characterized by the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 for the napl impacted soil vi scenario the residual source is above the groundwater table at most moments and thus the migration process of dissolved phase napl is neglected in our simulations the residual napl in the vadose zone was considered as a continuously released vapor source the transport process of which can be described by the advection diffusion equations 2 θ g θ w h k oc f oc ρ b h c g t c g q g d eff c g where h is henry s law constant θ g is

are presented in table 1 in this study vi scenarios involving different fluctuation amplitudes and periods of the water table soil types and source depths were investigated specifically five amplitudes i e a 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 m and periods i e t 1 2 4 5 and 10 d were set twelve textural soils with different mean soil particle sizes were examined and the corresponding hydraulic parameters are presented in table s1 the source depth included 5 7 10 15 and 20 m 2 4 calculation of indoor pollutant concentrations assuming the building is a well mixed continuously stirred tank the

a sandbox experiment to simulate the soil gas transport in tce impacted soils with oscillatory water table the sandbox was 0 6 m in length 0 5 m in height and 0 04 m in width and was filled with jumunjin sand fig 2 initially 0 5 ml of free phase tce was injected using a glass syringe with a septum x 20 cm z 15 cm after the sandbox was saturated the water table of the lower boundary varied from 0 to 10 cm the gaseous tce was sampled using a 5 μl gas tight syringe every 5 min the soil hydraulic parameters used in the simulation were obtained in the laboratory and the specific values can be found in table s2 to validate the developed model the simulations were compared with the experimental data from joun et al 2016 fig 3 where two cycles of vadose zone breathing with a fluctuation amplitude of 10 cm were studied the simulation results can generally reflect the observed variation of gaseous tce concentration and the simulation errors are within half an order of magnitude the agreement between simulations and observations demonstrates the rationality of the developed model in simulating soil water and gas transport in napl impacted soils we also note that the gaseous tce concentration is contrary to the fluctuation trend of the water table there are two potential mechanisms that can be used to explain this phenomenon due to the declining water table high concentrations of dissolved vocs are directly exposed to soil air resulting in a surge of vocs emissions in vadose zone soils on the other hand the high water saturation in the vadose zone makes the response of surface soil concentration to the decrease of water table relatively lagging an evidence for the concentration delay response can be found in fig 5 this phenomenon was also observed in the vi scenario of contaminated groundwater sources man et al 2021 the difference is that when the water table returns to 0 cm the depth at the beginning the tce soil gas concentrations decrease in the contaminated groundwater source scenario see fig 3 of man et al 2021 while for the tce impacted soil scenario the concentration remains almost unchanged this is because tce impacted soils continue to produce upward contaminant fluxes regardless of the decreasing water table 3 2 temporal variations of gaseous tce concentration distribution and indoor pollutant concentration fig 4 shows the distribution of gaseous tce concentration at different times of the last vadose zone breathing cycle compared to the steady state distribution fig 4a i e the soil gas concentration profile at the beginning of the simulation the gaseous tce concentrations fluctuate significantly within one cycle fig 4b shows the gaseous tce concentration distribution when the water table is located at the lowest as the water table rises fig 4c and d the soil gas is driven by the rising water from the pore space causing a decrease in gaseous tce concentration near the water table 5 m z 4 m in the following two days fig 4e and f the water table drops and the soil gas is inhaled into the deep soil with a gradual rise in the gaseous tce concentration fig 5 plots the temporal variations of indoor tce concentrations the initial indoor tce concentration c in is 1 27e 5 mol m3 when the water table fluctuates the indoor tce concentration varies drastically up to seven orders of magnitude within a month on the whole the averaged c in value is 1 14e 4 mol m3 nearly nine times larger than the initial concentration suggesting that the fluctuation of the water table could increase vi risks zhang et al 2021 showed that periodic water table fluctuations could increase gaseous tce concentrations at building foundation cracks we also note that the indoor tce concentration does not vary synchronously with the water table depth for example during the first two days the water table continues to decline while the indoor tce concentration first decreases and then increases this is because when the water table falls it induces a downward advection flux allowing indoor air to enter the soil through the foundation cracks on the other hand the water table drop also enhances the upward diffusion flux increasing the tce concentration guo 2015 found a slight delay between the gaseous pollutant concentration and the water table through sand tank experiments 3 3 influence of the fluctuation amplitude and period on the attenuation coefficient of the contaminated soil to indoor tce concentration α is the normalized indoor pollutant concentration defined as the concentration ratio of the indoor tce to the contamination source considering that the indoor tce concentration varies over time we adopted the averaged α in the last simulation circle to evaluate the influence of the fluctuation amplitude and period fig 6 presents the averaged α calculated from the vi scenarios with different amplitudes i e a 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 m and periods i e t 1 2 4 5 and 10 d where two types of soils sand and silt and building foundations basement and slab on grade are involved regardless of the foundation type and soil texture tested here the averaged α value increases with the fluctuation amplitude fig 6a and b and decreases with the fluctuation period fig 6c and d respectively for buildings with a basement foundation the averaged α value of sand is 2 37e 4 with the amplitude of 0 5 m and period of 4 d under otherwise the same conditions the averaged α value with an amplitude of 0 01 m is one order of magnitude lower than the original value and the averaged α value with a fluctuation period of 10 d is half of the original value the shorter fluctuation period means the higher fluctuation frequency the reciprocal of the fluctuation period of the water table which may lead to the enhancement of soil gas transport this finding was also observed by zhang et al 2021 who reported that a higher concentration at the crack was induced by the higher amplitude and the shorter period of groundwater table fluctuations the results remind us to be careful when assessing vi risks at sites with significant vadose zone breathing such as coastal areas liu et al 2021 compared to the slab on grade foundation buildings with a basement foundation are more vulnerable to vi risks as indicated by the larger averaged α this is because the basement bottom is located deeper than a slab on grade construction such buildings tend to be associated with a shorter diffusion distance of soil gas reducing mass flux loss during the diffusion process 3 4 influence of the soil texture on the attenuation coefficient of the contaminated soil to indoor tce concentration β is defined as the indoor tce concentration ratio between scenarios with oscillatory and static water tables a larger β value means that the indoor tce concentration is more susceptible to vadose zone breathing fig 7 presents the averaged α and β values calculated from vi scenarios with different soil types represented by the mean soil particle size the averaged α is the highest with sand 2 37e 4 for the basement foundation and 4 24e 5 for the slab on grade foundation and is the lowest with clay loam 3 07e 6 for the basement foundation and 6 11e 7 for the slab on grade foundation as the mean soil particle size increases the averaged α tends to increase and becomes more sensitive to water table fluctuations larger soil particle sizes usually mean more macropores which are more conducive to soil gas transport jury and horton 2004 yao et al 2017 claimed that soils with coarser particles allowed more significant soil gas advection when the mean soil particle size is less than 0 25 mm however no linear relationship exists between the averaged α and the soil particle size this is because the transport of soil gas is closely related to the soil water content shen et al 2013 which is jointly determined by the particle size and distribution parameters in the soil water retention curve assouline et al 1998 arthur et al 2012 pointed out that the particle and pore size distribution parameters were correlated with the soil gas transport properties β has a similar variation trend to the averaged α regardless of the building foundation type this is not hard to understand from the definition of β for buildings with a basement foundation the β value of the sand soil can be as high as approximately 18 7 and the β values of the other soils range from 1 to 3 which indicates that the water table fluctuation can significantly increase the indoor tce concentration under the current fluctuation amplitude and period i e a 0 5 m and t 4 d this is not always true for buildings with a slab on grade foundation except for the sand soil the β values of the other soils float around 1 this suggests that compared to the basement foundation buildings with a slab on grade foundation are less susceptible to water table fluctuations 3 5 influence of the contamination source depth on the attenuation coefficient of the contaminated soil to indoor tce concentration fig 8 plots the averaged α and β values against the contamination source depth for the two foundation types when the contamination source depth ranges from 5 to 10 m the averaged α of the basement foundation decreases from 2 37e 4 to 1 32e 5 for the slab on grade foundation the averaged α decreases from 4 24e 5 to 4 55e 6 thus a similar conclusion can be drawn from these two scenarios more attenuation represented by the smaller averaged α is observed with the increase of contamination source depth this finding is consistent with the soil gas transport mechanism as reported by johnston and gibson 2013 the deeper the contamination source the longer vertical distance between the building and the source resulting in more resistance to the upward diffusion of soil gases yao et al 2018 argued that for the groundwater contamination source the primary resistance to the upward soil gas flow is the capillary fringe when the source depth exceeds 10 m the averaged α remains almost unchanged suggesting that the source depth plays an insignificant influence this can also be seen from the β values which are close to 1 at this time the fluctuation of the water table does not affect the indoor tce concentration 4 conclusions this study provides valuable insights into the influence of vadose zone breathing on vapor intrusion vi from napl impacted soils where different fluctuation amplitudes and periods of the water table soil types building structures and source depths were involved our results show that for sites with significant water table fluctuations represented by large amplitudes and short periods vadose zone breathing can promote vi risks specifically with an amplitude of 0 5 m and a period of 4 d the variation range of indoor pollutant concentration is approximately seven orders of magnitude within one month and the averaged concentration is nearly nine times larger than the steady state concentration this is especially true for coarse textural soils and buildings with a basement foundation we also note that when the source depth exceeds a certain threshold i e 10 m in our cases the source depth plays an insignificant influence on vi risks as a result vadose zone breathing associated with soil types building structures and source depth should be taken into consideration when evaluating the vi risks of napl impacted soils preferential pathways such as permeable soil backfill and plant root systems are widespread in vadose zone soils jarvis et al 2016 unnithan et al 2021 in the presence of preferential pathways the unsaturated flow processes due to vadose zone breathing are also altered thus affecting the transport of soil gases however this was not considered in our model which will be explored in future studies another limitation is that the numerical model was developed for scenarios involving single family residences and its applicability needs to be further tested when multiple residences or even different building types are involved credit authorship contribution statement jun man conceptualization methodology writing original draft

2707,the water table fluctuations can cause a reciprocating advection of soil gas in the vertical direction known as vadose zone breathing in this study we developed a vadose zone breathing facilitated vapor intrusion vi model and applied it to evaluate the influence of napl non aqueous phase liquid impacted soils the developed model was first validated with data from previously conducted sand tank experiments and then used to simulate vi scenarios involving different fluctuation amplitudes and periods of the water table soil types building structures and source depths our results suggest that within one month of vadose zone breathing amplitude of 0 5 m and period of 4 d the indoor pollutant concentration varies by approximately seven orders of magnitude and the averaged concentration is nearly nine times larger than the steady state concentration the results also show that with the increase of mean soil particle size the indoor pollutant concentration tends to increase and becomes more sensitive to vadose zone breathing compared to the basement foundation buildings with a slab on grade foundation are less susceptible when the source depth exceeds 10 m the source depth plays an insignificant influence our findings highlight that vadose zone breathing can promote the vi risks of buildings with a basement foundation at sites with shallow water tables significant groundwater fluctuations and coarse textural soils keywords vapor intrusion residual napl groundwater fluctuation vadose zone breathing numerical model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction at sites contaminated by volatile organic compounds vocs contaminant soil gas can migrate into occupied buildings to threaten the health of residents a process known as vapor intrusion vi ma et al 2018 mchugh et al 2017 there are two major types of vi sources i e groundwater containing dissolved contaminants and napl non aqueous phase liquid impacted soils mcalary et al 2011 the latter is usually caused by the accumulation of napl floating on the water table or disseminated within the capillary fringe soucy and mumford 2017 yao et al 2019 which is believed to cause a much more significant vi risk as it usually represents a stronger vapor source verginelli et al 2016 in most vi studies the risk assessment for napl sources above the water table is the same as that for contaminated groundwater sources assuming an upward diffusion of vapors from subsurface sources johnson and ettinger 1991 man et al 2022 tillman and weaver 2005 verginelli and yao 2021 however soucy and mumford 2017 reported that the voc mass flux resulting from bubble facilitated transport increased with the supply of dissolved gas which was orders of magnitude higher than that under diffusion limited conditions ma et al 2019 also claimed that the diffusion limited model overestimated the completion time of mass transfer and underestimated the attenuation of pollutant concentrations to this end they developed an analytical bubble facilitated vi model however a constant water table was assumed in these studies which is inappropriate because the residual napl zones are usually induced by water table fluctuations he et al 2022 mclean and bledsoe 1992 groundwater fluctuations can induce temporal variations in the soil moisture content above the water table chen and hu 2004 guo 2015 qi et al 2020 qi et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 as a result the location of napl sources relative to the moving water table or capillary fringe has a significant impact on assessing site specific vi risk gupta et al 2019 yao et al 2019 guo et al 2019 revealed that for dissolved voc sources the oscillatory water table enhanced volatilization potential mainly in two ways changing the transport pathway and delivering the dissolved vocs to vadose zone soils moreover during water table fluctuations reciprocating advection of soil gas can be produced in the vertical direction known as vadose zone breathing especially in a coastal subsurface system with tidal variations jeng et al 2005 jiao and li 2004 such advection could play a significant role in the transport of soil gas released from napl sources through a one dimensional organic vapor transport model choi and smith 2005 compared the voc diffusive and advective fluxes under water table fluctuations the results indicated that the water table with a fluctuation amplitude of 0 1 m affected the advective flux as significantly as atmospheric pressure changes joun et al 2016 pointed out that compared to contaminated groundwater sources residual trichloroethylene tce sources produced slower response times but higher and longer lasting gas concentrations with oscillatory water tables among the recently reported studies zhang et al 2021 developed a two dimensional numerical model to explore the influence of groundwater table fluctuations on voc transport in the vadose zone man et al 2021 investigated the effect of vadose zone breathing on vi from groundwater contamination through numerical simulations these two works were conducted on dissolved phase groundwater plume and the location of the vapor source fluctuates with the water table on the other hand the location of the smear zone or a residual napl is relatively constant independent of the water table fluctuation qi et al 2020 formulated a one dimensional nonequilibrium multiphase flow model to simulate the release of voc from groundwater to the atmosphere in which the dnapl source was not above the groundwater table to better understand the role of vadose zone breathing in vi from a residual napl zone which is above the groundwater table at most moments we developed a two dimensional numerical model to simulate transient soil gas pollutant concentrations and corresponding indoor concentrations the model was first validated with the sandbox experimental data from joun et al 2016 and then applied to modeling vi scenarios with different water table fluctuations soil types building structures and source depths 2 methods 2 1 conceptual model in this study we considered the transport of tce impacted soil gas into the building within one month of vadose zone breathing where two building structures with a 2 m depth basement foundation or 0 2 m depth slab on grade foundation were involved in fig 1 we depict the schematic diagram and boundary conditions of the conceptual vi model using the building with a basement foundation as an example the study area was 24 m in length and 24 m in width and was built with a 10 m 10 m foundation there was a 0 15 m 0 001 m foundation crack which allowed soil gas to enter the building the pressure difference between the crack entrance and atmosphere is set to 5 pa here we assume a residual source with the gaseous tce concentration of 1 mol m3 located at the initial water table also the highest water table to achieve the maximum reasonable exposure concentration which is a common practice in vi risk assessment the residual source in the vadose zone is a belt zone in most actual fields in our simulations the belt zone was considered as a continuously released vapor source and used as the lower boundary represented by a line in the conceptual model since the study area is centrosymmetric about the building we only consider a quarter of the actual area in the simulations considering that tce is difficult to biodegrade under aerobic conditions kurt and spain 2013 ma et al 2020 usepa 2012 biodegradation was not considered in this study moreover we assumed that the system is isothermal and the solid liquid gas phase reaches equilibrium in the subsurface environment which is also the assumption generally adopted by most vi models costanza robinson et al 2013 luo et al 2015 yao et al 2013 2 2 governing equations of soil water and gas transport in our study comsol multiphysics multiphysics 1998 cross platform software for finite element analysis solver and multiphysics simulation was employed to simulate soil water and gas transport facilitated by vadose zone breathing in the process of vadose zone breathing the vertical movement of soil water and gas is dominant when the water table starts fluctuations the unsaturated flow in the soil can be simulated by richards equation richards 1931 i e 1 θ w h t k h h k h z where is the laplace operator t is the time t z is the vertical spatial coordinate l θ w h lwater 3 lsoil 3 and k h l t are the volumetric soil water content and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in the form of the pressure head h l the relationship of which can be characterized by the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 for the napl impacted soil vi scenario the residual source is above the groundwater table at most moments and thus the migration process of dissolved phase napl is neglected in our simulations the residual napl in the vadose zone was considered as a continuously released vapor source the transport process of which can be described by the advection diffusion equations 2 θ g θ w h k oc f oc ρ b h c g t c g q g d eff c g where h is henry s law constant θ g is

fluctuation amplitude l and t is the fluctuation period t the default values of fluctuation amplitude and period were 0 5 m and 4 d respectively the other boundary conditions of the developed model are presented in table 1 in this study vi scenarios involving different fluctuation amplitudes and periods of the water table soil types and source depths were investigated specifically five amplitudes i e a 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 m and periods i e t 1 2 4 5 and 10 d were set twelve textural soils with different mean soil particle sizes were examined and the corresponding hydraulic parameters are presented in table s1 the source depth included 5 7 10 15 and 20 m 2 4 calculation of indoor pollutant concentrations assuming the building is a well mixed continuously stirred tank the

a sandbox experiment to simulate the soil gas transport in tce impacted soils with oscillatory water table the sandbox was 0 6 m in length 0 5 m in height and 0 04 m in width and was filled with jumunjin sand fig 2 initially 0 5 ml of free phase tce was injected using a glass syringe with a septum x 20 cm z 15 cm after the sandbox was saturated the water table of the lower boundary varied from 0 to 10 cm the gaseous tce was sampled using a 5 μl gas tight syringe every 5 min the soil hydraulic parameters used in the simulation were obtained in the laboratory and the specific values can be found in table s2 to validate the developed model the simulations were compared with the experimental data from joun et al 2016 fig 3 where two cycles of vadose zone breathing with a fluctuation amplitude of 10 cm were studied the simulation results can generally reflect the observed variation of gaseous tce concentration and the simulation errors are within half an order of magnitude the agreement between simulations and observations demonstrates the rationality of the developed model in simulating soil water and gas transport in napl impacted soils we also note that the gaseous tce concentration is contrary to the fluctuation trend of the water table there are two potential mechanisms that can be used to explain this phenomenon due to the declining water table high concentrations of dissolved vocs are directly exposed to soil air resulting in a surge of vocs emissions in vadose zone soils on the other hand the high water saturation in the vadose zone makes the response of surface soil concentration to the decrease of water table relatively lagging an evidence for the concentration delay response can be found in fig 5 this phenomenon was also observed in the vi scenario of contaminated groundwater sources man et al 2021 the difference is that when the water table returns to 0 cm the depth at the beginning the tce soil gas concentrations decrease in the contaminated groundwater source scenario see fig 3 of man et al 2021 while for the tce impacted soil scenario the concentration remains almost unchanged this is because tce impacted soils continue to produce upward contaminant fluxes regardless of the decreasing water table 3 2 temporal variations of gaseous tce concentration distribution and indoor pollutant concentration fig 4 shows the distribution of gaseous tce concentration at different times of the last vadose zone breathing cycle compared to the steady state distribution fig 4a i e the soil gas concentration profile at the beginning of the simulation the gaseous tce concentrations fluctuate significantly within one cycle fig 4b shows the gaseous tce concentration distribution when the water table is located at the lowest as the water table rises fig 4c and d the soil gas is driven by the rising water from the pore space causing a decrease in gaseous tce concentration near the water table 5 m z 4 m in the following two days fig 4e and f the water table drops and the soil gas is inhaled into the deep soil with a gradual rise in the gaseous tce concentration fig 5 plots the temporal variations of indoor tce concentrations the initial indoor tce concentration c in is 1 27e 5 mol m3 when the water table fluctuates the indoor tce concentration varies drastically up to seven orders of magnitude within a month on the whole the averaged c in value is 1 14e 4 mol m3 nearly nine times larger than the initial concentration suggesting that the fluctuation of the water table could increase vi risks zhang et al 2021 showed that periodic water table fluctuations could increase gaseous tce concentrations at building foundation cracks we also note that the indoor tce concentration does not vary synchronously with the water table depth for example during the first two days the water table continues to decline while the indoor tce concentration first decreases and then increases this is because when the water table falls it induces a downward advection flux allowing indoor air to enter the soil through the foundation cracks on the other hand the water table drop also enhances the upward diffusion flux increasing the tce concentration guo 2015 found a slight delay between the gaseous pollutant concentration and the water table through sand tank experiments 3 3 influence of the fluctuation amplitude and period on the attenuation coefficient of the contaminated soil to indoor tce concentration α is the normalized indoor pollutant concentration defined as the concentration ratio of the indoor tce to the contamination source considering that the indoor tce concentration varies over time we adopted the averaged α in the last simulation circle to evaluate the influence of the fluctuation amplitude and period fig 6 presents the averaged α calculated from the vi scenarios with different amplitudes i e a 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 m and periods i e t 1 2 4 5 and 10 d where two types of soils sand and silt and building foundations basement and slab on grade are involved regardless of the foundation type and soil texture tested here the averaged α value increases with the fluctuation amplitude fig 6a and b and decreases with the fluctuation period fig 6c and d respectively for buildings with a basement foundation the averaged α value of sand is 2 37e 4 with the amplitude of 0 5 m and period of 4 d under otherwise the same conditions the averaged α value with an amplitude of 0 01 m is one order of magnitude lower than the original value and the averaged α value with a fluctuation period of 10 d is half of the original value the shorter fluctuation period means the higher fluctuation frequency the reciprocal of the fluctuation period of the water table which may lead to the enhancement of soil gas transport this finding was also observed by zhang et al 2021 who reported that a higher concentration at the crack was induced by the higher amplitude and the shorter period of groundwater table fluctuations the results remind us to be careful when assessing vi risks at sites with significant vadose zone breathing such as coastal areas liu et al 2021 compared to the slab on grade foundation buildings with a basement foundation are more vulnerable to vi risks as indicated by the larger averaged α this is because the basement bottom is located deeper than a slab on grade construction such buildings tend to be associated with a shorter diffusion distance of soil gas reducing mass flux loss during the diffusion process 3 4 influence of the soil texture on the attenuation coefficient of the contaminated soil to indoor tce concentration β is defined as the indoor tce concentration ratio between scenarios with oscillatory and static water tables a larger β value means that the indoor tce concentration is more susceptible to vadose zone breathing fig 7 presents the averaged α and β values calculated from vi scenarios with different soil types represented by the mean soil particle size the averaged α is the highest with sand 2 37e 4 for the basement foundation and 4 24e 5 for the slab on grade foundation and is the lowest with clay loam 3 07e 6 for the basement foundation and 6 11e 7 for the slab on grade foundation as the mean soil particle size increases the averaged α tends to increase and becomes more sensitive to water table fluctuations larger soil particle sizes usually mean more macropores which are more conducive to soil gas transport jury and horton 2004 yao et al 2017 claimed that soils with coarser particles allowed more significant soil gas advection when the mean soil particle size is less than 0 25 mm however no linear relationship exists between the averaged α and the soil particle size this is because the transport of soil gas is closely related to the soil water content shen et al 2013 which is jointly determined by the particle size and distribution parameters in the soil water retention curve assouline et al 1998 arthur et al 2012 pointed out that the particle and pore size distribution parameters were correlated with the soil gas transport properties β has a similar variation trend to the averaged α regardless of the building foundation type this is not hard to understand from the definition of β for buildings with a basement foundation the β value of the sand soil can be as high as approximately 18 7 and the β values of the other soils range from 1 to 3 which indicates that the water table fluctuation can significantly increase the indoor tce concentration under the current fluctuation amplitude and period i e a 0 5 m and t 4 d this is not always true for buildings with a slab on grade foundation except for the sand soil the β values of the other soils float around 1 this suggests that compared to the basement foundation buildings with a slab on grade foundation are less susceptible to water table fluctuations 3 5 influence of the contamination source depth on the attenuation coefficient of the contaminated soil to indoor tce concentration fig 8 plots the averaged α and β values against the contamination source depth for the two foundation types when the contamination source depth ranges from 5 to 10 m the averaged α of the basement foundation decreases from 2 37e 4 to 1 32e 5 for the slab on grade foundation the averaged α decreases from 4 24e 5 to 4 55e 6 thus a similar conclusion can be drawn from these two scenarios more attenuation represented by the smaller averaged α is observed with the increase of contamination source depth this finding is consistent with the soil gas transport mechanism as reported by johnston and gibson 2013 the deeper the contamination source the longer vertical distance between the building and the source resulting in more resistance to the upward diffusion of soil gases yao et al 2018 argued that for the groundwater contamination source the primary resistance to the upward soil gas flow is the capillary fringe when the source depth exceeds 10 m the averaged α remains almost unchanged suggesting that the source depth plays an insignificant influence this can also be seen from the β values which are close to 1 at this time the fluctuation of the water table does not affect the indoor tce concentration 4 conclusions this study provides valuable insights into the influence of vadose zone breathing on vapor intrusion vi from napl impacted soils where different fluctuation amplitudes and periods of the water table soil types building structures and source depths were involved our results show that for sites with significant water table fluctuations represented by large amplitudes and short periods vadose zone breathing can promote vi risks specifically with an amplitude of 0 5 m and a period of 4 d the variation range of indoor pollutant concentration is approximately seven orders of magnitude within one month and the averaged concentration is nearly nine times larger than the steady state concentration this is especially true for coarse textural soils and buildings with a basement foundation we also note that when the source depth exceeds a certain threshold i e 10 m in our cases the source depth plays an insignificant influence on vi risks as a result vadose zone breathing associated with soil types building structures and source depth should be taken into consideration when evaluating the vi risks of napl impacted soils preferential pathways such as permeable soil backfill and plant root systems are widespread in vadose zone soils jarvis et al 2016 unnithan et al 2021 in the presence of preferential pathways the unsaturated flow processes due to vadose zone breathing are also altered thus affecting the transport of soil gases however this was not considered in our model which will be explored in future studies another limitation is that the numerical model was developed for scenarios involving single family residences and its applicability needs to be further tested when multiple residences or even different building types are involved credit authorship contribution statement jun man conceptualization methodology writing original draft

2708,understanding the dynamic response of surface soil moisture ssm 0 7 cm drying to rising temperature is vital to predict future changes in agricultural and hydrological drought here we use quantile regression to explore the scaling effects of 2 m air temperature on ssm c of the driest month in 8 different land cover types in the yellow river basin by using temperature intervals and a sliding window approach ssm decreases significantly with air temperature and decreases more rapidly in warmer conditions except for plain field suggesting that temperature has a greater effect on ssm temperature scaling than land cover for warmer conditions scaling exhibits larger spatial heterogeneity indicating that it is mainly affected by local factors when ssm is moderate the scaling is constrained by various factors but mainly by temperature comparatively the scaling is close to 0 when ssm is very high or very low the study highlights that global warming effects on drought may be underestimated the findings provide an important theoretical basis for effects of temperature on soil moisture and future drought prediction keywords surface soil moisture drought climate change temperature land cover quantile regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is a frequently occurring extreme event caused by hydro climatic deficit dai 2011 sheffield wood 2007 with significant adverse effects on ecosystems hydrology agriculture and economies globally liu et al 2021 vicente serrano et al 2012 however for many regions the magnitude and even direction of climate warming induced drought trends depends on how drought is defined there stand substantial differences between drought indicators such as precipitation soil moisture runoff and vegetation health brunner et al 2021 cook et al 2018 diffenbaugh et al 2015 even at the land surface strong differences across drought indicators are evident cook et al 2018 the transition from meteorological i e insufficient precipitation to soil moisture drought depends on processes affecting the surface water balance most importantly however soil moisture drought can be regarded as the time integral balance between insufficient precipitation and subsequent loss of water including evapotranspiration runoff and drainage berg sheffield 2018 cook et al 2018 soil moisture drought is crucial because reduced soil moisture is often related to soil water stress on vegetation which limits the physiological functions of ecosystems and thus can have significant impacts on agricultural production berg sheffield 2018 liu et al 2021 troch et al 2013 soil moisture especially surface soil moisture ssm is also an important variable regulating interactions between land and atmosphere fischer et al 2007 mishra 2020 guswa et al 2002 korres et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 modulating partitioning of water and energy fluxes trenberth et al 2014 the growing body of literatures show that climate warming might have intensified historical soil moisture drought dai 2013 gu et al 2019a b miralles et al 2019 and might exacerbate future drought severity berg sheffield 2018 as noted above based on multi satellite datasets a decrease of global ssm was observed in 1988 2010 with more regions showing negative trends dorigo et al 2012 comparatively despite differences among climate models due to their complicated surface components and large uncertainties in the simulated soil moisture fields models can predict robust reductions in future ssm across most regions of the globe approximately 70 of the land areas show reduced multi model mean ssm under the rcp8 5 scenario berg et al 2017 berg sheffield 2018 cheng et al 2017 and regional declines of up to 10 zhao and dai 2015 cheng et al 2017 even in regions with increased precipitation no regions show statistically significant increases of ssm in models berg sheffield 2018 in contrast changes of total column soil moisture are more uncertain with only slightly negative global mean and most regions are dominated by decreased precipitation sheffield wood 2007 cook et al 2018 consistently different ssm drought measurements suggest spatially widespread increased drought under warmer climates due to temperature driven increases in evapotranspiration demand berg sheffield 2018 dorigo et al 2012 the widespread ssm drying is significantly lower than predicted drying from localized precipitation declines alone implying that warming may amplify soil moisture drought cook et al 2018 williams et al 2015 for example in most regions warmer temperatures can exacerbate soil moisture drying by increasing evapotranspiration and reducing snowfall and snowpack levels cook et al 2018 the soil moisture drying rate varies with climatic characteristics land cover soil type and drought severity fan et al 2021 mccoll et al 2017 tang and piechota 2009 vicente serrano et al 2020 for instance land cover and soil type can influence drought by altering the surface partitioning of precipitation e g interception infiltration and runoff and regulating water fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere fan et al 2019 cook et al 2018 previous studies have mainly focused on the long term changes of soil moisture under global warming while in depth research about effects of rising temperature on soil moisture drought is lacking therefore we proposed questions as what is the impact of rising temperature on ssm drought is the relationship linear this will improve our understanding of soil moisture drought changes under climate change the yellow river basin is an ecologically fragile area in china and is extremely sensitive to climate warming li et al 2019 studies show that with global warming soil moisture has become drier wang et al 2011 soil moisture can remarkably affect ecological environment and artificial ecological restoration in particular li et al 2019 ssm in the driest month of each year was chosen to mitigate the influence of hydrological factors such as precipitation and groundwater meanwhie long term ssm is more sensitive to rising temperature relative to total column soil moisture sheffield wood 2007 whan et al 2015 because external water recharge by precipitation and groundwater is weak under drought conditions thus here we used ssm of era5 land in the driest month of the year with different temperature intervals and sliding windows to explore the effect of rising temperature on ssm drought in 8 different vegetation land covers 2 data sets and methods 2 1 data sets era5

construction land and unused land liu et al 2014 all data sets used in this study have been listed in table 1 2 2 methods we computed the mean ssm and meteorological data for each month and selected

the meteorological and ssm datasets was selected the yellow river basin yrb has a total of 8 593 grid cells and was subdivided into 3 primary land cover types and 8 subtypes table 2 fig 1 other land covers with small area or accumulated water were not considered in this study for each land cover type we employed quantile regression to analyze the scaling of the driest monthly ssm with temperature quantile regression estimates the linear relationship between explanatory variables and the quantiles of the response or target variables koenker hallock 2001 the calculation of the quantile regression estimator minimizes the asymmetrical absolute value residuals and it is more robust to outliers than the least squares approach and is more reliable in estimating coefficients for non normal distributions given a series of data pairs xi yi for i 1 n the quantile regression model is as follows koenker hallock 2001 wasko sharma 2014 1 y i β 0 p β 1 p i p where p is the quantile 0 p 1

annual mean driest ssm in the baseline period of 1981 2018 we employed a bootstrap approach to calculate the significance level of the quantile regression we explored the influence of temperature on the scaling by splitting the temperature range into two parts i e cooler and warmer conditions the fixed temperature threshold was taken as 14 c which is the median of all data pairs the same procedure was accepted for each land cover the influence of temperature on scaling was further explored by employing the median temperature in each grid cell finally we evaluated changes in the scaling of ssm with temperature for every degree increase in temperature using a one degree sliding window to ensure that there are 10 n 1 2 3 10 sliding windows between the lowest temperature tmin

results and discussions 3 1 scaling of ssm with temperature ssm decreases with mean air temperature the 50th percentile regression of ssm with temperature is significantly negative in all land cover types p 0 05 fig 2 these findings are in good line with negative feedback of temperature on ssm cheng huang 2016 deng et al 2020 lakshmi et al 2003 oki kanae 2006 meanwhile these findings highlight how the strength of the feedback varies with temperature and land cover types increasing temperature reduces ssm by increasing evapotranspiration pascolini campbell et al 2021 but it may also increase precipitation lenderink van meijgaard 2008 because the increase in precipitation is limited by atmospheric radiative cooling it increases at a much lower rate than the clausius clapeyron rate of

deficit which is exponentially responding to temperature increases atmospheric demand but reduces evapotranspiration through stomatal conductance stress massmann et al 2019 typically as temperature increases the growth rate of evapotranspiration exceeds that of precipitation and hence decreases ssm deng et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 increasing air temperature can probably increase extreme precipitation but also reduce occurrences of precipitation ma et al 2015 slater et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the reduction of moderate and light rain further exacerbates ssm deficit and may lead to agricultural drought even in regions where precipitation increased due to warming no significant increases of ssm were found in models berg sheffield 2018 moreover ssm has a higher decreasing rate with increasing temperature in dry farmland mountain field and hilly field except for plain field 0 34 c followed by wooded land and grassland fig 2i these differences in deceleration rate may relate to the land cover type climatic conditions and evapotranspiration deng et al 2020 as a main driver of transpiration higher leaf area index leads to higher transpiration in wooded land than grassland kleb and wilson 1997 james et al 2003 for dry farmland the deceleration rate of ssm with temperature is significantly p 0 05 lower in plain field 0 34 c than mountain field 0 76 c and hilly field 0 95 c even though the temperature in plain field temperature 16 19 c is slightly higher than mountain field 15 70 c and close to hilly field 16 24 c plain field features a lower average ssm in the driest month 0 18 m3 m3 than mountain field 0 22 m3 m3 and hilly field 0 21 m3 m3 fig 1c which may limit the water available for evaporation mountain field and hilly field have high air temperature compared to other land covers with sufficient energy for evapotranspiration which may lead to rapid decreases in ssm with increasing temperature for wooded land the deceleration rate of ssm with temperature is similar in shrubland 0 55 c and forested land 0 58 c due to similar ssm and temperature for dense grassland ssm changes are of the lowest rate under increasing temperature i e 0 28 c temperature 0 63

indicating that the grass land cover has a limited effect on the reduction of ssm by transpiration meanwhile grassland with higher temperature shows greater decline of ssm with temperature indicating that the difference of air temperature is the main influencing factor figs 1 and 2 rather than ssm or vegetation coverage different land cover types witness notable differences in the regression coefficients and significance levels of different quantiles figs 2 and 3 overall the middle quantiles 30th 50th and 70th percentiles of ssm decrease significantly and faster with temperature in most

indicating that when ssm is lower ssm reduces faster with temperature temporally fig 3 3 2 difference in scaling in cooler vs warmer conditions to further study ssm changes with air temperature across climate conditions i e temperature ranges we further analyzed the scaling of ssm with temperature in cooler and warmer conditions by three methods fixed threshold 14 the median value of all data pairs fig 4 and fig s1 a statistical median in each grid cell fig 5 and a sliding window fig 6 in all land cover types the change of ssm with temperature features a greater rate of decrease in warmer conditions figs 4 5 and 6 which is significant except for sparse grassland fig 4a the results from the sliding window analysis also suggest that ssm decreases faster as the sliding window moves to the higher temperature range figs 4 and 6 under high temperature conditions an abnormally high coupling between temperature and soil moisture may occur in areas with low soil moisture miralles et al 2012 schwingshackl et al 2017 for grassland the differences between median scalings in cooler or warmer conditions are relatively small respectively 0 26 and 0 77 for dense grassland p 0 0001 0 41 and 0 65 for medium density grassland p 0 01 0 52 and 0 79 for sparse grassland p 0 05 however the scaling shows a larger variation range in the warmer conditions fig 4a table 3 for wooded land ssm decreases significantly faster and exhibits larger variation in warmer conditions the scalings are respectively 1 96 and 0 21 for shrubland 1 87 and 0 21 for forested land fig 4a the scaling shows small difference between shrubland and forested land regardless of the temperature suggesting that different forest types do not substantially affect the scaling in contrast substantial differences in scaling are found between cooler and warmer conditions suggesting that temperature range may play a critical role in the influence of temperature on scaling for dry farmland ssm decreases significantly faster in warmer than cooler conditions but with a similar variation range and the scalings are respectively 0 37 and 2 01 for mountain field 0 13 and 0 58 for plain field 0 88 and 1 45 for hilly field fig 4a table 3 meanwhile there are large differences among the mountain plain and hilly fields ssm generally declines with temperature in most areas with large spatial heterogeneity in both cooler and warmer conditions figs 4 and 5 cheng huang 2016 wang et al 2011 in the cooler conditions the scaling exhibits less spatial heterogeneity figs 1 3b and fig 5b indicating that it is not greatly affected by local land cover and local heterogeneity in evapotranspiration moreover the scaling is positive in the lower yrb close to the river channel figs 1 3b and fig 5b in warmer conditions there is an evident spatial difference of the scaling with larger fluctuation range suggesting it is more uncertain and mainly affected by local factors such as land cover and soil properties in particular the areas with positive scaling match well those with low ssm indicating low ssm features notable scaling uncertainty due to soil moisture deficit for evaporation fig 1b fig 3c fig s2c these results further indicate that the scaling varies in different conditions and land cover has a greater effect on the scaling in warmer conditions than in cooler conditions due to spatial differences of climatological variables within any single land cover type the scaling of ssm with temperature also has different spatial characteristics lakshmi et al 2003 miralles et al 2012 zhou et al 2021 therefore the scaling of different sites has a negative correlation with air temperature across all land cover types fig 7 indicating that the ssm drying in warmer areas is faster with increasing temperature fig 7 however the decreasing rate of the scaling differs slightly among different land cover types for every degree of temperature increase the change of the scaling is 0 027 with a high adjusted r2 value for all grassland types and the change of the scaling with temperature is higher in the shrubland 0 042 and mountain field 0 046 fig 4 the adjusted r2 in each land cover type except for plain field and hilly field is considerable indicating that the scaling is closely correlated with temperature in space 3 3 the effect of ssm on scaling we further explored the relationship of scaling with ssm fig 8 and fig s5 and found that the scaling is close to zero under high ssm fig 8 suggesting that when soil moisture is reduced by evapotranspiration other water sources are replenished to offset the reduction seneviratne et al 2010 when ssm reduces due to evapotranspiration other water sources such as deeper soil moisture mitigate evaporation reduction resulting in that ssm is in dynamic equilibrium therefore the scaling is close to 0 and rarely affected by temperature and ssm under conditions of high ssm the scaling also reduces rapidly to 0 under decreasing ssm when ssm is below a lower critical value fig 8 the change of ssm with temperature is mainly restricted by ssm seneviratne et al 2010 and its feedback on evapotranspiration resulting in reduction in evaporation magnitude and then the scaling rapidly reduces to 0 as ssm reduces given that ssm is not either evaporated by external energy or absorbed by vegetation edlefsen anderson 1943 when ssm is between the smaller and upper critical values of ssm the scaling changes strongly with ssm fig 8 and is affected by many climate and non climate factors but mainly restricted by temperature fig 8 these variables especially temperature play an important role in ssm drought mainly through the evapotranspiration process therefore we cannot ignore that in the case of moderate soil moisture energy and soil moisture regulations jointly limit the evapotranspiration rates which in turn affect soil moisture content seneviratne et al 2010 4 discussions in this study quantile regression was used to obtain robust scalings and three methods were used to reduce the uncertainty of results however the research results still have certain uncertainties which are sourced mainly from but are not limited to 1 uncertainty of ssm data since it is difficult to obtain in situ observed ssm data this study adopted the ssm assimilation dataset of era5 land e g beck et al 2021 the assimilation system reflects the land atmosphere interactions and the connection and transformation of ssm and subsoil moisture hersbach et al 2020 muñoz sabater et al 2021 in contrast remotely sensed soil moisture can only reflect the ssm state beck et al 2021 and may not adequately reflect soil moisture changes due to deep rooted vegetation through transpiration 2 uncertainty of land cover although good quality land cover data was used in this study liu et al 2014 the land cover in this region has changed during the study period due to natural and anthropogenic factors li et al 2019 which will inevitably modulate impacts of temperature on ssm variations 3 inconsistency of data sources the era5 land assimilation system integrates observational data into the numerical dynamic model and obtains the optimal solution of each variable through physical processes and equations muñoz sabater et al 2021 however this kind of assimilation also introduces systematic errors hersbach et al 2020 by selecting high quality datasets from different sources this study alleviates systematic errors caused by using datasets from the same assimilation system nonetheless the consistency of the results obtained by different methods convinces reliability of the conclusions this study sheds new light on impact of rising temperature on soil moisture drought and means much for future soil moisture drought risk management 5 conclusions this study employs quantile regression to explore the effects of temperature on ssm in 8 different land cover types based on three methods i e fixed threshold temperature intervals the median temperature in each grid cell and a sliding window approach the results from the different methods are consistent and all support the conclusion that higher mean temperature accelerates ssm drying in particular the key findings are in the yellow river basin ssm declined more rapidly with temperature in warmer land covers suggesting that relative to land cover temperature has a greater effect on ssm responses to temperature higher temperature accelerates ssm drying even across different covers in warmer conditions ssm responses to temperature exhibits spatial heterogeneity and substantial variation suggesting that it is more uncertain and mainly affected by local factors such as land cover and soil type when ssm is moderate ssm responses o temperature changes with ssm is restricted by multiple factors but mainly by temperature i e through evapotranspiration the ssm responses to temperature is weak when ssm is too high and or too low and the response is restricted by insufficient ssm for evapotranspiration in the latter case this work deepens the understanding of the impacts of rising temperature on soil moisture drought and may guide

2708,understanding the dynamic response of surface soil moisture ssm 0 7 cm drying to rising temperature is vital to predict future changes in agricultural and hydrological drought here we use quantile regression to explore the scaling effects of 2 m air temperature on ssm c of the driest month in 8 different land cover types in the yellow river basin by using temperature intervals and a sliding window approach ssm decreases significantly with air temperature and decreases more rapidly in warmer conditions except for plain field suggesting that temperature has a greater effect on ssm temperature scaling than land cover for warmer conditions scaling exhibits larger spatial heterogeneity indicating that it is mainly affected by local factors when ssm is moderate the scaling is constrained by various factors but mainly by temperature comparatively the scaling is close to 0 when ssm is very high or very low the study highlights that global warming effects on drought may be underestimated the findings provide an important theoretical basis for effects of temperature on soil moisture and future drought prediction keywords surface soil moisture drought climate change temperature land cover quantile regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is a frequently occurring extreme event caused by hydro climatic deficit dai 2011 sheffield wood 2007 with significant adverse effects on ecosystems hydrology agriculture and economies globally liu et al 2021 vicente serrano et al 2012 however for many regions the magnitude and even direction of climate warming induced drought trends depends on how drought is defined there stand substantial differences between drought indicators such as precipitation soil moisture runoff and vegetation health brunner et al 2021 cook et al 2018 diffenbaugh et al 2015 even at the land surface strong differences across drought indicators are evident cook et al 2018 the transition from meteorological i e insufficient precipitation to soil moisture drought depends on processes affecting the surface water balance most importantly however soil moisture drought can be regarded as the time integral balance between insufficient precipitation and subsequent loss of water including evapotranspiration runoff and drainage berg sheffield 2018 cook et al 2018 soil moisture drought is crucial because reduced soil moisture is often related to soil water stress on vegetation which limits the physiological functions of ecosystems and thus can have significant impacts on agricultural production berg sheffield 2018 liu et al 2021 troch et al 2013 soil moisture especially surface soil moisture ssm is also an important variable regulating interactions between land and atmosphere fischer et al 2007 mishra 2020 guswa et al 2002 korres et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 modulating partitioning of water and energy fluxes trenberth et al 2014 the growing body of literatures show that climate warming might have intensified historical soil moisture drought dai 2013 gu et al 2019a b miralles et al 2019 and might exacerbate future drought severity berg sheffield 2018 as noted above based on multi satellite datasets a decrease of global ssm was observed in 1988 2010 with more regions showing negative trends dorigo et al 2012 comparatively despite differences among climate models due to their complicated surface components and large uncertainties in the simulated soil moisture fields models can predict robust reductions in future ssm across most regions of the globe approximately 70 of the land areas show reduced multi model mean ssm under the rcp8 5 scenario berg et al 2017 berg sheffield 2018 cheng et al 2017 and regional declines of up to 10 zhao and dai 2015 cheng et al 2017 even in regions with increased precipitation no regions show statistically significant increases of ssm in models berg sheffield 2018 in contrast changes of total column soil moisture are more uncertain with only slightly negative global mean and most regions are dominated by decreased precipitation sheffield wood 2007 cook et al 2018 consistently different ssm drought measurements suggest spatially widespread increased drought under warmer climates due to temperature driven increases in evapotranspiration demand berg sheffield 2018 dorigo et al 2012 the widespread ssm drying is significantly lower than predicted drying from localized precipitation declines alone implying that warming may amplify soil moisture drought cook et al 2018 williams et al 2015 for example in most regions warmer temperatures can exacerbate soil moisture drying by increasing evapotranspiration and reducing snowfall and snowpack levels cook et al 2018 the soil moisture drying rate varies with climatic characteristics land cover soil type and drought severity fan et al 2021 mccoll et al 2017 tang and piechota 2009 vicente serrano et al 2020 for instance land cover and soil type can influence drought by altering the surface partitioning of precipitation e g interception infiltration and runoff and regulating water fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere fan et al 2019 cook et al 2018 previous studies have mainly focused on the long term changes of soil moisture under global warming while in depth research about effects of rising temperature on soil moisture drought is lacking therefore we proposed questions as what is the impact of rising temperature on ssm drought is the relationship linear this will improve our understanding of soil moisture drought changes under climate change the yellow river basin is an ecologically fragile area in china and is extremely sensitive to climate warming li et al 2019 studies show that with global warming soil moisture has become drier wang et al 2011 soil moisture can remarkably affect ecological environment and artificial ecological restoration in particular li et al 2019 ssm in the driest month of each year was chosen to mitigate the influence of hydrological factors such as precipitation and groundwater meanwhie long term ssm is more sensitive to rising temperature relative to total column soil moisture sheffield wood 2007 whan et al 2015 because external water recharge by precipitation and groundwater is weak under drought conditions thus here we used ssm of era5 land in the driest month of the year with different temperature intervals and sliding windows to explore the effect of rising temperature on ssm drought in 8 different vegetation land covers 2 data sets and methods 2 1 data sets era5

compared with observations and other model satellite datasets beck et al 2021 muñoz sabater et al 2021 for temperature we used 2 meter air temperature data sourced from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd a set of near surface meteorological and environmental reanalysis data developed by the institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences he et al 2020 cmfd merges a series of remote sensing datasets reanalysis datasets and in situ observation data including gldas data rodell et al 2004 merra pressure data rienecker et al 2011 gewex srb radiation data pinker et

he et al 2020 the land cover data are from the remotely sensed data of china s 5 year land status programme by the resource and environmental science and data center this land cover data covers a long time interval 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 this data set uses landsat remote sensing images as the main data source and has been verified through manual visual interpretation liu et al 2014 the spatial resolution of this freely available data is 1 km 1 km the data set divides land cover into 6 primary types and 25 secondary types the primary types are cultivated land wooded land grassland water area construction land and unused land liu et al 2014 all data sets used in this study have been listed in table 1 2 2 methods we computed the mean ssm and meteorological data for each month and selected the lowest monthly ssm in each year and corresponding temperature the five year land cover data 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 for china s land cover is used to obtain the modal land cover during the period of 1981 2018 all data are resampled to the same spatial resolution 0 1 0 1 using a bilinear interpolation except land cover data by the mode interpolation the baseline period of 1981 2018 shared by the meteorological and ssm datasets was selected the yellow river basin yrb has a total of 8 593 grid cells and was subdivided into 3 primary land cover types and 8 subtypes table 2 fig 1 other land covers with small area or accumulated water were not considered in this study for each land cover type we employed quantile regression to analyze the scaling of the driest monthly ssm with temperature quantile regression estimates the linear relationship between explanatory variables and the quantiles of the response or target variables koenker hallock 2001 the calculation of the quantile regression estimator minimizes the asymmetrical absolute value residuals and it is more robust to outliers than the least squares approach and is more reliable in estimating coefficients for non normal distributions given a series of data pairs xi yi for i 1 n the quantile regression model is as follows koenker hallock 2001 wasko sharma 2014 1 y i β 0 p β 1 p i p where p is the quantile 0 p 1

annual mean driest ssm in the baseline period of 1981 2018 we employed a bootstrap approach to calculate the significance level of the quantile regression we explored the influence of temperature on the scaling by splitting the temperature range into two parts i e cooler and warmer conditions the fixed temperature threshold was taken as 14 c which is the median of all data pairs the same procedure was accepted for each land cover the influence of temperature on scaling was further explored by employing the median temperature in each grid cell finally we evaluated changes in the scaling of ssm with temperature for every degree increase in temperature using a one degree sliding window to ensure that there are 10 n 1 2 3 10 sliding windows between the lowest temperature tmin and highest temperature tmax of all data pairs we determined the window length as l tmax tmin n 1 we choose n 10 to provide a balance between the number of windows and points within each window 3

when ssm is between the smaller and upper critical values of ssm the scaling changes strongly with ssm fig 8 and is affected by many climate and non climate factors but mainly restricted by temperature fig 8 these variables especially temperature play an important role in ssm drought mainly through the evapotranspiration process therefore we cannot ignore that in the case of moderate soil moisture energy and soil moisture regulations jointly limit the evapotranspiration rates which in turn affect soil moisture content seneviratne et al 2010 4 discussions in this study quantile regression was used to obtain robust scalings and three methods were used to reduce the uncertainty of results however the research results still have certain uncertainties which are sourced mainly from but are not limited to 1 uncertainty of ssm data since it is difficult to obtain in situ observed ssm data this study adopted the ssm assimilation dataset of era5 land e g beck et al 2021 the assimilation system reflects the land atmosphere interactions and the connection and transformation of ssm and subsoil moisture hersbach et al 2020 muñoz sabater et al 2021 in contrast remotely sensed soil moisture can only reflect the ssm state beck et al 2021 and may not adequately reflect soil moisture changes due to deep rooted vegetation through transpiration 2 uncertainty of land cover although good quality land cover data was used in this study liu et al 2014 the land cover in this region has changed during the study period due to natural and anthropogenic factors li et al 2019 which will inevitably modulate impacts of temperature on ssm variations 3 inconsistency of data sources the era5 land assimilation system integrates observational data into the numerical dynamic model and obtains the optimal solution of each variable through physical processes and equations muñoz sabater et al 2021 however this kind of assimilation also introduces systematic errors hersbach et al 2020 by selecting high quality datasets from different sources this study alleviates systematic errors caused by using datasets from the same assimilation system nonetheless the consistency of the results obtained by different methods convinces reliability of the conclusions this study sheds new light on impact of rising temperature on soil moisture drought and means much for future soil moisture drought risk management 5 conclusions this study employs quantile regression to explore the effects of temperature on ssm in 8 different land cover types based on three methods i e fixed threshold temperature intervals the median temperature in each grid cell and a sliding window approach the results from the different methods are consistent and all support the conclusion that higher mean temperature accelerates ssm drying in particular the key findings are in the yellow river basin ssm declined more rapidly with temperature in warmer land covers suggesting that relative to land cover temperature has a greater effect on ssm responses to temperature higher temperature accelerates ssm drying even across different covers in warmer conditions ssm responses to temperature exhibits spatial heterogeneity and substantial variation suggesting that it is more uncertain and mainly affected by local factors such as land cover and soil type when ssm is moderate ssm responses o temperature changes with ssm is restricted by multiple factors but mainly by temperature i e through evapotranspiration the ssm responses to temperature is weak when ssm is too high and or too low and the response is restricted by insufficient ssm for evapotranspiration in the latter case this work deepens the understanding of the impacts of rising temperature on soil moisture drought and may guide

2709,in the yellow river source area sayr a large scale isotope hydrological monitoring effort of landscape heterogeneity was implemented to assess and determine whether permafrost has a controlling influence on hydrological processes in the watersheds the isosource and mixsiar models were used to partition runoff during permafrost thaw season in five nested basins from 20 930 km2 to 121 972 km2 the analysis results showed that there were significant differences in the factors controlling runoff generation in the five basins as well as significant differences in runoff sources between upper watersheds with predominantly permafrost cover and lower watersheds with predominantly seasonal frozen soil cover the influence of permafrost on runoff generation was significantly reduced with increasing basin size soil permeability was influenced by permafrost thawing which impacted runoff generation in the permafrost zone however this only became effective under a specific combination of landscape characteristics and topography in basins with less permafrost cover the topographic characteristics and conditions of the catchment itself controlled the runoff generation mechanism in general the presence of permafrost influences the runoff generation but the extent of the influence depends on the characteristics of the basin itself and in particular the control of topography increases with the scale of the basin keywords isosource model mixsiar model hydrograph separation groundwater yellow river source area sayr data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction global warming has already had an irreversible impact on the hydrological cycle and hydrological processes in sensitive and vulnerable areas kundzewicz 2008 one of the indicators that is most sensitive to global warming is permafrost thawing biskaborn et al 2019 chadburn et al 2017 which significantly influences hydrograph characteristics in cold regions lafrenière and lamoureux 2019 to investigate the hydrologic cycle and how it is impacted by global warming the stable water isotopes δ18o δ2h have been increasingly used as they have significant advantages in the analysis of runoff components water flow path tracing and especially in the identification of groundwater sources in alpine permafrost regions including the arctic and qinghai tibet plateau qtp tan et al 2021 throckmorton et al 2016 previous studies used the stable water isotopes to investigate permafrost related hydrological processes in small meso and large scale watersheds gibson et al 2021b 2021a lachniet 2016 to either trace the contribution of water sources to runoff or to study water loss from permafrost for example a 9 year study to assess runoff ratios and residence times in lake watersheds based on stable isotope mass balance models across different land cover watershed morphometry climatic drivers and permafrost thaw was carried out gibson et al 2015 the study found that the thaw features in permafrost and bogs are the main drivers that influence runoff rather than morphometric properties lachniet 2016 mapped the isotopic composition of surface waters of high relief mountain ranges in alaska usa and yukon canada and highlighted that the variation in stable isotopes of stream water was controlled by topography ala aho et al 2018 investigated the spatial and temporal variability of stable isotopes in soils lakes and rivers to evaluate hydrological connectivity across 11 of latitude based on differences in permafrost cover they observed that landscapes in permafrost areas maintain persistent hydrological connectivity between lakes the active layer and rivers stable isotopes also helped to identify the components of runoff dominated by supra permafrost water in the source region of the yangtze river li et al 2020a in addition to the ongoing emphasis on explaining the role of permafrost previous studies also investigated the role of other watershed characteristics in controlling runoff generation including topography and geology soil land cover and watershed shape characteristics many observations and model simulations confirmed that permafrost degradation led to increased runoff in arctic regions liljedahl et al 2016 while runoff in the qinghai tibet plateau tended to decrease gao et al 2016 qiu 2012 investigations in permafrost basins on the tibetan plateau found that the depth of the active layer is critical to runoff runoff increased logarithmically with increasing thawing depth of the active layer for up to 60 cm while thawing depths 60 cm resulted in reduced runoff and slower recession wang et al 2009 niu et al 2011 found that the extent to which river hydrological processes were influenced by permafrost related to the degree of permafrost coverage in western china previous empirical and mathematical estimations of the average multi year runoff in the sayr showed that rainfall groundwater recharge and snow and ice meltwater accounted for 63 15 26 18 and 9 17 of the total annual runoff respectively however these results were highly uncertain and did not take into account the influence of permafrost on hydrological processes there were also numerous investigations of changes in the hydrological cycle associated with freeze thaw processes in the sayr mainly focusing on the effects of altered hydrothermal conditions in the active layer on the water storage capacity of the soil and hence on runoff luo et al 2020 qin et al 2017 these investigations have helped to understand the mechanisms by which permafrost affects hydrological processes although previous studies have conducted long term continuous monitoring and extensive field investigations of permafrost in the sayr they mostly focused on the effects of changes in hydrothermal conditions on local permafrost and active layer profiles neglecting the role that permafrost plays on the overall basin surface the extent to which degraded permafrost increasing permafrost temperature deepening of the active layer decreasing extent of permafrost cover affects runoff is unclear and the impact of permafrost thawing on runoff yield and concentration on different scale basins has yet to be explained in order to understand how river discharge changes in permafrost environments on the large catchment scale a nested basins approach to assess the impacts of permafrost on the runoff processes has been proposed previously mcnamara et al 1998 shanley et al 2002 attempted to explain old and new water contributions to runoff using isotopes as tracers in three nested permafrost catchments but their study was conducted in small scale catchments 410 111 250 km2 measurements in larger catchments are necessary to facilitate the understanding of the effects of permafrost on hydrological processes at larger spatial scales to date no large scale studies of this kind were conducted in the sayr that compare the hydrological response of nested watersheds of different sizes and physical characteristics to infer the controls on runoff generation and its components in this regard isotope hydrograph separation ihs mcdonnell et al 2014 has proven to be advantageous in understanding the mechanisms of runoff formation in the high altitude permafrost zone li et al 2020b 2020c additionally recently there has been an increase in using mixsiar models which are based on a bayesian theoretical framework to assess the contribution of river water sources beria et al 2020 birkel et al 2021 these models were previously mostly used to identify plant water sources and studies have revealed the potential for the application of bayesian mixing models in hydrology beria et al 2020 however so far the application of mixsiar models in the permafrost zone is rare the present study aimed at addressing both issues 1 to assess the influence of permafrost on runoff generation for different large scale nested basins and 2 to determine whether the mixsiar model is applicable in assessing runoff generation in permafrost areas we used extensive continuous isotope datasets of five large scale nested basins to determine the controlling factors and related processes of runoff generation to do this we describe two approaches to runoff source partitioning and the implementation of a large scale isotope hydrological survey across a range of hydro climatic conditions and landscape characteristics our hypothesis is that permafrost control of hydrological processes in large scale basins will be less pronounced than for smaller catchments and that on the large scale other catchment characteristics will dominate runoff generation thus we propose that permafrost will no longer be the primary controlling factor with increasing watershed size our main objectives are 1 to evaluate the applicability of the mixsiar model for runoff partitioning in permafrost areas and to systematically compare the performance of end member mixing analysis emma and bayesian methods 2 to quantitatively assess runoff generation under a diverse range of hydrological regimes in the sayr through isotopic runoff partitioning methods 3 to understand the influence of permafrost on runoff sources precipitation soil water groundwater 4 to capture the internal controlling factors of runoff generation in nested basins and 5 to provide parametric validation for large scale distributed hydrological models 2 study area the sayr above the tanag hydrological station 32 10 36 7 n 95 54 103 24 e 2 684 6 245 m a s l is situated in the northeast of qtp fig 1 which is deemed the largest flow producing region in the yellow river yr basin the most important ecological function region and main recharge region of freshwater resources in china as well as one of asia s regions that is highly susceptible to climate change the climate of the sayr is a typical plateau continental climate with hot and wet summers and cold and dry winters small annual but large daily temperature differences and long sunshine hours with strong radiation the sayr average annual temperature decreases from east to west and from south to north with increasing altitude for the madoi and maqin county it is below 3 0 while the annual temperature of maqu and xinghai county is over 1 5 the sayr lies on the edge of the interlaced belt controlled by the indian ocean south asian monsoon and the pacific ocean east asian monsoon with average annual precipitation of 484 2 mm due to the high altitude dry air little precipitation as well as good atmospheric transparency the annual potential evaporation is between 730 mm and 1 700 mm in 2017 the maqu meteorological station recorded the warmest and wettest year with the highest recorded annual precipitation of 703 mm and the highest average annual temperature of 3 13 c in 2018 the madoi meteorological station recorded the coldest and driest year with the lowest temperature of 4 2 c an annual precipitation of 472 mm and the highest potential evaporation of 1 321 mm the yr originates in the western part in the area of madoi county qinghai province which is a wide valley zone of the lake basin at an altitude of over 4 200 m a s l the yr then flows into the broad river valley of the xingxuhai region which features many lakes and is the largest wetland in the sayr on its course to the tanag hydrological station the main stream describes an s shape fig 1 the length of the main stream in the source area is 1 959 km with a drop in altitude of 2 768 m from upstream to downstream and an average specific drop of 1 47 the headwater area of the yr in the uppermost basin hayr is characterized by wide flooding plains and multiple lakes and wetlands it is largely dominated by braided rivers and unconfined sections spreading across its floodplain wetlands with an overall gradient of 0 4 there is low sediment transport due to the low slopes runoff is regulated by the great lakes and human activities all the year round and during spring thaw the snow melt runoff is mostly retained in the first hydropower station of the hayr fhsh reservoir with only a small amount being released resulting in a single snow melt hydrograph peak fig 1 the fhsh dam was removed in september 2018 which increased the annual streamflow by 123 210 2018 2019 ma et al 2021 which did not significantly affect the lower basin runoff the huangheyan hhy hydrological station of the uppermost hayr basin accounted for 25 8 and 4 of the flow at the downstream stations of jimai jm maqu mq and tanag tng during 1968 1975 ma et al 2021 indicating that the influence of upstream water on downstream runoff is gradually disappearing previous studies showed that the runoff and precipitation both show a double peaked feature with one peak in july and another in september during 1960 2019 not including the headwater of the yellow river overall annual runoff increases more than annual precipitation 2 5 yr 1 vs 1 01 yr 1 li et al 2021 the contribution of glacier melt from the a nyêmaqên mountain to yr runoff at the tanag gauging station is only 1 2 ma et al 2019 detailed information on the climate topography permafrost and vegetation for the five study basins can be found in literature blue et al 2013 ma et al 2019 alpine frozen desert soil is predominantly distributed at 4 000 5 200 m a s l where mostly sparse rocky lichens and small cushion plants with no agricultural use are growing below that at 3 000 4 000 m a s l alpine meadow soil and mountain meadow soil are found with mostly alpine meadow as vegetation cover of up to 40 90 it is an ideal summer pasture and the thickness of the chernozem soil can reach 60 80 cm lastly deep chestnut soil is mainly distributed in 2 500 3 400 m a s l which is rich in humus the vegetation cover is 60 80 and the main land use type is farmland the hydrogeology is complex and variable especially the dynamic changes of the supra permafrost water are extremely unstable within and between years the groundwater types are mainly bedrock supra permafrost water loose rock supra permafrost water and sub permafrost water in the permafrost zone and loose rock pore water in the non permafrost area and the thaw zones regarding permafrost the sayr is located in the transition zone between discontinuous 25 90 permafrost and seasonal frozen soil with a ratio of 43 8 permafrost and 56 2 seasonal frozen soil permafrost is mainly found above 4 000 m a s l and seasonal frozen soil is mainly found below this altitude as most previous studies focused on the hayr basin discontinuous permafrost area less data was available for the downstream basins the permafrost thickness in the hayr is generally 40 m with a measured maximum thickness of 74 m it is influenced by altitude latitude slope soil texture and local factors with strong spatial variability in recent years perennial permafrost has gradually degraded with seasonal frozen soil thickness thinning and shorter freezing periods model validated and field measured soil temperature data indicated that the thickness of the active layer increased from 1 8 m in 1980 to 2 4 m in 2006 with an average growth rate of 2 2 cm yr 1 luo et al 2014a b over the past 50 years the permafrost zone in the basin has shrunk from 2 4 10 4 km2 to 2 2 10 4 km2 and the active layer has increased from 1 4 m to 2 4 m due to climate warming luo et al 2014b more details about climate geomorphology permafrost and vegetation characteristics for individual nested basins are shown in table 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 field sampling laboratory analysis this work included five nested basins increasing in size basin 1 the catchment above huangheyan hydrologic station hhy 20 930 km2 basin 2 above the jimai hydrologic station jm 45 019 km2 basin 3 above the maqu hydrologic station mq 86 048 km2 basin 4 above the jungong hydrologic station jg 98 414 km2 and basin 5 above the tanag hydrologic station tng 121 972 km2 respectively fig 2 we collected 2 622 isotopic samples from all five basin outlets upstream to downstream of the sayr in 2017 a one year high temporal resolution continuous sampling was conducted and the sampling of hhy was carried out in 2018 as the endmembers for runoff generation were not known beforehand due to the complex hydrological processes we decided to sample atmospheric precipitation river water groundwater soil water and shallow ground ice systematically as replicates 3 1 1 precipitation samples a year long precipitation sampling was conducted in 2018 for hhy and in 2017 for all other stations we collected 136 146 130 60 and 72 precipitation samples including rainfall and snowfall at the five hydrological stations hhy jm mq jg and tng respectively the daily cumulative precipitation was collected using standard pit type rain barrels while ensuring that the barrels were level with the ground to avoid sources of pollution and the collected rainfall or snowfall was manually filled into polyethylene sample bottles for sealed storage after each precipitation event in the future throughfall samples should be collected as precipitation that was intercepted by plant canopies can influence results of isotope tracer studies stockinger et al 2015 3 1 2 river water samples due to the harsh environment the river water of hhy was sampled from may 2018 onwards while the other stations were sampled in a year long continuous campaign from january to december 2017 237 340 360 352 and 353 river water samples were collected as manual grab samples at hhy jm mq jg and tng respectively the samples were taken at a section 10 m distant to the hydrological station from 0 5 to 1 cm below the water surface manual borehole sampling was carried out during the icing period avoiding contamination where water flow was evident beneath the ice polyethylene sampling bottles were first washed three times with river water samples and then sealed to avoid headspace evaporation and two water samples were collected at 8 am each day 3 1 3 groundwater samples we collected 67 54 80 68 and 72 groundwater samples in the vicinity of the five hydrological stations from january to december of the corresponding hydrological year the nearest accessible wells to each of the stations were selected for sampling the farthest distance was 5 km which are located in madoi dar maqu county jungong and tangnaihai township we used a medium sized submersible vacuum pump for low speed sampling and samples were taken after pumping out the well volume samples were put into polyethylene bottles after rinsing three times and sealed taken first at a depth of 0 5 m below the groundwater surface due to the logistical challenges no further stratified sampling was undertaken 3 1 4 soil water and shallow ground ice samples we only carried out monthly soil water sampling in the active layer and the ground ice near the permafrost table was collected in a depth of 0 1 2 m within 5 km of the hhy and mq hydrological stations from april to december of the corresponding hydrological year overall a total of 63 soil water samples and 31 ground ice samples were collected with 33 of the soil water and 14 of the ground ice samples were collected near the mq hydrological station we dug two 1 5 m deep permafrost boreholes using a type 100 hydraulic drill rig to collect the observed shallow surface soil water and exposed ground ice sampling was carried out similar to the method employed by cao et al 2021 our boreholes were too shallow to allow for stratified sampling for more detailed studies however the collection of soil water should be supplemented with a stratification approach in the future although this presents some sampling difficulties 3 1 5 measurement of δ18o and δd twenty samples were discarded due to missing collection or damaged sample labels during transportation all water samples were sealed and then sent to the isotope platform at the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering hohai university for storage at 4 after filtering with 0 22 µm aqueous filters δ18o and δd ratios were measured using a picarro l2130 i high precision liquid water isotope analyser the reference standard is the vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water as defined by craig 1961 and gonfiantini 1978 the precision of δ18o and δd was maintained at 0 2 and 0 8 respectively the d excess was calculated based on the relationship between δd and δ18o content in fresh water on a global scale the global meteoric water line as defined by dansgaard 1964 the hydrogen and oxygen isotope data in this study were in agreement with the range of data from li et al 2020a at several of the same sampling transects from 2013 to 2015 indicating the accuracy of our experimental results 3 1 6 data for runoff climate and cryosphere we obtained discharge data from the hydrological yearbook compiled by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china the china meteorological data website https data cma cn provided daily meteorological data including precipitation air and ground temperature from the five weather stations located in the vicinity of the hydrological stations fig 1 this data was used to explain variability in isotopes of the taken water samples the permafrost distribution and classification are cited from zou et al 2017 and the data on land use type are from xu 2019 and permafrost thermal stability are from ran et al 2021 this work used the mean annual ground temperature 2005 2015 to classify the thermal stability types of permafrost where 5 0 c is extremely stable 3 0 to 5 0 c is stable 1 5 to 3 0 c is sub stable 0 5 to 1 5 c is transitional and 0 5 c is unstable type also compare to table 1 the watershed characteristic properties were analysed based on the dem images at 30 m resolution from usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov basic parameters for each basin were extracted from arcgis map 10 2 for subsequent analysis table 1 3 1 7 seasonal variability of runoff sources to better understand the isotopic seasonal variation of precipitation river water groundwater and soil water collected in the five nested basins we divided a hydrological year into three phases with reference to wu et al 2018 1 the spring flood and recession phase sf early april to late may for basin 1 and early march to late may for the other basins during which snow and ice melt the soil water content increases and evaporation is low 2 the summer flood and recession phase su from early june to the end of october when temperatures rainfall and evaporation increase and the active layer of the permafrost begins to thaw rewetting the unsaturated soil and 3 the winter dry period dp from early november to the end of march of the next year for basin 1 and from early november to the end of february of the next year for the other basins during which snow is the dominant form of precipitation potential evaporation is large and the basins are mostly dry and frozen 3 2 model explanations 3 2 1 data processing for data cleaning anomalous isotope values were detected using the r language r studio based on the local outlier factor method lof method after removing the isotopic outliers the rest of data all obeyed a normal distribution as indicated by a qq plot and a shapiro normality test p 0 05 descriptive statistics were performed using the pastecs package using simple linear regression to correlate δd and δ18o data based on the least squares fit lsf method for each water body to obtain a waterline the variability between data sources was checked by a one way anova p 0 05 followed by a post hoc tukey s test illustrating the difference between different sources of water bodies 3 2 2 isosource model because spring snowmelt samples could not be collected due to frozen conditions in higher altitudes and logistical issues and the snow isotopes are constantly evolving due to rain infiltration melt fractionation and refreeze sublimation the spatial variability of the snowmelt isotope signal used for calculation and quantification is highly uncertain schmieder et al 2016 therefor and as we were more interested in the runoff response to rainfall events we only performed runoff partitioning for the summer flood periods from early june to late october wu et al 2018 we used the isosource model to implement the end member mixing analysis emma hooper et al 1990 which is an approach to identify the plausibility of potential sources of water to the river and their respective contributions the emma method can determine whether the river water isotope observations all fall within the mixing map of the water source composition to avoid negative contributions the considered end members were i precipitation ii shallow soil water from a depth of approx 10 cm in the vadose zone of the active layer iii groundwater and iv lake water for the hhy station first we used as end members the monthly average of each water source second due to data scarcity only a small number of soil water samples could be averaged for each month third the soil water samples collected at station hhy were used as representative samples for basins with predominantly permafrost cover basin 1 basin 2 and soil water samples collected at station mq were used as representative samples for basins with primarily seasonal frozen soil cover basin 3 basin 4 basin 5 fourth due to the large mixing volume of the lakes we instead used the mean and standard deviation of lake water isotope data from lake ngoring in the hayr dataset 2014 2016 made by wan et al 2019 in our current work although it is difficult to clearly distinguish between event water and pre event water using the month by month isotopic emma method the end member values of the defined samples were well differentiated however as they were only sampled at the watershed outlet the issue of spatial variability in the isotopic composition of the end members was not addressed in addition evaporative enrichment of isotope values was not implemented the impact of end member definition and tracer selection on the results of nested basin runoff segmentation has been argued bansah and ali 2017 and while results could be called into question quantitatively meaning their absolute values are uncertain we assume that qualitatively they are sound meaning that their ratios to each other should be valid in summary we partitioned runoff for the five sites from june to october using the monthly averages of δ18o and δd values for precipitation groundwater shallow soil water and lake water as the source terms the isosource software was used with fractional increments fixed at 1 and tolerances no less than those calculated by the following equation 0 5 increment maximum differences between the sources 3 2 3 mixsiar model in order to simulate the contribution and variability of different water sources to runoff the mixsiar model was applied which is an open source r package that helps create and run bayesian mixing models for water source delineation mixsiar incorporates several years of advances in bayesian mixing model theory compared to older mixing models such as isosource phillips and gregg 2003 mixsir moore and semmens 2008 and siar parnell et al 2010 the traditional isosource model is the most widely used in water source partitioning and is a simple method for accurately calculating runoff components based on the conservation of mass principle provided that the number of sources is smaller than the number of tracers 1 however the isosource model is often applied in practice where the number of sources is larger than the number of isotopes 1 therefore when solving the mass conservation equation the equation will have multiple solutions and the uncertainty of the equation increases making the results more unreliable also random measurement errors and isotopic fractionation all contribute to the uncertainty in the proportional estimates in comparison mixsiar not only satisfies the case of n isotopes and more than n 1 sources but also takes into account the uncertainty of the data e g standard deviation fractionation coefficient etc leading to enhanced accuracy of the results while bayesian models offer a better water source differentiation performance the mixsiar model demands a larger data volume compared to other approaches and the smaller the standard deviation of the isotopic composition of the river water from the source end element is the more feasible the model runs the advantages and limitations of bayesian mixture models are detailed in stock et al 2018 because bayesian mixture models offer the option of specifying a priori information on the contribution of sources and are able to include fixed and random effects as covariance to reveal the variability in mixing ratios we chose a new bayesian mixture framework to quantify the uncertainty in mixing ratios we extended the total weight of the prior to equal the number of sources n which is the same as the weight for the uniform universal prior the prior information constructed on a daily basis could only roughly reflect the average proportion of mixes for the month in the bayesian model with the concentration dependence set to 0 we defaulted to the source isotopes being unaffected by fractionation and used the month by month mean and standard deviation of δ18o and δd values of precipitation groundwater shallow soil water and lake water as the source terms and the full river water isotope values for the corresponding month as the consumption term this formed an isotope pool and was entered into the bayesian model and grouped by month for simulation we used the mean assigned fraction results as a priori information for the simulation a monte carlo mcmc simulation was performed on the posterior distribution phillips et al 2005 for all variables of the converged model species and the gleman rubin diagnostic test was used to determine whether the model converged with the long model almost always satisfying variables 1 05 the mixsiar code is available at https github com brianstock mixsiar both the isosource and mixsiar models used the median values as the final simulation result and the standard deviation std dev and root mean square error rmse was used for error analysis and accuracy evaluation 3 2 4 pca analysis to determine the magnitude and extent of the influence of permafrost on runoff generation in nested watersheds at different scales and to identify the controlling factors on the origin of runoff processes 22 influencing factors reflecting watershed characteristics were selected table 1 and we applied a principal component analysis pca to gain further insight into the drivers of hydrological processes in watersheds a similar approach has been applied to study the mechanisms of watershed water loss gibson et al 2021b 4 results 4 1 seasonal variations in isotopic composition during the sf the river water isotopes at the outlets of all five basins were enriched during spring floods fig 2 contrary to the depleted isotopic signal of snowmelt water especially at the jm station basin 2 the soil water signatures also were larger than river water and groundwater with mean δ18o values of 9 38 and 9 00 at the hhy and mq stations basin 1 and 3 respectively the unusually positive soil water d excess values at hhy and mq with mean values of 12 45 and 12 00 respectively were similar to the d excess of snowmelt water during the su both precipitation and river water showed the most enriched characteristics with the largest δ18o and lowest d excess values compared to other phases at hhy basin 1 the enrichment was most pronounced in september with the river level rising by 1 12 m while ngoring lake level fell by 0 08 m at the same time which may be related to regulation by the great lakes however the isotopic changes in the other basins were opposite to the trend in runoff fig 2 where runoff increased while isotopes became depleted with the most pronounced depletion at the peak of the autumn flood and a clear lag between isotope depletion and runoff increase generally the isotopic composition of runoff was dissimilar to that of rainfall appendix figs 1 2 during the dp phase precipitation δ18o values were the lowest and soil water had the lowest d excess values during the whole year with mean values of 5 54 and 3 94 respectively which were more depleted than the d excess signal during su 5 14 and 0 52 winter soil water contained a summer evaporation signal as also indicated by throckmorton et al 2016 the isotopic values of river water returned to annual averages fig 2 and were similar for winter baseflow and spring flooding overall the intra annual seasonal variability in groundwater was minimal with the lowest range of groundwater δ18o values in jm 12 5 to 11 5 and the largest one in jg 8 7 to 12 34 appendix fig 1 overall the δ18o values of groundwater from the five basins were very similar 4 2 temporal variability of source water contributions 4 2 1 runoff partitioning results from the isosource model the results of the runoff partitioning for the five nested catchments identified by the isosource model are shown in fig 3 the runoff sources varied during permafrost thawing overall we found distinct groundwater components in all basins except basin 1 with less contributions of direct runoff from precipitation in early june the permafrost started to thaw but the first flow rise had not yet occurred and slight amounts of rainfall infiltrated the active layer the isosource model showed a dominance of soil water and groundwater as sources for runoff generation while precipitation was more or less negligible and basin 1 was additionally fed by 12 lake water precipitation had its biggest influence during july in all catchments ranging from 13 to 39 over all basins during august the influence of precipitation diminished in most catchments and soil water and groundwater contribute became dominant again at the end of the thaw period in september the second precipitation storm happened as the permafrost thaw depth reached its maximum basin 1 runoff was to a large extent fed by lake water 73 and the isosource model showed declines for the contribution of groundwater in all other basins as the active layer slowly began to freeze from the bottom up in october the groundwater contribution ratio increased again for almost all basins with the exception of basin 1 which was dominated by soil and lake water 4 2 2 runoff partitioning results from the mixsiar model the results of the mixsiar model simulation are shown in fig 4 in general similar to the isosource model the mixsiar model showed that groundwater mainly contributed to runoff with a smaller proportion of direct runoff contribution generated by rainfall in early june as was found with the isosource model groundwater and soil water were the main sources of runoff larger difference in results were found for basin 4 where the mixsiar model did not show a relatively homogeneous proportion of groundwater and soil water contributions 49 soil water and 43 groundwater unlike the isosource model where soil water contributed up to 84 in july as with the isosource model direct runoff from rainfall was highest across the catchments throughout the thaw period ranging from 11 to 41 the difference in results was more pronounced for basin 5 where the mixsiar model simulations indicated a more pronounced dominance of subsurface runoff 84 compared to 47 for the isosource model during august the contribution of runoff created by rainfall increased by 2 except for basin 3 and it increased by 15 compared to july for basin 4 for the other basins the mixsiar model simulated similar results to the isosource model with a reduced contribution of direct runoff from rainfall to river water and a more pronounced dominance of groundwater and soil water unlike the isosource model which exhibited a decrease in the ratio of groundwater runoff contribution in all basins when the thaw depth reached its maximum in september the mixsiar model showed an increase for the permafrost basin basin 2 and mostly decreases for the seasonally frozen soil basins an increase in basin 4 and a decrease in basin 3 and basin 5 with the difference between the two contributions to groundwater runoff simulations being greater in basin 2 mixsiar 86 isosource 34 in october when the active layer gradually froze there was little difference between the two model simulations and the contribution of subsurface runoff again dominated it is worth noting that the difference between the simulation results of the two models was more pronounced for basin 1 throughout the thaw period figs 3a 4a the contribution of lake runoff in basin 1 based on the isosource model was 24 double that of the mixsiar results with 11 at a time when the hydroelectric power station has not been dismantled and the proportional contribution of lake water may be over estimated overall the differences between the proportions of contribution from each source based on the isosource model simulations were relatively homogenised or too extreme compared to the mixsiar simulation results e g basin 3 groundwater runoff contribution was as high as 99 in august and october almost ignoring the proportion of direct runoff contribution from rainfall 4 3 spatial variability of source water contributions to investigate how the mechanism of runoff generation from upstream to downstream changed as the scale of the nested basin increased we averaged the contributing water sources over the entire thawing period with the exception of basin 1 which was influenced by great lakes regulation due to dam effects the results of both models for the remaining basins showed a predominance of subsurface runoff groundwater and soil water contributions isosource 84 92 90 79 mixsiar 88 90 86 82 but did not display a consistent trend towards an increasing subsurface runoff contribution with basin size both models revealed the largest contribution from groundwater runoff for basin 3 isosource 84 mixsiar 77 compared to the other basins with the smallest contribution from interflow isosource 8 mixsiar 14 with increasing size of the nested basins from basin 2 to basin 5 the isosource model results indicated an increasing and then decreasing trend in groundwater runoff contribution 54 84 55 46 respectively and the mixsiar model results indicated an increasing and then decreasing and then again increasing trend in groundwater runoff contribution 72 77 49 58 respectively with soil water contributions of both models showing a downward then upward followed again by a downward trend isosource 30 8 34 33 mixsiar 16 14 34 27 with basin 4 having the highest percentage of soil water contribution 34 in both models 4 4 pca and spearman s rank correlation coefficient analysis we performed a more detailed analysis to test our hypothesis that the impact on the runoff formation process by permafrost will not remain as influential in large scale basins and to explore factors controlling the runoff generation mechanism for nested basin in the pca results fig 5 a b the five nested basins were scattered in different quadrants indicating that the intrinsic driving mechanisms controlling flow production at different scales vary considerably with watersheds with similar drivers clustered together e g basin 3 and 4 clustering such as this could be related to similar catchment characteristics such as land use catchment shape seasonal frozen soil cover etc basins 3 4 and 5 were focused in the pc1 direction while basins 1 and 2 were concentrated in the pc2 direction without considering the basin shape characteristics fig 5a the scatter points of basins 1 3 and 4 were closer to the open waterbody area owr than other basins possibly related to the wide spread of lakes marshes and wetlands in those basins basin 1 was preferentially located close to the permafrost coverage pc transitional permafrost cover tpc and unstable permafrost cover upc the scatter points of basin 2 were closer to sub stable permafrost cover sspc permafrost coverage pc bare land br and desert cover dr which was in line with bare land and deserts being more prone to produce infiltration excess runoff the water source delineation result points of basin 3 and 4 were closest to the seasonal frozen soil cover sfc indicating the hydraulic connection between the subsurface and surface in the seasonal frozen soil area at the largest area scale basin 5 runoff processes were influenced by the area of cultivated land cr and the area of urbanization ur however after considering the inherent characteristics of the watershed itself fig 5b we found that the runoff generation in basins 3 and 4 was controlled by basin shape ke while basin length l also had a significant impact on basin 4 basin width b terrain slope s basin area a and the largest basin 5 that is the runoff formation process of the entire sayr was more closely related to cultivated land area cr and urban land area ur the tectonic conditions of these watersheds were more closely related to the larger basins 4 and 5 and we found a statistically significant positive relationship between the subsurface runoff contribution and basin length l and a positive correlation between soil water contribution and topographic gradient s fig 5b the watershed shape characteristics and topographic conditions except for mean basin elevation me had almost no effect on the runoff generation process of basins 1 and 2 to further explore the influence of the inherent e g md ke b s features and disturbed landscape e g pc upc br gr characteristics table 1 of the watershed itself on the flow production mechanisms across the sayr we applied the spearman s rank correlation coefficient method from the isosource model based simulation results the contribution from groundwater to runoff is negatively correlated with that of soil water r 0 69 p 0 05 appendix fig 3 and significantly positively correlated with watershed length r 0 6 p 0 05 while the soil water contribution was significantly positively correlated with the terrain slope of the basin r 0 47 p 0 05 the greater the topographic gradient hydraulic gradient the more likely interflow became based on the simulation results of the mixsiar model the contribution of groundwater runoff was significantly positively correlated with stable permafrost cover r 0 45 p 0 05 while isosource results indicated a negative correlation with sub stable permafrost cover r 0 53 p 0 05 in other words the more unstable the permafrost is the higher the proportion of interflow runoff and the lower the proportion of groundwater runoff generated in addition there was a positive correlation between the contribution of subsurface runoff and grassland cover which showed the importance of water storage and volatilization of infiltration from grassland to the water holding capacity of the sayr 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal variability of isotope values the seasonal variations of isotopes in precipitation soil water snowmelt water and groundwater are indicative of several hydrological processes first during spring floods sf all the rivers showed larger isotopic values than snowmelt water a result similar to that found in a large scale hydrological connectivity study in the siberian tundra ala aho et al 2018 this can be explained by mixing of depleted snowmelt with isotopically more positive soil water prior to snowmelt runoff formation and thus negligible direct runoff of snowmelt water further the similarity of the d excess of soil water and snowmelt additionally supports this theory supporting our decision to not include ground ice snowmelt as an additional end member however based on the evaporation signal of soil water the mixture of snowmelt and soil water seems to have been subjected to evaporative enrichment the large precipitation isotope values during summer floods su indicated that the sayr mainly depends on monsoonal transport of water vapor river water had the highest isotope values of the year as it was fed by possibly enriched waters sources soil water precipitation with large isotope values and or was influenced by evaporative enrichment of stream water however as precipitation was isotopically distinct from river water direct runoff by e g saturation excess overland flow can be deemed negligible in the dry winter dp the precipitation source changed to westerly transport of water vapor as indicated by the low precipitation isotope values soil water showed an evaporative signal which might indicate that part of the evaporation influenced summer precipitation was stored in the active layer mixing with the then present soil water ultimately freezing in winter since the river water isotopes during winter base flow and spring flood were similar we assume that a mixture of soil water and isotopically stable groundwater recharged the stream this was corroborated by results of both the isosource and mixsiar models showing that the majority of river water in june stemmed from soil water and groundwater while e g in july the contribution of precipitation increased figs 3 4 5 2 model performance similar to the results of the plant water calculations in the loess plateau wang et al 2019 the mixsiar model simulations had a smaller overall error in the sayr than the isosource model table 2 indicating the superiority of the mixsiar model structure itself and its applicability in permafrost areas we assumed that the mixsiar model would outperform the isosource model not only because of the higher accuracy of the mixsiar model smaller rmse but also for two reasons first we had four sources lake soil groundwater precipitation the number of tracers δ18o and δd 1 although the isosource model allows for a quantitative assessment of the contribution of water sources the simulation results can only give a feasible solution within the range of possible relative contribution values rather than exact values with a high degree of uncertainty however as the output of the bayesian model is a true probability distribution the mixsiar model provides an optimal solution based on an explicit consideration of the uncertainty and variability in the isotopic composition of water sources second studies in other nested catchments have shown that catchments with high permafrost cover have a higher yield per unit area and that thawing of the active layer has a significant control on the runoff storage capacity mcnamara et al 1998 while some studies have found that in catchments with high permafrost coverage a higher proportion of storm water precipitation enters the river as direct surface runoff or near surface loamy flow due to the lack of storage space carey and woo 1998 although the exact impact of permafrost cover types on the variability in flow production is still unclear the mixsiar model results showed an increase of groundwater contribution in the permafrost zone and a major decrease in the seasonal frozen soil zone this indicates that the mixsiar model is able to detect seasonal variations in groundwater contributions to runoff and has a better water partitioning performance than the isosource model as there is only a small likelihood that the groundwater contribution to runoff decreased simultaneously in all five nested catchments when the thaw layer reached its deepest depth in september as isosource model results indicated overall the simulation results from both models showed a small gap performance fig 3 4 although the mixsiar model performed better than the isosource model with both approaches indicating that direct surface runoff is not the most important runoff generation process in our basins and the main differences in the simulation results between the isosource and the mixsiar model were in the contributions from soil water and groundwater with the differences being largest at the outlets of basins 4 and 5 this might be related to the variability of soil moisture conditions and evapotranspiration conditions although there was a good discrimination between the selected end members and the scatter distribution of river water isotopes fell within the defined range of mixed end members with only a few samples falling outside the mixing triangle the uniform soil water sample data used for basins 2 4 and 5 introduced uncertainty into the experiment due to the lack of soil water samples which may have caused unreasonable end member contributions notably in the principal component analysis pca fig 5 we observed that the end member contributions based on isosource and mixsiar simulations were positively correlated because the vectors in the pca are at acute angles to each other indicating the consistency and reliability of the mixsiar model applied to runoff segmentation in alpine permafrost areas in fact both models are subject to uncertainty stemming from the isotope measurement and sample collection sampling techniques with high resolution and continuous monitoring are necessary to further grasp the mechanisms of runoff formation as the isotopic composition of soil moisture in the sayr was characterised by a distinct gradient cao et al 2021 due to low precipitation and strong evaporation to evaluate the plausibility of the simulation results we cited the 0 10 cm soil water content data fig 6 b simulated by zhang et al 2021 at the basin 3 outlet mq station by applying the gldas model based on measured data which is close to the sampling depth of our experiment overall the δ18o isotopic values of river water showed an opposite trend to the change in soil water content compare fig 6b and c with the higher the soil water content the more depleted the river water was in δ18o this suggests that soil water with its enriched isotope values is not the main source of runoff and that runoff is mainly and continuously replenished by water sources with more depleted isotope values i e groundwater this is consistent with the dominant contribution of groundwater to runoff fig 6d and e these results also fit the fact that the contribution of soil water to runoff is not high in july and august possibly due to the strong evaporation caused by rising temperatures and is highest in late september when the thaw layer reaches its deepest depth as the air temperature dropped the active layer started a process of freezing from the bottom up in early october with the water content of the thaw layer decreasing gradually and the surface was completely frozen by the end of october lastly the contribution of soil water drops to its original level in early june this indicates the plausibility of the simulation results of both models 5 3 dominant flow paths and inferred runoff generation processes the result that the direct runoff from rainfall during thawing was not the main contributor and that groundwater became the main source of runoff indicated that precipitation recharged shallow groundwater which then became runoff in the early thawing period june when the depth of the thaw layer was shallow and deep infiltration was prevented by the permafrost layer soil water and groundwater that accumulated on the surface of the active layer were the main sources of runoff with no significant direct runoff from precipitation yet carey and woo 1998 during july the large direct runoff in basin 2 up to 39 from isosource 41 from mixsiar may be related to the smaller catchment area and higher permafrost cover up to 84 permafrost cover although the terrain is relatively flat the 37 precipitation contribution from the isosource model of basin 5 could have been caused by the steeper topographic slopes despite being the largest catchment area combined with soil compaction caused by agricultural activities the difference in precipitation contributions might be related to differences in the thawing depth of the active layer which would affect the possible depth of soil infiltration and thus soil water dynamics wang et al 2017 2009 in august when soil hydraulic conductivity and water holding capacity was greater than at the early stage of permafrost thaw subsurface runoff should dominate but the higher proportion of direct runoff from rainfall for basin 4 mixsiar 47 may be related to the large precipitation amount 171 2 mm for this month compared to other station and additionally the small expanding area of basin 4 compared to basin 3 this will lead to saturation excess overland flow due to the short retention time in the basin in september as the depth of the active layer reached its maximum the infiltration capacity of the soil was at its largest and rainfall continued to infiltrate for groundwater storage while subsurface ice continued to melt and also replenished the groundwater possibly stronger evaporation due to the deepening of the active layer may have led to a decline in the shallow groundwater table thus showing a decrease in groundwater contribution to runoff by october the presence of frozen ice at the bottom of the active layer prevented groundwater infiltration to deeper depths the results of the freeze thaw investigation of the hayr luo et al 2014b showed that for sites with an average annual ground temperature above 0 5 c seasonal frozen soil zone the freezing process of the active layer was slow and insignificant the active layer did not freeze completely until the end of october and the freezing direction was from bottom to up this caused a significant increase in the contribution of groundwater runoff compared toits contributions in august and september furthermore the increased groundwater contribution could also be explained by the unfrozen soil taliks in the seasonal frozen soil zones that can additionally provide significant groundwater to the river the general differences in runoff generation between permafrost and seasonal frozen soil cover basins suggested that permafrost does influence runoff processes in the five basins by disrupting the infiltration depth and thus enhancing near surface lateral flow and saturation excess overland flow studies in the heihe river basin gao et al 2018 showed that basins with predominantly seasonal frozen soil cover 4200 m a s l had increased precipitation but decreased runoff with low runoff coefficients which could be explained by an increased water storage capacity of the thawed soil while basins with multi year permafrost cover 4200 m a s l had relatively consistent trends in precipitation and runoff and thus larger runoff coefficients which can be contributed to the increased ability of permafrost ice to release meltwater and the increased direct runoff caused by rainfall due to the permafrost layer blocking further infiltration it can be assumed that groundwater recharge will increase as the permafrost cover degrades leading to a stronger hydraulic connection between the surface and subsurface however at the sayr we did not find a correlation between permafrost cover and upstream to downstream changes in groundwater contribution in the nested catchments with increasing basin size and decreasing permafrost cover basins 4 and 5 did not show a stronger groundwater runoff dominance than basin 3 but rather a more dominant soil water contribution in basins 4 and 5 which mainly occurred in august and september during the peak vegetation growth period this may be related to high shrub and forest cover conditions during the thaw period in order to meet the transpiration water demand of vegetation water from the saturated zone was continuously recharged to the permafrost zone and vegetation was considered as a potential factor controlling hydrological processes in the permafrost zone influencing both the seasonal soil water dynamics and the water balance wang et al 2009 in addition the organic peatlands of the zoîgé plateau located between basin 3 and basin 4 had extensive wetland bogs with high hydraulic conductivity that can create favorable conditions for subsurface runoff storage 200 mm soil layer furthermore the slow release of water from organic soils and sphagnum plants is also responsible for the discontinuous recession of runoff from the basin it has also been found that narrow hillside watercourses heated during the thaw can occupy large saturated areas providing part of the source area for rapid subsurface runoff and continue to discharge groundwater well into autumn after the adjacent slopes freeze evans et al 2020 that said the influence of additional controlling factors impairs a clear relationship between water source contributions and permafrost cover in our studied nested watersheds 5 4 factors controlling runoff generation mechanism for nested basin fig 5 showed that the great lakes regulated runoff generation from basin 1 which provided a large storage capacity to reduce high runoff peaks and prolong low runoff due to dam effects an effect that may make it impossible to distinguish the initial contribution sources e g permafrost melt precipitation due to the storage mixing and replacement functions of the lakes without the interference of the regulation of the great lakes the permafrost thawing water can provide 13 2 16 7 of the runoff yang et al 2019 the pca results fig 5a b showed that elevation had a significant effect on the runoff generation basins 1 2 which corresponded to the finding that the seasonal frozen soil zone basins 3 4 5 was dominated by subsurface runoff this is similar to findings that basins at an altitude 4200 m a s l are dominated by seasonal frozen soil and have increased groundwater recharge gao et al 2018 we thus regarded runoff generation in the basins below the outlet of basin 2 4300 m a s l at jm station as being virtually unaffected by permafrost the low vegetation and highly exposed surface conditions have resulted in the runoff generation in excess of infiltration in basin 2 which combined with the influence of the permafrost barrier made groundwater recharge difficult and produced a higher soil water contribution the flow production mechanism in basin 3 was controlled by groundwater runoff reflecting the characteristics of groundwater catchment storage in the low lying terrain the study of st amour et al 2005 has shown that in basins with extensive swampy wetlands and widespread discontinuous permafrost cover precipitation from the upstream catchment area does not enter the river as direct flow during the storm but may be stored as groundwater for a long time and then transported to the river downstream during subsequent precipitation storms due to the narrow shape of the basin itself the runoff variation in basin 4 was more moderate than in other basins and because of the higher shrub cover and the strong water storage capacity of the vegetation roots the soil water contribution was predominant thus the runoff generation process of basin 4 was mainly controlled by the shape characteristics of the basin itself with a certain influence of the vegetation cover conditions for the largest basin basin 5 i e for the whole sayr the runoff formation process was controlled by the shape of the basin itself and topographic conditions which are more dominant than land use type and permafrost stability overall the stability of the permafrost had a stronger control on runoff generation than the degree of permafrost cover fig 7 and appendix fig 3 with the more unstable the permafrost the more easily subsurface runoff was converted to interflow in addition in the sayr the topography played an important role as with larger and longer basins groundwater storage gradually increased in line with favourable topographic conditions converging at the lowest elevation point lastly the vegetation cover was an important factor influencing the runoff sources the pca and spearman s rank correlation coefficient analysis results arguably validated our hypothesis that differences in the type of permafrost the degree of permafrost cover and the stability of permafrost did influence runoff processes at different scales of the catchment but were not decisive controlling factors before emphasizing the influence of permafrost degradation on runoff and groundwater we need to consider the characteristics of the basin itself therefore long term isotope sampling campaigns at the basin outlet are necessary and may be helpful to monitor the effects of shifts in the controlling factors on basin hydrological processes at different scales under changes in climate and anthropogenic disturbances 5 5 did the impact of permafrost on runoff processes have a scale effect our isotope data were obtained continuously at high resolution from the outlet of the nested basins and are one of the few such datasets in existence to study runoff generation processes in large scale alpine cold landscapes by assessing factors that vary with space the hypotheses are whether such a scale effect can be diluted as the basin size increases and if there are other controls that influence runoff more effectively sueker et al 2000 found that in some permafrost nested catchments there was little relationship between runoff by direct rainfall and catchment size gianfagna et al 2015 conducted a hydrological survey in nested catchments on the north slope of alaska and found that runoff ratios decreased with increasing catchment area due to permafrost limiting subsurface water storage space and wetting pre conditions utilizing basin area ratios alone can reveal relationships between upstream and downstream but in the sayr this approach was not possible the hydrological response of the catchment was impacted by the presence of permafrost the study of evans et al 2020 revealed increasing baseflow due to significant permafrost loss and enhanced groundwater surface water interactions in contrast for permafrost types with a smaller spatial extent of distribution discontinuous sporadic or no permafrost zones the increase in active layer thickness is not a driver of baseflow changes in northern eurasia catchments mcnamara et al 1998 investigated the factors controlling the allocation of old and new water contributions to runoff in nested catchments they found that reconciling contrasting patterns of the allocation of old and new water required invoking multiple explanations of processes and impacts the hydrological flow paths during snowmelt were found to be controlled by the proportion of wetland and intermediate sub basin area in 15 nested rivers in northern sweden laudon et al 2007 during the permafrost thaw period for the present study at the spatial scale we found little relationship between direct runoff and subsurface runoff with the size of the catchment our interpretation of the scale effect was that the expansion of the saturated area upstream along the narrow hillside watercourse provides part of the source area for rapid subsurface runoff until the topography gradually became gentler and eventually converges to the lowest point of the terrain mq station causing the prevailing dominant result of subsurface runoff in basin 3 thus the scale effect of permafrost on runoff generation has topography as a basis and the decisive control is also attributed to the topography with the increase in basin size the runoff formation process in basin 3 and 4 had become almost independent of the distribution of permafrost basin 5 was controlled by indicators related to land cover and also to the permafrost stability the only occurrence of extremely stable permafrost cover is closely related to the degree of development of ice marginal landforms due to the a nyêmaqên snow mountain although the contribution to runoff by the snow mountain is only 1 2 they can influence permafrost stability and in turn affect runoff in addition to the continuity of the permafrost we have to consider the vertical zonation of the permafrost it was difficult to isolate the effect of the thaw layer on runoff and the effect of permafrost on hydrological processes may have been overridden by other controlling factors as the watershed expands in extent in addition from a temporal perspective at larger scales permafrost can thaw earlier and the active layer of frozen water can be converted to interflow earlier resulting in a fault effect where the lower elevation basins downstream may not be connected to the melt water from the permafrost zone upstream this would prevent the transport of permafrost induced runoff from upstream to downstream resulting in permafrost thawing having no discernible impact on the runoff of downstream basins where basin length topographic gradient land use and asynchronous thawing may play a more significant role 5 6 topography based control of runoff processes in permafrost environments the hydrological processes in the sayr were characterized by a combination of inherent properties like topography basin length shape factor within the basin itself and landscape properties such as permafrost coverage and land use which combined to determine the hydrological processes in the basin in a widespread permafrost environment this study provided insight into how the variability of properties within a watershed combine to control flow through isotope hydrological investigations at the outlet of nested basins basin topography characteristics particularly gradient and length play a decisive role in controlling near surface soil water and subsurface runoff fig 7 summer rainfall contribution in basin 2 was related the strongest to optimal drainage conditions because permafrost acted as a semi impermeable water barrier to limit infiltration of the active layer deeper below moreover bare soil and desert dominated surface conditions allow for greater soil thaw with higher permeability and increased soil moisture consequently the contribution of summer rainfall and soil water to runoff was greater in basin 2 this was the reason why sub stable permafrost cover showed a significant negative correlation with the ratio of subsurface runoff contribution fig 7 in seasonal frozen soil basins with a low topographic gradient and extensive wetlands in the zoîgé plateau the ground was protected from deep thawing and thus had more available pore space for water storage due to sizeable cellular structure of the plants that form peatlands and the peat itself has a porosity of 72 to 93 with a strong water storage and permeability capacity the hydraulic properties of organic soils in those peatlands as a natural reservoir to homogenize floods were critical to the runoff regime combined with the shrub dominated vegetation cover that enhance the water storage capacity of the soil the study by carey and quinton 2005 found that the hydrologically responsive units in high shrub conditions accounted for 50 of the basin area with high water storage in the thawing layer during the thawing period and a water table oftentimes close to the porous surface of the organic layer which preferentially sent water rapidly to the river through soil macro pores it is also possible that the highly porous organic layer and the vegetation thermally isolated the soil by the constant saturated conditions producing large amounts of surface ice essentially preventing the downward infiltration of the melt front in summer therefore basin 3 was dominated by subsurface runoff to the river channel for watersheds with moderate topographic gradients that are hardly affected by permafrost like basin 4 5 there were no or very little restrictions by frozen ground and rainfall could infiltrate directly into the soil direct surface runoff was more prominent in basin 5 due to the low permeability of the agricultural soil and the urbanized sealed area in addition to the influence of arable and urban land use for the largest area of basin 5 the influence of topography on the runoff process played a dominant role which can be interpreted as an increase in topography controlled near surface saturated flow as the catchment area increases from the above we argue that the most important impact on the differences in yield and concentration of flow was that permafrost disrupted soil permeability to varying degrees resulting in spatial heterogeneity of runoff components and that the disruption of soil permeability by permafrost under the control of topography was only making a difference in runoff contributions when it appeared in combination with specific landscape characteristics of the catchment overall the characteristics of watershed yield and flow in different environments can provide a useful conceptual framework for the development of distributed hydrological models for the sayr in permafrost covered environments 6 conclusions this study produced detailed quantitative results on runoff sources through isotopic sampling from upstream to downstream watershed outlets which contributes to an understanding of the variability of hydrological pathways in the large natural diversity covering permafrost landscapes and environments the influence of permafrost on hydrological processes diminished significantly as the watershed scale increased and there was no clear relationship between runoff component contributions and watershed scale hydrological processes at different scales were the result of a combination of landscape elements and the physical characteristics of the watershed itself in addition the mixsiar model outperformed the isosource model in sayr for runoff generation simulations during the permafrost thaw period even so it is difficult to establish definitive conclusions at the large catchment scales 12 10 5 km2 using only one year of isotope data and the present findings are limited in the future we will work on the combination of stable isotope information and basin hydrological models to achieve coupled modelling of water stable isotopes and runoff processes increase isotope constraints reduce the mutual compromise effect and uncertainty range of each water source in the simulation process and help improve the simulation accuracy of hydrological models a more comprehensive and multifaceted evaluation of the hydro geomorphological complexity and hydrological connectivity of the sayr combining remote sensing and a more detailed

2709,in the yellow river source area sayr a large scale isotope hydrological monitoring effort of landscape heterogeneity was implemented to assess and determine whether permafrost has a controlling influence on hydrological processes in the watersheds the isosource and mixsiar models were used to partition runoff during permafrost thaw season in five nested basins from 20 930 km2 to 121 972 km2 the analysis results showed that there were significant differences in the factors controlling runoff generation in the five basins as well as significant differences in runoff sources between upper watersheds with predominantly permafrost cover and lower watersheds with predominantly seasonal frozen soil cover the influence of permafrost on runoff generation was significantly reduced with increasing basin size soil permeability was influenced by permafrost thawing which impacted runoff generation in the permafrost zone however this only became effective under a specific combination of landscape characteristics and topography in basins with less permafrost cover the topographic characteristics and conditions of the catchment itself controlled the runoff generation mechanism in general the presence of permafrost influences the runoff generation but the extent of the influence depends on the characteristics of the basin itself and in particular the control of topography increases with the scale of the basin keywords isosource model mixsiar model hydrograph separation groundwater yellow river source area sayr data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction global warming has already had an irreversible impact on the hydrological cycle and hydrological processes in sensitive and vulnerable areas kundzewicz 2008 one of the indicators that is most sensitive to global warming is permafrost thawing biskaborn et al 2019 chadburn et al 2017 which significantly influences hydrograph characteristics in cold regions lafrenière and lamoureux 2019 to investigate the hydrologic cycle and how it is impacted by global warming the stable water isotopes δ18o δ2h have been increasingly used as they have significant advantages in the analysis of runoff components water flow path tracing and especially in the identification of groundwater sources in alpine permafrost regions including the arctic and qinghai tibet plateau qtp tan et al 2021 throckmorton et al 2016 previous studies used the stable water isotopes to investigate permafrost related hydrological processes in small meso and large scale watersheds gibson et al 2021b 2021a lachniet 2016 to either trace the contribution of water sources to runoff or to study water loss from permafrost for example a 9 year study to assess runoff ratios and residence times in lake watersheds based on stable isotope mass balance models across different land cover watershed morphometry climatic drivers and permafrost thaw was carried out gibson et al 2015 the study found that the thaw features in permafrost and bogs are the main drivers that influence runoff rather than morphometric properties lachniet 2016 mapped the isotopic composition of surface waters of high relief mountain ranges in alaska usa and yukon canada and highlighted that the variation in stable isotopes of stream water was controlled by topography ala aho et al 2018 investigated the spatial and temporal variability of stable isotopes in soils lakes and rivers to evaluate hydrological connectivity across 11 of latitude based on differences in permafrost cover they observed that landscapes in permafrost areas maintain persistent hydrological connectivity between lakes the active layer and rivers stable isotopes also helped to identify the components of runoff dominated by supra permafrost water in the source region of the yangtze river li et al 2020a in addition to the ongoing emphasis on explaining the role of permafrost previous studies also investigated the role of other watershed characteristics in controlling runoff generation including topography and geology soil land cover and watershed shape characteristics many observations and model simulations confirmed that permafrost degradation led to increased runoff in arctic regions liljedahl et al 2016 while runoff in the qinghai tibet plateau tended to decrease gao et al 2016 qiu 2012 investigations in permafrost basins on the tibetan plateau found that the depth of the active layer is critical to runoff runoff increased logarithmically with increasing thawing depth of the active layer for up to 60 cm while thawing depths 60 cm resulted in reduced runoff and slower recession wang et al 2009 niu et al 2011 found that the extent to which river hydrological processes were influenced by permafrost related to the degree of permafrost coverage in western china previous empirical and mathematical estimations of the average multi year runoff in the sayr showed that rainfall groundwater recharge and snow and ice meltwater accounted for 63 15 26 18 and 9 17 of the total annual runoff respectively however these results were highly uncertain and did not take into account the influence of permafrost on hydrological processes there were also numerous investigations of changes in the hydrological cycle associated with freeze thaw processes in the sayr mainly focusing on the effects of altered hydrothermal conditions in the active layer on the water storage capacity of the soil and hence on runoff luo et al 2020 qin et al 2017 these investigations have helped to understand the mechanisms by which permafrost affects hydrological processes although previous studies have conducted long term continuous monitoring and extensive field investigations of permafrost in the sayr they mostly focused on the effects of changes in hydrothermal conditions on local permafrost and active layer profiles neglecting the role that permafrost plays on the overall basin surface the extent to which degraded permafrost increasing permafrost temperature deepening of the active layer decreasing extent of permafrost cover affects runoff is unclear and the impact of permafrost thawing on runoff yield and concentration on different scale basins has yet to be explained in order to understand how river discharge changes in permafrost environments on the large catchment scale a nested basins approach to assess the impacts of permafrost on the runoff processes has been proposed previously mcnamara et al 1998 shanley et al 2002 attempted to explain old and new water contributions to runoff using isotopes as tracers in three nested permafrost catchments but their study was conducted in small scale catchments 410 111 250 km2 measurements in larger catchments are necessary to facilitate the understanding of the effects of permafrost on hydrological processes at larger spatial scales to date no large scale studies of this kind were conducted in the sayr that compare the hydrological response of nested watersheds of different sizes and physical characteristics to infer the controls on runoff generation and its components in this regard isotope hydrograph separation ihs mcdonnell et al 2014 has proven to be advantageous in understanding the mechanisms of runoff formation in the high altitude permafrost zone li et al 2020b 2020c additionally recently there has been an increase in using mixsiar models which are based on a bayesian theoretical framework to assess the contribution of river water sources beria et al 2020 birkel et al 2021 these models were previously mostly used to identify plant water sources and studies have revealed the potential for the application of bayesian mixing models in hydrology beria et al 2020 however so far the application of mixsiar models in the permafrost zone is rare the present study aimed at addressing both issues 1 to assess the influence of permafrost on runoff generation for different large scale nested basins and 2 to determine whether the mixsiar model is applicable in assessing runoff generation in permafrost areas we used extensive continuous isotope datasets of five large scale nested basins to determine the controlling factors and related processes of runoff generation to do this we describe two approaches to runoff source partitioning and the implementation of a large scale isotope hydrological survey across a range of hydro climatic conditions and landscape characteristics our hypothesis is that permafrost control of hydrological processes in large scale basins will be less pronounced than for smaller catchments and that on the large scale other catchment characteristics will dominate runoff generation thus we propose that permafrost will no longer be the primary controlling factor with increasing watershed size our main objectives are 1 to evaluate the applicability of the mixsiar model for runoff partitioning in permafrost areas and to systematically compare the performance of end member mixing analysis emma and bayesian methods 2 to quantitatively assess runoff generation under a diverse range of hydrological regimes in the sayr through isotopic runoff partitioning methods 3 to understand the influence of permafrost on runoff sources precipitation soil water groundwater 4 to capture the internal controlling factors of runoff generation in nested basins and 5 to provide parametric validation for large scale distributed hydrological models 2 study area the sayr above the tanag hydrological station 32 10 36 7 n 95 54 103 24 e 2 684 6 245 m a s l is situated in the northeast of qtp fig 1 which is deemed the largest flow producing region in the yellow river yr basin the most important ecological function region and main recharge region of freshwater resources in china as well as one of asia s regions that is highly susceptible to climate change the climate of the sayr is a typical plateau continental climate with hot and wet summers and cold and dry winters small annual but large daily temperature differences and long sunshine hours with strong radiation the sayr average annual temperature decreases from east to west and from south to north with increasing altitude for the madoi and maqin county it is below 3 0 while the annual temperature of maqu and xinghai county is over 1 5 the sayr lies on the edge of the interlaced belt controlled by the indian ocean south asian monsoon and the pacific ocean east asian monsoon with average annual precipitation of 484 2 mm due to the high altitude dry air little precipitation as well as good atmospheric transparency the annual potential evaporation is between 730 mm and 1 700 mm in 2017 the maqu meteorological station recorded the warmest and wettest year with the highest recorded annual precipitation of 703 mm and the highest average annual temperature of 3 13 c in 2018 the madoi meteorological station recorded the coldest and driest year with the lowest temperature of 4 2 c an annual precipitation of 472 mm and the highest potential evaporation of 1 321 mm the yr originates in the western part in the area of madoi county qinghai province which is a wide valley zone of the lake basin at an altitude of over 4 200 m a s l the yr then flows into the broad river valley of the xingxuhai region which features many lakes and is the largest wetland in the sayr on its course to the tanag hydrological station the main stream describes an s shape fig 1 the length of the main stream in the source area is 1 959 km with a drop in altitude of 2 768 m from upstream to downstream and an average specific drop of 1 47 the headwater area of the yr in the uppermost basin hayr is characterized by wide flooding plains and multiple lakes and wetlands it is largely dominated by braided rivers and unconfined sections spreading across its floodplain wetlands with an overall gradient of 0 4 there is low sediment transport due to the low slopes runoff is regulated by the great lakes and human activities all the year round and during spring thaw the snow melt runoff is mostly retained in the first hydropower station of the hayr fhsh reservoir with only a small amount being released resulting in a single snow melt hydrograph peak fig 1 the fhsh dam was removed in september 2018 which increased the annual streamflow by 123 210 2018 2019 ma et al 2021 which did not significantly affect the lower basin runoff the huangheyan hhy hydrological station of the uppermost hayr basin accounted for 25 8 and 4 of the flow at the downstream stations of jimai jm maqu mq and tanag tng during 1968 1975 ma et al 2021 indicating that the influence of upstream water on downstream runoff is gradually disappearing previous studies showed that the runoff and precipitation both show a double peaked feature with one peak in july and another in september during 1960 2019 not including the headwater of the yellow river overall annual runoff increases more than annual precipitation 2 5 yr 1 vs 1 01 yr 1 li et al 2021 the contribution of glacier melt from the a nyêmaqên mountain to yr runoff at the tanag gauging station is only 1 2 ma et al 2019 detailed information on the climate topography permafrost and vegetation for the five study basins can be found in literature blue et al 2013 ma et al 2019 alpine frozen desert soil is predominantly distributed at 4 000 5 200 m a s l where mostly sparse rocky lichens and small cushion plants with no agricultural use are growing below that at 3 000 4 000 m a s l alpine meadow soil and mountain meadow soil are found with mostly alpine meadow as vegetation cover of up to 40 90 it is an ideal summer pasture and the thickness of the chernozem soil can reach 60 80 cm lastly deep chestnut soil is mainly distributed in 2 500 3 400 m a s l which is rich in humus the vegetation cover is 60 80 and the main land use type is farmland the hydrogeology is complex and variable especially the dynamic changes of the supra permafrost water are extremely unstable within and between years the groundwater types are mainly bedrock supra permafrost water loose rock supra permafrost water and sub permafrost water in the permafrost zone and loose rock pore water in the non permafrost area and the thaw zones regarding permafrost the sayr is located in the transition zone between discontinuous 25 90 permafrost and seasonal frozen soil with a ratio of 43 8 permafrost and 56 2 seasonal frozen soil permafrost is mainly found above 4 000 m a s l and seasonal frozen soil is mainly found below this altitude as most previous studies focused on the hayr basin discontinuous permafrost area less data was available for the downstream basins the permafrost thickness in the hayr is generally 40 m with a measured maximum thickness of 74 m it is influenced by altitude latitude slope soil texture and local factors with strong spatial variability in recent years perennial permafrost has gradually degraded with seasonal frozen soil thickness thinning and shorter freezing periods model validated and field measured soil temperature data indicated that the thickness of the active layer increased from 1 8 m in 1980 to 2 4 m in 2006 with an average growth rate of 2 2 cm yr 1 luo et al 2014a b over the past 50 years the permafrost zone in the basin has shrunk from 2 4 10 4 km2 to 2 2 10 4 km2 and the active layer has increased from 1 4 m to 2 4 m due to climate warming luo et al 2014b more details about climate geomorphology permafrost and vegetation characteristics for individual nested basins are shown in table 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 field sampling laboratory analysis this work included five nested basins increasing in size basin 1 the catchment above huangheyan hydrologic station hhy 20 930 km2 basin 2 above the jimai hydrologic station jm 45 019 km2 basin 3 above the maqu hydrologic station mq 86 048 km2 basin 4 above the jungong hydrologic station jg 98 414 km2 and basin 5 above the tanag hydrologic station tng 121 972 km2 respectively fig 2 we collected 2 622 isotopic samples from all five basin outlets upstream to downstream of the sayr in 2017 a one year high temporal resolution continuous sampling was conducted and the sampling of hhy was carried out in 2018 as the endmembers for runoff generation were not known beforehand due to the complex hydrological processes we decided to sample atmospheric precipitation river water groundwater soil water and shallow ground ice systematically as replicates 3 1 1 precipitation samples a year long precipitation sampling was conducted in 2018 for hhy and in 2017 for all other stations we collected 136 146 130 60 and 72 precipitation samples including rainfall and snowfall at the five hydrological stations hhy jm mq jg and tng respectively the daily cumulative precipitation was collected using standard pit type rain barrels while ensuring that the barrels were level with the ground to avoid sources of pollution and the collected rainfall or snowfall was manually filled into polyethylene sample bottles for sealed storage after each precipitation event in the future throughfall samples should be collected as precipitation that was intercepted by plant canopies can influence results of isotope tracer studies stockinger et al 2015 3 1 2 river water samples due to the harsh environment the river water of hhy was sampled from may 2018 onwards while the other stations were sampled in a year long continuous campaign from january to december 2017 237 340 360 352 and 353 river water samples were collected as manual grab samples at hhy jm mq jg and tng respectively the samples were taken at a section 10 m distant to the hydrological station from 0 5 to 1 cm below the water surface manual borehole sampling was carried out during the icing period avoiding contamination where water flow was evident beneath the ice polyethylene sampling bottles were first washed three times with river water samples and then sealed to avoid headspace evaporation and two water samples were collected at 8 am each day 3 1 3 groundwater samples we collected 67 54 80 68 and 72 groundwater samples in the vicinity of the five hydrological stations from january to december of the corresponding hydrological year the nearest accessible wells to each of the stations were selected for sampling the farthest distance was 5 km which are located in madoi dar maqu county jungong and tangnaihai township we used a medium sized submersible vacuum pump for low speed sampling and samples were taken after pumping out the well volume samples were put into polyethylene bottles after rinsing three times and sealed taken first at a depth of 0 5 m below the groundwater surface due to the logistical challenges no further stratified sampling was undertaken 3 1 4 soil water and shallow ground ice samples we only carried out monthly soil water sampling in the active layer and the ground ice near the permafrost table was collected in a depth of 0 1 2 m within 5 km of the hhy and mq hydrological stations from april to december of the corresponding hydrological year overall a total of 63 soil water samples and 31 ground ice samples were collected with 33 of the soil water and 14 of the ground ice samples were collected near the mq hydrological station we dug two 1 5 m deep permafrost boreholes using a type 100 hydraulic drill rig to collect the observed shallow surface soil water and exposed ground ice sampling was carried out similar to the method employed by cao et al 2021 our boreholes were too shallow to allow for stratified sampling for more detailed studies however the collection of soil water should be supplemented with a stratification approach in the future although this presents some sampling difficulties 3 1 5 measurement of δ18o and δd twenty samples were discarded due to missing collection or damaged sample labels during transportation all water samples were sealed and then sent to the isotope platform at the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering hohai university for storage at 4 after filtering with 0 22 µm aqueous filters δ18o and δd ratios were measured using a picarro l2130 i high precision liquid water isotope analyser the reference standard is the vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water as defined by craig 1961 and gonfiantini 1978 the precision of δ18o and δd was maintained at 0 2 and 0 8 respectively the d excess was calculated based on the relationship between δd and δ18o content in fresh water on a global scale the global meteoric water line as defined by dansgaard 1964 the hydrogen and oxygen isotope data in this study were in agreement with the range of data from li et al 2020a at several of the same sampling transects from 2013 to 2015 indicating the accuracy of our experimental results 3 1 6 data for runoff climate and cryosphere we obtained discharge data from the hydrological yearbook compiled by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china the china meteorological data website https data cma cn provided daily meteorological data including precipitation air and ground temperature from the five weather stations located in the vicinity of the hydrological stations fig 1 this data was used to explain variability in isotopes of the taken water samples the permafrost distribution and classification are cited from zou et al 2017 and the data on land use type are from xu 2019 and permafrost thermal stability are from ran et al 2021 this work used the mean annual ground temperature 2005 2015 to classify the thermal stability types of permafrost where 5 0 c is extremely stable 3 0 to 5 0 c is stable 1 5 to 3 0 c is sub stable 0 5 to 1 5 c is transitional and 0 5 c is unstable type also compare to table 1 the watershed characteristic properties were analysed based on the dem images at 30 m resolution from usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov basic parameters for each basin were extracted from arcgis map 10 2 for subsequent analysis table 1 3 1 7 seasonal variability of runoff sources to better understand the isotopic seasonal variation of precipitation river water groundwater and soil water collected in the five nested basins we divided a hydrological year into three phases with reference to wu et al 2018 1 the spring flood and recession phase sf early april to late may for basin 1 and early march to late may for the other basins during which snow and ice melt the soil water content increases and evaporation is low 2 the summer flood and recession phase su from early june to the end of october when temperatures rainfall and evaporation increase and the active layer of the permafrost begins to thaw rewetting the unsaturated soil and 3 the winter dry period dp from early november to the end of march of the next year for basin 1 and from early november to the end of february of the next year for the other basins during which snow is the dominant form of precipitation potential evaporation is large and the basins are mostly dry and frozen 3 2 model explanations 3 2 1 data processing for data cleaning anomalous isotope values were detected using the r language r studio based on the local outlier factor method lof method after removing the isotopic outliers the rest of data all obeyed a normal distribution as indicated by a qq plot and a shapiro normality test p 0 05 descriptive statistics were performed using the pastecs package using simple linear regression to correlate δd and δ18o data based on the least squares fit lsf method for each water body to obtain a waterline the variability between data sources was checked by a one way anova p 0 05 followed by a post hoc tukey s test illustrating the difference between different sources of water bodies 3 2 2 isosource model because spring snowmelt samples could not be collected due to frozen conditions in higher altitudes and logistical issues and the snow isotopes are constantly evolving due to rain infiltration melt fractionation and refreeze sublimation the spatial variability of the snowmelt isotope signal used for calculation and quantification is highly uncertain schmieder et al 2016 therefor and as we were more interested in the runoff response to rainfall events we only performed runoff partitioning for the summer flood periods from early june to late october wu et al 2018 we used the isosource model to implement the end member mixing analysis emma hooper et al 1990 which is an approach to identify the plausibility of potential sources of water to the river and their respective contributions the emma method can determine whether the river water isotope observations all fall within the mixing map of the water source composition to avoid negative contributions the considered end members were i precipitation ii shallow soil water from a depth of approx 10 cm in the vadose zone of the active layer iii groundwater and iv lake water for the hhy station first we used as end members the monthly average of each water source second due to data scarcity only a small number of soil water samples could be averaged for each month third the soil water samples collected at station hhy were used as representative samples for basins with predominantly permafrost cover basin 1 basin 2 and soil water samples collected at station mq were used as representative samples for basins with primarily seasonal frozen soil cover basin 3 basin 4 basin 5 fourth due to the large mixing volume of the lakes we instead used the mean and standard deviation of lake water isotope data from lake ngoring in the hayr dataset 2014 2016 made by wan et al 2019 in our current work although it is difficult to clearly distinguish between event water and pre event water using the month by month isotopic emma method the end member values of the defined samples were well differentiated however as they were only sampled at the watershed outlet the issue of spatial variability in the isotopic composition of the end members was not addressed in addition evaporative enrichment of isotope values was not implemented the impact of end member definition and tracer selection on the results of nested basin runoff segmentation has been argued bansah and ali 2017 and while results could be called into question quantitatively meaning their absolute values are uncertain we assume that qualitatively they are sound meaning that their ratios to each other should be valid in summary we partitioned runoff for the five sites from june to october using the monthly averages of δ18o and δd values for precipitation groundwater shallow soil water and lake water as the source terms the isosource software was used with fractional increments fixed at 1 and tolerances no less than those calculated by the following equation 0 5 increment maximum differences between the sources 3 2 3 mixsiar model in order to simulate the contribution and variability of different water sources to runoff the mixsiar model was applied which is an open source r package that helps create and run bayesian mixing models for water source delineation mixsiar incorporates several years of advances in bayesian mixing model theory compared to older mixing models such as isosource phillips and gregg 2003 mixsir moore and semmens 2008 and siar parnell et al 2010 the traditional isosource model is the most widely used in water source partitioning and is a simple method for accurately calculating runoff components based on the conservation of mass principle provided that the number of sources is smaller than the number of tracers 1 however the isosource model is often applied in practice where the number of sources is larger than the number of isotopes 1 therefore when solving the mass conservation equation the equation will have multiple solutions and the uncertainty of the equation increases making the results more unreliable also random measurement errors and isotopic fractionation all contribute to the uncertainty in the proportional estimates in comparison mixsiar not only satisfies the case of n isotopes and more than n 1 sources but also takes into account the uncertainty of the data e g standard deviation fractionation coefficient etc leading to enhanced accuracy of the results while bayesian models offer a better water source differentiation performance the mixsiar model demands a larger data volume compared to other approaches and the smaller the standard deviation of the isotopic composition of the river water from the source end element is the more feasible the model runs the advantages and limitations of bayesian mixture models are detailed in stock et al 2018 because bayesian mixture models offer the option of specifying a priori information on the contribution of sources and are able to include fixed and random effects as covariance to reveal the variability in mixing ratios we chose a new bayesian mixture framework to quantify the uncertainty in mixing ratios we extended the total weight of the prior to equal the number of sources n which is the same as the weight for the uniform universal prior the prior information constructed on a daily basis could only roughly reflect the average proportion of mixes for the month in the bayesian model with the concentration dependence set to 0 we defaulted to the source isotopes being unaffected by fractionation and used the month by month mean and standard deviation of δ18o and δd values of precipitation groundwater shallow soil water and lake water as the source terms and the full river water isotope values for the corresponding month as the consumption term this formed an isotope pool and was entered into the bayesian model and grouped by month for simulation we used the mean assigned fraction results as a priori information for the simulation a monte carlo mcmc simulation was performed on the posterior distribution phillips et al 2005 for all variables of the converged model species and the gleman rubin diagnostic test was used to determine whether the model converged with the long model almost always satisfying variables 1 05 the mixsiar code is available at https github com brianstock mixsiar both the isosource and mixsiar models used the median values as the final simulation result and the standard deviation std dev and root mean square error rmse was used for error analysis and accuracy evaluation 3 2 4 pca analysis to determine the magnitude and extent of the influence of permafrost on runoff generation in nested watersheds at different scales and to identify the controlling factors on the origin of runoff processes 22 influencing factors reflecting watershed characteristics were selected table 1 and we applied a principal component analysis pca to gain further insight into the drivers of hydrological processes in watersheds a similar approach has been applied to study the mechanisms of watershed water loss gibson et al 2021b 4 results 4 1 seasonal variations in isotopic composition during the sf the river water isotopes at the outlets of all five basins were enriched during spring floods fig 2 contrary to the depleted isotopic signal of snowmelt water especially at the jm station basin 2 the soil water signatures also were larger than river water and groundwater with mean δ18o values of 9 38 and 9 00 at the hhy and mq stations basin 1 and 3 respectively the unusually positive soil water d excess values at hhy and mq with mean values of 12 45 and 12 00 respectively were similar to the d excess of snowmelt water during the su both precipitation and river water showed the most enriched characteristics with the largest δ18o and lowest d excess values compared to other phases at hhy basin 1 the enrichment was most pronounced in september with the river level rising by 1 12 m while ngoring lake level fell by 0 08 m at the same time which may be related to regulation by the great lakes however the isotopic changes in the other basins were opposite to the trend in runoff fig 2 where runoff increased while isotopes became depleted with the most pronounced depletion at the peak of the autumn flood and a clear lag between isotope depletion and runoff increase generally the isotopic composition of runoff was dissimilar to that of rainfall appendix figs 1 2 during the dp phase precipitation δ18o values were the lowest and soil water had the lowest d excess values during the whole year with mean values of 5 54 and 3 94 respectively which were more depleted than the d excess signal during su 5 14 and 0 52 winter soil water contained a summer evaporation signal as also indicated by throckmorton et al 2016 the isotopic values of river water returned to annual averages fig 2 and were similar for winter baseflow and spring flooding overall the intra annual seasonal variability in groundwater was minimal with the lowest range of groundwater δ18o values in jm 12 5 to 11 5 and the largest one in jg 8 7 to 12 34 appendix fig 1 overall the δ18o values of groundwater from the five basins were very similar 4 2 temporal variability of source water contributions 4 2 1 runoff partitioning results from the isosource model the results of the runoff partitioning for the five nested catchments identified by the isosource model are shown in fig 3 the runoff sources varied during permafrost thawing overall we found distinct groundwater components in all basins except basin 1 with less contributions of direct runoff from precipitation in early june the permafrost started to thaw but the first flow rise had not yet occurred and slight amounts of rainfall infiltrated the active layer the isosource model showed a dominance of soil water and groundwater as sources for runoff generation while precipitation was more or less negligible and basin 1 was additionally fed by 12 lake water precipitation had its biggest influence during july in all catchments ranging from 13 to 39 over all basins during august the influence of precipitation diminished in most catchments and soil water and groundwater contribute became dominant again at the end of the thaw period in september the second precipitation storm happened as the permafrost thaw depth reached its maximum basin 1 runoff was to a large extent fed by lake water 73 and the isosource model showed declines for the contribution of groundwater in all other basins as the active layer slowly began to freeze from the bottom up in october the groundwater contribution ratio increased again for almost all basins with the exception of basin 1 which was dominated by soil and lake water 4 2 2 runoff partitioning results from the mixsiar model the results of the mixsiar model simulation are shown in fig 4 in general similar to the isosource model the mixsiar model showed that groundwater mainly contributed to runoff with a smaller proportion of direct runoff contribution generated by rainfall in early june as was found with the isosource model groundwater and soil water were the main sources of runoff larger difference in results were found for basin 4 where the mixsiar model did not show a relatively homogeneous proportion of groundwater and soil water contributions 49 soil water and 43 groundwater unlike the isosource model where soil water contributed up to 84 in july as with the isosource model direct runoff from rainfall was highest across the catchments throughout the thaw period ranging from 11 to 41 the difference in results was more pronounced for basin 5 where the mixsiar model simulations indicated a more pronounced dominance of subsurface runoff 84 compared to 47 for the isosource model during august the contribution of runoff created by rainfall increased by 2 except for basin 3 and it increased by 15 compared to july for basin 4 for the other basins the mixsiar model simulated similar results to the isosource model with a reduced contribution of direct runoff from rainfall to river water and a more pronounced dominance of groundwater and soil water unlike the isosource model which exhibited a decrease in the ratio of groundwater runoff contribution in all basins when the thaw depth reached its maximum in september the mixsiar model showed an increase for the permafrost basin basin 2 and mostly decreases for the seasonally frozen soil basins an increase in basin 4 and a decrease in basin 3 and basin 5 with the difference between the two contributions to groundwater runoff simulations being greater in basin 2 mixsiar 86 isosource 34 in october when the active layer gradually froze there was little difference between the two model simulations and the contribution of subsurface runoff again dominated it is worth noting that the difference between the simulation results of the two models was more pronounced for basin 1 throughout the thaw period figs 3a 4a the contribution of lake runoff in basin 1 based on the isosource model was 24 double that of the mixsiar results with 11 at a time when the hydroelectric power station has not been dismantled and the proportional contribution of lake water may be over estimated overall the differences between the proportions of contribution from each source based on the isosource model simulations were relatively homogenised or too extreme compared to the mixsiar simulation results e g basin 3 groundwater runoff contribution was as high as 99 in august and october almost ignoring the proportion of direct runoff contribution from rainfall 4 3 spatial variability of source water contributions to investigate how the mechanism of runoff generation from upstream to downstream changed as the scale of the nested basin increased we averaged the contributing water sources over the entire thawing period with the exception of basin 1 which was influenced by great lakes regulation due to dam effects the results of both models for the remaining basins showed a predominance of subsurface runoff groundwater and soil water contributions isosource 84 92 90 79 mixsiar 88 90 86 82 but did not display a consistent trend towards an increasing subsurface runoff contribution with basin size both models revealed the largest contribution from groundwater runoff for basin 3 isosource 84 mixsiar 77 compared to the other basins with the smallest contribution from interflow isosource 8 mixsiar 14 with increasing size of the nested basins from basin 2 to basin 5 the isosource model results indicated an increasing and then decreasing trend in groundwater runoff contribution 54 84 55 46 respectively and the mixsiar model results indicated an increasing and then decreasing and then again increasing trend in groundwater runoff contribution 72 77 49 58 respectively with soil water contributions of both models showing a downward then upward followed again by a downward trend isosource 30 8 34 33 mixsiar 16 14 34 27 with basin 4 having the highest percentage of soil water contribution 34 in both models 4 4 pca and spearman s rank correlation coefficient analysis we performed a more detailed analysis to test our hypothesis that the impact on the runoff formation process by permafrost will not remain as influential in large scale basins and to explore factors controlling the runoff generation mechanism for nested basin in the pca results fig 5 a b the five nested basins were scattered in different quadrants indicating that the intrinsic driving mechanisms controlling flow production at different scales vary considerably with watersheds with similar drivers clustered together e g basin 3 and 4 clustering such as this could be related to similar catchment characteristics such as land use catchment shape seasonal frozen soil cover etc basins 3 4 and 5 were focused in the pc1 direction while basins 1 and 2 were concentrated in the pc2 direction without considering the basin shape characteristics fig 5a the scatter points of basins 1 3 and 4 were closer to the open waterbody area owr than other basins possibly related to the wide spread of lakes marshes and wetlands in those basins basin 1 was preferentially located close to the permafrost coverage pc transitional permafrost cover tpc and unstable permafrost cover upc the scatter points of basin 2 were closer to sub stable permafrost cover sspc permafrost coverage pc bare land br and desert cover dr which was in line with bare land and deserts being more prone to produce infiltration excess runoff the water source delineation result points of basin 3 and 4 were closest to the seasonal frozen soil cover sfc indicating the hydraulic connection between the subsurface and surface in the seasonal frozen soil area at the largest area scale basin 5 runoff processes were influenced by the area of cultivated land cr and the area of urbanization ur however after considering the inherent characteristics of the watershed itself fig 5b we found that the runoff generation in basins 3 and 4 was controlled by basin shape ke while basin length l also had a significant impact on basin 4 basin width b terrain slope s basin area a and the largest basin 5 that is the runoff formation process of the entire sayr was more closely related to cultivated land area cr and urban land area ur the tectonic conditions of these watersheds were more closely related to the larger basins 4 and 5 and we found a statistically significant positive relationship between the subsurface runoff contribution and basin length l and a positive correlation between soil water contribution and topographic gradient s fig 5b the watershed shape characteristics and topographic conditions except for mean basin elevation me had almost no effect on the runoff generation process of basins 1 and 2 to further explore the influence of the inherent e g md ke b s features and disturbed landscape e g pc upc br gr characteristics table 1 of the watershed itself on the flow production mechanisms across the sayr we applied the spearman s rank correlation coefficient method from the isosource model based simulation results the contribution from groundwater to runoff is negatively correlated with that of soil water r 0 69 p 0 05 appendix fig 3 and significantly positively correlated with watershed length r 0 6 p 0 05 while the soil water contribution was significantly positively correlated with the terrain slope of the basin r 0 47 p 0 05 the greater the topographic gradient hydraulic gradient the more likely interflow became based on the simulation results of the mixsiar model the contribution of groundwater runoff was significantly positively correlated with stable permafrost cover r 0 45 p 0 05 while isosource results indicated a negative correlation with sub stable permafrost cover r 0 53 p 0 05 in other words the more unstable the permafrost is the higher the proportion of interflow runoff and the lower the proportion of groundwater runoff generated in addition there was a positive correlation between the contribution of subsurface runoff and grassland cover which showed the importance of water storage and volatilization of infiltration from grassland to the water holding capacity of the sayr 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal variability of isotope values the seasonal variations of isotopes in precipitation soil water snowmelt water and groundwater are indicative of several hydrological processes first during spring floods sf all the rivers showed larger isotopic values than snowmelt water a result similar to that found in a large scale hydrological connectivity study in the siberian tundra ala aho et al 2018 this can be explained by mixing of depleted snowmelt with isotopically more positive soil water prior to snowmelt runoff formation and thus negligible direct runoff of snowmelt water further the similarity of the d excess of soil water and snowmelt additionally supports this theory supporting our decision to not include ground ice snowmelt as an additional end member however based on the evaporation signal of soil water the mixture of snowmelt and soil water seems to have been subjected to evaporative enrichment the large precipitation isotope values during summer floods su indicated that the sayr mainly depends on monsoonal transport of water vapor river water had the highest isotope values of the year as it was fed by possibly enriched waters sources soil water precipitation with large isotope values and or was influenced by evaporative enrichment of stream water however as precipitation was isotopically distinct from river water direct runoff by e g saturation excess overland flow can be deemed negligible in the dry winter dp the precipitation source changed to westerly transport of water vapor as indicated by the low precipitation isotope values soil water showed an evaporative signal which might indicate that part of the evaporation influenced summer precipitation was stored in the active layer mixing with the then present soil water ultimately freezing in winter since the river water isotopes during winter base flow and spring flood were similar we assume that a mixture of soil water and isotopically stable groundwater recharged the stream this was corroborated by results of both the isosource and mixsiar models showing that the majority of river water in june stemmed from soil water and groundwater while e g in july the contribution of precipitation increased figs 3 4 5 2 model performance similar to the results of the plant water calculations in the loess plateau wang et al 2019 the mixsiar model simulations had a smaller overall error in the sayr than the isosource model table 2 indicating the superiority of the mixsiar model structure itself and its applicability in permafrost areas we assumed that the mixsiar model would outperform the isosource model not only because of the higher accuracy of the mixsiar model smaller rmse but also for two reasons first we had four sources lake soil groundwater precipitation the number of tracers δ18o and δd 1 although the isosource model allows for a quantitative assessment of the contribution of water sources the simulation results can only give a feasible solution within the range of possible relative contribution values rather than exact values with a high degree of uncertainty however as the output of the bayesian model is a true probability distribution the mixsiar model provides an optimal solution based on an explicit consideration of the uncertainty and variability in the isotopic composition of water sources second studies in other nested catchments have shown that catchments with high permafrost cover have a higher yield per unit area and that thawing of the active layer has a significant control on the runoff storage capacity mcnamara et al 1998 while some studies have found that in catchments with high permafrost coverage a higher proportion of storm water precipitation enters the river as direct surface runoff or near surface loamy flow due to the lack of storage space carey and woo 1998 although the exact impact of permafrost cover types on the variability in flow production is still unclear the mixsiar model results showed an increase of groundwater contribution in the permafrost zone and a major decrease in the seasonal frozen soil zone this indicates that the mixsiar model is able to detect seasonal variations in groundwater contributions to runoff and has a better water partitioning performance than the isosource model as there is only a small likelihood that the groundwater contribution to runoff decreased simultaneously in all five nested catchments when the thaw layer reached its deepest depth in september as isosource model results indicated overall the simulation results from both models showed a small gap performance fig 3 4 although the mixsiar model performed better than the isosource model with both approaches indicating that direct surface runoff is not the most important runoff generation process in our basins and the main differences in the simulation results between the isosource and the mixsiar model were in the contributions from soil water and groundwater with the differences being largest at the outlets of basins 4 and 5 this might be related to the variability of soil moisture conditions and evapotranspiration conditions although there was a good discrimination between the selected end members and the scatter distribution of river water isotopes fell within the defined range of mixed end members with only a few samples falling outside the mixing triangle the uniform soil water sample data used for basins 2 4 and 5 introduced uncertainty into the experiment due to the lack of soil water samples which may have caused unreasonable end member contributions notably in the principal component analysis pca fig 5 we observed that the end member contributions based on isosource and mixsiar simulations were positively correlated because the vectors in the pca are at acute angles to each other indicating the consistency and reliability of the mixsiar model applied to runoff segmentation in alpine permafrost areas in fact both models are subject to uncertainty stemming from the isotope measurement and sample collection sampling techniques with high resolution and continuous monitoring are necessary to further grasp the mechanisms of runoff formation as the isotopic composition of soil moisture in the sayr was characterised by a distinct gradient cao et al 2021 due to low precipitation and strong evaporation to evaluate the plausibility of the simulation results we cited the 0 10 cm soil water content data fig 6 b simulated by zhang et al 2021 at the basin 3 outlet mq station by applying the gldas model based on measured data which is close to the sampling depth of our experiment overall the δ18o isotopic values of river water showed an opposite trend to the change in soil water content compare fig 6b and c with the higher the soil water content the more depleted the river water was in δ18o this suggests that soil water with its enriched isotope values is not the main source of runoff and that runoff is mainly and continuously replenished by water sources with more depleted isotope values i e groundwater this is consistent with the dominant contribution of groundwater to runoff fig 6d and e these results also fit the fact that the contribution of soil water to runoff is not high in july and august possibly due to the strong evaporation caused by rising temperatures and is highest in late september when the thaw layer reaches its deepest depth as the air temperature dropped the active layer started a process of freezing from the bottom up in early october with the water content of the thaw layer decreasing gradually and the surface was completely frozen by the end of october lastly the contribution of soil water drops to its original level in early june this indicates the plausibility of the simulation results of both models 5 3 dominant flow paths and inferred runoff generation processes the result that the direct runoff from rainfall during thawing was not the main contributor and that groundwater became the main source of runoff indicated that precipitation recharged shallow groundwater which then became runoff in the early thawing period june when the depth of the thaw layer was shallow and deep infiltration was prevented by the permafrost layer soil water and groundwater that accumulated on the surface of the active layer were the main sources of runoff with no significant direct runoff from precipitation yet carey and woo 1998 during july the large direct runoff in basin 2 up to 39 from isosource 41 from mixsiar may be related to the smaller catchment area and higher permafrost cover up to 84 permafrost cover although the terrain is relatively flat the 37 precipitation contribution from the isosource model of basin 5 could have been caused by the steeper topographic slopes despite being the largest catchment area combined with soil compaction caused by agricultural activities the difference in precipitation contributions might be related to differences in the thawing depth of the active layer which would affect the possible depth of soil infiltration and thus soil water dynamics wang et al 2017 2009 in august when soil hydraulic conductivity and water holding capacity was greater than at the early stage of permafrost thaw subsurface runoff should dominate but the higher proportion of direct runoff from rainfall for basin 4 mixsiar 47 may be related to the large precipitation amount 171 2 mm for this month compared to other station and additionally the small expanding area of basin 4 compared to basin 3 this will lead to saturation excess overland flow due to the short retention time in the basin in september as the depth of the active layer reached its maximum the infiltration capacity of the soil was at its largest and rainfall continued to infiltrate for groundwater storage while subsurface ice continued to melt and also replenished the groundwater possibly stronger evaporation due to the deepening of the active layer may have led to a decline in the shallow groundwater table thus showing a decrease in groundwater contribution to runoff by october the presence of frozen ice at the bottom of the active layer prevented groundwater infiltration to deeper depths the results of the freeze thaw investigation of the hayr luo et al 2014b showed that for sites with an average annual ground temperature above 0 5 c seasonal frozen soil zone the freezing process of the active layer was slow and insignificant the active layer did not freeze completely until the end of october and the freezing direction was from bottom to up this caused a significant increase in the contribution of groundwater runoff compared toits contributions in august and september furthermore the increased groundwater contribution could also be explained by the unfrozen soil taliks in the seasonal frozen soil zones that can additionally provide significant groundwater to the river the general differences in runoff generation between permafrost and seasonal frozen soil cover basins suggested that permafrost does influence runoff processes in the five basins by disrupting the infiltration depth and thus enhancing near surface lateral flow and saturation excess overland flow studies in the heihe river basin gao et al 2018 showed that basins with predominantly seasonal frozen soil cover 4200 m a s l had increased precipitation but decreased runoff with low runoff coefficients which could be explained by an increased water storage capacity of the thawed soil while basins with multi year permafrost cover 4200 m a s l had relatively consistent trends in precipitation and runoff and thus larger runoff coefficients which can be contributed to the increased ability of permafrost ice to release meltwater and the increased direct runoff caused by rainfall due to the permafrost layer blocking further infiltration it can be assumed that groundwater recharge will increase as the permafrost cover degrades leading to a stronger hydraulic connection between the surface and subsurface however at the sayr we did not find a correlation between permafrost cover and upstream to downstream changes in groundwater contribution in the nested catchments with increasing basin size and decreasing permafrost cover basins 4 and 5 did not show a stronger groundwater runoff dominance than basin 3 but rather a more dominant soil water contribution in basins 4 and 5 which mainly occurred in august and september during the peak vegetation growth period this may be related to high shrub and forest cover conditions during the thaw period in order to meet the transpiration water demand of vegetation water from the saturated zone was continuously recharged to the permafrost zone and vegetation was considered as a potential factor controlling hydrological processes in the permafrost zone influencing both the seasonal soil water dynamics and the water balance wang et al 2009 in addition the organic peatlands of the zoîgé plateau located between basin 3 and basin 4 had extensive wetland bogs with high hydraulic conductivity that can create favorable conditions for subsurface runoff storage 200 mm soil layer furthermore the slow release of water from organic soils and sphagnum plants is also responsible for the discontinuous recession of runoff from the basin it has also been found that narrow hillside watercourses heated during the thaw can occupy large saturated areas providing part of the source area for rapid subsurface runoff and continue to discharge groundwater well into autumn after the adjacent slopes freeze evans et al 2020 that said the influence of additional controlling factors impairs a clear relationship between water source contributions and permafrost cover in our studied nested watersheds 5 4 factors controlling runoff generation mechanism for nested basin fig 5 showed that the great lakes regulated runoff generation from basin 1 which provided a large storage capacity to reduce high runoff peaks and prolong low runoff due to dam effects an effect that may make it impossible to distinguish the initial contribution sources e g permafrost melt precipitation due to the storage mixing and replacement functions of the lakes without the interference of the regulation of the great lakes the permafrost thawing water can provide 13 2 16 7 of the runoff yang et al 2019 the pca results fig 5a b showed that elevation had a significant effect on the runoff generation basins 1 2 which corresponded to the finding that the seasonal frozen soil zone basins 3 4 5 was dominated by subsurface runoff this is similar to findings that basins at an altitude 4200 m a s l are dominated by seasonal frozen soil and have increased groundwater recharge gao et al 2018 we thus regarded runoff generation in the basins below the outlet of basin 2 4300 m a s l at jm station as being virtually unaffected by permafrost the low vegetation and highly exposed surface conditions have resulted in the runoff generation in excess of infiltration in basin 2 which combined with the influence of the permafrost barrier made groundwater recharge difficult and produced a higher soil water contribution the flow production mechanism in basin 3 was controlled by groundwater runoff reflecting the characteristics of groundwater catchment storage in the low lying terrain the study of st amour et al 2005 has shown that in basins with extensive swampy wetlands and widespread discontinuous permafrost cover precipitation from the upstream catchment area does not enter the river as direct flow during the storm but may be stored as groundwater for a long time and then transported to the river downstream during subsequent precipitation storms due to the narrow shape of the basin itself the runoff variation in basin 4 was more moderate than in other basins and because of the higher shrub cover and the strong water storage capacity of the vegetation roots the soil water contribution was predominant thus the runoff generation process of basin 4 was mainly controlled by the shape characteristics of the basin itself with a certain influence of the vegetation cover conditions for the largest basin basin 5 i e for the whole sayr the runoff formation process was controlled by the shape of the basin itself and topographic conditions which are more dominant than land use type and permafrost stability overall the stability of the permafrost had a stronger control on runoff generation than the degree of permafrost cover fig 7 and appendix fig 3 with the more unstable the permafrost the more easily subsurface runoff was converted to interflow in addition in the sayr the topography played an important role as with larger and longer basins groundwater storage gradually increased in line with favourable topographic conditions converging at the lowest elevation point lastly the vegetation cover was an important factor influencing the runoff sources the pca and spearman s rank correlation coefficient analysis results arguably validated our hypothesis that differences in the type of permafrost the degree of permafrost cover and the stability of permafrost did influence runoff processes at different scales of the catchment but were not decisive controlling factors before emphasizing the influence of permafrost degradation on runoff and groundwater we need to consider the characteristics of the basin itself therefore long term isotope sampling campaigns at the basin outlet are necessary and may be helpful to monitor the effects of shifts in the controlling factors on basin hydrological processes at different scales under changes in climate and anthropogenic disturbances 5 5 did the impact of permafrost on runoff processes have a scale effect our isotope data were obtained continuously at high resolution from the outlet of the nested basins and are one of the few such datasets in existence to study runoff generation processes in large scale alpine cold landscapes by assessing factors that vary with space the hypotheses are whether such a scale effect can be diluted as the basin size increases and if there are other controls that influence runoff more effectively sueker et al 2000 found that in some permafrost nested catchments there was little relationship between runoff by direct rainfall and catchment size gianfagna et al 2015 conducted a hydrological survey in nested catchments on the north slope of alaska and found that runoff ratios decreased with increasing catchment area due to permafrost limiting subsurface water storage space and wetting pre conditions utilizing basin area ratios alone can reveal relationships between upstream and downstream but in the sayr this approach was not possible the hydrological response of the catchment was impacted by the presence of permafrost the study of evans et al 2020 revealed increasing baseflow due to significant permafrost loss and enhanced groundwater surface water interactions in contrast for permafrost types with a smaller spatial extent of distribution discontinuous sporadic or no permafrost zones the increase in active layer thickness is not a driver of baseflow changes in northern eurasia catchments mcnamara et al 1998 investigated the factors controlling the allocation of old and new water contributions to runoff in nested catchments they found that reconciling contrasting patterns of the allocation of old and new water required invoking multiple explanations of processes and impacts the hydrological flow paths during snowmelt were found to be controlled by the proportion of wetland and intermediate sub basin area in 15 nested rivers in northern sweden laudon et al 2007 during the permafrost thaw period for the present study at the spatial scale we found little relationship between direct runoff and subsurface runoff with the size of the catchment our interpretation of the scale effect was that the expansion of the saturated area upstream along the narrow hillside watercourse provides part of the source area for rapid subsurface runoff until the topography gradually became gentler and eventually converges to the lowest point of the terrain mq station causing the prevailing dominant result of subsurface runoff in basin 3 thus the scale effect of permafrost on runoff generation has topography as a basis and the decisive control is also attributed to the topography with the increase in basin size the runoff formation process in basin 3 and 4 had become almost independent of the distribution of permafrost basin 5 was controlled by indicators related to land cover and also to the permafrost stability the only occurrence of extremely stable permafrost cover is closely related to the degree of development of ice marginal landforms due to the a nyêmaqên snow mountain although the contribution to runoff by the snow mountain is only 1 2 they can influence permafrost stability and in turn affect runoff in addition to the continuity of the permafrost we have to consider the vertical zonation of the permafrost it was difficult to isolate the effect of the thaw layer on runoff and the effect of permafrost on hydrological processes may have been overridden by other controlling factors as the watershed expands in extent in addition from a temporal perspective at larger scales permafrost can thaw earlier and the active layer of frozen water can be converted to interflow earlier resulting in a fault effect where the lower elevation basins downstream may not be connected to the melt water from the permafrost zone upstream this would prevent the transport of permafrost induced runoff from upstream to downstream resulting in permafrost thawing having no discernible impact on the runoff of downstream basins where basin length topographic gradient land use and asynchronous thawing may play a more significant role 5 6 topography based control of runoff processes in permafrost environments the hydrological processes in the sayr were characterized by a combination of inherent properties like topography basin length shape factor within the basin itself and landscape properties such as permafrost coverage and land use which combined to determine the hydrological processes in the basin in a widespread permafrost environment this study provided insight into how the variability of properties within a watershed combine to control flow through isotope hydrological investigations at the outlet of nested basins basin topography characteristics particularly gradient and length play a decisive role in controlling near surface soil water and subsurface runoff fig 7 summer rainfall contribution in basin 2 was related the strongest to optimal drainage conditions because permafrost acted as a semi impermeable water barrier to limit infiltration of the active layer deeper below moreover bare soil and desert dominated surface conditions allow for greater soil thaw with higher permeability and increased soil moisture consequently the contribution of summer rainfall and soil water to runoff was greater in basin 2 this was the reason why sub stable permafrost cover showed a significant negative correlation with the ratio of subsurface runoff contribution fig 7 in seasonal frozen soil basins with a low topographic gradient and extensive wetlands in the zoîgé plateau the ground was protected from deep thawing and thus had more available pore space for water storage due to sizeable cellular structure of the plants that form peatlands and the peat itself has a porosity of 72 to 93 with a strong water storage and permeability capacity the hydraulic properties of organic soils in those peatlands as a natural reservoir to homogenize floods were critical to the runoff regime combined with the shrub dominated vegetation cover that enhance the water storage capacity of the soil the study by carey and quinton 2005 found that the hydrologically responsive units in high shrub conditions accounted for 50 of the basin area with high water storage in the thawing layer during the thawing period and a water table oftentimes close to the porous surface of the organic layer which preferentially sent water rapidly to the river through soil macro pores it is also possible that the highly porous organic layer and the vegetation thermally isolated the soil by the constant saturated conditions producing large amounts of surface ice essentially preventing the downward infiltration of the melt front in summer therefore basin 3 was dominated by subsurface runoff to the river channel for watersheds with moderate topographic gradients that are hardly affected by permafrost like basin 4 5 there were no or very little restrictions by frozen ground and rainfall could infiltrate directly into the soil direct surface runoff was more prominent in basin 5 due to the low permeability of the agricultural soil and the urbanized sealed area in addition to the influence of arable and urban land use for the largest area of basin 5 the influence of topography on the runoff process played a dominant role which can be interpreted as an increase in topography controlled near surface saturated flow as the catchment area increases from the above we argue that the most important impact on the differences in yield and concentration of flow was that permafrost disrupted soil permeability to varying degrees resulting in spatial heterogeneity of runoff components and that the disruption of soil permeability by permafrost under the control of topography was only making a difference in runoff contributions when it appeared in combination with specific landscape characteristics of the catchment overall the characteristics of watershed yield and flow in different environments can provide a useful conceptual framework for the development of distributed hydrological models for the sayr in permafrost covered environments 6 conclusions this study produced detailed quantitative results on runoff sources through isotopic sampling from upstream to downstream watershed outlets which contributes to an understanding of the variability of hydrological pathways in the large natural diversity covering permafrost landscapes and environments the influence of permafrost on hydrological processes diminished significantly as the watershed scale increased and there was no clear relationship between runoff component contributions and watershed scale hydrological processes at different scales were the result of a combination of landscape elements and the physical characteristics of the watershed itself in addition the mixsiar model outperformed the isosource model in sayr for runoff generation simulations during the permafrost thaw period even so it is difficult to establish definitive conclusions at the large catchment scales 12 10 5 km2 using only one year of isotope data and the present findings are limited in the future we will work on the combination of stable isotope information and basin hydrological models to achieve coupled modelling of water stable isotopes and runoff processes increase isotope constraints reduce the mutual compromise effect and uncertainty range of each water source in the simulation process and help improve the simulation accuracy of hydrological models a more comprehensive and multifaceted evaluation of the hydro geomorphological complexity and hydrological connectivity of the sayr combining remote sensing and a more detailed
