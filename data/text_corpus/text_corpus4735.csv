23675,robotic systems capable of aquatic movement has increased exploitation in recent years due to the diverse range of missions that can be performed in otherwise hostile environments these aquatic unmanned vehicles auvs have begun to transition to systems that replicate biological animals as they are already extremely efficient at moving in aqueous environments the result is the abandonment of inefficient propeller based locomotion for a biological locomotion type suitable for the specific mission there is a diverse range of biological locomotion s available with animals that give a range of criteria to follow in this review existing aquatic animals and found auvs are classified how the bioinspired systems compare to the animals in their locomotion is investigated and discussed then it is discussed what makes these systems bioinspired and biomimetic and the auvs that fall into these distinctive categories limitations and future recommendations on possible improvements for these systems are offered keywords aquatic systems bioinspiration fin oscillation fin undulation jet propulsion 1 introduction currently there is a growing need for the adaptation of robotic systems which can autonomously perform routine tasks in aquatic environments blindberg 2001 habib 2013 scaradozzi et al 2017 raj and thakur 2016 yen and azwadi 2015 this need derives from the large scale unobservable volume of the oceans and other bodies of water which all present a challenge for hominoid observation this challenge persists due to human fragility in aqueous environments and the underdeveloped robotic systems that are deployed to solve the lack of mission capabilities of these systems inspiration must be taken from the diverse selection of species which inhabit the oceans rivers and lakes deriving inspiration from nature would mean the system is bioinspired if the system mimics a biological system it is dubbed biomimicry there have already been studies where researchers used bioinspiration and biomimicry to make an autonomous vehicle these new robots are characterized as an aquatic unmanned vehicle auv these auvs are modeled after certain fish species which the investigators deemed to be the best form to replicate this review offers a thorough classification list for biological and auv systems in this effort more current and dated systems are compiled into one location to allow for future investigators searching auv system reference information more available information allow the opportunity to create optimized auvs see table 26 auvs would have application in a wide range of civilian and military missions for exploitation in marine or aquatic environments these missions include environmental surveying oil spill monitoring internal pipe inspection erosion monitoring observation of animal species beach safety espionage anti espionage and border patrol blindberg 2001 najem et al 2012 the mission of an auv is dependent on its design however a major component of the auv is the autonomy of the system an autonomous system is necessary for the completion of these missions because signal transmission through water is difficult especially at great depths or distance the craft needs to carry out pre planned mission solely on its own and should respond to changing environment in addition these systems need to have long endurance and have the capability to move in close quarter environments with constantly changing fluid flow a close quarter environment would not condone a system tethered with a control cable or that of those using propellers propeller thrust degrades when fluid flow is not uniform propellers are also inefficient in comparison with fishes where propellers are estimated efficiency of 40 50 percent habib 2013 fishes have the ability of changing direction at a complete stop which is highly beneficial in close quarter environments for example systems comparable with the eel would be useful in pipe inspection where large body contortion is necessary to navigate complex bends furthermore tuna are extremely efficient swimmers such a robot that has a high level of biomimicry could also display high speed required for specific missions depending on mission requirements a biological system should be the center point for the design because of their swimming capabilities the current unmanned submersible systems being used in civilian and military missions are all relatively similar where by systems use propellers for thrust these unmanned submersibles have been adapted from their larger manned relatives when the utility and safety of these systems was realized blindberg 2001 autonomous aquatic robotic systems have been used with rapid growth of use since the 1970s blindberg 2001 however the most substantial exploitation increase is from 1990 to 2010 with the first commercial products coming about in the 2000 2010 timeframe blindberg 2001 these systems are often outfitted with observation equipment like cameras temperature gauges salinity instruments and acoustic mapping blindberg 2001 cruz et al 1999 these systems can be separated into two classifications there are the torpedo shaped autonomous systems which have been widely used on more long endurance and faster speed missions these types of systems have been extensively used because of their long range and depth capabilities blindberg 2001 systems like those used to track migratory shark species by acoustic tag tracking have been implemented with mixed results lost connection with signal beacon lin et al 2013 scientist tag a shark with an acoustic tag and then a torpedo shaped auv follows this beacon at a predetermined distance lin et al 2013 this allows for the observation of depth temperature of water salinity along with gps location of the animal lin et al 2013 there are torpedo shaped robots capable of long range missions known as gliders were swept up by the military guizzo 2008 these glider submersibles work on an efficient and clever system that uses buoyancy and winged flight to accomplish forward movement no propellers guizzo 2008 by filling and emptying ballast tanks the craft is capable of changing depth during depth change large control surfaces give the craft forward direction other types of submersible robots are the slower and less hydrodynamic robots that are comparable with the kambara wettergreen et al 1998 these systems are used often because of their appendage attachments and their adequate close proximity control these systems are often simple where an open frame external cage contains all the equipment and not much focus is placed on their efficiency wettergreen et al 1998 similar submersible systems to the kambara have been utilized for reef exploration wreckage surveying and deep sea exploration there have been extensive reviews of auv and biological systems these reviews are used and adapted to make a comprehensive review use of works blindberg 2001 habib 2013 scaradozzi et al 2017 raj and thakur 2016 yen and azwadi 2015 laschi et al 2013 sfakiotakis et al 1999 colgate and lynch 2004 lauder 2015 neveln et al 2013 allow for a starting point where ideas can be gathered and amassed into one place the reviews of auvs lack certain topics or overview of systems this review fills voids in this research and offers it in a clearer format the review is organized as follows in section 2 the biological locomotion and species are outlined in section 3 the found auvs are described and organized in section 4 there is an in depth discussion about the best auvs compare them to the biological and the most critique for biomimicry systems in section 5 summary conclusions are presented 2 biological locomotion and species there are several methodologies that can be used to define the locomotion characteristics this review proposes a more encompassing and straightforward classification for the biological systems that can be applied to the found auvs locomotion is divided into three main classifications namely fin oscillation fin undulation and jet propulsion this is the first review that combines these locomotions there are many categories within these main classes along with overlap between them the classification and categories are presented in fig 1 the fin oscillation has one of the largest categories the well known caudal fin swimmers while the largest class in fin undulation is pectoral fin swimmers the jet propulsion class is amongst the smallest defined there is not as much variety in this class the dorsal anal fin oscillation is described in the fin oscillation section the oscillation undulation is detailed in the fin undulation moreover the combination jet fin undulation is described in jet propulsion the terminology for the fin oscillation was taken from sfakiotakis et al 1999 where a detailed review is given for different types of fish locomotion some of the same terminology is needed for the explanation of the auv systems thus this terminology is given to allow a better understanding of types of fins and what nomenclature are used in the various categories of locomotion shown in fig 2 a and c respectively are for a caudal finned fish and ray species these classes are vastly different in their swimming capabilities however there are similarities in the fin structures as ribs are used in the fins to give the flexible membrane rigidity these rib structures are shown in fig 2 b and d for the caudal fin fishes and the ray respectively the most important fins to take note of are caudal pectoral dorsal and anal however the ray has enlarged pectoral fins in comparison with the caudal finned fish sfakiotakis et al 1999 biological species have developed in a manner which condones the most efficient propulsion for their mission habib 2013 sfakiotakis et al 1999 colgate and lynch 2004 webb and weihs 2015 most fishes developed an actuation that produces a useable thrust and a body that minimizes resistance drag buoyancy of fishes is maintained through use of a swim bladder that fills with gases to counteract the animals weight and to maintain depth control pitch and roll are controlled with auxiliary fins or main propulsion fins yaw is controlled through use of the body flexion in most animals the various terminology for directional change can be seen in fig 3 b and c it has been found that fish species swim within a strouhal number range between 0 2 st 0 4 yen and azwadi 2015 depending on the fluid flow the fish must compensate with either body movement or fin stabilizing webb and weihs 2015 high endurance or migratory swimming would require more powerful swimming muscle and efficient forward thrust propulsion gemballa et al 2006 the skin surface also has a large effect on the efficiency on the system sharks are known for their drag reducing skin lauder et al 2016 studying individual classes that utilize these various fins are explained in their respective sections along with corresponding species in that class 2 1 fin oscillation locomotion the fin oscillation classification is the largest of all those defined these biological systems offer a great variety to choose from size speed endurance and turning capabilities range propulsion actuation also varies depending on the sub classification the chart presented in fig 4 gives representation of the vast diversity of species found using fin oscillation as shown in fig 4 on the left there are the caudal fin swimmers which are the first classification discussed then the pectoral fin species after that dorsal anal fin and the combination oscillation fin categories are consolidated as seen in fig 4 the caudal fin category has the largest representative group of animals the labriform fishes are the second largest grouping while the tetraodontiform and ostraciiform are the two smallest 2 1 1 caudal fin it is clear from the flowchart in fig 4 that the largest category is the caudal fin this is due to the large variety of animals that use a caudal fin for major propulsion caudal finned fishes are differentiated by the thrust generated by a tail realized through a body undulation these fishes are usually labeled as body caudal fin bcf in other reports scaradozzi et al 2017 sfakiotakis et al 1999 fishes that utilize a caudal fin tend to be faster swimmers or have a high endurance and a large majority of these fish species tend to be predatory animals syme and shadwick 2011 there are long distance swimmers found in this class as some are migratory animal van ginneken et al 2005 the caudal fin allows for more thrust to be generated but thrust magnitude is dependent on the body actuation gillis 1996 the different degrees of body undulation are shown in fig 5 the greatest degree of body undulation can be seen expressed in the anguilliforms fig 5 a which the first caudal fin category discussed the subcarangiform carangiform and thunniform will then follow in this order respectively as the body undulation decreases in this manner 2 1 1 1 anguilliform the anguilliform caudal fin category represents animals denoted with the largest body undulation to realize a caudal fin oscillation sfakiotakis et al 1999 as shown in fig 5 a these animals are extremely flexible and have small turning radii gillis 1996 eels and sea snakes are considered in this class gillis 1996 graham et al 1987 both are found in reefs or protective covering where these animals display a great degree of body flexibility this flexibility comes from the large number of vertebrae for an eel this number can average 104 whereas sea snakes can average 186 vertebrae gillis 1996 eels are one of the most efficient migratory swimmers in a study conducted by van ginneken et al van ginneken et al 2005 controlled tests found that the efficiency of eel anguilla anguilla aka european eel migratory swimming is extremely high van ginneken et al 2005 using a comparison set from two experiments they determined the endurance of these animals one experiment lasting 173 days and the other 7 days to make sure that the speeds were similar for each result in their experiments they used a water channel and subjected the animals to constant flow of oxygenated rich water during these two trials the eels swam with an average velocity of 0 22 m s the european eels sustained this pace for the full 173 day experiment 5500 km van ginneken et al 2005 studies have also been done on the eel migration using pop up satellite tags psats in this investigation a psat of dimensions 2 13 cm2 were attached to eels to study the increased drag and the impact on the eels swimming performance burgerhout et al 2011 it was found that individuals struggled swimming and their efficiency was impacted significantly burgerhout et al 2011 this shows that these animals have extremely efficient propulsion and they use energy sparingly to accomplish migratory swimming 2 1 1 2 subcarangiform carangiform the subcarangiform and carangiform classifications are extremely similar they can be distinguished with a slightly varying initiation point along the body subcarangiform fishes utilize slightly more back and forth head movement as presented in fig 5 b undulation is therefore initiated closer to the head and a longer undulation wave realizes caudal fin oscillation which requires the activation of more muscle along the body altringham et al 1993 a common agreement is that carangiform fishes utilize one third of their posterior body for undulation scaradozzi et al 2017 sfakiotakis et al 1999 subcarangiform fishes include animals like salmon and carp while examples of carangiforms include trevally shad and piranha these fishes are some of the most studied somewhat because they are the most easily caught and are considered efficient power thrust fish altringham et al 1993 these fishes inhabit bodies of water that satisfy their survival needs these two classes have a large variety of sizes weights and speeds the flexibility of these two sub categories is much less than the anguilliform sub category 2 1 1 3 thunniform thunniform fishes are most often found to be predators or a higher order of the food chain noted by a very limited body undulation to the last quarter of the body sfakiotakis et al 1999 as shown in fig 5 d this body undulation and compact muscle grouping force a rigid tail with powerful oscillations syme and shadwick 2011 shadwick and syme 2008 bodies are usually very streamline and can be considered as extremely efficient fishes where they sustain top speed for long duration to either pursue prey or avoid even larger thunniform predators guinet et al 2007 this sub category includes tunas sharks and dolphins it can be mentioned that some of these species in this group are warm blooded which gives these predators the upper hand in terms of endurance and power syme and shadwick 2011 warm muscle means more efficient muscle performance and hence more thrust syme and shadwick 2011 2 1 2 pectoral fin labriform the pectoral fin is a category of fishes which primarily uses pectoral fin locomotion to perform slower speed agile swimming davison 1988 fishes like wrasses parrotfish and sheephead utilize this form of propulsion for the efficiency of close quarter swimming the species that use labriform swimming tend to be found in reefs and areas of cover these fishes use a caudal fin occasionally when their pectoral muscles are at maximum endurance or when burst swimming korsmeyer et al 2002 these fishes have low endurance when solely utilizing their pectoral fins korsmeyer et al 2002 in fig 6 the top and side views for the rowing and flapping swimming modes are shown for a labriform swimmer the pectoral fins of the labriforms have rigid fin rays between the fin membrane which give the fin rigidity westneat 1996 the swimming strokes of the labriform fishes can be classified into two categories namely flapping or rowing motions as shown in fig 6 the flapping motion is when the fish only performs upstroke and downstroke with the leading edge of the fin while the rest of the fin membrane remains passive this means that both the upstroke and downstroke are both power strokes for flapping sfakiotakis et al 1999 however the relative area for drag is increased when using flapping fin strokes so speed is low during this actuation therefore flapping is good for close quarter maneuvering the rowing motion is used for faster speeds this motion can be described by the leading edge making a vertical downstroke but on the upstroke the fin is pulled back at an angle to the vertical axis sfakiotakis et al 1999 sitorus et al 2009 2 1 3 dorsal anal fin tetraodontiform this unique class is very sparse in the literature covering species like the ocean sunfish sharptail mola and slender sunfish these three represented animals are all in the same family so it is easiest to just refer to the category by the largest member which is ocean sunfish the ocean sunfish are extremely large and are the biggest bony fish on the planet fig 7 is a representative drawing of the ocean sunfish these fish have long lifespans which allows them to reach huge sizes however these fishes have the least efficient design considered out of all the ones mentioned these fishes utilize two large paddle fins one dorsal and one anal for locomotion sfakiotakis et al 1999 these fins have rigid ribs and the fish uses the most unorthodox oscillation motions to control direction and depth sfakiotakis et al 1999 yaw and pitch control for this animal are low moreover this fish has issues navigating in close quarter environments these fishes are open ocean migrators who feed on jellyfish their body is considered flat with a slight taper from their head to the underdeveloped caudal fin 2 1 4 pectoral dorsal anal and caudal fin ostraciiform the ostraciiform is a unique class because it uses pectoral and dorsal anal fin oscillations to control movement sfakiotakis et al 1999 hove et al 2001 gordon et al 2000 these fishes can be found in reefs and close quarter environments what makes this class stand out is the unique body shape for the species namely boxfish and cowfish these two relatives have a body shape that is akin to rigid box as shown in fig 8 these fishes can maintain finetuned fin oscillations giving this fish good maneuverability in the small crevasses it calls home the speed of these animals is low because of their body shape and their inefficient fin actuation for fast speeds hove et al 2001 osctraciiform locomotion can be described in a few different ways like labriform and ostraciiform which use pectoral fin flapping motions however osctraciiform not only do vertical flapping they also perform horizontal flapping too hove et al 2001 the dorsal and anal fin are used to give more forward thrust and stability and both fins flap synchronously in phase hove et al 2001 occasionally they use their extremely small caudal fin for some burst propulsion but is rare hove et al 2001 2 2 consolidation of characteristics of biological fin oscillation species the fin oscillation classification has probably the greatest degree of variation of animal size shape speed and swimming technique between the categories these variations allow the animals in this class to perform a wide range of missions this includes close quarter maneuvering burst swimming and endurance it should be stated that the values in table 1 should be a range these values should rather be used as a point of reference where animal growth and speed are averaged unless otherwise stated this allows for values from zero and some greater than those specified it should also be realized that these animals serve as a generalization for these classes there is a wide variety of species that use a defined locomotion but attempts in creating a range of values through the animals selected gives a batch of mimicable animals table 2 offers details about the animals endurance and turning capabilities as well as a picture for shape for fin oscillation the most abundant animals use a caudal fin however since the sizes vary so drastically for these animals each class should be described independently this review regularly only displays a few of the most commonly found animals for the anguilliform the european eel is the midrange size but it has the highest average speed and the highest endurance the giant moray is the largest eel selected it has an extremely flexible body but this animal does not have extreme endurance the giant moray is an ambush hunter that sometimes moves along the reef to find new hunting grounds the sea snake makes shallow water dives to catch prey off the coast these animals are capable of dives lasting longer than 20 min during these dives they search crevasses in the ocean sea floor these animals are not migratory swimmers in the subcarangiform category two similar animals have been selected both being salmon having similar shape the chum and chinook salmon display burst swimming and migratory swimming from oceans to rivers as all salmon species do as part of their life cycle these animals swim long distances to reach their hunting grounds off the pacific coast of asia and north america friedland et al 2001 these animals then return to the rivers and stream estuaries to mate where depending on the estuary salmon must perform jumps over waterfalls this is done by burst swimming and leaping out of the water above the rapid or water fall burst swimming is for short periods of time as salmon cannot sustain this high energy jumping the carangiforms have some good shaped fish with slender tapered bodies that they utilize to be swift predators the most dominant predator of these is the swordfish an animal capable of extremely large sizes even more impressively this animal is capable of extreme burst swimming of 27 m s sagong et al 2013 the swordfish body is very streamline with the enlarged sword on its nose also known as an enlarged bill this bill gives it predatory advantage when attacking other fishes and helps this fish pierce the water when swimming allowing it to swim faster the bonefish also has a streamline body a powerful peduncle that propels this fish through the water the trevally is a moderately fast carangiform that has a more slender body that tapers heavily into the peduncle this animal has prominent dorsal and anal fins the thunniform animals are on the upper tier of the food chain apex predators of the oceans these animals are capable of large sizes and express extremely streamline bodies the tuna dolphin and shark can leisurely swim at speeds greater than 1 m s and burst swimming greater than 10 m s the yellowfin is one of the largest tuna with average weight of 50 kg for caught fish but these animals can get much larger dagorn et al 2006 however a mature yellowfin is larger than the skipjack tuna it was found that the yellowfin tuna even though larger has great high speed endurance as it can maintain 3 m s for more than 30 min guinet et al 2007 the tunas have a slender lunate tail that is semi rigid and good for thrust the aspect ratio of the yellowfin can be observed to be larger than the skipjack tuna the elongated second dorsal fin and anal fin of the yellowfin tuna has not been found to play any part in thrust generation all fins of the tuna are semi rigid structures fin oscillation and undulation animals often have scales that cover their bodies these structures on their skin gives the animal a protective layering the skin of the predatory animals gives them an advantage during high speed swimming for predators scales can be observed as smaller and therefore create a smoother surface like those of the tuna other animals have adapted to create scales that induce a boundary layer like that found in sharks sharks regularly have scales microstructures that trap water in vortexes along the skin surface this greatly reduces drag and allows sharks like the mako to achieve extremely high speed the mako shark is capable of burst swimming greater than 13 m s for short periods of time the body shape of the mako shark with a more elongated and tapered body compared to the tuna the shark has semi rigid fins but these fins can still passively flex the dolphin is also a fast predator with a body comparable to the shark the bottlenose dolphin is a mid sized dolphin that is capable of power endurance much like the other predators in this category bottlenose dolphins swim at greater than 11 m s labriform swimmers do not have the most impressive of speeds as their pectoral fins are used to swim in short range missions these animals do use their caudal fin but this is only when they need a boost of speed their shape is somewhat flat and elongated comparable to the trevally body type their pectoral fins give them decent turning capabilities as their bodies are flexible like the caudal fin swimmers the schelegel s parrotfish is the best representation for the labriform it has the highest average speed and top speed but it is the mid size of the three displayed at 0 2 kg and 0 2 m these fishes are found in the coral reef with ostraciiform species the ostraciiform is detailed with only one fish as the boxfish and cowfish are comparable these fishes are small with an average weight being less than 0 1 kg and length less than 0 2 m these fishes hide out in alcoves along coral reefs so their multiple oscillating fins give it great control and stability with a moderate average speed relative to its length the largest animal described is the ocean sunfish a tetraodontiform the maximum weight of this animal is nearly 1000 kg and a wingspan of an impressive 2 4 m this extremely large animal stays in deeper water and has a maximum speed of less than 2 m s however due to its large size it is still able to cover 26 km day ocean sunfish 2017c the ocean sunfish only has four active fins where the pectoral fins help stabilize the colossal body despite these control surfaces yaw pitch and roll are very difficult to control for these fishes the body is flat with a slight disk shape seen from a side view with a taper from the head to the tail 2 3 fin undulation locomotion animals in this class use individual rib excitation in their fins to create undulatory waves along the fin habib 2013 sfakiotakis et al 1999 albert 2001 boileau et al 2002 the animals in fin undulation use this wave propagation for thrust and stability control some of these animals are able to control the direction of the wave giving them forward and backward swimming capabilities or null speed turning there are many types of fins utilized by these animals namely pectoral dorsal anal and dorsal anal there is a sub category which uses undulatory and oscillatory fins high endurance swimmers can be found in this class but more often these animals are ambush predators that use structures as cover for classes such as the dorsal anal and combination fin their undulatory fin allows forward and backward movement which is ideal in close quarter environments albert 2001 the four different types of undulatory fin and the one combination of undulation and oscillation fin are presented in fig 9 it follows from the latter figure that this class is much smaller than the fin oscillation but the animals are more diverse in this class the largest fin undulation category is the rajiforms which is discussed first then the comparable amiiform and gymnotiform are described after that the balistiform is shown as the dorsal and anal fin combination category last the diodontiform is presented to be another strange locomotion as it uses both oscillation and undulation fins 2 3 1 pectoral fin rajiform this class includes species like rays and skates the body individuals are comprised of cartilage which gives their whole body great flexibility fin ribs extend from the body into the pectoral fin these ribs are excited by muscles which run through the skeleton the skeletal structures of these animals are shown in fig 10 rajiform individuals like the common stingray or skate can control these ribs individually to create an undulatory wave along the fin length the rib structures for the common stingray are more free compared to the manta ray whose ribs are aligned in a cross weave matrix and unify at the fin edge the common stingray ribs do not have a secondary terminus connect when compared to the manta ray rib structure manta rays have cross ribs to the spanning ribs which gives the pectoral fins more rigidity the common stingray does have some cross connection but these are much closer to the body as the rib tips must still be free to move the difference in structure is shown in fig 10 a and b however this difference in structure for the manta ray means that a large portion of the leading edge is excited to cause the movement that forces the undulation along the fin rosenberger 2001 for animals like the common stingray or skates fin ribs are distributed along the entire fin surface area and partake as dominant sections as the ribs are free to move independently of its neighbor rosenberger 2001 as shown in fig 11 the various shapes for all the animals that partake in rajiform swimming are presented there are clear differences in shapes some are more circular like the common stingray while the cownose ray has triangle shaped pectoral fins there are two outliers in this category a caudal fin is utilized for thrust by the animals expressed in fig 11 e and f shovelnose guitarfish shape is shown by fig 11 c while the shape of fig 11 f are the common torpedo or electric ray as seen in fig 9 these rajiform members are combined with the fin oscillation category to represent their caudal fin these animals use a caudal fin for most of their swimming these caudal fin rajiforms are more closely related to the shark however these animals have enlarged flattened pectoral fins and utilize these in swimming too but primarily use the caudal fin rajiform shapes and fin structures determine what kind of swimming capabilities the animal will exhibit the manta and cownose rays can cruise more because their fins behave as more rigid structures allow these animals to glide the common stingray and electric rays have better ability of navigating close quarter environments as their flexible fins give them extreme turning capabilities these rajiforms offer a diverse range of swimming capabilities 2 3 2 elongated undulating dorsal fin amiiform amiiform animals are known by their undulating dorsal fin sfakiotakis et al 1999 jagnandan and sanford 2013 there are a limited number of animals that use this locomotion examples of species that use this locomotion are comparable to the african aba aba and the bowfin these fishes are not extremely fast but they are decently agile as they can move forward and backward by switching the direction of the wave motion in the fin including increased directional control by rolling their fin axis off vertical they do this by retracting muscles along their sides to achieve spinal curvature aba aba knifefish 2017 aba aba knife fish feeding 2017 their dorsal fin runs the length of the spin and is composed of a flexible membrane around closely compacted fin ribs or rays jagnandan and sanford 2013 the complex undulations in the dorsal fins are caused by the contraction of extensor and flexor muscles along either side of the dorsal fin as shown in fig 12 these animals can realize tight turning and multi directional capabilities jagnandan and sanford 2013 these fishes prefer cover as they are not very fast and use cover to ambush their prey and protect themselves 2 3 3 elongated undulating anal fin gymnotiform the gymnotiform class is comparable to the amiiform animals however the undulating fin is on the posterior of the body as an elongated anal fin these fins also have many individual ribs albert youngerman et al 2014 states that these undulating fins are composed of 100 300 bony ribs this allows the fish to have complete control of the fin for the entire length because each rib has its own set of agonist and antagonist muscles the membrane between the ribs are extremely flexible and can move with the rib with ease low and willy 2005 the length and location of the anal fin along with the fins flexibility can be noted in fig 13 these fishes are ambush predators like the amiiforms and prefer obstructions in the water column where they can hunt small prey with greater ease these fishes do not make large migratory swims as they are small and are vulnerable to larger predators outside their hunting zones the forward and backwards movements of the gymnotiform and amiiform allow them to perform complex maneuvering the bend of the body allows the fin to be angled to the vertical axis permits these fishes to move with higher degree of freedom the main undulatory fin also allows these fishes to move forward backward upward and downward as described in the detailed study by youngerman et al 2014 the ghost knifefish can vary the undulation waves and angle of attack of the fin to achieve various directional changes youngerman et al 2014 the pectoral fins of the ghost knifefish are used as control surfaces for pitch and roll control black ghost knife fish 2017 2 3 4 combination of dorsal and anal fin undulation balistiform the balistiform fishes are classified by the use of both the dorsal and anal fins also known as medial pair fin mpf undulation locomotion sfakiotakis et al 1999 the most commonly found species in this class is the triggerfish fishes that utilize this propulsion type utilize mpf combination until the muscles controlling the fin ribs are exhausted then the caudal fin is used until muscle recuperation occurs korsmeyer et al 2002 therefore even though these species primarily use their mpfs occasionally the caudal fin is utilized to increase endurance in experiments performed by korsmeyer et al 2002 picasso triggerfish were subjected to an endurance test in this test fluid flow was increased intermittently till the fish was at its maximum speed where it could barely maintain its position in the channel the average time lapsed till the fish faltered was 4 h however these fishes were relying heavily on their caudal fin for most of the maximum speed korsmeyer et al 2002 these types of fishes do not get very large and this locomotion is primarily utilized by triggerfish the various types of triggerfish are all similar where the majority are comparable to just one of the larger species that can be found the picasso triggerfish these fishes do not perform large migrations and can be most easily studied in shallow reefs 2 3 5 combination of pectoral fin undulation dorsal anal oscillation diodontiform this is a unique classification of fish where the use of large undulating pectoral fins aid in slow speed motion while oscillating dorsal and anal fins generate more thrust for higher speeds chan 2010 fishes found in this class are similar to the porcupine fish or pufferfish this fish is not considered as migratory swimmers and inhabit shallow water reefs these porcupine fish are not burst swimmers and rely on their body spines and unique attribute of swelling up with water to enlarge their size to ward off predators fishes that also use the pectoral fin undulation are bluegill these fishes do this by individual ribs within the fin lauder 2015 the bluegill use these fins for low speed swimming but use their caudal fin for higher speeds 2 4 consolidation of characteristics of biological fin undulation species the animals in the fin undulation classification vary greatly however it should be noted that the fins which have ribs and are utilized to perform undulation vary depending on the type of fin and also the type of animal these ribs allow these animals to have great control of their fins in sections rib length can vary depending on the animal s body shape shapes vary from flat body to tubular elongated bodies the body types vary which allow for different fin length and wave propagations the body of an amiiform allows for the fin to not have long ribs since the fin is so long while the main ribs in the manta ray are long to control the leading edge of the pectoral fin these animals can be considered in having good mobility but are not burst swimmers in tables 3 and 4 the characteristics of the some of the biological fin undulation species are presented the fin undulation category is filled with animals that include ambush predators capable of multi directional motion the animals capable of this motion are amiiform gymnotiform and diodontiform the rajiform animals comparable to the common stingray are capable of null speed turns these capabilities allow these animals to navigate in extremely close quarter environments the utility of this directional control is the ability to navigate in close quarter environments the amiiform and gymnotiform have limited information about average speed and top speed however these animals are ambushed hunters that prefer cover the elongated fins of the animals in these classes allow these animals to nimbly move through extremely close quarter environments the shape of the body of the amiiform and gymnotiform also condone this close quarter navigation as they can fit through narrow gaps in the cover that they inhabit the shape of these animals is either an elongated tube shape or they have a more flattened body the bodies of these animals are flexible allowing for the change of yaw pitch and roll the elongated fins of these animals have ribs that are of similar length and are distributed along the whole length of the fin the electric eel was found to be the largest gymnotiform at 20 kg and 2 m in the amiiform category the african aba aba is found with a maximum size of 18 5 kg and 1 67 m these two animals have similar tubular shapes the black knifefish is smaller but very nimble gymnotiform the manta ray is the largest fin undulation animal with individuals averaging around 100 kg while cownose rays weigh about 15 kg the wingspan of manta ray is about 3 5 m compared to the cownose ray of wingspan of 1 2 m there is a large size difference between these two rays however these animals perform migratory swimming using their triangular pectoral fins to glide through the water the pectoral fin rib matrix does not allow form multiple waves at a time although the manta ray uses more of a flapping motion it has a top speed of 9 8 m s and has an average speed slightly over 1 m s the common stingray is capable of impressive burst swimming greater than 10 m s however the common stingray has the circular disc shape that has the free pectoral ribs the free moving ribs allows this animal to have multiple undulation waves at a time the shape of rajiform animals range from circular disc oblong disc and triangular fins the rib composition of the fin determines what wave propagation that the ray will perform these ribs have changing thickness depending on the length of the fin the body of these animals are flexible because their skeletal structure is comprised of cartilage even though cartilage is not as strong as bone these animals bodies are still strong the balistiform selected is the picasso triggerfish this animal expresses a good size and shape assumption for these animals based off observations for the triggerfish the picasso triggerfish has a size of 0 14 kg and 0 17 m the balistiform are short range swimmers when using primarily just their dorsal anal fins once these muscles are exhausted the caudal fin is utilized the caudal fin of the picasso triggerfish has a flexible lunate caudal fin these fish have a slender body and its pectoral fins are used for control surfaces for stability these animals swim close to cover to forage for food in coral reefs the diodontiform animals also stay close to cover and can navigate using their undulating pectoral fins and then perform fast swimming with their oscillating mpf the porcupine fish has a tubular body that tapers to the caudal fin that this fish periodically uses the length of these animals is greater than the triggerfish with a length of 0 5 m the weight of these animals could not be determined but the size can be assumed to be greater than the balistiform 2 5 jet propulsion jet propulsion is the smallest classification presented in this review this locomotion is broken down into three main categories namely bell constriction mantel constriction shell compression and a combination of jet and fin undulation fig 14 shows these four categories with the biological systems that fall in each the bell constriction category focuses on the movement of jellyfish mantel constriction is divided into cephalopods such as octopus shell compression is specifically for mollusks such as scallops lastly the chart presents systems that use a combination including the squid or cuttlefish 2 5 1 bell constriction bell constriction locomotion is defined by the movement of a flexible bell in certain biological systems this propulsion category is applied specifically to jellyfish yeom and oh 2009 however these biological systems that utilize bell constriction for locomotion have their movement strongly influenced by the ocean current because their mass and thrust are not large enough to resist it bell constriction is produced by the contraction and relaxation phases of the subumbrellar muscles in the bell causing movement by ejecting water due to the constriction of the volume of the bell villanueva et al 2011 fig 14 displays a schematic drawing for the anatomy of oblate shape and prolate shape jellyfish respectively some of the main muscles such as the subumbrellar rhopalium tentacles mouth and arms are depicted in fig 14 the rhopalium muscle controls the pace of swimming muscle contraction setting the basic swim frequency katsuki and greenspan 2013 because of the shape of their bells not all jellyfish create thrust in the same manner for this reason jellyfish s propulsion movement is classified into two different swimming patterns which are jet and rowing propulsion species in these categories have structural similarities such as muscles however the subumbrellar muscle is noticed to be of larger area for systems using rowing propulsion oblate shape in contrast to jet propulsion prolate shape as shown in fig 15 a and b respectively the prolate shaped jellyfish are also recognized as bullet shaped jellyfish due to their long bell appearance as presented in fig 15 a dabiri et al 2005 the jellyfish in this category contract their bells with a higher frequency to generate the necessary thrust that they need for swimming mchenry and jed 2003 however prolate shaped jellyfish use more energy than oblate shape jellyfish for locomotion because of the higher frequency of contraction rowing propulsion on the other hand is generated by oblate shaped jellyfish also known as the flat shaped jellyfish which is shown in fig 15 b dabiri et al 2005 oblate shape jellyfish contract their bells slower using a larger volume which causes a larger amount of water to propel from their bells this type of movement is often not entire circumferential constrictions oblate jellyfish impulse their bell margin as a paddle to swim by only constricting a portion of the bell mchenry and jed 2003 however the oblate jellyfish can still perform a full bell deformation to displace water oblate shape jellyfish use less energy for movement because as their frequency is lower than prolate shape jellyfish peng and alben 2012 shown in fig 13 more found biological jellyfish fall into the rowing propulsion category this could be due to the use of currents for long distance travel and the need for high energy propulsion 2 5 2 mantel constriction octopus fall into the mantel constriction propulsion category the system of propulsion by mantel constriction is generated by filling the mantle cavity with water and expelling it out through the siphon however locomotion is also achieved by using their limbs arms to walk on the ocean floor and in coral reefs octopus mantel constriction is generated by using recovery and power strokes also known as sculling fig 16 shows the main parts of the octopus considered in this review the siphon not only expels water but also specifies the directional movement and speed of the octopus mantel constriction in these species is principally for hunting defense and fast swimming sfakiotakis et al 2015 as mentioned octopus use this propulsion technique to escape from predators by burst swimming away a defensive ink is released as a distraction technique during this defensive burst swimming 2 5 3 shell compression shell compression locomotion is used by biological systems from the mollusk classification shell compression is the type of locomotion derived by the opening and closing of the two shell halves water is absorbed into the abductor muscle on scallops and propelled out between the shells producing the clapping action movement fig 17 displays an illustrated description for the anatomy of the atlantic bay scallop body parts including the mantle and abductor muscle as well as the union of the two shells by the shell joint are shown the ribs illustrated on the shell are from shell growth these ribs are not the same support ribs used by the fin oscillation and undulation species scallops use shell compression propulsion primarily to escape from predators region 1995 however this propulsion mechanism is not endurance based since it takes a lot of energy for scallops to use shell compression 2 5 4 mantel constriction and undulating mantel fin biological systems such as cuttlefish and squids use a combination method of mantel constriction and undulating mantel fin these types of propulsion are utilized in various modes of swimming with different proportion of use between undulation fin and jet propulsion this results in slower speed control but these animals possess great agility and speed these animals can swim forward and backward and easily change swimming directions by using both undulating fin and mantel constriction wang et al 2011 some species of squid produce a propulsion strong enough to shoot them out of the water unlike the octopus these cephalopods are equipped with 8 arms and 2 tentacles the two tentacles are not used by octopus the muscular mantle in these systems fills and expels water to generate mantel constriction propulsion the jet propulsion method of cuttlefish and squids comparable to the octopus forces a fast backward swimming direction wang et al 2011 undulating mantel fin locomotion is given by continuous contractions of muscles along the fin length this undulating fin is primarily used when swimming slow in forward or backward direction including control of yaw pitch and roll a schematic for the anatomy of cuttlefish is shown in fig 18 these animals are highly efficient swimmers at slow and fast speeds wang et al 2011 2 6 consolidation of characteristics of biological jet propulsion species some of the aquatic species based on jet propulsion locomotion differ in many ways such as jellyfish from cephalopods even so these species relate by all having little swimming endurance jellyfish swimming endurance is extremely low since their movement mainly depends on the ocean s current instead of self propelling jellyfish turning abilities is highly characterized as minimal octopus cover short distances using jet propulsion which depends on its arms and mantle cavity for movement cuttlefish and squids have higher turning capabilities in contrast to octopuses through use of their undulation fin the bell constriction category presents some jellyfish species such as the aequorea victoria aurelia aurita and nomura s jellyfish from them all the aurelia aurita also known as moon jellyfish is the most common type of jellyfish studied and observed at aquariums these animals weigh approximately 0 175 kg and a length about 0 014 m one of largest known jellyfish weighing about 204 kg is nomura s jellyfish with a diameter length of about 1 8 m there is no information presented about aequorea victoria s weight but present a maximum length of about 0 25 m nomura s jellyfish is capable of swimming at an average speed of 0 43 m s reaching a top speed of 0 529 m s in contrast aequorea victoria propels at an average speed of 0 20 m s as previously stated none of the systems present endurance since their movement mainly depends on ocean current jellyfish are not efficient at maneuverability because of their body shape and structure the nomura s jellyfish has the lowest directional control mantel constriction is represented by the blue ringed octopus octopus vulgaris and enteroctopus dofleini these animals were chosen to create a range of sizes for this category the blue ringed octopus is among the smallest octopi with a length of 0 15 m and weight of 0 028 kg the octopus vulgaris is the most common of its species since it is found in most of the major oceans this animal is also differentiable by its pimple like structures covering its mantle these structures help this animal blend into its surroundings by breaking up its silhouette to look more like coral structure the octopus vulgaris weights 10 kg reaching a maximum size of 1 50 m the enteroctopus dofleini best known as the giant pacific octopus is the largest identified octopus it weighs approximately 50 kg with a size of around 5 m this animal was found to have an average speed of 0 305 m s reaching as high as 11 2 m s during burst swimming turning capabilities for these animals is classified as tight since they can easily change directions with their arms but during jet propulsion these animals have lower directional control swimming endurance for these animals cannot be extreme when using jet propulsion shell compression locomotion is denoted by the atlantic bay scallop which is one of the most common types of scallop the atlantic bay scallop was selected as the sole animal for this class as other scallops have high similarities in size and structure the atlantic bay scallop measures 0 089 m in length with no information about its weight these animals only use shell compression to escape from predators at a speed around 0 8 m s it was denoted that the system s endurance was extremely low because they only swim to a safer place a few meters away from their starting position the turning of the atlantic bay scallop is described to be extremely low lastly the combination of mantel constriction and undulatory fin locomotion is represented by the sepia officinalis cuttlefish watasenia scintillans squid and vampire squid the sepia officinalis is the largest of these biological systems with a length of approximate 0 325 m and mass of about 6 75 kg the vampire squid weights approximately 0 450 kg and consists of a size reaching 0 30 m which is comparable to the sepia officinalis length the watasenia scintillans is among the smallest identified squids with a mass of 0 0089 kg and 0 06 m in size the sepia officinalis is able of reaching a top speed of 0 8 m s compared to the vampire squid s top speed of 0 9 m s both systems consist of short swimming endurances where the sepia officinalis lasts less than a minute most swimming done by these animals is through the use of the undulation fin where jet propulsion is used to burst swim or aid in directional control the fins of these animals vary where shape and length of the fin along the mantel depend on the species the watasenia scintillans squid consists of a triangle shaped undulatory fin covering most of the muscular mantle compared to the vampire squid having two oval fins on the sides of the mantle that are only a portion of the mantel length the sepia officinalis cuttlefish has a fin that starts at the top and runs the length of the mantel the shape of this fin is a crescent that almost parallels the mantel there are many other squids which have varying aspect ratios to those defined but these should be considered the three main shapes 3 auv systems and locomotion classification bioinspired systems follow the same classifications defined for the biological systems investigators try to mimic the mechanical movement using materials they deem fit generally there are two different types of materials used to accomplish movement these materials are either rigid or soft where rigid means the components do not deform or change shape rigid materials have the benefit of using actuation mechanisms commonly found in robotics soft materials can flex and deform during movement soft materials have the benefit using newer and more experimental actuation mechanisms some mechanical systems have skins which are applied over the actuation mechanism to improve hydrodynamics 3 1 auv fin oscillation robots in the fin oscillation classification follow the sub categories defined for the biological systems while there are a lot of robots in this category it is important to define them in chronological order in each category based off their actuation mechanism type the mechanical layout of the systems are described for each robot in table 7 then the characteristics of each robot are reviewed and compared in the consolidation section 3 1 1 auv caudal fin the caudal fin category has robots defined in anguilliform subcarangiform carangiform and thunniform locomotion the large number of robots in this class is due to the assumption that the caudal fin produces the best thrust for fast speed and body types of fishes found in this category condone improved hydrodynamics 3 1 1 1 anguilliform early efforts in this category should be considered in those by ayers et al 2000 creating a lamprey like robot and crespi et al 2004 2005 who created the amphibot the amphibot is a chain module robot where each module is of rigid box design with an actuator connection with its neighbor these actuators only allow for one degree of freedom this allows for the body undulation to only occur in one plane stefanini et al 2012 created the lampetra which is a robot that uses many segments to partake in the locomotion this system has a unique muscle like contraction actuators between each thin section the lampetra has a more flexible body due to the smaller sections and actuators in more recent work by crespi et al 2013 the amphibot was updated into the salamandra robotica ii this system modules or connections were not updated but the system was given a caudal fin appendage and multiple pectoral fins to aid in control and locomotion considering robots with multi degree of freedom there are multiple cases yu et al 2009 created a large robot that had full range of movement with rigid tubular modules with actuation mechanism connections that have two degrees of freedom the connection actuation mechanism is covered in a flexible skin to waterproof the system the modules were equipped with wheels mounted on rigid ribs along the module surface these wheels give this robot the capability to move on land and also give the robot more area for thrust generation in water rollinson et al 2014 created a robot that had all rigid components and actuation mechanism this chain of modules has actuation mechanisms where each coupling has only one degree of freedom however the actuation mechanisms have an alternating pattern so the next one in line has a planar motion at a ninety degree angle relative to the previous connection liljeback et al 2014 managed to compact the actuation mechanisms and connections to make a slimmer design using rigid components where each module has two degrees of freedom this robot is waterproof and is capable of appendage attachments to help with alternative missions 3 1 1 2 subcarangiform carangiform this class has a great variety of auvs to choose from the reason the subcarangiform and carangiform category are combined in the bioinspired description is because there is no great way to discern the robot s variation in body undulation initiation therefore the robots in this class are grouped together based off their actuation mechanism first the three link systems are considered second are four linked systems then the multi linked systems are consolidated and lastly the outliers are described considering the three link actuation robots leads us to one of the most heavily referenced units created by hu et al 2006 this robot has a rigid body unit that houses components the robot was given a semi neutral buoyancy with the addition of foam inserts along the body and caudal peduncle the body and peduncle are covered in a skin composed of rigid scales that overlap each other scales move freely past each other fins and tail are composed of flexible but strong material that allows for passive flexion of the fins yu et al 2004 robot considered the four link caudal peduncle assembly and a rigid body the peduncle assembly was covered with a skin to waterproof the assembly the tail is lunate to mimic those of biological systems but the tail is a rigid piece of composite yu et al 2012 made a larger auv that was primarily composed of metal components the different sections are mostly cubic in shape this system was also meant to transition from water to land by using wheels attached to the body large rectangular pectoral fins are used as control surfaces yu et al 2014 auv had rigid body and a caudal peduncle mechanism that is covered with a skin the pectoral fins were rigid with a square area but these fins are capable of 360 degree rotation this allows for the pectoral fins to be altered to give this auv backward movement koca et al 2016 created a robot that had a small rigid body where the caudal peduncle actuation unit is a majority of the body length this robot has fixed pectoral fins and a large rigid tail the skin over the peduncle was tight were the structure of the actuation mechanism is visible in 2005 multiple robots were created through the work of lui et al liu et al 2005 liu and hu 2005 where focus was put on the complex turning capabilities of the robot they created the mt1 liu et al 2005 which was a predecessor to the c turn robot liu and hu 2005 the actuation mechanism for these are multi linked peduncle units where rigid components were used information on the construction of these robots is limited but the c turn robot had a small head unit and large peduncle section where the peduncle section was covered by a multi sectioned skin ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 created a carp inspired robot where the robot structure was contained within a mimetic body shell electrical components are contained in a rigid acrylic tube while the peduncle is also a multi segmented unit the peduncle unit has a tail servo motor that has two bending joints to cause a flexible tail fin to bend the fins of this robot are flexible elastomers but are still semi rigid clapham et al clapham and hu 2014 created a unique prototype design isplash that showed promise in body undulation mimicry the body to peduncle was constructed using joints along the length allowing for head movement in the swimming this produced better flexion and thrust generated all components for this design are rigid but the actuation mechanism allows for components to slide past each other allowing for compaction of the design the isplash has a semi constant width of body along its length with a slight taper near the nose and tail there are a few examples for the outliers in the carangiform class a wire driven shark was constructed by lau et al 2015 where a multi segmented tail allows for a good peduncle flexion this wire driven peduncle used four wires and two servo motors two wires per servo motor upper and lower pair in the peduncle section the rigid body housed the electrical components and the servomotors due to the use of two servo motors the tail can have an angle of attack relative to the neutral vertical axis which lau et al 2015 described as a sway swimming motion a hydraulic actuated peduncle was created by katzshmann et al 2016 where the peduncle is made of a soft material the hydraulic actuation mechanism that makes the peduncle flex is through filling of different voids in the peduncle body and fins are constructed of rigid materials but the pectoral fins are functioning control surfaces 3 1 1 3 thunniform comparable with the subcarangiform and carangiform class the thunniform robots also use a peduncle actuation unit however to achieve a more concentrated tail actuation different actuation mechanisms are exploited to organize the robots in this category the style of the actuation mechanism is used where single link multi linked and other various robots are described firstly one of the initial robots that was created to analyze the effects of hydrodynamics of a moving body mimicking a tuna was the robotuna created by mit tolkoff 1999 similarly a robot mimicking a mackerel was created by wen et al 2013 although this system is a four linked actuation the testing was similar to the robotuna these two robots were equipped with a flexible streamline skin these robots were fixed to a strut that translates motions into belts housed in the mechanical skeleton which then force a body motion single actuators are the simplest of all the considered designs these designs were constructed using both soft and rigid materials considering the single actuators chen et al 2010 created an ipmc peduncle driven robot where the body and pectoral fins were rigid structures with no complacent movement the main objective of chen et al 2010 was to study the effects of thrust using different tail aspect ratios considering the same ipmc actuation mechanism a miniature robotic fish was created by marras et al marras and porfiri 2012 where the body and peduncle could be considered as two separate units controlled by a single motor and joint and the tail was a flexible caudal fin similarly this robot was used to investigate the impacts of varying the tail aspect ratios and shapes a relatively simple single motor actuated robotic fish was created by yu et al 2016a in their design the motor gives motion to an eccentric wheel that drives a connecting rod giving motion to the peduncle unit which is composed of rigid components the body is of uniform width with a tapered head unit the final design has a protective skin covering body unit this design has no control surfaces but was capable of performing c turns and s turns a multi linked robotic dolphin was created by shen et al 2011 this dolphin robot has a peduncle unit comprised of three links that allow for vertical flexion and a fourth for a smaller horizontal flexion so the tail has three directional movement the pectoral fin control surfaces also had three degree of freedom movement peduncle is encased in a rubber tubing to protect it and make it waterproof the entire body was covered in flexible mimetic body shell in efforts by yu et al yu and wei 2013 a slider crank robotic dolphin was created that gave actuation to two vertical pitch units and one yaw unit this realizes a tail flexion with three degrees of freedom and the pectoral fins are fixed surfaces pitch controlled using ballast sliders in the rigid body peduncle unit is covered in a flexible shell to make it streamline with the body through efforts to increase the endurance a gliding mode was conceived for a robotic design by wu et al 2015 this design incorporated a single joint for movement of the peduncle with another joint for movement of the caudal fin yaw and pitch movements are controlled through use of the pectoral fins and a buoyancy bladder which can be emptied and filled with water body and dorsal fin are rigid the body houses all the equipment including the buoyancy bladder yu et al 2016b created an impressive robot that was capable of fast speed and leaping out of the water yu et al 2016b design is comparable with the one by wu et al 2015 but some alterations make this an intriguing design the robot has a rigid body unit that houses components however the head is separate unit capable of vertical movement by using a neck joint there is a joint connection for the body peduncle and peduncle tail these two separate connections are each given their own dc motor respectively pectoral fins are capable of pitch control skeletal structure of the robot that holds components is rigid while this is encased in a flexible shell it should be stated that this robotic dolphin is capable gaining enough speed to break the water s surface with its whole body length the last thunniform auv that is defined is the large vorticity control unmanned undersea vehicle vcuuv created by anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 at the draper laboratory this design was inspired from the robotuna this robot was capable of extremely fast swimming however this is an extremely heavy hydraulic design the body is a rigid housing for the multiple batteries and other components while the peduncle design has a driven link chain which is encased in a rigid exostructure that folds over itself during flexion this exoskeleton allows for the permeation of water between each section however the body is waterproof to protect components this design has a main ballast to ensure the design does not roll pectoral fins are functioning control surfaces for depth and directional control 3 1 2 auv pectoral fin labriform there are few found robots in this class as it is difficult to create a stable robot that solely uses fin oscillation the robots in this category are organized as follows pure pectoral swimmer pectoral fin flexible fin joint with caudal fin assist and a pectoral fin dual caudal fin hybrid the first robot considered is a wrasse robot created by sitorus et al 2009 this design has a body with dimensions closer to a rigid cubic structure than those of the slender wrasse however this body was used to house the considered components relatively well the pectoral fins are relatively rigid but can perform both the rowing and flapping motions reminiscent of the wrasse in efforts by behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2016 a labriform swimming robot was created that had flexible pectoral fins which could perform both rowing and flapping motions the caudal fin is made from the same material as the pectoral fins and could be activated when more forward thrust is needed the body is rigid zhang et al 2016 created a cross over robot where the robot uses pectoral fins and a dual caudal fin for swimming the pectoral fins have 3 dof while the dual caudal fin have 1 dof where they compress the water when their stroke comes together stability is highly maintained when using the dual caudal fin the body is a rigid encasement for components and the fins are also rigid 3 1 3 auv oscillating dorsal and anal fin tetraodontiform to the authors knowledge no robotic systems have been validated to the point where they can be considered in this review the oscillation of dorsal and anal fin would require a unique understanding of the swimming characteristics of the ocean sunfish this would not be an extremely swift design if it was to be exploited 3 1 4 auv pectoral dorsal anal and caudal fin ostraciiform the robots that fill in this category try to mimic the boxfish or similar fishes there is not much variance in the designs found where these designs consider pectoral and caudal fin in the locomotion it may be recalled that the true boxfish uses its dorsal and anal fin during its swimming modes for stability and added thrust the ostraciiform robots are presented in a chronological order first the boxybot created by lachat et al 2006 is a rigid component based robot where the body was separated into two sections one for pectoral fin and the other for caudal fin the caudal fin section gives actuation to the fin but only in a one degree of freedom the pectoral fins are capable of 360 rotation but primarily performs flapping for thrust kodati et al 2008 created a robot in which they dubbed as microautonomous robotic ostraciiform marco marco s body was a 3d printed replica of a boxfish where the materials used were rigid pectoral fins are capable of 2 dof motion wang and his consultants wang et al 2013 wang and xie 2014 considered the same design the newer design in 2014 was slightly smaller but had the same capabilities the body is a rigid unit which is not mimetic like the marco the pectoral and caudal fin are rigid the caudal fin has a single degree of freedom and the pectoral fins can rotate 360 but also primarily used for flapping mainong et al 2017 used their design to invest different aspect ratios and shapes for the pectoral fins this design is all rigid components caudal fin has 1 dof pectoral fins have 360 rotation and the body is mimetic of the boxfish 3 2 consolidation of fin oscillation auv characteristics the auvs that utilize fin oscillation make up the largest classification much like the biological animals investigated the size shapes and capabilities do vary greatly for the auvs in this class earlier auv fin oscillation sections displayed shape and structure using the actuation mechanism to organize the systems within each category however there are systems in each class which should be recognized more so by their defining size and performance characteristics the anguilliform auvs have a smaller range of sizes in comparison with the carangiform or thunniform categories for the found total mass of these systems liljeback et al 2014 is the lightest design at 0 31 kg while rollinson et al 2014 and yu et al 2009 are 3 657 kg and 6 75 kg respectively yu et al 2009 is by far the heaviest design investigated this is due to its large module design anguilliform auvs generally follow a trend of length sizes of around 1 m with stefanini et al 2012 coming closest to this at 0 99 m yu et al 2009 rollinson et al 2014 and liljeback et al 2014 are all systems between 1 and 1 2 m the fastest forward speed is held by yu et al 2009 at 0 07 m s but liljeback et al 2014 has a high joint speed which would suggest that it possesses moderate speed capabilities crespi et al 2005 has a speed which was half that of yu et al 2009 yu et al 2009 and liljeback et al 2014 are the only two systems which have depth control as they have three directional control with their head unit stefanini et al 2012 has the best endurance at 5 h while crespi et al 2005 has a defined endurance time of 2 h in the subcarangiform and carangiform category there is a great variety of systems to choose from as for the size the lightest design is yu et al 2004 at 0 5 kg and the largest is ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 at 12 kg yu et al 2014 at 5 2 kg and yu et al 2012 at 5 kg round out the mid range weights with all other systems being below these values in a range 1 65 3 67 kg the system with the smallest length is clapham et al clapham and hu 2014 at 0 251 m and the largest being ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 at 0 9 m the rest of these systems range from lengths of 0 4 0 8 m clapham et al clapham and hu 2014 has the fastest speed of 0 85 m s and yu et al 2014 is the second fastest in this category at 0 7 m s all other systems speeds are higher than 0 1 m s but are below these maximum values due to the use of control surfaces these systems have good directional and depth control endurance ranges from katzshmann et al 2016 at 35 min to lui et al liu et al 2005 at 4 5 h the thunniform category has the largest auvs considered where anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 is the heaviest out of all auv categories at 173 1 kg the second largest being shen et al 2011 at 23 5 kg with wu et al 2015 following closer behind at 18 2 kg the lengths of these auvs fall in the same order where anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 has the longest length of 2 4 m the smallest thunniform auv is marras et al marras and porfiri 2012 at 0 07 kg and 0 117 m all other systems fall between the ranges defined by these systems the fastest auv is smaller at 4 7 kg and 0 72 m but yu et al 2016b design is capable of 2 1 m s swimming which allows it to leap out of the water even though anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 design is large it can swim at 1 2 m s the turning capabilities of these systems are still decent however compared to the subcrangiform and carangiform auvs these systems have lower body flexibility and hence lower turning capabilities depth control was also not found for most of these systems but the best performing systems often do have good depth control found endurance for these systems also ranges from 1 to 3 5 h the size of these systems allows for large battery packs equipped to power larger motors the labriform auvs have a range of mass of 0 33 2 5 m with the two found lengths having less than 0 1 m of variance the speed of behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2016 and zhang et al 2016 are the same at 0 53 m s regardless of their designs being completely different the turning and depth control are the best for zhang et al 2016 the variance of characteristics in the osctraciiform auv category is small so just an overview of the systems is stated while tables 8 and 9 can be referenced for specific numbers these auvs have few descriptions for mass but the smallest design is kodati et al 2008 and the largest one is wang et al wang and xie 2014 in respect to length the smallest is also kodati et al 2008 and the largest is wang et al 2013 kodati et al 2008 is the slowest ostraciiform auv investigated while wang et al 2013 is the fastest generally these auvs have moderate turning capabilities however wang et al wang and xie 2014 was described to have depth control which makes it the only one in this category to have this capability while this same auv has the only defined endurance of around 1 5 h 3 3 auv fin undulation for the fin undulation class it is more common to have soft materials which are more flexible due to the flexion which are required for thrust the categories for auvs follow those defined previously in the review and their description and pictures are given in table 10 3 3 1 auv undulatory pectoral fin rajiform the pectoral fin class is the second largest category to the caudal fin fishes lots of different shapes actuation mechanisms and materials have been utilized in this class for most of the robots considered efforts were made to mimic the same rib membrane excitation found in biological systems the order of the mentioned systems are leading edge rib passive fin and multi ribbed active excitation with the leading edge rib an upstroke and downstroke are performed by means of an actuation unit the stroke of the rib causes a translational wave along the membrane surface thereby causing thrust the multi ribbed actuation causes active excitation along the fin length through all the ribs engrained in the fin each rib supersedes the motion of the rib before causing the translational wave across the fin the first robot to be considered is a robotic manta ray gao et al 2007 created a design where a leading edge fin rib caused passive undulation to a membrane supported by a second rib running parallel to the body the body is a rigid unit with fixed control surfaces as horizontal and vertical tails this robot was then upgraded into the robo ray iii created by niu et al 2012 where the fixed control surfaces were replaced with functioning ones that increased stability and depth control a smaller leading edge design was developed by wang et al 2009 except the leading edge used shape memory alloy sma wires that overlaid an elastic substrate on two sides and are integrated into a polymer matrix having two sma wires gives the capability for the fin to have upstroke and downstroke by alternative heating of the sma wires through electrical resistance of the wire this design floated on the surface of the water with a buoyant rigid body turns can be achieved by selecting which fin to excite an encased rigid skeleton design is a pneumatic fin flexion ray created by cai et al 2009 this design was control tethered in order to supply power to actuators that pull on the cables that cause the rigid skeleton to morph for an upstroke the skeleton was encased in a mimetic body resembling the manta ray a soft material leading edge design is an ipmc actuated robot created by chen et al 2012 the ipmc comprised most of the first half of the elastomer membrane fin the body is a rigid box for components a similar design to the leading edge is a soft body robot created by alvarado et al 2013 this design has a body composed of soft materials which is greater than 70 of all materials used each side of the disc body fin has a single actuator at an angle where this actuator gives the fin vertical excitation for a passive translational wave there are solid body components encased within the soft body which act as buoyancy tanks to help control depth the last leading edge design is a bionic fin manta ray created by chew et al 2015 this design gives flapping actuation to a rigid leading edge in the pectoral fin however each fin is given an angle of attack during upstroke and downstroke the trailing edge for the fin receives passive undulation waves from this motion the body is a rigid encasement for components but has a semi tapered design the actively excited multi ribbed rajiform category has a few functioning robots often the benefit of this type of actuation is that the robot can perform a null speed turn where the robot can rotate in a stationary position the first robot to be considered using this actuation is the cownose ray i by yang et al 2009 in this design an actuation skeleton excites multiple ribs in a flexible membrane this skeleton is not encased in a body roman ii described by zhou et al zhou and low 2012 was a larger version of roman iii which is described by low et al 2011 in these two designs a rigid body has actuation units aligned on the sides to allow for the attachment and excitation of the pectoral fins the body is tapered and the only control surfaces are the pectoral fins two surface float systems found both use ipmc multi ribbed actuators for swimming punning et al 2004 and takagi et al 2006 designs are small and relatively similar so they are grouped together the ipmc ribs are each individually excited to create the undulation wave the raybot created by krishnamurthy et al 2010 is a rajiform robot that uses a caudal fin for propulsion which is what the electric ray commonly uses for thrust however even though this robot is equipped with enlarged pectoral fins made of soft material the pectoral fins do not perform undulations this robot is classified in this category due to the biological systems including electric rays in the rajiform category the smallest robot considered is a soft robotic ray combined with tissue engineering which was created by park et al 2016 this design is unique because a metallic skeleton transports electrical excitation to multiple ribs which then locally excite a layer of muscle tissue to flex the ribs have a descending size from front to back to cause larger undulations at the forefront of the pectoral fin through larger electrical impulse delivered the skeleton is electrically excited through laser flashes to two leading prongs on the skeleton depending on which prong receives a more direct impulse determines which half of the body is supplied a larger excitation causing a turning behavior if the prongs receive the same amount of impulse then a straight forward thrust is generated 3 3 2 auv undulating dorsal fin amiiform there are only two amiiform robots which were found to be classified in this category these two designs were created by hu et al 2009 and xie et al 2016 however these two designs considered active multi ribbed actuation the robogrilos described in hu et al 2009 has a very slender rigid body that contains the necessary actuation mechanisms to carry the translational undulation wave information on the robogrilos is limited but the fin size can be noted as large in aspect ratio in comparison with the body size in xie et al 2016 an extremely similar dorsal undulation fin was implemented into a rigid shell encasement akin to the torpedo a rigid criss cross tail maintains stability and gives this robot directional control 3 3 3 auv undulating anal fin gymnotiform similarly the gymnotiform class has few robot systems to be described siahmansouri et al 2011 design incorporated a ballast floatation tank with pitch and yaw actuation joints which connect to the multi ribbed propulsion fin this multi ribbed designs are similar to those found in the amiiform bioinspired category all components besides the fin membrane can be considered rigid for this design curet et al 2011 created a robotic knifefish that has an actuation mechanism encased in a rigid tubular shell where fin rib length is relatively short in comparison with those described in other systems however ribs have a small radius and the number of ribs that are powered in the actuation is greater than twenty which is the most out of any considered undulatory fin designs liu et al 2012 created a robot that used a passive fin design where a rib on the nose and tail of the robot gives excitation to the flexible fin membrane stretched between them this robot has a similar tubular body to the curet et al 2011 robotic knifefish this design is also equipped with a propulsive caudal fin to aid with forward thrust similar to the other robots in this category all components besides the undulatory fin can be considered rigid 3 3 4 auv undulatory pectoral fin and oscillating dorsal anal fin diodontiform this class is similar to the tetraodontiform where there are no found robotic systems that utilize undulatory pectoral fins and oscillating dorsal and anal fin likewise there are no found systems that use solely the undulatory pectoral fins like those found in bluegill this category along with the tetraodontiform are voids where new systems could be conceived 3 4 consolidation of fin undulation auv characteristics the auvs that utilize an undulation fin are diverse but these systems are fewer in number compared to the fin oscillation class generally the size of the rajiform auvs is comparable with the subcarangiform and carangiform auv category as masses and lengths do not exceed 10 kg and 1 m respectively the auv with the largest mass in the rajiform category is krishnamurthy et al 2010 at 5 5 kg the smallest being park et al 2016 even though the mass is unknown the relative size of this system is a fraction of the chen et al 2012 design which has the smallest found mass of 0 055 kg therefore it can be assumed that park et al 2016 is the lightest design the longest length is zhou et al zhou and low 2012 at 1 m while park et al 2016 is again the smallest design however this design had a small tail so its length is slightly greater than 0 01 m the majority of these systems are in a length range of 0 1 m 0 56 m more concern is placed on wingspan of these systems as pectoral fins are the main thrust generators by comparing the few defined systems a range of ratios of length to wingspan can be established as 0 48 0 87 the rajiform auv with the highest speed is gao et al 2007 at 0 7 m s the next best performing system is chew et al 2015 at 0 45 m s after these two systems there is a gradual decrease of performance with most systems not being able to swim faster than 0 3 m s the systems with the best turning capabilities are niu et al 2012 wang et al 2009 yang et al 2009 zhou et al zhou and low 2012 and low et al 2011 most of these systems do not have a defined turning capability depth control and none have a defined endurance in the amiiform and gymnotiform auv category there is limited information on size and length characteristics the largest is liu et al 2012 anal fin auv at 11 kg and 1 2 m however the two amiiform systems look to be of large size in table 10 pictures the undulation fin runs the length of these auvs which is good characteristic the speed of these auvs is decent as the range of speed is 0 18 0 424 m s considering both categories the capabilities of turning depth control and endurance are not found for these systems in tables 11 and 12 all characteristics of auv with undulation fin including mass length and speed are shown 3 5 auv jet propulsion the smallest classification for bioinspired aquatic robots use jet propulsion mechanisms for movement for this classification it is important to divide the systems by chronological order since they follow some similarities between them bioinspired robots are designed using the same materials to mimic movement of biological systems in table 13 auvs that utilize jet propulsion description and picture for reference are presented 3 5 1 bell constriction robotic systems falling in this category were inspired by common jellyfish such as aurelia aurita and aequorea victoria because they use similar aspects in their designs robotic jellyfish are presented in chronological order robojelly designed by villanueva et al 2011 was inspired by aurelia aurita in regards to its morphology and kinematics sma and bismac actuators were utilized to achieve a similar bell deformation to its biological system which would allow the motion of the robot the body is made from soft silicone poured into a mold to mimic the morphology of aurelia aurita the second bioinspired aquatic robot presented was designed and fabricated by najem et al 2012 the jellyfish robot mimics shape and swimming style of the aequorea victoria known for its high swimming efficiency najem et al 2012 chose this species because of its similar properties to ipmc actuators in regards to bell deformation the bell was fabricated using heat shrinkable polymer to mimic weight and shape of biological system the last system introduced is auv robotic jellyfish designed and produced by dooley et al 2016 although this robot does not meet the criteria for bioinspiration its physical aspects were influenced by jellyfish this system uses a pulley system to actuate its tentacles which results in an ineffective actuation under water the bell of the auv robot was made from transparent acrylic the system does not propel using bell constriction however since it was inspired by jellyfish it can be compared to the last bioinspired robotic jellyfish 3 5 2 mantel constriction octopuses locomotion and manipulation characteristics have been an inspiration to the development of auvs with the same capabilites poseidrone and another bioinspired robotic octopus are covered in relation to their skin and motion mimicry to biological species designed and manufactured by arienti et al 2013 poseidrone is a soft bioinspired robot consisting of manipulation and locomotion capabilities including crawling and swimming abilities poseidrone is recognized as the first soft bodied rov the system s skin is composed of rubber like materials the second bioinspired robot was done by sfakiotakis et al 2015 researchers focused on propulsion capabilities of the system where they achieved forward and backward propulsion and turning as well as ability to grasp objects the arms are mode from polyurethane material inspired by the octopus vulgaris the robotic octopus depends entirely on arms for swimming its manipulation capabilities could bring attention to several underwater applications such as monitoring inspections and rescue operations 3 5 3 mantel constriction and undulation fin robotic systems inspired by cuttlefish and squid fall into the mantel constriction and undulation fin locomotion classification auvs in this section are classified in chronological order providing a short description of each robot the cuttlefish dual undulation fin robot was designed and fabricated by low and willy 2005 although this system mimics cuttlefish movement it was unable to mimic the complex musculature of its fins the system does not meet the requirements for bioinspiration in regards to physical perspective the second robotic system also designed by low and willy 2005 depends on its fins for locomotion which mimics the majority for movement of cuttlefish the two undulating fins have their own actuation chain to create the motion to conclude the robotic fish does not meet the criteria for bioinspiration due to its lack of appearance to biological systems the best bioinspired system was designed by wang et al 2011 this system imitates the cuttlefish actuation this design is actuated by sma wires for the mantel constriction and membrane undulation the fin undulation propulsion is used during low speed swimming and mantel constriction for high speed swimming the last underwater robot designed and fabricated by gilva et al 2015 was inspired by the locomotion of cuttlefish and rays the system propels by lateral undulatory fins on the sides of the body because of its size it is believed that the robot may function as an educational platform for underwater robots 3 5 4 consolidation of jet propulsion auv characteristics the auvs based on jet propulsion locomotion form the smallest classification of robots in the same way as their biological inspirations the systems presented for each category differ from one another regarding length mass and speed however they display similar characteristics for turning capabilities depth control and endurance the auvs from tables 14 and 15 are organized in chronological order to give a perspective of the changes made from earliest robots presented due to the lack of locomotion there are no auvs that use the shell constriction propulsion bell constriction locomotion is denoted by the auvs created by villanueva et al 2011 najem et al 2012 and dooley et al 2016 the auv by villanueva et al 2011 has a mass of 0 242 kg and a diameter of 0 164 m najem et al 2012 has a mass of 0 02 kg and diameter of 15 m the last jellyfish robot by dooley et al 2016 has a length of 0 2 m from the systems presented villanueva et al 2011 and najem et al 2012 show a close resemblance to biological systems such as aequorea victoria and aurelia aurita speed for the villanueva et al 2011 is 0 19 m s while najem et al 2012 is slower with a speed of 0 0015 m s turning description was defined as low for villanueva et al 2011 and najem et al 2012 while the dooley et al 2016 did not give any explanation for this category however the auv robotic jellyfish was the only system to describe depth control being in the medium range and endurance description of less than 20 min from the systems presented villanueva et al 2011 and najem et al 2012 showed a close resemblance to the biological jellyfish classified in table 5 however the dooley et al 2016 failed at imitating the biological systems by exceeding dimensions the second classification for locomotion is the mantel constriction as show in tables 14 and 15 arienti et al 2013 and sfakiotakis et al 2015 are classified into this category for their locomotion description and inspiration on octopus arienti et al 2013 is the first octopus auv presented in the tables above consists of a mass of 0 75 kg and length of 0 2 m none of the auvs presented have similar mass to biological species however the design by sfakiotakis et al 2015 has the closest approach to the blue ringed octopus regarding its length of 0 15 m speed for these auvs varies greatly arienti et al 2013 has speed of 0 62 m s and sfakiotakis et al 2015 of 0 0986 m s lastly the sfakiotakis et al 2015 is the only auv in this category that has described turning capabilities none of the systems present information about depth control and endurance lastly the jet and undulation fin propulsion locomotion is denoted by auvs like the cuttlefish dual undulation fin robot by low and willy 2005 multi ribbed dual undulation fin by low and willy 2005 cuttlefish robot by wang et al 2011 and dual undulation fin robot by gilva et al 2015 none of the auvs named give information regarding mass except for multi ribbed dual undulation fin with a 9 kg mass both cuttlefish dual undulation fin robot and multi ribbed dual undulation fin consist of a length of 0 81 m the dual undulation fin robot has length of 0 24 m from all the systems the cuttlefish robot is the only auv to show speed being of 0 6 m s lastly for turning description category the dual undulation fin robot is classified as low the best auv to imitate a biological aquatic system from table 5 is the multi ribbed dual undulation fin for its similar size and weight to the biological cuttlefish however the cuttlefish robot by wang et al 2011 is the most similar to the biological cuttlefish because this auv has an active undulating fin and jet propulsion this actuation mechanism closely imitates the speed of the sepia officinalis cuttlefish being of 0 8 m s the dual undulation fin robot is not a good system according to the requirements for bioinspiration for missing information about mass speed depth and endurance 4 constraints limitations and future recommendations through the organization of these systems auvs can be expressed in their respective biological locomotion category often auvs derive their size shape speed materials and endurance from nature these derivations are expressed as five criteria where auvs are compared to the biological systems in their respective categories by expressing the best auvs for each criterion a better understanding can be gained on individual levels of bioinspiration and biomimicry by falling into at least one of the criteria described the auv is deemed bioinspired if a system is expressed in all criteria then it is biomimicry assumptions will be made so more systems can be categorized as biomimicry because it is extremely difficult for an auv to fulfill all criteria suggestions will be expressed that will help auvs works toward biomimicry 4 1 size comparison auvs can be found within the size ranges that are obtained from biological tables 1 3 and 5 mass and length ranges extracted from these biological tables give parameters that distinguishes a reduced group size of auvs these auvs that fall within these ranges are defined in tables 16 21 in the caudal fin category there is a good variety of robots that fall in the ranges for mass and length anguilliform ranges for mass 0 075 30 kg and length 0 63 3 m reduces the number of auvs to four out of seven as shown in table 16 in the subcarangiform and carangiform category has a range of mass is 3 25 650 kg and length is 0 65 4 55 m these large ranges allow for a greater variance in auv size these categories are combined because it is hard to differentiate initiation of the body undulation for the auvs however efforts should be made to differentiate auvs between these two categories in the future so they follow biological standards the largest auv is the carp robot by ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 the rest of the auvs not shown in table 17 fall below the mass and length ranges a large amount of the mass and length range is still available for the subcarangiform and carangiform auvs to exploit so larger auvs can still be created from biological thunniform animals the mass range 2 450 kg and length range 0 5 3 m are extracted these ranges are wide and auvs of bigger sizes can fit within this category as shown in table 18 the auv in created by anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 is the largest auv found the next two largest auvs created by shen et al 2011 and wu et al 2015 are more than 100 kg and 1 m smaller than anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 while lengths in this category are the largest described there is still a large amount of the size range that can be exploited in this category these longer lengths accommodate larger actuation mechanisms and components for greater thrust capabilities often structures are made of rigid components that cause an increase in the mass but the range defined allows for these larger systems the thunniform category can accommodate these larger sizes and this allows for even more powerful systems to be developed the labriform class does not have any auvs that fall into the ranges for mass 0 058 0 22 kg and length 0 158 0 271 m all the found labriform systems exceed the biological size range there is only one ostraciiform auv that has a size that can be compared to the boxfish while the other ostraciiform auvs exceed this size as shown in table 19 the marco by kodati et al 2008 has the smallest length of all of those defined but is still longer than the typical boxfish these systems have difficulty to imitating the boxfish because of their small size the rajiform class has a biological mass range 15 100 kg and length range 1 2 3 5 m the length range is defined for the wingspan because this is considered a more important dimension for this category the length range is selected in this manner as the pectoral fins are the main propulsion however when the range is defined in this manner none of the auvs fall within this range it has been deemed by these researchers that the size of their auvs can fall more in the mass range 0 055 7 3 kg and length range 0 01 0 6 m the auv range is vastly lower than the rajiform animals sizes do range due to growth of the animal but these auvs are being constructed in a manner that condones lower cost and ease of control the smaller size of these crafts could also be due to the small pools and water channels where these systems are tested however once designs are validated there is no reason as to why larger versions could not be constructed the amiiform and gymnotiform categories are grouped together in table 20 as these systems are similar except for the fin location amiiforms have a mass range 1 18 5 kg and length range 0 5 1 67 m gymnotiforms have a mass range 2 10 kg and length range 0 5 2 m there is only one robot in each category that falls within the biological range established these systems therefore do not follow the biological criteria for size the auvs that are classified in the jet propulsion category have the difficult task of replicating animals that have bodies void of rigid structures using rigid materials in this category can make a system too large bell constriction classification has a mass range 0 175 205 kg and a diameter range 0 014 1 80 m villanueva et al 2011 is the only system that agrees with the mass and length ranges in the jet propulsion category whereas the other two auvs only fall into the length range of the biological system as shown in table 21 auvs corresponding to mantel constriction locomotion are based on mass range of 0 028 50 kg and length range of 0 15 5 m arienti et al 2013 and sfakiotakis et al 2015 fall within the mass range obtained from the octopus lastly jet and undulation fin locomotion species have a range for mass of 0 0089 6 75 kg and length of 0 06 0 325 m these ranges limit the number of auvs down to three unfortunately the size of the system created by wang et al 2011 could not be determined however this system should be noted as it is constructed with proportionally more soft materials and has opportunity to fulfill the size requirements 4 2 shape comparison the shape of the auvs derive from the animals found in that category the more similar the shape is to an animal the higher the level of bioinspiration the shape helps to recreate the swimming capabilities of the animal there are notable auvs in each category which should be distinguished as their shape is the most similar in the anguilliform category a long slender body is consid115ed for all designs therefore in this category all auvs fit this criterion as shown in table 9 the subcarangiform carangiform thunniform and labriform categories can be distinguished by a long body length where the mid body or behind the head has the greatest girth the peduncle is tapered till it meets the tail where the tail has a lunate shape these shapes are determined by the pictures in tables 2 4 and 6 those presented in table 22 are determined to be the best biological representation for each category in the subcarangiform carangiform categories auv by hu et al liljeback et al 2014 ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 and katzshmann et al 2016 have the better shapes out of the ones displayed in table 22 these designs have a body shape that has varying girth along their length and height hu et al 2006 and ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 shapes are good because a body shell covers their mechanical structure ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 has an entire body encasement that does not show any evidence of its structure thunniform category has auvs like those created by tolkoff et al tolkoff 1999 anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 chen et al 2010 shen et al 2011 wen et al 2013 yu et al yu and wei 2013 wu et al 2015 and yu et al 2016a which all have extremely good shapes the robot dolphins all tend to have a shell applied to the mechanical structure which makes the final shape like that found in nature in the labriform category behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2016 has the best shape considered for the labriform auvs as presented in table 23 the ostraciiform auvs have shapes similar to the boxfish as presented in table 24 the auvs also shown in table 24 have designs where the shape was created in a cad software mainong et al 2017 3d printed the rigid body of their boxfish robot distinguishing the auvs that have shapes similar to the boxfish limits this category down to two the rajiform auvs do tend to have a similar shape that consider the outline shape of the animals in table 25 which are common shapes from fig 11 however the thickness of the body should follow the dimensions of the rajiform as well which tmeans that the body should be flattened there are a couple of soft material auvs that have shapes with a high level of biomimicry as shown in table 26 cai et al 2009 krishnamurthy et al 2010 alvarado et al 2013 and park et al 2016 have shapes created out of soft materials which promotes a likeness to those found in nature on the other hand gao et al 2007 niu et al 2012 and chew et al 2015 designs utilized a mixture of rigid and soft materials to create their shapes these shapes have a likeness to the biological but not to such a high degree as those constructed with primarily soft materials there are no similar shapes found in the amiiform and gymnotiform categories there were multiple auvs said to be derived from animals that have long slender bodies with gradual taper but these auvs did not mimic this shape curet et al 2011 and liu et al 2012 considered more of the shape of an electric eel which has a long tubular body however these designs will not be considered because they also do not consider the taper of the body representative examples of shape for the jet propulsion categories are shown in table 27 the auvs in this category that have good shapes are made of soft materials and are presentedin table 28 the soft material allows for the curve shapes that are commonly found in this category as mentioned the robojelly by villanueva et al 2011 uses bioinspired shape memory alloy composite actuators and fabricated from rtv silicone to imitate the skin of the aurelia aurita jellyfish villanueva et al 2011 the jellyfish robot by najem et al 2012 uses ipmc which are actuators matching the morphology and kinematic characteristics to the aequorea victoria jellyfish the bells of these two designs are flexible and shapes are very similar to the jellyfish the design of the cuttlefish robot by wang et al 2011 consists of sma wires actuating the pectoral fin and mantle which as mentioned presents the best practical and comprehensive performance lastly poseidrone is a soft robotic system primarily composed of soft materials to imitate the skin of biological octopuses 4 3 materials material selection has a large impact on a systems level of bioinspiration and biomimicry biological systems exhibit a diverse range of body types that bioinspired auvs should replicate the body structure of animals can give blueprints needed for the replication of swimming characteristics one material suggestion is that soft materials are emphasized for fins as these surfaces are flexible for animals these fins have varying rigidity depending on the fin type number of ribs thickness of ribs rib length and fin size there are several examples of auvs which utilize flexible fins in the anguilliform category the lampetra developed by stephani et al stefanini et al 2012 uses a flexible caudal fin along with a large number of body sections that gives this robot better body and fin flexibility in the subcarangiform and carangiform category the designs by hu et al 2006 liu et al liu and hu 2010 ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 and katzshmann et al 2016 utilize flexible fins hu et al 2006 is the only one that uses ribs in their flexible fins none of the studied thunniform designs were found to actively use flexible fins however when considering a biological thunniform the assumption of rigid fins is more acceptable as fin structure is often more rigid in this category however these fins should still have some complacent movement or slight flexibility the labriform category has one robot that utilizes a flexible fin joint with a semi rigid fin which was created by behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2016 this labriform design is considered in this group because the flexible joint allows the fin surface to have some passive movement during actuation the undulatory fin robots use a flexible fin membrane however there are some differences between the types of soft material used alvarado et al 2013 cai et al 2009 and chew et al 2015 used a thicker membrane fin while the rest of the systems use a thin membrane this thin membrane observed to be applied to amiiform and gymnotiform systems see table 27 the robotic systems that use soft materials as majority of their body exhibit a large body resemblance to the biological animal for example all the jet propulsion auvs in table 28 utilize soft materials and actuators villanueva et al 2011 and najem et al 2012 created systems that closely resemble jellyfish while wang et al 2011 and arienti et al 2013 manipulated a soft mantel to eject water out of a nozzle and have a likeness to their biological counterpart these auvs and others use soft material actuators to create thrust however soft actuators often have a trade off where actuators do not produce sufficient thrust the robotic systems that use soft actuators should be considered as special cases as these actuators often yield a natural motion impc and sma actuators flex like real muscle but when using these materials as a single actuator where a single wire or beam is difficult to generate thrust there are several auvs that use soft materials in their actuation and it can be noted that these systems exhibit a lower speed less than 1 m s this low speed is due to the actuators being small relative to the auv size however these actuators create a large force relative to their size a single beam or wire cannot produce the thrust required for moving a large robot at high speed the material properties for various soft material actuators are given in table 29 the sma wire is in the conducting polymer category it should be noted that the ipmc and conducting polymer are the only two materials which have a low electrical excitation however the specific power of the conducting polymer is much higher the actuation types of these materials are tensile or bending the construction of these flexible actuators need to be considered to optimize these material characteristics this means that there is still a possibility of improvement in the soft actuators as you could stack these materials to create a larger force however due to the electrical excitation needed components should be insulted from each other to avoid a short circuit or any other mechanical disturbance if ipmc and sma are insulated from each other a packaging of synthetic muscle can be created which increases potential area and thus creates larger force there are also systems that use rigid material actuators which are encased within a soft material shell this makes the body comparable to biological systems as the shape replicates the animal hydrodynamics this encasement over the mechanical structure can yield a similar motion to the biological cases where animals have a rigid skeletal structure with muscle attached to create the motion systems that use this construction method were referenced in the shape section including ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 shen et al 2011 yu et al yu and wei 2013 alvarado et al chen et al 2012 and yu et al 2016a all these works utilized rigid actuators bound in a soft materials encasement the rigid components give these systems better thrust and the soft body gives them better efficiency fixed system tests have been performed where mechanical systems are given actuation in a water channel these robots are given actuation through either a tether cable or the support strut the body of these systems exhibit good flexion though the internal components which are rigid like a skeleton this rigid skeleton is encased in a soft body skin or shell that makes the body more streamline these systems are the mit robotuna designed by tolkolf et al tolkoff 1999 and mackerel robot designed by wen et al 2013 both systems utilized a rigid tail at the end of the active caudal peduncle a rajiform auv used in a similar test was the flexible pectoral foil cownose ray developed by cai et al 2009 this test was performed on this system as proof of concept prior to letting this auv swim in a pool without the rigid support for the water channel test this rajiform auv also had an internal skeleton which is actuated by a pneumatic rope muscles while robotuna and mackerel robot are actuated through a pully and belt system the robotuna and mackerel robot can complete a full range of motion of their caudal fin however the rajiform auv has a limited motion range in comparison with biological systems 4 4 speed rigid material systems have a large amount of systems capable of fast speeds one of the most impressive systems is the robotic dolphin created by yu et al 2016a which is capable of leaping another swift design is the vcuuv by anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 these systems utilize different actuation mechanisms but they exhibit good body flexion and powerful thrust these two designs try to mimic their respective biological animal with rigid components to the best of their abilities yu et al kopman and porfiri 2013 robotic dolphin includes a head motion in their design to increase thrust through a more realistic body undulation of the dolphin in the subcarangiform and carangiform category the isplash created by clapham et al clapham and hu 2014 has a complete body flexion using rigid components through the incorporation of joints along the length of the body the isplash has a side to side head movement which gives this design the highest speed which can be noted in table 7 there are other carangiform designs that compete with the multi jointed isplash namely the three link g9 fish designed by hu et al 2006 and four link yu et al 2014 design these two designs incorporate a rigid head unit that encases sensitive components and both use a link system to make their peduncle flexible the g9 uses scales to try and make head peduncle tail more streamline the scales are much larger than those found in nature and can result in increased drag on the other hand yu et al 2014 used a smooth encasement to cover the peduncle all the rest of the rigid component carangiform robots exhibit similar speed and actuation type while some use a peduncle encasement like yu et al 2014 a few do not and the system performs swimming routines with the links exposed for the thunniform category the previously stated vcuuv and dolphin capable of leaping are the fastest but there are still reputable designs left in this category a simple design that is capable of fast speed is the single motor actuated robotic fish by yu et al 2016a this design has continuous growth of speed depending on power input as power increases so does tail frequency yu et al 2016a did not fully max out the designs capable speed the last notable design that was capable of decent speed was the slider crank robotic dolphin by yu et al yu and wei 2013 this design also had a rigid head and body attached to the large slider crank link actuators these rigid actuators provide powerful thrust to this design the labriform and ostraciiform auvs display similar speed capabilities however these speeds are not as extreme as the thunniforms and they are not very reputable these systems are capable of slower speeds which is similar to their biological categories the labriform category has the swifter designs of these two categories the rigid component pectoral and dual caudal fin robot by zhang et al 2016 matched speed with the flexible fin joint design of behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2016 the ostraciiforms have three designs with all similar speed as the boxybot by lachat et al 2006 wang et al 2013 and wang et al wang and xie 2014 where wang et al 2013 is a continuation of the wang et al 2013 design the undulatory fin auvs do not display extreme speed but there are some still worth discussing these designs should be stated as reference for the greatest speed in their respective classification for the rajiform category gao et al 2007 chew et al 2015 and zhou et al zhou and low 2012 have a descending value of swimming speed where gao et al 2007 is the swiftest the two amiiform robots designed by hu et al 2009 and xie et al 2016 have relatively similar speeds and are faster than the gymnotiform auvs which do not have speed greater than 0 3 m s the jet propulsion auvs are also not notable for fast speeds however some systems do display similar speeds to their respective biological categories although none of the systems using bell constriction present similar speeds to biological jellyfish it should be mentioned that robojelly designed by villanueva et al 2011 is the fastest system due to the shape testing for the bell with the optimal thrust systems in the mantel constriction category present some similar speed capabilities to their biological inspirations poseidrone by arienti et al 2013 is between the average and maximum speed for the enteroctopus dofleini the robotic octopus by sfakiotakis et al 2015 has speeds at a lower range due to its method of propulsion by using its arms to compress water away from the body the majority of the jet and undulation fin auvs in tables 14 and 15 did not present information about speed except the cuttlefish robot designed by low and willy 2005 the systems show similar speed ranges as the biological sepia officinalis cuttlefish the most intriguing aspect of low and willy 2005 is that the design incorporates a function undulation fin along with the mantel constriction to have control at low speeds 4 5 endurance when evaluating the endurance of the auvs it is hard to compare the similarities to biological systems as biological animals that live in reefs or some amount of structure do not have extreme endurance and migratory animals have extreme endurance what should be noted from the biological animals is that certain locomotion condones endurance burst high speed swimming and close quarter maneuvering the best bioinspired category that follows these three biological standards are auvs found in the caudal fin however the caudal fin category has more difficulty swimming in close quarter environments rajiforms are the next largest category which has some very functioning designs which exhibit good swimming ability with moderate speed the value of this category is that some actively excited multi ribbed rajiforms can perform null speed rotational turns the value in this is that the auv can move in extremely close quarter environments there have been a few robots classified in the jet and undulation fin category which exhibit either just jet or undulation fin there was no found actual combination auv similar to the cuttlefish the value of having a combination of cuttlefish auv is the null speed turning like the rajiforms and fast speed because of the jet propulsion while the labriforms ostraciiform amiiform and gymnotiform auv categories have functioning robots capable of lower speeds or have possibilities in close quarter maneuvering however much is to be desired in swimming performance for these categories 4 6 bioinspired biomimetic auvs and future recommendations the auvs which are considered bioinspired fall into at least one of the categories mentioned the most important categories being shape and materials to be biomimetic the auv should either 1 be in all categories or 2 have an extremely high degree of mimicry materials utilized to replicate biological animals for 1 it is very difficult for an auv to fall within all categories namely size shape material and speed endurance is considered as a low priority for this review as it is difficult to match biological systems where some animals can swim for extremely long periods of time however these endurance characteristics are given as a reference point that the auvs should be working toward for 2 materials are recommended to be flexible with structures comparable with those defined for the biological there can be a component structure comparable to a skeleton that transfers mechanical motion but there should be an exterior shell to have a mimetic shape and flexibility this rigid skeleton should have good flexion that allows for this shell to have smooth movement there are a few systems in fin oscillation that use flexible fins but majority of the body is often made of rigid components there are a few fin oscillation auvs that have a body shell over the skeleton ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 shen et al 2011 wu et al yu and wei 2013 and yu et al 2016b systems should be considered mimetic in the fin oscillation class the anguilliform auvs have system which utilizes a muscle like actuation lampetra by stephani et al stefanini et al 2012 should be considered mimetic although this system has visible section this can be easily fixed by a body sleeve to make this system more hydrodynamic a rigid component thunniform design which are considered as mimetic is the vcuuv by anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 this large tuna design is capable of complex swimming missions but the structure is made completely out of rigid components and hydraulic actuator where the peduncle has a clever flexion design that gives this body similar movement to the tuna this would suggest that more systems be considered mimetic but the decision to include this design is based off the fulfillment of criteria for 1 this is considered the only auv to span all these categories successfully considering the fin undulation class the rajiform category is the only one that has potential for mimetic auvs the rigid structures of the amiiform and gymnotiforms do not allow for the fulfillment of the materials selected however the rajiform category has several systems which could be deemed mimetic the soft structured systems by alvarado et al 2013 cai et al 2009 krishnamurthy et al 2010 and park et al 2016 have extreme resemblance to their biological counterparts the sizes of these systems do not fall within the biological criteria however these auvs are taking steps in the right direction to replicate the biological animals in this category the most intriguing design that is revolutionary is park et al 2016 this design uses actual muscle tissue outlaid in a polymer matrix that is excited through optical impulse to a metallic skeleton to actuate the pectoral fins unfortunately this design is very difficult to scale up in the jet propulsion there are several systems that are recognized by their mimetic design the auvs described in table 28 have extremely good traits the jellyfish auvs by villanueva et al 2011 and najem et al 2012 are the most mimetic out of the four however the designs of wang et al 2011 and arienti et al 2013 should be recognized by their soft mantel constriction propulsion designs the design of arienti et al 2013 has arms that flex extremely similar to the octopus and are able to push the auv when touching the sea floor considering all the various robot systems described in this review the best performing tend to align with the locomotion category that they are placed in rigid and soft materials can be used to create the various locomotions and shapes however the auvs with the fastest speeds are the ones with rigid components it could be further expressed that the use of a mixture of rigid and soft materials would make these robots more like biological systems a skeletal structure is the easiest way to describe how the rigid materials could be used soft materials can cover this skeleton much like the robotuna and mackerel and flexible fin cownose ray designed by cai et al 2009 the flexible skins make these systems highly mimetic and gives them more biological characteristics as stated recommendations are suggested during the material selection process the rigid skeletal structure described allows for more realistic performance for fin oscillation auvs while the soft body shells would help for these auvs to mimic animal characteristics considering fin undulation auvs more soft materials are needed as large portions of the fins and body need to be flexible various construction techniques need to be applied depending on the selection of a fin actuated by active or passive wave propagation the fin undulation auvs need to have body flexibility as this trait can be found for the biological animals described the jet propulsion auvs still need to determine the best construction methods to recreate the thrust necessary for efficient movement the amiiform gymnotiform and jet propulsion auvs struggle with directional control and more work needs to be done to improve their capabilities the jet propulsion auvs have the greatest possibilities for improvements out of the systems described 5 conclusions the utility of the aquatic unmanned vehicles offers a solution for a wide range of missions in efforts to create more optimized systems the adaptation of biological animal traits was proposed as these offer functional design alternatives this review compiled works by organizing auvs into a biological locomotion based classification the auvs described serve as a good literature reviews for each category the biological animals defined give criteria that can be used to create more optimized auvs the more intriguing auvs found were ones that aligned with the biological animals in their respective categories criteria extracted from each biological category creates a smaller batch of auvs found to be more inspired from nature from this batch of auvs certain observations are made that will allow for more realistic bioinspired auvs the selection of materials is assumed to be a top priority to create biomimetic auvs the use of rigid and soft materials was proposed as biological animals have rigid and soft structures body actuation and fin motion are deemed a significant part of the bioinspired process many auvs in the fin oscillation and undulation do not consider the body morphology of their characteristic animals auvs in the jet propulsion category are still being developed where they consider the soft body and how to replicate the thrust generated by these animals considering biological criteria it was discussed what makes these systems bioinspired and biomimetic and the auvs that fall into these distinctive categories 
23675,robotic systems capable of aquatic movement has increased exploitation in recent years due to the diverse range of missions that can be performed in otherwise hostile environments these aquatic unmanned vehicles auvs have begun to transition to systems that replicate biological animals as they are already extremely efficient at moving in aqueous environments the result is the abandonment of inefficient propeller based locomotion for a biological locomotion type suitable for the specific mission there is a diverse range of biological locomotion s available with animals that give a range of criteria to follow in this review existing aquatic animals and found auvs are classified how the bioinspired systems compare to the animals in their locomotion is investigated and discussed then it is discussed what makes these systems bioinspired and biomimetic and the auvs that fall into these distinctive categories limitations and future recommendations on possible improvements for these systems are offered keywords aquatic systems bioinspiration fin oscillation fin undulation jet propulsion 1 introduction currently there is a growing need for the adaptation of robotic systems which can autonomously perform routine tasks in aquatic environments blindberg 2001 habib 2013 scaradozzi et al 2017 raj and thakur 2016 yen and azwadi 2015 this need derives from the large scale unobservable volume of the oceans and other bodies of water which all present a challenge for hominoid observation this challenge persists due to human fragility in aqueous environments and the underdeveloped robotic systems that are deployed to solve the lack of mission capabilities of these systems inspiration must be taken from the diverse selection of species which inhabit the oceans rivers and lakes deriving inspiration from nature would mean the system is bioinspired if the system mimics a biological system it is dubbed biomimicry there have already been studies where researchers used bioinspiration and biomimicry to make an autonomous vehicle these new robots are characterized as an aquatic unmanned vehicle auv these auvs are modeled after certain fish species which the investigators deemed to be the best form to replicate this review offers a thorough classification list for biological and auv systems in this effort more current and dated systems are compiled into one location to allow for future investigators searching auv system reference information more available information allow the opportunity to create optimized auvs see table 26 auvs would have application in a wide range of civilian and military missions for exploitation in marine or aquatic environments these missions include environmental surveying oil spill monitoring internal pipe inspection erosion monitoring observation of animal species beach safety espionage anti espionage and border patrol blindberg 2001 najem et al 2012 the mission of an auv is dependent on its design however a major component of the auv is the autonomy of the system an autonomous system is necessary for the completion of these missions because signal transmission through water is difficult especially at great depths or distance the craft needs to carry out pre planned mission solely on its own and should respond to changing environment in addition these systems need to have long endurance and have the capability to move in close quarter environments with constantly changing fluid flow a close quarter environment would not condone a system tethered with a control cable or that of those using propellers propeller thrust degrades when fluid flow is not uniform propellers are also inefficient in comparison with fishes where propellers are estimated efficiency of 40 50 percent habib 2013 fishes have the ability of changing direction at a complete stop which is highly beneficial in close quarter environments for example systems comparable with the eel would be useful in pipe inspection where large body contortion is necessary to navigate complex bends furthermore tuna are extremely efficient swimmers such a robot that has a high level of biomimicry could also display high speed required for specific missions depending on mission requirements a biological system should be the center point for the design because of their swimming capabilities the current unmanned submersible systems being used in civilian and military missions are all relatively similar where by systems use propellers for thrust these unmanned submersibles have been adapted from their larger manned relatives when the utility and safety of these systems was realized blindberg 2001 autonomous aquatic robotic systems have been used with rapid growth of use since the 1970s blindberg 2001 however the most substantial exploitation increase is from 1990 to 2010 with the first commercial products coming about in the 2000 2010 timeframe blindberg 2001 these systems are often outfitted with observation equipment like cameras temperature gauges salinity instruments and acoustic mapping blindberg 2001 cruz et al 1999 these systems can be separated into two classifications there are the torpedo shaped autonomous systems which have been widely used on more long endurance and faster speed missions these types of systems have been extensively used because of their long range and depth capabilities blindberg 2001 systems like those used to track migratory shark species by acoustic tag tracking have been implemented with mixed results lost connection with signal beacon lin et al 2013 scientist tag a shark with an acoustic tag and then a torpedo shaped auv follows this beacon at a predetermined distance lin et al 2013 this allows for the observation of depth temperature of water salinity along with gps location of the animal lin et al 2013 there are torpedo shaped robots capable of long range missions known as gliders were swept up by the military guizzo 2008 these glider submersibles work on an efficient and clever system that uses buoyancy and winged flight to accomplish forward movement no propellers guizzo 2008 by filling and emptying ballast tanks the craft is capable of changing depth during depth change large control surfaces give the craft forward direction other types of submersible robots are the slower and less hydrodynamic robots that are comparable with the kambara wettergreen et al 1998 these systems are used often because of their appendage attachments and their adequate close proximity control these systems are often simple where an open frame external cage contains all the equipment and not much focus is placed on their efficiency wettergreen et al 1998 similar submersible systems to the kambara have been utilized for reef exploration wreckage surveying and deep sea exploration there have been extensive reviews of auv and biological systems these reviews are used and adapted to make a comprehensive review use of works blindberg 2001 habib 2013 scaradozzi et al 2017 raj and thakur 2016 yen and azwadi 2015 laschi et al 2013 sfakiotakis et al 1999 colgate and lynch 2004 lauder 2015 neveln et al 2013 allow for a starting point where ideas can be gathered and amassed into one place the reviews of auvs lack certain topics or overview of systems this review fills voids in this research and offers it in a clearer format the review is organized as follows in section 2 the biological locomotion and species are outlined in section 3 the found auvs are described and organized in section 4 there is an in depth discussion about the best auvs compare them to the biological and the most critique for biomimicry systems in section 5 summary conclusions are presented 2 biological locomotion and species there are several methodologies that can be used to define the locomotion characteristics this review proposes a more encompassing and straightforward classification for the biological systems that can be applied to the found auvs locomotion is divided into three main classifications namely fin oscillation fin undulation and jet propulsion this is the first review that combines these locomotions there are many categories within these main classes along with overlap between them the classification and categories are presented in fig 1 the fin oscillation has one of the largest categories the well known caudal fin swimmers while the largest class in fin undulation is pectoral fin swimmers the jet propulsion class is amongst the smallest defined there is not as much variety in this class the dorsal anal fin oscillation is described in the fin oscillation section the oscillation undulation is detailed in the fin undulation moreover the combination jet fin undulation is described in jet propulsion the terminology for the fin oscillation was taken from sfakiotakis et al 1999 where a detailed review is given for different types of fish locomotion some of the same terminology is needed for the explanation of the auv systems thus this terminology is given to allow a better understanding of types of fins and what nomenclature are used in the various categories of locomotion shown in fig 2 a and c respectively are for a caudal finned fish and ray species these classes are vastly different in their swimming capabilities however there are similarities in the fin structures as ribs are used in the fins to give the flexible membrane rigidity these rib structures are shown in fig 2 b and d for the caudal fin fishes and the ray respectively the most important fins to take note of are caudal pectoral dorsal and anal however the ray has enlarged pectoral fins in comparison with the caudal finned fish sfakiotakis et al 1999 biological species have developed in a manner which condones the most efficient propulsion for their mission habib 2013 sfakiotakis et al 1999 colgate and lynch 2004 webb and weihs 2015 most fishes developed an actuation that produces a useable thrust and a body that minimizes resistance drag buoyancy of fishes is maintained through use of a swim bladder that fills with gases to counteract the animals weight and to maintain depth control pitch and roll are controlled with auxiliary fins or main propulsion fins yaw is controlled through use of the body flexion in most animals the various terminology for directional change can be seen in fig 3 b and c it has been found that fish species swim within a strouhal number range between 0 2 st 0 4 yen and azwadi 2015 depending on the fluid flow the fish must compensate with either body movement or fin stabilizing webb and weihs 2015 high endurance or migratory swimming would require more powerful swimming muscle and efficient forward thrust propulsion gemballa et al 2006 the skin surface also has a large effect on the efficiency on the system sharks are known for their drag reducing skin lauder et al 2016 studying individual classes that utilize these various fins are explained in their respective sections along with corresponding species in that class 2 1 fin oscillation locomotion the fin oscillation classification is the largest of all those defined these biological systems offer a great variety to choose from size speed endurance and turning capabilities range propulsion actuation also varies depending on the sub classification the chart presented in fig 4 gives representation of the vast diversity of species found using fin oscillation as shown in fig 4 on the left there are the caudal fin swimmers which are the first classification discussed then the pectoral fin species after that dorsal anal fin and the combination oscillation fin categories are consolidated as seen in fig 4 the caudal fin category has the largest representative group of animals the labriform fishes are the second largest grouping while the tetraodontiform and ostraciiform are the two smallest 2 1 1 caudal fin it is clear from the flowchart in fig 4 that the largest category is the caudal fin this is due to the large variety of animals that use a caudal fin for major propulsion caudal finned fishes are differentiated by the thrust generated by a tail realized through a body undulation these fishes are usually labeled as body caudal fin bcf in other reports scaradozzi et al 2017 sfakiotakis et al 1999 fishes that utilize a caudal fin tend to be faster swimmers or have a high endurance and a large majority of these fish species tend to be predatory animals syme and shadwick 2011 there are long distance swimmers found in this class as some are migratory animal van ginneken et al 2005 the caudal fin allows for more thrust to be generated but thrust magnitude is dependent on the body actuation gillis 1996 the different degrees of body undulation are shown in fig 5 the greatest degree of body undulation can be seen expressed in the anguilliforms fig 5 a which the first caudal fin category discussed the subcarangiform carangiform and thunniform will then follow in this order respectively as the body undulation decreases in this manner 2 1 1 1 anguilliform the anguilliform caudal fin category represents animals denoted with the largest body undulation to realize a caudal fin oscillation sfakiotakis et al 1999 as shown in fig 5 a these animals are extremely flexible and have small turning radii gillis 1996 eels and sea snakes are considered in this class gillis 1996 graham et al 1987 both are found in reefs or protective covering where these animals display a great degree of body flexibility this flexibility comes from the large number of vertebrae for an eel this number can average 104 whereas sea snakes can average 186 vertebrae gillis 1996 eels are one of the most efficient migratory swimmers in a study conducted by van ginneken et al van ginneken et al 2005 controlled tests found that the efficiency of eel anguilla anguilla aka european eel migratory swimming is extremely high van ginneken et al 2005 using a comparison set from two experiments they determined the endurance of these animals one experiment lasting 173 days and the other 7 days to make sure that the speeds were similar for each result in their experiments they used a water channel and subjected the animals to constant flow of oxygenated rich water during these two trials the eels swam with an average velocity of 0 22 m s the european eels sustained this pace for the full 173 day experiment 5500 km van ginneken et al 2005 studies have also been done on the eel migration using pop up satellite tags psats in this investigation a psat of dimensions 2 13 cm2 were attached to eels to study the increased drag and the impact on the eels swimming performance burgerhout et al 2011 it was found that individuals struggled swimming and their efficiency was impacted significantly burgerhout et al 2011 this shows that these animals have extremely efficient propulsion and they use energy sparingly to accomplish migratory swimming 2 1 1 2 subcarangiform carangiform the subcarangiform and carangiform classifications are extremely similar they can be distinguished with a slightly varying initiation point along the body subcarangiform fishes utilize slightly more back and forth head movement as presented in fig 5 b undulation is therefore initiated closer to the head and a longer undulation wave realizes caudal fin oscillation which requires the activation of more muscle along the body altringham et al 1993 a common agreement is that carangiform fishes utilize one third of their posterior body for undulation scaradozzi et al 2017 sfakiotakis et al 1999 subcarangiform fishes include animals like salmon and carp while examples of carangiforms include trevally shad and piranha these fishes are some of the most studied somewhat because they are the most easily caught and are considered efficient power thrust fish altringham et al 1993 these fishes inhabit bodies of water that satisfy their survival needs these two classes have a large variety of sizes weights and speeds the flexibility of these two sub categories is much less than the anguilliform sub category 2 1 1 3 thunniform thunniform fishes are most often found to be predators or a higher order of the food chain noted by a very limited body undulation to the last quarter of the body sfakiotakis et al 1999 as shown in fig 5 d this body undulation and compact muscle grouping force a rigid tail with powerful oscillations syme and shadwick 2011 shadwick and syme 2008 bodies are usually very streamline and can be considered as extremely efficient fishes where they sustain top speed for long duration to either pursue prey or avoid even larger thunniform predators guinet et al 2007 this sub category includes tunas sharks and dolphins it can be mentioned that some of these species in this group are warm blooded which gives these predators the upper hand in terms of endurance and power syme and shadwick 2011 warm muscle means more efficient muscle performance and hence more thrust syme and shadwick 2011 2 1 2 pectoral fin labriform the pectoral fin is a category of fishes which primarily uses pectoral fin locomotion to perform slower speed agile swimming davison 1988 fishes like wrasses parrotfish and sheephead utilize this form of propulsion for the efficiency of close quarter swimming the species that use labriform swimming tend to be found in reefs and areas of cover these fishes use a caudal fin occasionally when their pectoral muscles are at maximum endurance or when burst swimming korsmeyer et al 2002 these fishes have low endurance when solely utilizing their pectoral fins korsmeyer et al 2002 in fig 6 the top and side views for the rowing and flapping swimming modes are shown for a labriform swimmer the pectoral fins of the labriforms have rigid fin rays between the fin membrane which give the fin rigidity westneat 1996 the swimming strokes of the labriform fishes can be classified into two categories namely flapping or rowing motions as shown in fig 6 the flapping motion is when the fish only performs upstroke and downstroke with the leading edge of the fin while the rest of the fin membrane remains passive this means that both the upstroke and downstroke are both power strokes for flapping sfakiotakis et al 1999 however the relative area for drag is increased when using flapping fin strokes so speed is low during this actuation therefore flapping is good for close quarter maneuvering the rowing motion is used for faster speeds this motion can be described by the leading edge making a vertical downstroke but on the upstroke the fin is pulled back at an angle to the vertical axis sfakiotakis et al 1999 sitorus et al 2009 2 1 3 dorsal anal fin tetraodontiform this unique class is very sparse in the literature covering species like the ocean sunfish sharptail mola and slender sunfish these three represented animals are all in the same family so it is easiest to just refer to the category by the largest member which is ocean sunfish the ocean sunfish are extremely large and are the biggest bony fish on the planet fig 7 is a representative drawing of the ocean sunfish these fish have long lifespans which allows them to reach huge sizes however these fishes have the least efficient design considered out of all the ones mentioned these fishes utilize two large paddle fins one dorsal and one anal for locomotion sfakiotakis et al 1999 these fins have rigid ribs and the fish uses the most unorthodox oscillation motions to control direction and depth sfakiotakis et al 1999 yaw and pitch control for this animal are low moreover this fish has issues navigating in close quarter environments these fishes are open ocean migrators who feed on jellyfish their body is considered flat with a slight taper from their head to the underdeveloped caudal fin 2 1 4 pectoral dorsal anal and caudal fin ostraciiform the ostraciiform is a unique class because it uses pectoral and dorsal anal fin oscillations to control movement sfakiotakis et al 1999 hove et al 2001 gordon et al 2000 these fishes can be found in reefs and close quarter environments what makes this class stand out is the unique body shape for the species namely boxfish and cowfish these two relatives have a body shape that is akin to rigid box as shown in fig 8 these fishes can maintain finetuned fin oscillations giving this fish good maneuverability in the small crevasses it calls home the speed of these animals is low because of their body shape and their inefficient fin actuation for fast speeds hove et al 2001 osctraciiform locomotion can be described in a few different ways like labriform and ostraciiform which use pectoral fin flapping motions however osctraciiform not only do vertical flapping they also perform horizontal flapping too hove et al 2001 the dorsal and anal fin are used to give more forward thrust and stability and both fins flap synchronously in phase hove et al 2001 occasionally they use their extremely small caudal fin for some burst propulsion but is rare hove et al 2001 2 2 consolidation of characteristics of biological fin oscillation species the fin oscillation classification has probably the greatest degree of variation of animal size shape speed and swimming technique between the categories these variations allow the animals in this class to perform a wide range of missions this includes close quarter maneuvering burst swimming and endurance it should be stated that the values in table 1 should be a range these values should rather be used as a point of reference where animal growth and speed are averaged unless otherwise stated this allows for values from zero and some greater than those specified it should also be realized that these animals serve as a generalization for these classes there is a wide variety of species that use a defined locomotion but attempts in creating a range of values through the animals selected gives a batch of mimicable animals table 2 offers details about the animals endurance and turning capabilities as well as a picture for shape for fin oscillation the most abundant animals use a caudal fin however since the sizes vary so drastically for these animals each class should be described independently this review regularly only displays a few of the most commonly found animals for the anguilliform the european eel is the midrange size but it has the highest average speed and the highest endurance the giant moray is the largest eel selected it has an extremely flexible body but this animal does not have extreme endurance the giant moray is an ambush hunter that sometimes moves along the reef to find new hunting grounds the sea snake makes shallow water dives to catch prey off the coast these animals are capable of dives lasting longer than 20 min during these dives they search crevasses in the ocean sea floor these animals are not migratory swimmers in the subcarangiform category two similar animals have been selected both being salmon having similar shape the chum and chinook salmon display burst swimming and migratory swimming from oceans to rivers as all salmon species do as part of their life cycle these animals swim long distances to reach their hunting grounds off the pacific coast of asia and north america friedland et al 2001 these animals then return to the rivers and stream estuaries to mate where depending on the estuary salmon must perform jumps over waterfalls this is done by burst swimming and leaping out of the water above the rapid or water fall burst swimming is for short periods of time as salmon cannot sustain this high energy jumping the carangiforms have some good shaped fish with slender tapered bodies that they utilize to be swift predators the most dominant predator of these is the swordfish an animal capable of extremely large sizes even more impressively this animal is capable of extreme burst swimming of 27 m s sagong et al 2013 the swordfish body is very streamline with the enlarged sword on its nose also known as an enlarged bill this bill gives it predatory advantage when attacking other fishes and helps this fish pierce the water when swimming allowing it to swim faster the bonefish also has a streamline body a powerful peduncle that propels this fish through the water the trevally is a moderately fast carangiform that has a more slender body that tapers heavily into the peduncle this animal has prominent dorsal and anal fins the thunniform animals are on the upper tier of the food chain apex predators of the oceans these animals are capable of large sizes and express extremely streamline bodies the tuna dolphin and shark can leisurely swim at speeds greater than 1 m s and burst swimming greater than 10 m s the yellowfin is one of the largest tuna with average weight of 50 kg for caught fish but these animals can get much larger dagorn et al 2006 however a mature yellowfin is larger than the skipjack tuna it was found that the yellowfin tuna even though larger has great high speed endurance as it can maintain 3 m s for more than 30 min guinet et al 2007 the tunas have a slender lunate tail that is semi rigid and good for thrust the aspect ratio of the yellowfin can be observed to be larger than the skipjack tuna the elongated second dorsal fin and anal fin of the yellowfin tuna has not been found to play any part in thrust generation all fins of the tuna are semi rigid structures fin oscillation and undulation animals often have scales that cover their bodies these structures on their skin gives the animal a protective layering the skin of the predatory animals gives them an advantage during high speed swimming for predators scales can be observed as smaller and therefore create a smoother surface like those of the tuna other animals have adapted to create scales that induce a boundary layer like that found in sharks sharks regularly have scales microstructures that trap water in vortexes along the skin surface this greatly reduces drag and allows sharks like the mako to achieve extremely high speed the mako shark is capable of burst swimming greater than 13 m s for short periods of time the body shape of the mako shark with a more elongated and tapered body compared to the tuna the shark has semi rigid fins but these fins can still passively flex the dolphin is also a fast predator with a body comparable to the shark the bottlenose dolphin is a mid sized dolphin that is capable of power endurance much like the other predators in this category bottlenose dolphins swim at greater than 11 m s labriform swimmers do not have the most impressive of speeds as their pectoral fins are used to swim in short range missions these animals do use their caudal fin but this is only when they need a boost of speed their shape is somewhat flat and elongated comparable to the trevally body type their pectoral fins give them decent turning capabilities as their bodies are flexible like the caudal fin swimmers the schelegel s parrotfish is the best representation for the labriform it has the highest average speed and top speed but it is the mid size of the three displayed at 0 2 kg and 0 2 m these fishes are found in the coral reef with ostraciiform species the ostraciiform is detailed with only one fish as the boxfish and cowfish are comparable these fishes are small with an average weight being less than 0 1 kg and length less than 0 2 m these fishes hide out in alcoves along coral reefs so their multiple oscillating fins give it great control and stability with a moderate average speed relative to its length the largest animal described is the ocean sunfish a tetraodontiform the maximum weight of this animal is nearly 1000 kg and a wingspan of an impressive 2 4 m this extremely large animal stays in deeper water and has a maximum speed of less than 2 m s however due to its large size it is still able to cover 26 km day ocean sunfish 2017c the ocean sunfish only has four active fins where the pectoral fins help stabilize the colossal body despite these control surfaces yaw pitch and roll are very difficult to control for these fishes the body is flat with a slight disk shape seen from a side view with a taper from the head to the tail 2 3 fin undulation locomotion animals in this class use individual rib excitation in their fins to create undulatory waves along the fin habib 2013 sfakiotakis et al 1999 albert 2001 boileau et al 2002 the animals in fin undulation use this wave propagation for thrust and stability control some of these animals are able to control the direction of the wave giving them forward and backward swimming capabilities or null speed turning there are many types of fins utilized by these animals namely pectoral dorsal anal and dorsal anal there is a sub category which uses undulatory and oscillatory fins high endurance swimmers can be found in this class but more often these animals are ambush predators that use structures as cover for classes such as the dorsal anal and combination fin their undulatory fin allows forward and backward movement which is ideal in close quarter environments albert 2001 the four different types of undulatory fin and the one combination of undulation and oscillation fin are presented in fig 9 it follows from the latter figure that this class is much smaller than the fin oscillation but the animals are more diverse in this class the largest fin undulation category is the rajiforms which is discussed first then the comparable amiiform and gymnotiform are described after that the balistiform is shown as the dorsal and anal fin combination category last the diodontiform is presented to be another strange locomotion as it uses both oscillation and undulation fins 2 3 1 pectoral fin rajiform this class includes species like rays and skates the body individuals are comprised of cartilage which gives their whole body great flexibility fin ribs extend from the body into the pectoral fin these ribs are excited by muscles which run through the skeleton the skeletal structures of these animals are shown in fig 10 rajiform individuals like the common stingray or skate can control these ribs individually to create an undulatory wave along the fin length the rib structures for the common stingray are more free compared to the manta ray whose ribs are aligned in a cross weave matrix and unify at the fin edge the common stingray ribs do not have a secondary terminus connect when compared to the manta ray rib structure manta rays have cross ribs to the spanning ribs which gives the pectoral fins more rigidity the common stingray does have some cross connection but these are much closer to the body as the rib tips must still be free to move the difference in structure is shown in fig 10 a and b however this difference in structure for the manta ray means that a large portion of the leading edge is excited to cause the movement that forces the undulation along the fin rosenberger 2001 for animals like the common stingray or skates fin ribs are distributed along the entire fin surface area and partake as dominant sections as the ribs are free to move independently of its neighbor rosenberger 2001 as shown in fig 11 the various shapes for all the animals that partake in rajiform swimming are presented there are clear differences in shapes some are more circular like the common stingray while the cownose ray has triangle shaped pectoral fins there are two outliers in this category a caudal fin is utilized for thrust by the animals expressed in fig 11 e and f shovelnose guitarfish shape is shown by fig 11 c while the shape of fig 11 f are the common torpedo or electric ray as seen in fig 9 these rajiform members are combined with the fin oscillation category to represent their caudal fin these animals use a caudal fin for most of their swimming these caudal fin rajiforms are more closely related to the shark however these animals have enlarged flattened pectoral fins and utilize these in swimming too but primarily use the caudal fin rajiform shapes and fin structures determine what kind of swimming capabilities the animal will exhibit the manta and cownose rays can cruise more because their fins behave as more rigid structures allow these animals to glide the common stingray and electric rays have better ability of navigating close quarter environments as their flexible fins give them extreme turning capabilities these rajiforms offer a diverse range of swimming capabilities 2 3 2 elongated undulating dorsal fin amiiform amiiform animals are known by their undulating dorsal fin sfakiotakis et al 1999 jagnandan and sanford 2013 there are a limited number of animals that use this locomotion examples of species that use this locomotion are comparable to the african aba aba and the bowfin these fishes are not extremely fast but they are decently agile as they can move forward and backward by switching the direction of the wave motion in the fin including increased directional control by rolling their fin axis off vertical they do this by retracting muscles along their sides to achieve spinal curvature aba aba knifefish 2017 aba aba knife fish feeding 2017 their dorsal fin runs the length of the spin and is composed of a flexible membrane around closely compacted fin ribs or rays jagnandan and sanford 2013 the complex undulations in the dorsal fins are caused by the contraction of extensor and flexor muscles along either side of the dorsal fin as shown in fig 12 these animals can realize tight turning and multi directional capabilities jagnandan and sanford 2013 these fishes prefer cover as they are not very fast and use cover to ambush their prey and protect themselves 2 3 3 elongated undulating anal fin gymnotiform the gymnotiform class is comparable to the amiiform animals however the undulating fin is on the posterior of the body as an elongated anal fin these fins also have many individual ribs albert youngerman et al 2014 states that these undulating fins are composed of 100 300 bony ribs this allows the fish to have complete control of the fin for the entire length because each rib has its own set of agonist and antagonist muscles the membrane between the ribs are extremely flexible and can move with the rib with ease low and willy 2005 the length and location of the anal fin along with the fins flexibility can be noted in fig 13 these fishes are ambush predators like the amiiforms and prefer obstructions in the water column where they can hunt small prey with greater ease these fishes do not make large migratory swims as they are small and are vulnerable to larger predators outside their hunting zones the forward and backwards movements of the gymnotiform and amiiform allow them to perform complex maneuvering the bend of the body allows the fin to be angled to the vertical axis permits these fishes to move with higher degree of freedom the main undulatory fin also allows these fishes to move forward backward upward and downward as described in the detailed study by youngerman et al 2014 the ghost knifefish can vary the undulation waves and angle of attack of the fin to achieve various directional changes youngerman et al 2014 the pectoral fins of the ghost knifefish are used as control surfaces for pitch and roll control black ghost knife fish 2017 2 3 4 combination of dorsal and anal fin undulation balistiform the balistiform fishes are classified by the use of both the dorsal and anal fins also known as medial pair fin mpf undulation locomotion sfakiotakis et al 1999 the most commonly found species in this class is the triggerfish fishes that utilize this propulsion type utilize mpf combination until the muscles controlling the fin ribs are exhausted then the caudal fin is used until muscle recuperation occurs korsmeyer et al 2002 therefore even though these species primarily use their mpfs occasionally the caudal fin is utilized to increase endurance in experiments performed by korsmeyer et al 2002 picasso triggerfish were subjected to an endurance test in this test fluid flow was increased intermittently till the fish was at its maximum speed where it could barely maintain its position in the channel the average time lapsed till the fish faltered was 4 h however these fishes were relying heavily on their caudal fin for most of the maximum speed korsmeyer et al 2002 these types of fishes do not get very large and this locomotion is primarily utilized by triggerfish the various types of triggerfish are all similar where the majority are comparable to just one of the larger species that can be found the picasso triggerfish these fishes do not perform large migrations and can be most easily studied in shallow reefs 2 3 5 combination of pectoral fin undulation dorsal anal oscillation diodontiform this is a unique classification of fish where the use of large undulating pectoral fins aid in slow speed motion while oscillating dorsal and anal fins generate more thrust for higher speeds chan 2010 fishes found in this class are similar to the porcupine fish or pufferfish this fish is not considered as migratory swimmers and inhabit shallow water reefs these porcupine fish are not burst swimmers and rely on their body spines and unique attribute of swelling up with water to enlarge their size to ward off predators fishes that also use the pectoral fin undulation are bluegill these fishes do this by individual ribs within the fin lauder 2015 the bluegill use these fins for low speed swimming but use their caudal fin for higher speeds 2 4 consolidation of characteristics of biological fin undulation species the animals in the fin undulation classification vary greatly however it should be noted that the fins which have ribs and are utilized to perform undulation vary depending on the type of fin and also the type of animal these ribs allow these animals to have great control of their fins in sections rib length can vary depending on the animal s body shape shapes vary from flat body to tubular elongated bodies the body types vary which allow for different fin length and wave propagations the body of an amiiform allows for the fin to not have long ribs since the fin is so long while the main ribs in the manta ray are long to control the leading edge of the pectoral fin these animals can be considered in having good mobility but are not burst swimmers in tables 3 and 4 the characteristics of the some of the biological fin undulation species are presented the fin undulation category is filled with animals that include ambush predators capable of multi directional motion the animals capable of this motion are amiiform gymnotiform and diodontiform the rajiform animals comparable to the common stingray are capable of null speed turns these capabilities allow these animals to navigate in extremely close quarter environments the utility of this directional control is the ability to navigate in close quarter environments the amiiform and gymnotiform have limited information about average speed and top speed however these animals are ambushed hunters that prefer cover the elongated fins of the animals in these classes allow these animals to nimbly move through extremely close quarter environments the shape of the body of the amiiform and gymnotiform also condone this close quarter navigation as they can fit through narrow gaps in the cover that they inhabit the shape of these animals is either an elongated tube shape or they have a more flattened body the bodies of these animals are flexible allowing for the change of yaw pitch and roll the elongated fins of these animals have ribs that are of similar length and are distributed along the whole length of the fin the electric eel was found to be the largest gymnotiform at 20 kg and 2 m in the amiiform category the african aba aba is found with a maximum size of 18 5 kg and 1 67 m these two animals have similar tubular shapes the black knifefish is smaller but very nimble gymnotiform the manta ray is the largest fin undulation animal with individuals averaging around 100 kg while cownose rays weigh about 15 kg the wingspan of manta ray is about 3 5 m compared to the cownose ray of wingspan of 1 2 m there is a large size difference between these two rays however these animals perform migratory swimming using their triangular pectoral fins to glide through the water the pectoral fin rib matrix does not allow form multiple waves at a time although the manta ray uses more of a flapping motion it has a top speed of 9 8 m s and has an average speed slightly over 1 m s the common stingray is capable of impressive burst swimming greater than 10 m s however the common stingray has the circular disc shape that has the free pectoral ribs the free moving ribs allows this animal to have multiple undulation waves at a time the shape of rajiform animals range from circular disc oblong disc and triangular fins the rib composition of the fin determines what wave propagation that the ray will perform these ribs have changing thickness depending on the length of the fin the body of these animals are flexible because their skeletal structure is comprised of cartilage even though cartilage is not as strong as bone these animals bodies are still strong the balistiform selected is the picasso triggerfish this animal expresses a good size and shape assumption for these animals based off observations for the triggerfish the picasso triggerfish has a size of 0 14 kg and 0 17 m the balistiform are short range swimmers when using primarily just their dorsal anal fins once these muscles are exhausted the caudal fin is utilized the caudal fin of the picasso triggerfish has a flexible lunate caudal fin these fish have a slender body and its pectoral fins are used for control surfaces for stability these animals swim close to cover to forage for food in coral reefs the diodontiform animals also stay close to cover and can navigate using their undulating pectoral fins and then perform fast swimming with their oscillating mpf the porcupine fish has a tubular body that tapers to the caudal fin that this fish periodically uses the length of these animals is greater than the triggerfish with a length of 0 5 m the weight of these animals could not be determined but the size can be assumed to be greater than the balistiform 2 5 jet propulsion jet propulsion is the smallest classification presented in this review this locomotion is broken down into three main categories namely bell constriction mantel constriction shell compression and a combination of jet and fin undulation fig 14 shows these four categories with the biological systems that fall in each the bell constriction category focuses on the movement of jellyfish mantel constriction is divided into cephalopods such as octopus shell compression is specifically for mollusks such as scallops lastly the chart presents systems that use a combination including the squid or cuttlefish 2 5 1 bell constriction bell constriction locomotion is defined by the movement of a flexible bell in certain biological systems this propulsion category is applied specifically to jellyfish yeom and oh 2009 however these biological systems that utilize bell constriction for locomotion have their movement strongly influenced by the ocean current because their mass and thrust are not large enough to resist it bell constriction is produced by the contraction and relaxation phases of the subumbrellar muscles in the bell causing movement by ejecting water due to the constriction of the volume of the bell villanueva et al 2011 fig 14 displays a schematic drawing for the anatomy of oblate shape and prolate shape jellyfish respectively some of the main muscles such as the subumbrellar rhopalium tentacles mouth and arms are depicted in fig 14 the rhopalium muscle controls the pace of swimming muscle contraction setting the basic swim frequency katsuki and greenspan 2013 because of the shape of their bells not all jellyfish create thrust in the same manner for this reason jellyfish s propulsion movement is classified into two different swimming patterns which are jet and rowing propulsion species in these categories have structural similarities such as muscles however the subumbrellar muscle is noticed to be of larger area for systems using rowing propulsion oblate shape in contrast to jet propulsion prolate shape as shown in fig 15 a and b respectively the prolate shaped jellyfish are also recognized as bullet shaped jellyfish due to their long bell appearance as presented in fig 15 a dabiri et al 2005 the jellyfish in this category contract their bells with a higher frequency to generate the necessary thrust that they need for swimming mchenry and jed 2003 however prolate shaped jellyfish use more energy than oblate shape jellyfish for locomotion because of the higher frequency of contraction rowing propulsion on the other hand is generated by oblate shaped jellyfish also known as the flat shaped jellyfish which is shown in fig 15 b dabiri et al 2005 oblate shape jellyfish contract their bells slower using a larger volume which causes a larger amount of water to propel from their bells this type of movement is often not entire circumferential constrictions oblate jellyfish impulse their bell margin as a paddle to swim by only constricting a portion of the bell mchenry and jed 2003 however the oblate jellyfish can still perform a full bell deformation to displace water oblate shape jellyfish use less energy for movement because as their frequency is lower than prolate shape jellyfish peng and alben 2012 shown in fig 13 more found biological jellyfish fall into the rowing propulsion category this could be due to the use of currents for long distance travel and the need for high energy propulsion 2 5 2 mantel constriction octopus fall into the mantel constriction propulsion category the system of propulsion by mantel constriction is generated by filling the mantle cavity with water and expelling it out through the siphon however locomotion is also achieved by using their limbs arms to walk on the ocean floor and in coral reefs octopus mantel constriction is generated by using recovery and power strokes also known as sculling fig 16 shows the main parts of the octopus considered in this review the siphon not only expels water but also specifies the directional movement and speed of the octopus mantel constriction in these species is principally for hunting defense and fast swimming sfakiotakis et al 2015 as mentioned octopus use this propulsion technique to escape from predators by burst swimming away a defensive ink is released as a distraction technique during this defensive burst swimming 2 5 3 shell compression shell compression locomotion is used by biological systems from the mollusk classification shell compression is the type of locomotion derived by the opening and closing of the two shell halves water is absorbed into the abductor muscle on scallops and propelled out between the shells producing the clapping action movement fig 17 displays an illustrated description for the anatomy of the atlantic bay scallop body parts including the mantle and abductor muscle as well as the union of the two shells by the shell joint are shown the ribs illustrated on the shell are from shell growth these ribs are not the same support ribs used by the fin oscillation and undulation species scallops use shell compression propulsion primarily to escape from predators region 1995 however this propulsion mechanism is not endurance based since it takes a lot of energy for scallops to use shell compression 2 5 4 mantel constriction and undulating mantel fin biological systems such as cuttlefish and squids use a combination method of mantel constriction and undulating mantel fin these types of propulsion are utilized in various modes of swimming with different proportion of use between undulation fin and jet propulsion this results in slower speed control but these animals possess great agility and speed these animals can swim forward and backward and easily change swimming directions by using both undulating fin and mantel constriction wang et al 2011 some species of squid produce a propulsion strong enough to shoot them out of the water unlike the octopus these cephalopods are equipped with 8 arms and 2 tentacles the two tentacles are not used by octopus the muscular mantle in these systems fills and expels water to generate mantel constriction propulsion the jet propulsion method of cuttlefish and squids comparable to the octopus forces a fast backward swimming direction wang et al 2011 undulating mantel fin locomotion is given by continuous contractions of muscles along the fin length this undulating fin is primarily used when swimming slow in forward or backward direction including control of yaw pitch and roll a schematic for the anatomy of cuttlefish is shown in fig 18 these animals are highly efficient swimmers at slow and fast speeds wang et al 2011 2 6 consolidation of characteristics of biological jet propulsion species some of the aquatic species based on jet propulsion locomotion differ in many ways such as jellyfish from cephalopods even so these species relate by all having little swimming endurance jellyfish swimming endurance is extremely low since their movement mainly depends on the ocean s current instead of self propelling jellyfish turning abilities is highly characterized as minimal octopus cover short distances using jet propulsion which depends on its arms and mantle cavity for movement cuttlefish and squids have higher turning capabilities in contrast to octopuses through use of their undulation fin the bell constriction category presents some jellyfish species such as the aequorea victoria aurelia aurita and nomura s jellyfish from them all the aurelia aurita also known as moon jellyfish is the most common type of jellyfish studied and observed at aquariums these animals weigh approximately 0 175 kg and a length about 0 014 m one of largest known jellyfish weighing about 204 kg is nomura s jellyfish with a diameter length of about 1 8 m there is no information presented about aequorea victoria s weight but present a maximum length of about 0 25 m nomura s jellyfish is capable of swimming at an average speed of 0 43 m s reaching a top speed of 0 529 m s in contrast aequorea victoria propels at an average speed of 0 20 m s as previously stated none of the systems present endurance since their movement mainly depends on ocean current jellyfish are not efficient at maneuverability because of their body shape and structure the nomura s jellyfish has the lowest directional control mantel constriction is represented by the blue ringed octopus octopus vulgaris and enteroctopus dofleini these animals were chosen to create a range of sizes for this category the blue ringed octopus is among the smallest octopi with a length of 0 15 m and weight of 0 028 kg the octopus vulgaris is the most common of its species since it is found in most of the major oceans this animal is also differentiable by its pimple like structures covering its mantle these structures help this animal blend into its surroundings by breaking up its silhouette to look more like coral structure the octopus vulgaris weights 10 kg reaching a maximum size of 1 50 m the enteroctopus dofleini best known as the giant pacific octopus is the largest identified octopus it weighs approximately 50 kg with a size of around 5 m this animal was found to have an average speed of 0 305 m s reaching as high as 11 2 m s during burst swimming turning capabilities for these animals is classified as tight since they can easily change directions with their arms but during jet propulsion these animals have lower directional control swimming endurance for these animals cannot be extreme when using jet propulsion shell compression locomotion is denoted by the atlantic bay scallop which is one of the most common types of scallop the atlantic bay scallop was selected as the sole animal for this class as other scallops have high similarities in size and structure the atlantic bay scallop measures 0 089 m in length with no information about its weight these animals only use shell compression to escape from predators at a speed around 0 8 m s it was denoted that the system s endurance was extremely low because they only swim to a safer place a few meters away from their starting position the turning of the atlantic bay scallop is described to be extremely low lastly the combination of mantel constriction and undulatory fin locomotion is represented by the sepia officinalis cuttlefish watasenia scintillans squid and vampire squid the sepia officinalis is the largest of these biological systems with a length of approximate 0 325 m and mass of about 6 75 kg the vampire squid weights approximately 0 450 kg and consists of a size reaching 0 30 m which is comparable to the sepia officinalis length the watasenia scintillans is among the smallest identified squids with a mass of 0 0089 kg and 0 06 m in size the sepia officinalis is able of reaching a top speed of 0 8 m s compared to the vampire squid s top speed of 0 9 m s both systems consist of short swimming endurances where the sepia officinalis lasts less than a minute most swimming done by these animals is through the use of the undulation fin where jet propulsion is used to burst swim or aid in directional control the fins of these animals vary where shape and length of the fin along the mantel depend on the species the watasenia scintillans squid consists of a triangle shaped undulatory fin covering most of the muscular mantle compared to the vampire squid having two oval fins on the sides of the mantle that are only a portion of the mantel length the sepia officinalis cuttlefish has a fin that starts at the top and runs the length of the mantel the shape of this fin is a crescent that almost parallels the mantel there are many other squids which have varying aspect ratios to those defined but these should be considered the three main shapes 3 auv systems and locomotion classification bioinspired systems follow the same classifications defined for the biological systems investigators try to mimic the mechanical movement using materials they deem fit generally there are two different types of materials used to accomplish movement these materials are either rigid or soft where rigid means the components do not deform or change shape rigid materials have the benefit of using actuation mechanisms commonly found in robotics soft materials can flex and deform during movement soft materials have the benefit using newer and more experimental actuation mechanisms some mechanical systems have skins which are applied over the actuation mechanism to improve hydrodynamics 3 1 auv fin oscillation robots in the fin oscillation classification follow the sub categories defined for the biological systems while there are a lot of robots in this category it is important to define them in chronological order in each category based off their actuation mechanism type the mechanical layout of the systems are described for each robot in table 7 then the characteristics of each robot are reviewed and compared in the consolidation section 3 1 1 auv caudal fin the caudal fin category has robots defined in anguilliform subcarangiform carangiform and thunniform locomotion the large number of robots in this class is due to the assumption that the caudal fin produces the best thrust for fast speed and body types of fishes found in this category condone improved hydrodynamics 3 1 1 1 anguilliform early efforts in this category should be considered in those by ayers et al 2000 creating a lamprey like robot and crespi et al 2004 2005 who created the amphibot the amphibot is a chain module robot where each module is of rigid box design with an actuator connection with its neighbor these actuators only allow for one degree of freedom this allows for the body undulation to only occur in one plane stefanini et al 2012 created the lampetra which is a robot that uses many segments to partake in the locomotion this system has a unique muscle like contraction actuators between each thin section the lampetra has a more flexible body due to the smaller sections and actuators in more recent work by crespi et al 2013 the amphibot was updated into the salamandra robotica ii this system modules or connections were not updated but the system was given a caudal fin appendage and multiple pectoral fins to aid in control and locomotion considering robots with multi degree of freedom there are multiple cases yu et al 2009 created a large robot that had full range of movement with rigid tubular modules with actuation mechanism connections that have two degrees of freedom the connection actuation mechanism is covered in a flexible skin to waterproof the system the modules were equipped with wheels mounted on rigid ribs along the module surface these wheels give this robot the capability to move on land and also give the robot more area for thrust generation in water rollinson et al 2014 created a robot that had all rigid components and actuation mechanism this chain of modules has actuation mechanisms where each coupling has only one degree of freedom however the actuation mechanisms have an alternating pattern so the next one in line has a planar motion at a ninety degree angle relative to the previous connection liljeback et al 2014 managed to compact the actuation mechanisms and connections to make a slimmer design using rigid components where each module has two degrees of freedom this robot is waterproof and is capable of appendage attachments to help with alternative missions 3 1 1 2 subcarangiform carangiform this class has a great variety of auvs to choose from the reason the subcarangiform and carangiform category are combined in the bioinspired description is because there is no great way to discern the robot s variation in body undulation initiation therefore the robots in this class are grouped together based off their actuation mechanism first the three link systems are considered second are four linked systems then the multi linked systems are consolidated and lastly the outliers are described considering the three link actuation robots leads us to one of the most heavily referenced units created by hu et al 2006 this robot has a rigid body unit that houses components the robot was given a semi neutral buoyancy with the addition of foam inserts along the body and caudal peduncle the body and peduncle are covered in a skin composed of rigid scales that overlap each other scales move freely past each other fins and tail are composed of flexible but strong material that allows for passive flexion of the fins yu et al 2004 robot considered the four link caudal peduncle assembly and a rigid body the peduncle assembly was covered with a skin to waterproof the assembly the tail is lunate to mimic those of biological systems but the tail is a rigid piece of composite yu et al 2012 made a larger auv that was primarily composed of metal components the different sections are mostly cubic in shape this system was also meant to transition from water to land by using wheels attached to the body large rectangular pectoral fins are used as control surfaces yu et al 2014 auv had rigid body and a caudal peduncle mechanism that is covered with a skin the pectoral fins were rigid with a square area but these fins are capable of 360 degree rotation this allows for the pectoral fins to be altered to give this auv backward movement koca et al 2016 created a robot that had a small rigid body where the caudal peduncle actuation unit is a majority of the body length this robot has fixed pectoral fins and a large rigid tail the skin over the peduncle was tight were the structure of the actuation mechanism is visible in 2005 multiple robots were created through the work of lui et al liu et al 2005 liu and hu 2005 where focus was put on the complex turning capabilities of the robot they created the mt1 liu et al 2005 which was a predecessor to the c turn robot liu and hu 2005 the actuation mechanism for these are multi linked peduncle units where rigid components were used information on the construction of these robots is limited but the c turn robot had a small head unit and large peduncle section where the peduncle section was covered by a multi sectioned skin ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 created a carp inspired robot where the robot structure was contained within a mimetic body shell electrical components are contained in a rigid acrylic tube while the peduncle is also a multi segmented unit the peduncle unit has a tail servo motor that has two bending joints to cause a flexible tail fin to bend the fins of this robot are flexible elastomers but are still semi rigid clapham et al clapham and hu 2014 created a unique prototype design isplash that showed promise in body undulation mimicry the body to peduncle was constructed using joints along the length allowing for head movement in the swimming this produced better flexion and thrust generated all components for this design are rigid but the actuation mechanism allows for components to slide past each other allowing for compaction of the design the isplash has a semi constant width of body along its length with a slight taper near the nose and tail there are a few examples for the outliers in the carangiform class a wire driven shark was constructed by lau et al 2015 where a multi segmented tail allows for a good peduncle flexion this wire driven peduncle used four wires and two servo motors two wires per servo motor upper and lower pair in the peduncle section the rigid body housed the electrical components and the servomotors due to the use of two servo motors the tail can have an angle of attack relative to the neutral vertical axis which lau et al 2015 described as a sway swimming motion a hydraulic actuated peduncle was created by katzshmann et al 2016 where the peduncle is made of a soft material the hydraulic actuation mechanism that makes the peduncle flex is through filling of different voids in the peduncle body and fins are constructed of rigid materials but the pectoral fins are functioning control surfaces 3 1 1 3 thunniform comparable with the subcarangiform and carangiform class the thunniform robots also use a peduncle actuation unit however to achieve a more concentrated tail actuation different actuation mechanisms are exploited to organize the robots in this category the style of the actuation mechanism is used where single link multi linked and other various robots are described firstly one of the initial robots that was created to analyze the effects of hydrodynamics of a moving body mimicking a tuna was the robotuna created by mit tolkoff 1999 similarly a robot mimicking a mackerel was created by wen et al 2013 although this system is a four linked actuation the testing was similar to the robotuna these two robots were equipped with a flexible streamline skin these robots were fixed to a strut that translates motions into belts housed in the mechanical skeleton which then force a body motion single actuators are the simplest of all the considered designs these designs were constructed using both soft and rigid materials considering the single actuators chen et al 2010 created an ipmc peduncle driven robot where the body and pectoral fins were rigid structures with no complacent movement the main objective of chen et al 2010 was to study the effects of thrust using different tail aspect ratios considering the same ipmc actuation mechanism a miniature robotic fish was created by marras et al marras and porfiri 2012 where the body and peduncle could be considered as two separate units controlled by a single motor and joint and the tail was a flexible caudal fin similarly this robot was used to investigate the impacts of varying the tail aspect ratios and shapes a relatively simple single motor actuated robotic fish was created by yu et al 2016a in their design the motor gives motion to an eccentric wheel that drives a connecting rod giving motion to the peduncle unit which is composed of rigid components the body is of uniform width with a tapered head unit the final design has a protective skin covering body unit this design has no control surfaces but was capable of performing c turns and s turns a multi linked robotic dolphin was created by shen et al 2011 this dolphin robot has a peduncle unit comprised of three links that allow for vertical flexion and a fourth for a smaller horizontal flexion so the tail has three directional movement the pectoral fin control surfaces also had three degree of freedom movement peduncle is encased in a rubber tubing to protect it and make it waterproof the entire body was covered in flexible mimetic body shell in efforts by yu et al yu and wei 2013 a slider crank robotic dolphin was created that gave actuation to two vertical pitch units and one yaw unit this realizes a tail flexion with three degrees of freedom and the pectoral fins are fixed surfaces pitch controlled using ballast sliders in the rigid body peduncle unit is covered in a flexible shell to make it streamline with the body through efforts to increase the endurance a gliding mode was conceived for a robotic design by wu et al 2015 this design incorporated a single joint for movement of the peduncle with another joint for movement of the caudal fin yaw and pitch movements are controlled through use of the pectoral fins and a buoyancy bladder which can be emptied and filled with water body and dorsal fin are rigid the body houses all the equipment including the buoyancy bladder yu et al 2016b created an impressive robot that was capable of fast speed and leaping out of the water yu et al 2016b design is comparable with the one by wu et al 2015 but some alterations make this an intriguing design the robot has a rigid body unit that houses components however the head is separate unit capable of vertical movement by using a neck joint there is a joint connection for the body peduncle and peduncle tail these two separate connections are each given their own dc motor respectively pectoral fins are capable of pitch control skeletal structure of the robot that holds components is rigid while this is encased in a flexible shell it should be stated that this robotic dolphin is capable gaining enough speed to break the water s surface with its whole body length the last thunniform auv that is defined is the large vorticity control unmanned undersea vehicle vcuuv created by anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 at the draper laboratory this design was inspired from the robotuna this robot was capable of extremely fast swimming however this is an extremely heavy hydraulic design the body is a rigid housing for the multiple batteries and other components while the peduncle design has a driven link chain which is encased in a rigid exostructure that folds over itself during flexion this exoskeleton allows for the permeation of water between each section however the body is waterproof to protect components this design has a main ballast to ensure the design does not roll pectoral fins are functioning control surfaces for depth and directional control 3 1 2 auv pectoral fin labriform there are few found robots in this class as it is difficult to create a stable robot that solely uses fin oscillation the robots in this category are organized as follows pure pectoral swimmer pectoral fin flexible fin joint with caudal fin assist and a pectoral fin dual caudal fin hybrid the first robot considered is a wrasse robot created by sitorus et al 2009 this design has a body with dimensions closer to a rigid cubic structure than those of the slender wrasse however this body was used to house the considered components relatively well the pectoral fins are relatively rigid but can perform both the rowing and flapping motions reminiscent of the wrasse in efforts by behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2016 a labriform swimming robot was created that had flexible pectoral fins which could perform both rowing and flapping motions the caudal fin is made from the same material as the pectoral fins and could be activated when more forward thrust is needed the body is rigid zhang et al 2016 created a cross over robot where the robot uses pectoral fins and a dual caudal fin for swimming the pectoral fins have 3 dof while the dual caudal fin have 1 dof where they compress the water when their stroke comes together stability is highly maintained when using the dual caudal fin the body is a rigid encasement for components and the fins are also rigid 3 1 3 auv oscillating dorsal and anal fin tetraodontiform to the authors knowledge no robotic systems have been validated to the point where they can be considered in this review the oscillation of dorsal and anal fin would require a unique understanding of the swimming characteristics of the ocean sunfish this would not be an extremely swift design if it was to be exploited 3 1 4 auv pectoral dorsal anal and caudal fin ostraciiform the robots that fill in this category try to mimic the boxfish or similar fishes there is not much variance in the designs found where these designs consider pectoral and caudal fin in the locomotion it may be recalled that the true boxfish uses its dorsal and anal fin during its swimming modes for stability and added thrust the ostraciiform robots are presented in a chronological order first the boxybot created by lachat et al 2006 is a rigid component based robot where the body was separated into two sections one for pectoral fin and the other for caudal fin the caudal fin section gives actuation to the fin but only in a one degree of freedom the pectoral fins are capable of 360 rotation but primarily performs flapping for thrust kodati et al 2008 created a robot in which they dubbed as microautonomous robotic ostraciiform marco marco s body was a 3d printed replica of a boxfish where the materials used were rigid pectoral fins are capable of 2 dof motion wang and his consultants wang et al 2013 wang and xie 2014 considered the same design the newer design in 2014 was slightly smaller but had the same capabilities the body is a rigid unit which is not mimetic like the marco the pectoral and caudal fin are rigid the caudal fin has a single degree of freedom and the pectoral fins can rotate 360 but also primarily used for flapping mainong et al 2017 used their design to invest different aspect ratios and shapes for the pectoral fins this design is all rigid components caudal fin has 1 dof pectoral fins have 360 rotation and the body is mimetic of the boxfish 3 2 consolidation of fin oscillation auv characteristics the auvs that utilize fin oscillation make up the largest classification much like the biological animals investigated the size shapes and capabilities do vary greatly for the auvs in this class earlier auv fin oscillation sections displayed shape and structure using the actuation mechanism to organize the systems within each category however there are systems in each class which should be recognized more so by their defining size and performance characteristics the anguilliform auvs have a smaller range of sizes in comparison with the carangiform or thunniform categories for the found total mass of these systems liljeback et al 2014 is the lightest design at 0 31 kg while rollinson et al 2014 and yu et al 2009 are 3 657 kg and 6 75 kg respectively yu et al 2009 is by far the heaviest design investigated this is due to its large module design anguilliform auvs generally follow a trend of length sizes of around 1 m with stefanini et al 2012 coming closest to this at 0 99 m yu et al 2009 rollinson et al 2014 and liljeback et al 2014 are all systems between 1 and 1 2 m the fastest forward speed is held by yu et al 2009 at 0 07 m s but liljeback et al 2014 has a high joint speed which would suggest that it possesses moderate speed capabilities crespi et al 2005 has a speed which was half that of yu et al 2009 yu et al 2009 and liljeback et al 2014 are the only two systems which have depth control as they have three directional control with their head unit stefanini et al 2012 has the best endurance at 5 h while crespi et al 2005 has a defined endurance time of 2 h in the subcarangiform and carangiform category there is a great variety of systems to choose from as for the size the lightest design is yu et al 2004 at 0 5 kg and the largest is ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 at 12 kg yu et al 2014 at 5 2 kg and yu et al 2012 at 5 kg round out the mid range weights with all other systems being below these values in a range 1 65 3 67 kg the system with the smallest length is clapham et al clapham and hu 2014 at 0 251 m and the largest being ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 at 0 9 m the rest of these systems range from lengths of 0 4 0 8 m clapham et al clapham and hu 2014 has the fastest speed of 0 85 m s and yu et al 2014 is the second fastest in this category at 0 7 m s all other systems speeds are higher than 0 1 m s but are below these maximum values due to the use of control surfaces these systems have good directional and depth control endurance ranges from katzshmann et al 2016 at 35 min to lui et al liu et al 2005 at 4 5 h the thunniform category has the largest auvs considered where anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 is the heaviest out of all auv categories at 173 1 kg the second largest being shen et al 2011 at 23 5 kg with wu et al 2015 following closer behind at 18 2 kg the lengths of these auvs fall in the same order where anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 has the longest length of 2 4 m the smallest thunniform auv is marras et al marras and porfiri 2012 at 0 07 kg and 0 117 m all other systems fall between the ranges defined by these systems the fastest auv is smaller at 4 7 kg and 0 72 m but yu et al 2016b design is capable of 2 1 m s swimming which allows it to leap out of the water even though anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 design is large it can swim at 1 2 m s the turning capabilities of these systems are still decent however compared to the subcrangiform and carangiform auvs these systems have lower body flexibility and hence lower turning capabilities depth control was also not found for most of these systems but the best performing systems often do have good depth control found endurance for these systems also ranges from 1 to 3 5 h the size of these systems allows for large battery packs equipped to power larger motors the labriform auvs have a range of mass of 0 33 2 5 m with the two found lengths having less than 0 1 m of variance the speed of behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2016 and zhang et al 2016 are the same at 0 53 m s regardless of their designs being completely different the turning and depth control are the best for zhang et al 2016 the variance of characteristics in the osctraciiform auv category is small so just an overview of the systems is stated while tables 8 and 9 can be referenced for specific numbers these auvs have few descriptions for mass but the smallest design is kodati et al 2008 and the largest one is wang et al wang and xie 2014 in respect to length the smallest is also kodati et al 2008 and the largest is wang et al 2013 kodati et al 2008 is the slowest ostraciiform auv investigated while wang et al 2013 is the fastest generally these auvs have moderate turning capabilities however wang et al wang and xie 2014 was described to have depth control which makes it the only one in this category to have this capability while this same auv has the only defined endurance of around 1 5 h 3 3 auv fin undulation for the fin undulation class it is more common to have soft materials which are more flexible due to the flexion which are required for thrust the categories for auvs follow those defined previously in the review and their description and pictures are given in table 10 3 3 1 auv undulatory pectoral fin rajiform the pectoral fin class is the second largest category to the caudal fin fishes lots of different shapes actuation mechanisms and materials have been utilized in this class for most of the robots considered efforts were made to mimic the same rib membrane excitation found in biological systems the order of the mentioned systems are leading edge rib passive fin and multi ribbed active excitation with the leading edge rib an upstroke and downstroke are performed by means of an actuation unit the stroke of the rib causes a translational wave along the membrane surface thereby causing thrust the multi ribbed actuation causes active excitation along the fin length through all the ribs engrained in the fin each rib supersedes the motion of the rib before causing the translational wave across the fin the first robot to be considered is a robotic manta ray gao et al 2007 created a design where a leading edge fin rib caused passive undulation to a membrane supported by a second rib running parallel to the body the body is a rigid unit with fixed control surfaces as horizontal and vertical tails this robot was then upgraded into the robo ray iii created by niu et al 2012 where the fixed control surfaces were replaced with functioning ones that increased stability and depth control a smaller leading edge design was developed by wang et al 2009 except the leading edge used shape memory alloy sma wires that overlaid an elastic substrate on two sides and are integrated into a polymer matrix having two sma wires gives the capability for the fin to have upstroke and downstroke by alternative heating of the sma wires through electrical resistance of the wire this design floated on the surface of the water with a buoyant rigid body turns can be achieved by selecting which fin to excite an encased rigid skeleton design is a pneumatic fin flexion ray created by cai et al 2009 this design was control tethered in order to supply power to actuators that pull on the cables that cause the rigid skeleton to morph for an upstroke the skeleton was encased in a mimetic body resembling the manta ray a soft material leading edge design is an ipmc actuated robot created by chen et al 2012 the ipmc comprised most of the first half of the elastomer membrane fin the body is a rigid box for components a similar design to the leading edge is a soft body robot created by alvarado et al 2013 this design has a body composed of soft materials which is greater than 70 of all materials used each side of the disc body fin has a single actuator at an angle where this actuator gives the fin vertical excitation for a passive translational wave there are solid body components encased within the soft body which act as buoyancy tanks to help control depth the last leading edge design is a bionic fin manta ray created by chew et al 2015 this design gives flapping actuation to a rigid leading edge in the pectoral fin however each fin is given an angle of attack during upstroke and downstroke the trailing edge for the fin receives passive undulation waves from this motion the body is a rigid encasement for components but has a semi tapered design the actively excited multi ribbed rajiform category has a few functioning robots often the benefit of this type of actuation is that the robot can perform a null speed turn where the robot can rotate in a stationary position the first robot to be considered using this actuation is the cownose ray i by yang et al 2009 in this design an actuation skeleton excites multiple ribs in a flexible membrane this skeleton is not encased in a body roman ii described by zhou et al zhou and low 2012 was a larger version of roman iii which is described by low et al 2011 in these two designs a rigid body has actuation units aligned on the sides to allow for the attachment and excitation of the pectoral fins the body is tapered and the only control surfaces are the pectoral fins two surface float systems found both use ipmc multi ribbed actuators for swimming punning et al 2004 and takagi et al 2006 designs are small and relatively similar so they are grouped together the ipmc ribs are each individually excited to create the undulation wave the raybot created by krishnamurthy et al 2010 is a rajiform robot that uses a caudal fin for propulsion which is what the electric ray commonly uses for thrust however even though this robot is equipped with enlarged pectoral fins made of soft material the pectoral fins do not perform undulations this robot is classified in this category due to the biological systems including electric rays in the rajiform category the smallest robot considered is a soft robotic ray combined with tissue engineering which was created by park et al 2016 this design is unique because a metallic skeleton transports electrical excitation to multiple ribs which then locally excite a layer of muscle tissue to flex the ribs have a descending size from front to back to cause larger undulations at the forefront of the pectoral fin through larger electrical impulse delivered the skeleton is electrically excited through laser flashes to two leading prongs on the skeleton depending on which prong receives a more direct impulse determines which half of the body is supplied a larger excitation causing a turning behavior if the prongs receive the same amount of impulse then a straight forward thrust is generated 3 3 2 auv undulating dorsal fin amiiform there are only two amiiform robots which were found to be classified in this category these two designs were created by hu et al 2009 and xie et al 2016 however these two designs considered active multi ribbed actuation the robogrilos described in hu et al 2009 has a very slender rigid body that contains the necessary actuation mechanisms to carry the translational undulation wave information on the robogrilos is limited but the fin size can be noted as large in aspect ratio in comparison with the body size in xie et al 2016 an extremely similar dorsal undulation fin was implemented into a rigid shell encasement akin to the torpedo a rigid criss cross tail maintains stability and gives this robot directional control 3 3 3 auv undulating anal fin gymnotiform similarly the gymnotiform class has few robot systems to be described siahmansouri et al 2011 design incorporated a ballast floatation tank with pitch and yaw actuation joints which connect to the multi ribbed propulsion fin this multi ribbed designs are similar to those found in the amiiform bioinspired category all components besides the fin membrane can be considered rigid for this design curet et al 2011 created a robotic knifefish that has an actuation mechanism encased in a rigid tubular shell where fin rib length is relatively short in comparison with those described in other systems however ribs have a small radius and the number of ribs that are powered in the actuation is greater than twenty which is the most out of any considered undulatory fin designs liu et al 2012 created a robot that used a passive fin design where a rib on the nose and tail of the robot gives excitation to the flexible fin membrane stretched between them this robot has a similar tubular body to the curet et al 2011 robotic knifefish this design is also equipped with a propulsive caudal fin to aid with forward thrust similar to the other robots in this category all components besides the undulatory fin can be considered rigid 3 3 4 auv undulatory pectoral fin and oscillating dorsal anal fin diodontiform this class is similar to the tetraodontiform where there are no found robotic systems that utilize undulatory pectoral fins and oscillating dorsal and anal fin likewise there are no found systems that use solely the undulatory pectoral fins like those found in bluegill this category along with the tetraodontiform are voids where new systems could be conceived 3 4 consolidation of fin undulation auv characteristics the auvs that utilize an undulation fin are diverse but these systems are fewer in number compared to the fin oscillation class generally the size of the rajiform auvs is comparable with the subcarangiform and carangiform auv category as masses and lengths do not exceed 10 kg and 1 m respectively the auv with the largest mass in the rajiform category is krishnamurthy et al 2010 at 5 5 kg the smallest being park et al 2016 even though the mass is unknown the relative size of this system is a fraction of the chen et al 2012 design which has the smallest found mass of 0 055 kg therefore it can be assumed that park et al 2016 is the lightest design the longest length is zhou et al zhou and low 2012 at 1 m while park et al 2016 is again the smallest design however this design had a small tail so its length is slightly greater than 0 01 m the majority of these systems are in a length range of 0 1 m 0 56 m more concern is placed on wingspan of these systems as pectoral fins are the main thrust generators by comparing the few defined systems a range of ratios of length to wingspan can be established as 0 48 0 87 the rajiform auv with the highest speed is gao et al 2007 at 0 7 m s the next best performing system is chew et al 2015 at 0 45 m s after these two systems there is a gradual decrease of performance with most systems not being able to swim faster than 0 3 m s the systems with the best turning capabilities are niu et al 2012 wang et al 2009 yang et al 2009 zhou et al zhou and low 2012 and low et al 2011 most of these systems do not have a defined turning capability depth control and none have a defined endurance in the amiiform and gymnotiform auv category there is limited information on size and length characteristics the largest is liu et al 2012 anal fin auv at 11 kg and 1 2 m however the two amiiform systems look to be of large size in table 10 pictures the undulation fin runs the length of these auvs which is good characteristic the speed of these auvs is decent as the range of speed is 0 18 0 424 m s considering both categories the capabilities of turning depth control and endurance are not found for these systems in tables 11 and 12 all characteristics of auv with undulation fin including mass length and speed are shown 3 5 auv jet propulsion the smallest classification for bioinspired aquatic robots use jet propulsion mechanisms for movement for this classification it is important to divide the systems by chronological order since they follow some similarities between them bioinspired robots are designed using the same materials to mimic movement of biological systems in table 13 auvs that utilize jet propulsion description and picture for reference are presented 3 5 1 bell constriction robotic systems falling in this category were inspired by common jellyfish such as aurelia aurita and aequorea victoria because they use similar aspects in their designs robotic jellyfish are presented in chronological order robojelly designed by villanueva et al 2011 was inspired by aurelia aurita in regards to its morphology and kinematics sma and bismac actuators were utilized to achieve a similar bell deformation to its biological system which would allow the motion of the robot the body is made from soft silicone poured into a mold to mimic the morphology of aurelia aurita the second bioinspired aquatic robot presented was designed and fabricated by najem et al 2012 the jellyfish robot mimics shape and swimming style of the aequorea victoria known for its high swimming efficiency najem et al 2012 chose this species because of its similar properties to ipmc actuators in regards to bell deformation the bell was fabricated using heat shrinkable polymer to mimic weight and shape of biological system the last system introduced is auv robotic jellyfish designed and produced by dooley et al 2016 although this robot does not meet the criteria for bioinspiration its physical aspects were influenced by jellyfish this system uses a pulley system to actuate its tentacles which results in an ineffective actuation under water the bell of the auv robot was made from transparent acrylic the system does not propel using bell constriction however since it was inspired by jellyfish it can be compared to the last bioinspired robotic jellyfish 3 5 2 mantel constriction octopuses locomotion and manipulation characteristics have been an inspiration to the development of auvs with the same capabilites poseidrone and another bioinspired robotic octopus are covered in relation to their skin and motion mimicry to biological species designed and manufactured by arienti et al 2013 poseidrone is a soft bioinspired robot consisting of manipulation and locomotion capabilities including crawling and swimming abilities poseidrone is recognized as the first soft bodied rov the system s skin is composed of rubber like materials the second bioinspired robot was done by sfakiotakis et al 2015 researchers focused on propulsion capabilities of the system where they achieved forward and backward propulsion and turning as well as ability to grasp objects the arms are mode from polyurethane material inspired by the octopus vulgaris the robotic octopus depends entirely on arms for swimming its manipulation capabilities could bring attention to several underwater applications such as monitoring inspections and rescue operations 3 5 3 mantel constriction and undulation fin robotic systems inspired by cuttlefish and squid fall into the mantel constriction and undulation fin locomotion classification auvs in this section are classified in chronological order providing a short description of each robot the cuttlefish dual undulation fin robot was designed and fabricated by low and willy 2005 although this system mimics cuttlefish movement it was unable to mimic the complex musculature of its fins the system does not meet the requirements for bioinspiration in regards to physical perspective the second robotic system also designed by low and willy 2005 depends on its fins for locomotion which mimics the majority for movement of cuttlefish the two undulating fins have their own actuation chain to create the motion to conclude the robotic fish does not meet the criteria for bioinspiration due to its lack of appearance to biological systems the best bioinspired system was designed by wang et al 2011 this system imitates the cuttlefish actuation this design is actuated by sma wires for the mantel constriction and membrane undulation the fin undulation propulsion is used during low speed swimming and mantel constriction for high speed swimming the last underwater robot designed and fabricated by gilva et al 2015 was inspired by the locomotion of cuttlefish and rays the system propels by lateral undulatory fins on the sides of the body because of its size it is believed that the robot may function as an educational platform for underwater robots 3 5 4 consolidation of jet propulsion auv characteristics the auvs based on jet propulsion locomotion form the smallest classification of robots in the same way as their biological inspirations the systems presented for each category differ from one another regarding length mass and speed however they display similar characteristics for turning capabilities depth control and endurance the auvs from tables 14 and 15 are organized in chronological order to give a perspective of the changes made from earliest robots presented due to the lack of locomotion there are no auvs that use the shell constriction propulsion bell constriction locomotion is denoted by the auvs created by villanueva et al 2011 najem et al 2012 and dooley et al 2016 the auv by villanueva et al 2011 has a mass of 0 242 kg and a diameter of 0 164 m najem et al 2012 has a mass of 0 02 kg and diameter of 15 m the last jellyfish robot by dooley et al 2016 has a length of 0 2 m from the systems presented villanueva et al 2011 and najem et al 2012 show a close resemblance to biological systems such as aequorea victoria and aurelia aurita speed for the villanueva et al 2011 is 0 19 m s while najem et al 2012 is slower with a speed of 0 0015 m s turning description was defined as low for villanueva et al 2011 and najem et al 2012 while the dooley et al 2016 did not give any explanation for this category however the auv robotic jellyfish was the only system to describe depth control being in the medium range and endurance description of less than 20 min from the systems presented villanueva et al 2011 and najem et al 2012 showed a close resemblance to the biological jellyfish classified in table 5 however the dooley et al 2016 failed at imitating the biological systems by exceeding dimensions the second classification for locomotion is the mantel constriction as show in tables 14 and 15 arienti et al 2013 and sfakiotakis et al 2015 are classified into this category for their locomotion description and inspiration on octopus arienti et al 2013 is the first octopus auv presented in the tables above consists of a mass of 0 75 kg and length of 0 2 m none of the auvs presented have similar mass to biological species however the design by sfakiotakis et al 2015 has the closest approach to the blue ringed octopus regarding its length of 0 15 m speed for these auvs varies greatly arienti et al 2013 has speed of 0 62 m s and sfakiotakis et al 2015 of 0 0986 m s lastly the sfakiotakis et al 2015 is the only auv in this category that has described turning capabilities none of the systems present information about depth control and endurance lastly the jet and undulation fin propulsion locomotion is denoted by auvs like the cuttlefish dual undulation fin robot by low and willy 2005 multi ribbed dual undulation fin by low and willy 2005 cuttlefish robot by wang et al 2011 and dual undulation fin robot by gilva et al 2015 none of the auvs named give information regarding mass except for multi ribbed dual undulation fin with a 9 kg mass both cuttlefish dual undulation fin robot and multi ribbed dual undulation fin consist of a length of 0 81 m the dual undulation fin robot has length of 0 24 m from all the systems the cuttlefish robot is the only auv to show speed being of 0 6 m s lastly for turning description category the dual undulation fin robot is classified as low the best auv to imitate a biological aquatic system from table 5 is the multi ribbed dual undulation fin for its similar size and weight to the biological cuttlefish however the cuttlefish robot by wang et al 2011 is the most similar to the biological cuttlefish because this auv has an active undulating fin and jet propulsion this actuation mechanism closely imitates the speed of the sepia officinalis cuttlefish being of 0 8 m s the dual undulation fin robot is not a good system according to the requirements for bioinspiration for missing information about mass speed depth and endurance 4 constraints limitations and future recommendations through the organization of these systems auvs can be expressed in their respective biological locomotion category often auvs derive their size shape speed materials and endurance from nature these derivations are expressed as five criteria where auvs are compared to the biological systems in their respective categories by expressing the best auvs for each criterion a better understanding can be gained on individual levels of bioinspiration and biomimicry by falling into at least one of the criteria described the auv is deemed bioinspired if a system is expressed in all criteria then it is biomimicry assumptions will be made so more systems can be categorized as biomimicry because it is extremely difficult for an auv to fulfill all criteria suggestions will be expressed that will help auvs works toward biomimicry 4 1 size comparison auvs can be found within the size ranges that are obtained from biological tables 1 3 and 5 mass and length ranges extracted from these biological tables give parameters that distinguishes a reduced group size of auvs these auvs that fall within these ranges are defined in tables 16 21 in the caudal fin category there is a good variety of robots that fall in the ranges for mass and length anguilliform ranges for mass 0 075 30 kg and length 0 63 3 m reduces the number of auvs to four out of seven as shown in table 16 in the subcarangiform and carangiform category has a range of mass is 3 25 650 kg and length is 0 65 4 55 m these large ranges allow for a greater variance in auv size these categories are combined because it is hard to differentiate initiation of the body undulation for the auvs however efforts should be made to differentiate auvs between these two categories in the future so they follow biological standards the largest auv is the carp robot by ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 the rest of the auvs not shown in table 17 fall below the mass and length ranges a large amount of the mass and length range is still available for the subcarangiform and carangiform auvs to exploit so larger auvs can still be created from biological thunniform animals the mass range 2 450 kg and length range 0 5 3 m are extracted these ranges are wide and auvs of bigger sizes can fit within this category as shown in table 18 the auv in created by anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 is the largest auv found the next two largest auvs created by shen et al 2011 and wu et al 2015 are more than 100 kg and 1 m smaller than anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 while lengths in this category are the largest described there is still a large amount of the size range that can be exploited in this category these longer lengths accommodate larger actuation mechanisms and components for greater thrust capabilities often structures are made of rigid components that cause an increase in the mass but the range defined allows for these larger systems the thunniform category can accommodate these larger sizes and this allows for even more powerful systems to be developed the labriform class does not have any auvs that fall into the ranges for mass 0 058 0 22 kg and length 0 158 0 271 m all the found labriform systems exceed the biological size range there is only one ostraciiform auv that has a size that can be compared to the boxfish while the other ostraciiform auvs exceed this size as shown in table 19 the marco by kodati et al 2008 has the smallest length of all of those defined but is still longer than the typical boxfish these systems have difficulty to imitating the boxfish because of their small size the rajiform class has a biological mass range 15 100 kg and length range 1 2 3 5 m the length range is defined for the wingspan because this is considered a more important dimension for this category the length range is selected in this manner as the pectoral fins are the main propulsion however when the range is defined in this manner none of the auvs fall within this range it has been deemed by these researchers that the size of their auvs can fall more in the mass range 0 055 7 3 kg and length range 0 01 0 6 m the auv range is vastly lower than the rajiform animals sizes do range due to growth of the animal but these auvs are being constructed in a manner that condones lower cost and ease of control the smaller size of these crafts could also be due to the small pools and water channels where these systems are tested however once designs are validated there is no reason as to why larger versions could not be constructed the amiiform and gymnotiform categories are grouped together in table 20 as these systems are similar except for the fin location amiiforms have a mass range 1 18 5 kg and length range 0 5 1 67 m gymnotiforms have a mass range 2 10 kg and length range 0 5 2 m there is only one robot in each category that falls within the biological range established these systems therefore do not follow the biological criteria for size the auvs that are classified in the jet propulsion category have the difficult task of replicating animals that have bodies void of rigid structures using rigid materials in this category can make a system too large bell constriction classification has a mass range 0 175 205 kg and a diameter range 0 014 1 80 m villanueva et al 2011 is the only system that agrees with the mass and length ranges in the jet propulsion category whereas the other two auvs only fall into the length range of the biological system as shown in table 21 auvs corresponding to mantel constriction locomotion are based on mass range of 0 028 50 kg and length range of 0 15 5 m arienti et al 2013 and sfakiotakis et al 2015 fall within the mass range obtained from the octopus lastly jet and undulation fin locomotion species have a range for mass of 0 0089 6 75 kg and length of 0 06 0 325 m these ranges limit the number of auvs down to three unfortunately the size of the system created by wang et al 2011 could not be determined however this system should be noted as it is constructed with proportionally more soft materials and has opportunity to fulfill the size requirements 4 2 shape comparison the shape of the auvs derive from the animals found in that category the more similar the shape is to an animal the higher the level of bioinspiration the shape helps to recreate the swimming capabilities of the animal there are notable auvs in each category which should be distinguished as their shape is the most similar in the anguilliform category a long slender body is consid115ed for all designs therefore in this category all auvs fit this criterion as shown in table 9 the subcarangiform carangiform thunniform and labriform categories can be distinguished by a long body length where the mid body or behind the head has the greatest girth the peduncle is tapered till it meets the tail where the tail has a lunate shape these shapes are determined by the pictures in tables 2 4 and 6 those presented in table 22 are determined to be the best biological representation for each category in the subcarangiform carangiform categories auv by hu et al liljeback et al 2014 ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 and katzshmann et al 2016 have the better shapes out of the ones displayed in table 22 these designs have a body shape that has varying girth along their length and height hu et al 2006 and ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 shapes are good because a body shell covers their mechanical structure ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 has an entire body encasement that does not show any evidence of its structure thunniform category has auvs like those created by tolkoff et al tolkoff 1999 anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 chen et al 2010 shen et al 2011 wen et al 2013 yu et al yu and wei 2013 wu et al 2015 and yu et al 2016a which all have extremely good shapes the robot dolphins all tend to have a shell applied to the mechanical structure which makes the final shape like that found in nature in the labriform category behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2016 has the best shape considered for the labriform auvs as presented in table 23 the ostraciiform auvs have shapes similar to the boxfish as presented in table 24 the auvs also shown in table 24 have designs where the shape was created in a cad software mainong et al 2017 3d printed the rigid body of their boxfish robot distinguishing the auvs that have shapes similar to the boxfish limits this category down to two the rajiform auvs do tend to have a similar shape that consider the outline shape of the animals in table 25 which are common shapes from fig 11 however the thickness of the body should follow the dimensions of the rajiform as well which tmeans that the body should be flattened there are a couple of soft material auvs that have shapes with a high level of biomimicry as shown in table 26 cai et al 2009 krishnamurthy et al 2010 alvarado et al 2013 and park et al 2016 have shapes created out of soft materials which promotes a likeness to those found in nature on the other hand gao et al 2007 niu et al 2012 and chew et al 2015 designs utilized a mixture of rigid and soft materials to create their shapes these shapes have a likeness to the biological but not to such a high degree as those constructed with primarily soft materials there are no similar shapes found in the amiiform and gymnotiform categories there were multiple auvs said to be derived from animals that have long slender bodies with gradual taper but these auvs did not mimic this shape curet et al 2011 and liu et al 2012 considered more of the shape of an electric eel which has a long tubular body however these designs will not be considered because they also do not consider the taper of the body representative examples of shape for the jet propulsion categories are shown in table 27 the auvs in this category that have good shapes are made of soft materials and are presentedin table 28 the soft material allows for the curve shapes that are commonly found in this category as mentioned the robojelly by villanueva et al 2011 uses bioinspired shape memory alloy composite actuators and fabricated from rtv silicone to imitate the skin of the aurelia aurita jellyfish villanueva et al 2011 the jellyfish robot by najem et al 2012 uses ipmc which are actuators matching the morphology and kinematic characteristics to the aequorea victoria jellyfish the bells of these two designs are flexible and shapes are very similar to the jellyfish the design of the cuttlefish robot by wang et al 2011 consists of sma wires actuating the pectoral fin and mantle which as mentioned presents the best practical and comprehensive performance lastly poseidrone is a soft robotic system primarily composed of soft materials to imitate the skin of biological octopuses 4 3 materials material selection has a large impact on a systems level of bioinspiration and biomimicry biological systems exhibit a diverse range of body types that bioinspired auvs should replicate the body structure of animals can give blueprints needed for the replication of swimming characteristics one material suggestion is that soft materials are emphasized for fins as these surfaces are flexible for animals these fins have varying rigidity depending on the fin type number of ribs thickness of ribs rib length and fin size there are several examples of auvs which utilize flexible fins in the anguilliform category the lampetra developed by stephani et al stefanini et al 2012 uses a flexible caudal fin along with a large number of body sections that gives this robot better body and fin flexibility in the subcarangiform and carangiform category the designs by hu et al 2006 liu et al liu and hu 2010 ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 and katzshmann et al 2016 utilize flexible fins hu et al 2006 is the only one that uses ribs in their flexible fins none of the studied thunniform designs were found to actively use flexible fins however when considering a biological thunniform the assumption of rigid fins is more acceptable as fin structure is often more rigid in this category however these fins should still have some complacent movement or slight flexibility the labriform category has one robot that utilizes a flexible fin joint with a semi rigid fin which was created by behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2016 this labriform design is considered in this group because the flexible joint allows the fin surface to have some passive movement during actuation the undulatory fin robots use a flexible fin membrane however there are some differences between the types of soft material used alvarado et al 2013 cai et al 2009 and chew et al 2015 used a thicker membrane fin while the rest of the systems use a thin membrane this thin membrane observed to be applied to amiiform and gymnotiform systems see table 27 the robotic systems that use soft materials as majority of their body exhibit a large body resemblance to the biological animal for example all the jet propulsion auvs in table 28 utilize soft materials and actuators villanueva et al 2011 and najem et al 2012 created systems that closely resemble jellyfish while wang et al 2011 and arienti et al 2013 manipulated a soft mantel to eject water out of a nozzle and have a likeness to their biological counterpart these auvs and others use soft material actuators to create thrust however soft actuators often have a trade off where actuators do not produce sufficient thrust the robotic systems that use soft actuators should be considered as special cases as these actuators often yield a natural motion impc and sma actuators flex like real muscle but when using these materials as a single actuator where a single wire or beam is difficult to generate thrust there are several auvs that use soft materials in their actuation and it can be noted that these systems exhibit a lower speed less than 1 m s this low speed is due to the actuators being small relative to the auv size however these actuators create a large force relative to their size a single beam or wire cannot produce the thrust required for moving a large robot at high speed the material properties for various soft material actuators are given in table 29 the sma wire is in the conducting polymer category it should be noted that the ipmc and conducting polymer are the only two materials which have a low electrical excitation however the specific power of the conducting polymer is much higher the actuation types of these materials are tensile or bending the construction of these flexible actuators need to be considered to optimize these material characteristics this means that there is still a possibility of improvement in the soft actuators as you could stack these materials to create a larger force however due to the electrical excitation needed components should be insulted from each other to avoid a short circuit or any other mechanical disturbance if ipmc and sma are insulated from each other a packaging of synthetic muscle can be created which increases potential area and thus creates larger force there are also systems that use rigid material actuators which are encased within a soft material shell this makes the body comparable to biological systems as the shape replicates the animal hydrodynamics this encasement over the mechanical structure can yield a similar motion to the biological cases where animals have a rigid skeletal structure with muscle attached to create the motion systems that use this construction method were referenced in the shape section including ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 shen et al 2011 yu et al yu and wei 2013 alvarado et al chen et al 2012 and yu et al 2016a all these works utilized rigid actuators bound in a soft materials encasement the rigid components give these systems better thrust and the soft body gives them better efficiency fixed system tests have been performed where mechanical systems are given actuation in a water channel these robots are given actuation through either a tether cable or the support strut the body of these systems exhibit good flexion though the internal components which are rigid like a skeleton this rigid skeleton is encased in a soft body skin or shell that makes the body more streamline these systems are the mit robotuna designed by tolkolf et al tolkoff 1999 and mackerel robot designed by wen et al 2013 both systems utilized a rigid tail at the end of the active caudal peduncle a rajiform auv used in a similar test was the flexible pectoral foil cownose ray developed by cai et al 2009 this test was performed on this system as proof of concept prior to letting this auv swim in a pool without the rigid support for the water channel test this rajiform auv also had an internal skeleton which is actuated by a pneumatic rope muscles while robotuna and mackerel robot are actuated through a pully and belt system the robotuna and mackerel robot can complete a full range of motion of their caudal fin however the rajiform auv has a limited motion range in comparison with biological systems 4 4 speed rigid material systems have a large amount of systems capable of fast speeds one of the most impressive systems is the robotic dolphin created by yu et al 2016a which is capable of leaping another swift design is the vcuuv by anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 these systems utilize different actuation mechanisms but they exhibit good body flexion and powerful thrust these two designs try to mimic their respective biological animal with rigid components to the best of their abilities yu et al kopman and porfiri 2013 robotic dolphin includes a head motion in their design to increase thrust through a more realistic body undulation of the dolphin in the subcarangiform and carangiform category the isplash created by clapham et al clapham and hu 2014 has a complete body flexion using rigid components through the incorporation of joints along the length of the body the isplash has a side to side head movement which gives this design the highest speed which can be noted in table 7 there are other carangiform designs that compete with the multi jointed isplash namely the three link g9 fish designed by hu et al 2006 and four link yu et al 2014 design these two designs incorporate a rigid head unit that encases sensitive components and both use a link system to make their peduncle flexible the g9 uses scales to try and make head peduncle tail more streamline the scales are much larger than those found in nature and can result in increased drag on the other hand yu et al 2014 used a smooth encasement to cover the peduncle all the rest of the rigid component carangiform robots exhibit similar speed and actuation type while some use a peduncle encasement like yu et al 2014 a few do not and the system performs swimming routines with the links exposed for the thunniform category the previously stated vcuuv and dolphin capable of leaping are the fastest but there are still reputable designs left in this category a simple design that is capable of fast speed is the single motor actuated robotic fish by yu et al 2016a this design has continuous growth of speed depending on power input as power increases so does tail frequency yu et al 2016a did not fully max out the designs capable speed the last notable design that was capable of decent speed was the slider crank robotic dolphin by yu et al yu and wei 2013 this design also had a rigid head and body attached to the large slider crank link actuators these rigid actuators provide powerful thrust to this design the labriform and ostraciiform auvs display similar speed capabilities however these speeds are not as extreme as the thunniforms and they are not very reputable these systems are capable of slower speeds which is similar to their biological categories the labriform category has the swifter designs of these two categories the rigid component pectoral and dual caudal fin robot by zhang et al 2016 matched speed with the flexible fin joint design of behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2016 the ostraciiforms have three designs with all similar speed as the boxybot by lachat et al 2006 wang et al 2013 and wang et al wang and xie 2014 where wang et al 2013 is a continuation of the wang et al 2013 design the undulatory fin auvs do not display extreme speed but there are some still worth discussing these designs should be stated as reference for the greatest speed in their respective classification for the rajiform category gao et al 2007 chew et al 2015 and zhou et al zhou and low 2012 have a descending value of swimming speed where gao et al 2007 is the swiftest the two amiiform robots designed by hu et al 2009 and xie et al 2016 have relatively similar speeds and are faster than the gymnotiform auvs which do not have speed greater than 0 3 m s the jet propulsion auvs are also not notable for fast speeds however some systems do display similar speeds to their respective biological categories although none of the systems using bell constriction present similar speeds to biological jellyfish it should be mentioned that robojelly designed by villanueva et al 2011 is the fastest system due to the shape testing for the bell with the optimal thrust systems in the mantel constriction category present some similar speed capabilities to their biological inspirations poseidrone by arienti et al 2013 is between the average and maximum speed for the enteroctopus dofleini the robotic octopus by sfakiotakis et al 2015 has speeds at a lower range due to its method of propulsion by using its arms to compress water away from the body the majority of the jet and undulation fin auvs in tables 14 and 15 did not present information about speed except the cuttlefish robot designed by low and willy 2005 the systems show similar speed ranges as the biological sepia officinalis cuttlefish the most intriguing aspect of low and willy 2005 is that the design incorporates a function undulation fin along with the mantel constriction to have control at low speeds 4 5 endurance when evaluating the endurance of the auvs it is hard to compare the similarities to biological systems as biological animals that live in reefs or some amount of structure do not have extreme endurance and migratory animals have extreme endurance what should be noted from the biological animals is that certain locomotion condones endurance burst high speed swimming and close quarter maneuvering the best bioinspired category that follows these three biological standards are auvs found in the caudal fin however the caudal fin category has more difficulty swimming in close quarter environments rajiforms are the next largest category which has some very functioning designs which exhibit good swimming ability with moderate speed the value of this category is that some actively excited multi ribbed rajiforms can perform null speed rotational turns the value in this is that the auv can move in extremely close quarter environments there have been a few robots classified in the jet and undulation fin category which exhibit either just jet or undulation fin there was no found actual combination auv similar to the cuttlefish the value of having a combination of cuttlefish auv is the null speed turning like the rajiforms and fast speed because of the jet propulsion while the labriforms ostraciiform amiiform and gymnotiform auv categories have functioning robots capable of lower speeds or have possibilities in close quarter maneuvering however much is to be desired in swimming performance for these categories 4 6 bioinspired biomimetic auvs and future recommendations the auvs which are considered bioinspired fall into at least one of the categories mentioned the most important categories being shape and materials to be biomimetic the auv should either 1 be in all categories or 2 have an extremely high degree of mimicry materials utilized to replicate biological animals for 1 it is very difficult for an auv to fall within all categories namely size shape material and speed endurance is considered as a low priority for this review as it is difficult to match biological systems where some animals can swim for extremely long periods of time however these endurance characteristics are given as a reference point that the auvs should be working toward for 2 materials are recommended to be flexible with structures comparable with those defined for the biological there can be a component structure comparable to a skeleton that transfers mechanical motion but there should be an exterior shell to have a mimetic shape and flexibility this rigid skeleton should have good flexion that allows for this shell to have smooth movement there are a few systems in fin oscillation that use flexible fins but majority of the body is often made of rigid components there are a few fin oscillation auvs that have a body shell over the skeleton ichikizaki et al ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 shen et al 2011 wu et al yu and wei 2013 and yu et al 2016b systems should be considered mimetic in the fin oscillation class the anguilliform auvs have system which utilizes a muscle like actuation lampetra by stephani et al stefanini et al 2012 should be considered mimetic although this system has visible section this can be easily fixed by a body sleeve to make this system more hydrodynamic a rigid component thunniform design which are considered as mimetic is the vcuuv by anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 this large tuna design is capable of complex swimming missions but the structure is made completely out of rigid components and hydraulic actuator where the peduncle has a clever flexion design that gives this body similar movement to the tuna this would suggest that more systems be considered mimetic but the decision to include this design is based off the fulfillment of criteria for 1 this is considered the only auv to span all these categories successfully considering the fin undulation class the rajiform category is the only one that has potential for mimetic auvs the rigid structures of the amiiform and gymnotiforms do not allow for the fulfillment of the materials selected however the rajiform category has several systems which could be deemed mimetic the soft structured systems by alvarado et al 2013 cai et al 2009 krishnamurthy et al 2010 and park et al 2016 have extreme resemblance to their biological counterparts the sizes of these systems do not fall within the biological criteria however these auvs are taking steps in the right direction to replicate the biological animals in this category the most intriguing design that is revolutionary is park et al 2016 this design uses actual muscle tissue outlaid in a polymer matrix that is excited through optical impulse to a metallic skeleton to actuate the pectoral fins unfortunately this design is very difficult to scale up in the jet propulsion there are several systems that are recognized by their mimetic design the auvs described in table 28 have extremely good traits the jellyfish auvs by villanueva et al 2011 and najem et al 2012 are the most mimetic out of the four however the designs of wang et al 2011 and arienti et al 2013 should be recognized by their soft mantel constriction propulsion designs the design of arienti et al 2013 has arms that flex extremely similar to the octopus and are able to push the auv when touching the sea floor considering all the various robot systems described in this review the best performing tend to align with the locomotion category that they are placed in rigid and soft materials can be used to create the various locomotions and shapes however the auvs with the fastest speeds are the ones with rigid components it could be further expressed that the use of a mixture of rigid and soft materials would make these robots more like biological systems a skeletal structure is the easiest way to describe how the rigid materials could be used soft materials can cover this skeleton much like the robotuna and mackerel and flexible fin cownose ray designed by cai et al 2009 the flexible skins make these systems highly mimetic and gives them more biological characteristics as stated recommendations are suggested during the material selection process the rigid skeletal structure described allows for more realistic performance for fin oscillation auvs while the soft body shells would help for these auvs to mimic animal characteristics considering fin undulation auvs more soft materials are needed as large portions of the fins and body need to be flexible various construction techniques need to be applied depending on the selection of a fin actuated by active or passive wave propagation the fin undulation auvs need to have body flexibility as this trait can be found for the biological animals described the jet propulsion auvs still need to determine the best construction methods to recreate the thrust necessary for efficient movement the amiiform gymnotiform and jet propulsion auvs struggle with directional control and more work needs to be done to improve their capabilities the jet propulsion auvs have the greatest possibilities for improvements out of the systems described 5 conclusions the utility of the aquatic unmanned vehicles offers a solution for a wide range of missions in efforts to create more optimized systems the adaptation of biological animal traits was proposed as these offer functional design alternatives this review compiled works by organizing auvs into a biological locomotion based classification the auvs described serve as a good literature reviews for each category the biological animals defined give criteria that can be used to create more optimized auvs the more intriguing auvs found were ones that aligned with the biological animals in their respective categories criteria extracted from each biological category creates a smaller batch of auvs found to be more inspired from nature from this batch of auvs certain observations are made that will allow for more realistic bioinspired auvs the selection of materials is assumed to be a top priority to create biomimetic auvs the use of rigid and soft materials was proposed as biological animals have rigid and soft structures body actuation and fin motion are deemed a significant part of the bioinspired process many auvs in the fin oscillation and undulation do not consider the body morphology of their characteristic animals auvs in the jet propulsion category are still being developed where they consider the soft body and how to replicate the thrust generated by these animals considering biological criteria it was discussed what makes these systems bioinspired and biomimetic and the auvs that fall into these distinctive categories 
23676,the exploratory frontier of offshore oil and gas industry comes into deeper waters with the 3000 m water depth barrier hurdled in the us gulf of mexico in 2003 at these water depths the extremely high external pressures low temperatures long distance tie backs and high environmental loads due to waves currents and wind combined brings the employed equipment to its operational limit this paper presents a literature review on failure events experienced by the industry concerning pipelines risers and umbilical cables describing their causes consequences and severity from the several failure modes reported up to now it is possible to select the ones that are more frequent and deserves attention from academia and industry concerning pipelines the main failure modes reported are due to mechanical damage corrosion construction defect natural hazards and fatigue additionally a vast review of published researches concerning the pipeline seabed interaction is presented with regard to floating risers approximately 85 of them are of flexible type although flexible risers may fail in different ways collapse due to external pressure is reported as the most frequent failure mode for umbilical cables the major failure modes are found to occur under tension or compression torsion fatigue wear and sheaving keywords equipments failures deepwater oil and gas industry 1 introduction oil and gas exploration and production in deepwater is associated with the use of highly sophisticated equipment and increasing innovative technology however the failure of this equipment can cause serious consequences including material loss and environmental pollution critical accidents can even cause the loss of human lives based on a literature review this paper aims to identify past typical failures experienced in the industry concerning pipelines risers and umbilicals detailing the causes consequences and severity of these failures pipelines are the safest method to export liquid and gaseous petroleum products or chemicals roche 2007 however like any engineering structure pipelines do occasionally fail the main failure modes experienced by pipelines during production are identified as mechanical damage impact or accidental damage external and or internal corrosion construction defect material or mechanical failure natural hazards and fatigue risers are oil and gas transfer lines of much importance to offshore oil and gas production systems they comprise the dynamic segment of an exportation pipeline or a production flowline connecting seabed to the production unit at sea level they are affected by mechanical stress environmental issues and individual conditions resulting from the geographic location where the production unit has been installed risers can be classified as flexible or rigid for flexible risers the major failures experienced are due to fatigue corrosion torsion burst collapse and overbending for rigid risers the most common external threats are impacts internal and or external corrosion overstress fatigue structural wear structural instability material degradation and fire explosion in surface segments umbilical cables are responsible to control subsea equipment like xmas trees manifolds pumps separators etc bryant 1990 identifies the failure modes of umbilical cables as tension or compression torsion fatigue wear and sheaving these failures modes are discussed with particular focus on sheaving which is associated with the use of static sheaves such as curved plates during umbilical installation this work is motivated by the need of extensively address studies about the safety of offshore operations in deepwater and ultra deepwater scenarios like pre salt fields in the brazilian santos basin the compiled information can be used as a guide to initiate studies on structural integrity the possibility of contributing to the establishment of a national program of offshore safety in brazil with emphasis on technological advances that aim the prevention of accidents is also a motivation for this research 2 pipeline failures according to the us pipeline hazardous materials safety administration phmsa 2014 there were a few more than three hundred offshore pipeline incidents in the u s in the past ten years seventy one involving hydrocarbon releases aljaroudi et al 2015 pipeline failures are usually related to a breakdown in the system for example the loss of corrosion protection meaning a combination of ageing coating aggressive environment and rapid corrosion growth that may lead to a failure this type of failure is not simply a corrosion failure but a corrosion control system failure similar observations can be drawn for failures due to external interference stress corrosion cracking etc cosham and hopkins 2002 based on four different databases that include only accidents that led to loss of containment de stefani and carr 2010 pointed out the following as the most probable failure modes in pipelines mechanical damage which includes impact and any external damage external or internal corrosion construction defect mechanical or material failure and natural hazards stadie frohbös and lampe 2013 also studied offshore pipeline failures based on existing codes as dnv rp f116 2009 and historical records considering 22 offshore pipelines the authors concluded that beside the failure modes mentioned above erosion structural threats fatigue and static overloads particularly at free spans and unpredicted operation are also possible failure modes based on pipeline and riser loss of containment parloc 2003 and data from phmsa 2014 stadie frohbös and lampe 2013 concluded that impact is the major cause of failures in offshore pipelines in operation at north sea representing 56 of the total failures between 1971 and 2000 in the us comparing all failures reported between 1995 and 2011 31 are caused by corrosion these numbers and those of other failure causes are summarized in fig 1 the difference between the two scenarios us and north sea may be explained by geographic reasons at the shallow waters of north sea the impact of a dropped object is most probably than at us deepwaters since the current action can deviate the object from the undesirable target on the other hand hurricanes are frequent at us increasing the failures by natural hazards at those fields anyway corrosion is always an issue of concern for both scenarios review and analysis of historical causes of pipeline failures worldwide indicate that corrosion especially internal corrosion is the most widely reported cause of failure of offshore pipelines followed by maritime activities anchor or trawling damage and vessel collisions and natural forces like storms and mudslides hokstad et al 2010 corrosion reduces the pipeline s strength and capacity to endure operating pressure leading to two possible failure events leakage or burst leakage failure occurs when corrosion fully penetrates the pipeline wall thickness while burst failure occurs when operating pressure exceeds the maximum allowable pressure at a defect point aljaroudi et al 2015 all internal and external corrosion occurrences affecting pipelines used in the oil gas industry are of electrochemical nature i e they need the presence of water in contact with steel and oxidizing species dissolved in water for feeding corrosion cells roche 2007 at ultra deepwater scenarios thickness reduction can cause collapse under external pressure rather than burst under internal pressure cathode protection cp and coatings are used to protect offshore transportation pipelines according to roche 2004 as long as coatings remain bonded to steel and cathode protection is correctly applied monitored and maintained no external corrosion risk exists however the same author in another paper published three years later stated that not even the risk of corrosion under unbonded coating is a concern to offshore pipelines integrity this is probably due to the high conductivity and homogeneity of seawater which makes easier the access of cp current underneath electrical shields roche 2007 according to roche 2007 most of the leaks due to internal corrosion have been explained by microbiologically induced corrosion mic or by ingress of co2 traces combined with h2s the first parameter determining corrosion risks is the presence of water in contact with steel surfaces this contact is obvious for injection water lines in the case of oil pipelines water may be in contact with steel at the bottom of the pipe settled by gravity and on the flow pattern depending on the water content for wet gas pipelines water is separate also at the pipeline bottom line but in some cases condensation may occur if the gas is hot at the top line when cooling from outside is significant enough several types of corrosion may occur at locations where water is in contact with steel as long as oxidizing species are present the most frequent species are co2 light organic acids h2s and o2 most often corrosion pattern is in the form of pits craters or more uniform wall thinning in india offshore facilities premature leaks in subsea water injection pipelines due to rupture were observed analysis of different operating parameters and water quality indicated failure due to microbial induced internal corrosion according to samant and singh 1998 this kind of corrosion was due to low flow velocities insoluble corrosion products suspended iron oxide iron sulfide and bacteria present in the water accumulated at the bottom of the pipe moreover non pigging of the pipeline might have allowed bacteria to multiply rapidly and develop colonies and biofilm which provides a hiding sites for bacteria and shielded them from effective treatment by bactericides due to lack of frequent pigging and an effective microbiocidal treatment procedure the uncontrolled growth of bacteria occurred consequently microbial activities dominated and led to an acidic environment that ultimately caused internal severe localized corrosion samant and singh 1998 another pipeline failure case was reported by rose 1999 and was attributed to girth weld problems at point pedernales field california a complete and sudden failure of a subsea pipeline caused the release of 163 barrels of crude oil into the pacific ocean a crack occurred at a girth weld between pipe body and the flange bell after investigation and analysis of the failure it was concluded that the crack initiated at the heat affected zone leading to a complete separation of the flange bell the examination revealed that the heat affected zone was brittle possibly due to a lack of preheating prior to welding therefore numerous microcracks have developed one of which being the failure initiation site rose 1999 amend 2010 attributed to welds the responsibility for more than 6 of significant pipeline failures the author stated that pipeline girth welds are unlikely to fail unless subjected to axial strains that far exceed the strains related to internal pressure alone girth welds containing significant workmanship flaws are likely to be resistant to failure at stresses less than the pipe yield strength unless the welds do not match specification and or are susceptible to brittle fracture initiation pipe buckling and overbending can result from longitudinal compressive stresses induced by a change of temperature simonsen 2014 if the temperature of a pipeline is increased due to a production fluid flow temperature the pipeline can deform both circumferentially and axially circumferential expansion is usually fully unconstrained but longitudinal expansion is often prevented by seabed friction and attachments generating compressive stresses that can lead to pipe buckling and overbending a vast review of published researches on the pipeline seabed interaction under waves and or currents is presented by fredsøe 2016 comprising three issues scour liquefaction and lateral stability of pipelines the process of scour around a pipeline is dependent on seabed interaction which is influenced by pipeline movement due to bending along the scour process fredsøe 2016 when the pipe is placed on or slightly embedded a certain distance e from the seabed piping may occur due to its submerged weight by the seepage flow below it fredsøe 2016 such flow is caused by the pressure difference between the upstream stagnation pressure point a in fig 2 and the lower pressure in the leeside wake point b in fig 2 as described by sumer et al 2001 the pressure gradient from a to b fig 2 is a function of the keulegan carpenter number kc for waves defined as 1 kc 2πa d where a is the orbital amplitude in steady flow the wake pressure is primarily governed by the pressure in the separation point point s in fig 2 which is slightly lower due to the small velocities in the wake compared to the outer flow in s the pressure is low since the outside flow is high the scour process initiated by piping was studied experimentally by chiew 1990 and sumer et al 2001 the onset of the scour beneath a pipeline strongly depends on the initial embedment e into the seabed an upper limit was found for the onset of scour when the pipe is embedded no onset was observed by chiew 1990 when e d exceeded 0 5 where d is the pipe diameter the scour process in the onset of piping in waves is similar to that in the current alone case with some particularities since the flow attack is bidirectional the impact of the length of the scour hole on the pipeline deformation was studied by leckie et al 2015 and draper et al 2015 they found that for long holes the pipe locally sags down into the hole causing strains along the pipe while for shorter holes the pipe sinks more uniformly a scoured hole around a pipeline may further undergo sediment backfilling which can be caused for instance by the touchdown of the pipe into the scoured hole this backfill process was observed experimentally by sumer and fredsøe 2002 the development of scour holes along the pipe affects the sinking velocity of the pipe into the bed faster spreading of the holes is related to faster pipe sinking when the pipe is located in a free span it may vibrate as a result of waves and or current sumer et al 1989 shen et al 2000 zhao and cheng 2010 which causes an additional pulsating flow around the pipe leading to an expansion of the scoured bed profile a mechanism to stop the expansion of the scour hole along the pipe is the increased embedment of the pipe in the shoulders which considerably reduces the scour below the pipe in the free span scour can be reduced or totally avoided by installing flexible mattresses around it placed either above or beneath the pipe the horizontal extent away from the pipe must be sufficient large so the edge scour at the outer periphery is sufficiently reduced to ensure the mat s stability fredsøe 2016 noncohesive soil in the seabed exposed to waves may undergo liquefaction when pipelines placed on the seabed may sink if their submerged density is higher than the liquefied soil density similarly buried pipelines may float to the bed surface when their submerged density is lower than that of the surrounding liquefied soil fredsøe 2016 usually liquefaction caused by earthquake is the major cause for liquefaction of soil due to its large amplitude in the oscillation and higher frequency fredsøe 2016 waves can also cause liquefaction jeng 2013 sumer 2014 regarding the lateral stability of pipelines wagner et al 1989 developed a model to predict the soil resistance to lateral motions of untrenched submarine pipelines including loading history effects to the coulomb friction model they conducted full scale laboratory tests of pipe soil interaction including both monotonic and cyclic lateral load tests on five offshore soil conditions loose silty fine sand loose medium coarse sand dense medium coarse sand soft clay and stiff clay the tests showed that any loading history that causes increased pipe penetration resulted in increased lateral resistance and this dependence is not addressed by the typical coulomb model a two term empirical lateral soil resistance model which depends on the pipe size and weight the soil strength and the lateral loading history was then developed by wagner et al 1989 2 f h f f f r where f h is the total lateral soil resistance f f is the sliding resistance and f r is the lateral passive soil resistance term in terms of flow pipe soil interaction mechanism the works of gao et al 2002 2007 and teh et al 2003 show advances in this area gao et al 2002 adopted a hydrodynamic loading method to better understand the physics of lateral stability of untrenched offshore pipelines under wave loading from the conduction of a series of experiments the authors identified three characteristic stages in the process of pipe lateral instability a onset of sand scour b pipe rocking and c pipe breakout the authors established a linear relationship between the pipe weight parameter g and hydrodynamic parameters f rb by means of an empirical formula that works as a guide for engineering practice more recently gao et al 2007 compared the results previously shown for the pipeline stability in waves with those in currents this comparison is summarized in fig 3 where it can be noticed that under wave loading after the fully stable stage a slight rocking stage of the pipeline takes place the time durations of both stages are approximately the same finally in the last stage the pipeline suddenly moves back and forth with large horizontal displacements i e the pipe loses lateral stability fig 3 a however under the current loading the pipe pushes the soil nearby ahead with a slight lateral displacement in the stream direction instead of with slight rocking after the totally stable stage in the stage of the pipeline losing stability the pipeline in the currents moves with large displacements only in the stream direction fig 3 b regarding the linear relationship between the pipe weight parameter and hydrodynamic parameters developed by the authors in 2002 different relationships for pipeline lateral stability in waves and in currents were found indicating that the pipeline directly laid on the sandy seabed in currents remains more stable than in waves for the same level of flow velocity the influence of the flow pipe soil interaction in the stability process was studied by teh et al 2003 which identified that even if the conventional design practice uses to assume the seabed itself as stable there is substantial field evidence that assumption may be incomplete for erodible seabed under severe wave condition the authors carried out a series of experiments to understand the behavior of a marine pipeline on a mobile and liquefied seabed two instability mechanisms were identified depending on the specific gravity of the pipelines if the pipeline is light enough it tends to become unstable earlier than the seabed does while if it is heavy enough the instability should be first reached by the seabed the results also showed that the pipeline sinking or floating depth in liquefied seabed depends on the pipeline specific gravity and liquefied soil parameters but not on the wave condition 3 riser failures subsea risers are a type of flowline developed for the vertical transportation of fluids or products from the seafloor to production and drilling facilities above the water surface as well as in the opposite way from the facility to the seafloor for injection purposes these conduits primarily transport produced hydrocarbons but also make the transportation of injection fluids control fluids and gas lift risers can be either rigid or flexible during operations these structures are susceptible to dynamic loads that can lead to failures the possible failure modes and some real incidents for each type of riser will be thoroughly discussed next due to its importance to oil and gas production a riser structural failure can lead to serious financial losses to operator it results in reduction or cessation of revenue by committing the production development it may also lead to spillage and pollution and may even endanger lives sen 2006 cook et al 2006 based their studies on bp s deepwater floating production facilities located in the gulf of mexico gom and developed an integrity management study for a range of riser types top tensioned vertical risers steel catenary risers and flexible pipe risers the following most probable external threats for risers were determined considering the deepwater environment in the gom impacts external corrosion overstress fatigue wear material degradation and fire explosion in above water sections among these external threats external corrosion is the most frequent another author anunobi 2012 stated that external corrosion is responsible for 70 of reported riser failure incidents 3 1 rigid risers the most severe consequences of a riser failure are typically associated with production export injection risers there are many riser configurations to these functions but vertical top tensioned rigid risers are historically most applied for production nazir et al 2008 according to hokstad et al 2010 approximately 15 of risers for floating systems worldwide are metallic risers inside this percentage 75 are top tensioned risers ttrs which are considered a mature technology that has been used for production since 1975 mcs 2009 this type of riser works as a conduit from the seabed to the facility and allows workover activity when it is necessary ttrs are subjected to fatigue loads due to platform motions and ocean currents thethi et al 2005 in 2009 the mcs advanced subsea engineering prepared an investigation into the causes and probabilities of top tensioned riser ttr failures due to workover and drilling operations existing single and dual casing production risers with a surface blowout preventer were then analyzed mcs 2009 for sidetrack and re drilling operations the most critical riser failure modes outside of typical production hazards included drilling induced vibration div fatigue and riser wear from direct contact with the drill string in both failure modes reduced thickness caused by production represents a major contributing factor for their occurrence if not noticed at the beginning div can reduce drastically riser life or even lead to a complete failure of the riser a top tensioned riser case study in the gom is presented in the recommended practice dnv rp f206 2008 in which are shown examples of possible failure mechanisms and their global failure modes as system failure modes can be listed burst collapse buckling with external and internal pressure leakage fracture due to fatigue and rupture due to overload as major causes of failures can be listed excessive pressure excessive temperature corrosion leading to critical material loss excessive tension excessive bending moment excessive fatigue loading physical damage by accident or during installation and manufacturing defects these failure mechanisms and failure modes are illustrated in table 1 steel catenary risers scrs are composed by a single wall rigid steel pipe and require minimal subsea equipment which makes it cheaper than other configurations buberg 2014 a scr is a seemingly relatively simple system where the riser is in continuity with the flowline and is made up from welding a number of steel pipe joints of standard length quintin et al 2007 scrs are not widely used but they are a very attractive option for deepwater operations because these risers have the advantage of being highly resistant to internal and external pressure however in terms of fatigue failure these risers deserve careful evaluation of the fatigue life since they are very sensitive to cyclic loadings sen 2006 in their study kimiaei et al 2010 stated that two critical fatigue areas could be highlighted in a scr the vessel hang off point and the touchdown point where the highest bending moment is observed according to sen 2008 the main contributors to fatigue damage are i first order vessel motion ii slow drift iii vortex induced vibration viv and iv fatigue during transportation a case study of a steel catenary riser in west africa is presented in the recommended practice dnv rp f206 2008 and the results for initial cause mechanism and failure modes are outlined in table 2 3 2 flexible risers as an alternative for conventional rigid steel pipes flexible risers have been used over the last 30 years simonsen 2014 the use of these structures allowed production in areas where rigid pipes were not an economically viable choice approximately 85 of risers designed for floating systems are flexible risers hokstad et al 2010 flexible pipes are crucial for subsea activities worldwide and mainly for norwegian oil and gas production facilities since 1986 leira et al 2015 there are two types of flexible pipes available bonded and unbonded as the unbonded pipes are largely used by oil and gas industry they will be the focus of this review there are more than 3500 dynamic unbonded flexible risers in operation worldwide the average riser age is more than 10 years and a great number of risers are soon reaching their original design service life of 15 25 years muren et al 2016 according to dos santos et al 2010 the technology qualification of flexible pipes was not capable to anticipate the variety of failure mechanisms that followed the first years in use the author attributes two main reasons for that the first is the high patented environment surrounding the flexible risers technology development where algorithms and degradation models are closed to the market and the second is the lack of high level independent design verification here high level regards the completeness of the verification with no judgment to its quality fig 4 exemplifies some of the failure modes that were described in this section summarized in table 3 due to their complex layered configuration flexible pipes are more vulnerable to damage and present high number of failure modes moreover the integrity management becomes more challenging because of each layer is made of a different material according to 4 subsea 2013 in a report for psa norway several flexible risers fail before reaching their intended lifetime actually 25 of offshore flexible risers in norway were replaced without meeting their design service life the need to study flexible pipes is obvious due to the knowledge and technology gaps that need to be overcome to meet integrity requirements in order to fill these gaps it is essential that manufacturers operators and regulatory agencies cooperate with each other in 2009 a joint industry project jip was started by oil and gas uk and led by sureflex including oil and gas operators a flexible pipe manufacturer and a regulatory authority the aim was to collect data about flexible pipe usage degradation and incidents recently norwegian petroleum safety authority psa started to manage the corrosion and damage database codam in order to report incidents and injuries of offshore structures and pipeline systems on the norwegian continental shelf ncs through exchanged information standards and guidelines for safe fabrication and operation of flexible pipe systems can be improved based on api rp 17b simonsen 2014 raised nine most probable failure modes that can occur in flexible pipes collapse burst tensile rupture compressive rupture overbending torsional rupture fatigue erosion and corrosion these failure modes will be explained next 3 2 1 collapse common failure mechanisms that could cause carcass collapse of a flexible riser are excessive force or pressure fabrication anomalies erosion carcass corrosion and installation damage simonsen 2014 focusing on flexible pipes used in production activities the main risk they are subject is the sand content in the produced fluids the sand can cause erosion on the innermost pipe layer carcass and by this way its collapse resistance decreases this situation is more likely to happen in gas production pipes clevelario et al 2010 developed a numerical model to predict flexible pipe collapse resistance when subjected to curvature the authors aim to assess and quantify the effects of curvature on the flexible pipe collapse resistance in the ultradeep water of brazilian pre salt according to the authors the flexible pipe bending configuration is amongst the factors that can affect its suitability to service in extreme water depths 2500 m since it creates a dissymmetry between both the compressed and extended pipe areas the carcass and pressure armour gaps in these areas vary and reduce the overall pipe collapse resistance however according to clevelario et al 2010 some simple design solutions can be incorporated into flexible pipes to improve its overall collapse resistance and compensate for any possible reduction caused by bending the reader is encouraged to read clevelario et al 2010 for more information about these design solutions based on data from codam collapse is the most common incident in the ncs being more susceptible to happen in double annulus risers statoil had several incidents of such risers with carcass collapse observed in three different double annulus risers at njord a visund and snorre b fields simonsen 2014 3 2 2 burst burst is mainly caused by rupture of tensile and or pressure armors due to excessive internal pressure the rupture of the external sheath can also causes loss of pipe integrity other defects and failures as fabrication imperfections internal corrosion and erosion or external abrasion can also lead to burst by pipe weakening simonsen 2014 many incidents in flexible risers due to burst are described in codam simonsen 2014 emphasized two events where rupture of external sheath led to burst the first one was a rupture in the external sheath caused by a leak which promoted an increase in internal pressure inside the annulus and ended in burst of the external sheath in the other case the rupture of the external sheath occurred because the annulus vent system was not working correctly in this case diffused gases built up the pressure until it became larger than the burst resistance of the external sheath this is a well known problem and according to simonsen 2014 past years studies were developed in order to guarantee well functioning of the vent system and gas monitoring in flexible pipes 3 2 3 tensile rupture considering that tensile armor wires are already designed to support loads higher than normal service loads tensile forces should be a problem only when they are excessive and act together with any factor that reduces the wire resistance as corrosion or anomalies according to codam and sureflex incident reports simonsen 2014 tensile rupture is not a common occurrence just representing a low percentage of observed failures simonsen 2014 concluded that tensile failure is a threat to pipe integrity just when it is combined with corrosion abrasion or any other factor that changes the resistance of the flexible pipe 3 2 4 compressive rupture ribeiro et al 2003 used a three dimensional finite element model to predict the local mechanical behavior of flexible risers under compression the authors concluded that the axial compression stiffness is much lower than the tension one the tensile armours and the plastic sheaths are responsible for this behavior the wires of the tensile armours not only move radially but also laterally resulting in high bending stresses in these wires and finally that compression in flexible risers also generate gaps between layers a failure mechanism called radial buckling or bird caging can happen when a flexible pipe experiences large compressive loads causing wire disordering this mechanism is usually avoided when the outer sheath is intact and buckling resistance is high it is no longer a common phenomenon because new pipes use to have a high strength kevlar tape preventing bird caging this failure mode is more likely to happen in static flowlines for a properly designed flexible riser with or without an intact outer sheath it should not be an issue muren 2007 however a later study done by sureflex simonsen 2014 stated that in 2010 5 of flexible pipes incidents around the world were classified as bird caging which indicates that this failure mode should also be addressed 3 2 5 overbending according to simonsen 2014 the overbending failure mode in risers is more likely to happen at the touch down point tpd overbending can affect almost all the layers of a flexible pipe simonsen 2014 stated that loads induced by overbending can affect the pipe in different ways collapse due to compression forces may occur at the carcass and internal pressure sheath rupture of internal or external pressure sheath due to tension forces induced by overbending cracking of the outer sheath and unlocking of carcass and pressure armor layers due to pipe strength reduction if the bending stress is excessive although overbending affects many layers of a flexible pipe only one incident concerning this failure mode was reported in the norwegian sector in this case the failure happened during installation this failure mode used to be a current uk problem in the 90 s but it is not frequent anymore simonsen 2014 3 2 6 torsional rupture as the tensile armour wires are configured in a helical pattern they are subjected to tension or compression as the riser is twisted excessive tension loads due to twisting may lead to rupture of one or several wires according to simonsen 2014 torsional force in either direction on the flexible pipe may pose problems if the force is in the same direction as the helical pattern of the wires they will tighten and the collapse of the carcass and or internal pressure sheath may occur if the torsional force acts in the other direction the wires may be subjected to excessive compression force causing radial buckling or unlocking of the armour wires thereby torsional rupture is a flexible riser failure mode to be aware of because it can lead to other failures modes like structure collapse however it is not reported as the main cause of incidents risers operating in hard environmental situations wind waves and current are more vulnerable to torsional failure 3 2 7 fatigue flexible pipes experience fatigue failure due to cumulated cyclic stresses in different layers the fatigue challenges for deepwater risers are mainly concentrated at top due to bending combined with high tension and at seabed touch down area due to bending combined with high pressure loads this is also driven by the fact that almost all deepwater risers are in a free standing configuration nielsen et al 2008 the norwegian offshore sector in the north sea has done a research about fatigue failure in flexible pipes and it was observed that in average flexible risers were in service just 50 of its intended lifetime muren 2007 de lemos et al 2005 stated the most important failure modes of unbonded flexible risers associated to fatigue as fatigue associated with the wear of the tensile armors pure fatigue of the tensile armors fatigue associated with the wear of the pressure armors corrosion fatigue fatigue of the polymeric layer and fatigue in the armors at the end fittings in deep water environments the fatigue failure of tension wires near the end connection is an occurrence to be aware of simonsen 2014 there is a significant change in stiffness between the riser and the connector in the region close to the end fitting this structural discontinuity strongly influences the fatigue processes in the tensile axial wires at and embedded in the connector progressive fatigue failure possible accelerated by corrosion can occur mccarthy and buttle 2012 the majority of the reported cases of damage to flexible risers describe damage located in the top section of the riser close to the bend these include external sheath damage corrosion and or fatigue induced damage to the tensile armors and torsional instability associated to tensile armor rupture elman and alvim 2008 damage to the outer sheath which may lead to flooded annulus and consequently corrosion of the tensile and pressure armor wires degradation of the polymer layers increase of fatigue damage and decrease of the service life of a pipe experimental tests and numerical models have been done in order to allow a better prediction of fatigue life of armor wires authors like corrignan et al 2009 and kershaw et al 2014 agree that the flexible riser external sheath has a higher risk of damage between the wave zone and the topsides hang off potentially resulting in tensile armor corrosion or corrosion fatigue nielsen et al 2008 attribute to vessel motion and wave loading as the riser fatigue drivers saunders and o sullivan 2007 pointed out that external sheath damage is the major cause of flexible risers failures representing around 37 of the damage population in 2007 as can be seen in fig 5 in their work nielsen et al 2008 stated that corrosion fatigue properties are highly reduced in connection with sour service the armour wires can be subjected to a corrosive environment in case of partly or entirely water filled annulus that changes significantly along its length due to the hydrostatic pressure head consequently the fatigue assessment may require that different s n curves be applied along riser sections reflecting the different partial pressures of the permeated constituents nielsen et al 2008 clements et al 2006 concentrates their studies on the processes of understanding the materials under corrosion fatigue conditions and the development of material design curves according to the authors although fatigue and corrosion fatigue testing of flexible pipe armour wires has been well documented over the years little has been published to describe the effect of different test protocols and test set ups the armour wire fatigue capacity based upon representative s n curves and the palmgren miner linear damage hypothesis is normally applied when accumulated fatigue damage nielsen et al 2008 is calculated clements et al 2006 reported the resulting s n curves from different test protocols and how these increase or reduce conservatism in service life analysis according to simonsen 2014 due to intense efforts in researches and technologies the number of incidents due to fatigue failures in flexible pipes is decreasing in norway for example there is no register of fatigue failure of tensile wires for latest years however when operations occur in sour environment like brazil and west africa fatigue failures in tensile armors are still occurring although it is a complicated failure mode considering that it affects all different layers of a flexible pipe its occurrence can be avoided with a high safety factor assuming that its mechanisms are not influenced by any other factor that could decrease the fatigue strength like corrosion 3 2 8 erosion according to simonsen 2014 erosion alone is not a potential cause of loss of pipe integrity however happening concomitantly with corrosion thinning of the carcass may cause rupture or collapse of a pipe in this case erosion destroys the corrosion protecting layer turning the carcass more susceptible to fail erosion can happen due to the presence of particles in produced fluids and also by the development of hydrates the particles collide with the internal wall of the carcass reducing the thickness of the steel layer the erosion is more likely to happen in gas production pipes where the solid fragments flow with higher velocity it is noticed that there is no report exposing failures in flexible pipes exclusively caused by erosion according to helgaker et al 2017 erosion in smooth pipes can be determined with industry standard erosion prediction methodologies however these models are usually valid for smooth pipes only with limited information available on erosion in flexible pipes the work of parsi et al 2014 describes key factors influencing erosion and reviews available erosion equations the authors discuss solid particle erosion modelling for oil and gas wells and pipelines these models are used to limit the maximum production flow rates and avoid excessive erosion damage oka et al 2005 and oka and yoshida 2005 developed an equation for estimating erosion damage caused by solid particle impact arabnejad et al 2015 proposed a semi mechanistic model for the erosion of different target materials due to solid particles these models can be used to predict erosion wear caused by sand production in oil and gas components 3 2 9 corrosion in the same work of simonsen 2014 the author stated that corrosion alone is not a typical cause of failure in flexible pipes however when in combination with high static or fatigue loads it can cause loss of pipe integrity the contact of the seawater saturated with oxygen with the steel layers induces oxidation and it is a common reason for corrosion the author concluded that corrosion happens mostly when seawater and oxygen can flow into the annulus due to a breach in the outer sheath breach normally occurs during transportation and installation of a flexible pipe when damage used to be neglected this problem is highly appearing in statistics and needs to be studied 3 2 10 other failure modes besides the nine failure modes previously described based on the api rp 17b seven other different failure modes were studied by seaflex and were reported by muren 2007 these failure modes include hydrogen embrittlement impacts pigging accidents ageing wear vibrations in gas pipes and annulus threat environment however facing that flexible pipe is a current and common topic of many early and recent studies these additional failure modes will not be deeply covered in this report for more data about failure in flexible pipes some studies can be suggested hokstad et al 2010 performed a wide study about subsea equipment with focus on common failures experienced by each layer of a flexible pipe braga et al 2011 addressed the use of continuous vibration measurements to detect rupture of wires in the tensile armor layers of flexible risers leira et al 2015 proposed integrity assessment and qualification of lifetime extension based on a specific case study and also repair solutions for outer sheath damage facing the fact that it is one of the most common failures in flexible pipes shen and jukes 2015 discussed key factors impacting on the stress and fatigue damage of unbonded flexible risers and the potential failure modes at a hpht deepwater environment 4 subsea 2013 reported a study about unbonded flexible pipes where some incidents observed by psa from codam database were analyzed considering their causes possible solutions and mitigation actions some works about vibration in gas pipes can be also emphasized swindell and belfroid 2007 addressed the technical issues associated with high amplitude pressure pulsations generated by gas flow through flexible risers zheng et al 2012 showed that the influence of chaotic response on the resulting fatigue damage can be as significant as that of higher harmonic components finally belfroid et al 2009 studied the flow induced pressure pulsations fip from shackle type carcass according to them when gas passes through the flexible riser vortex shedding occurs at each of the internal corrugations generating pressure pulsations which induce vibration forces and excite mechanical natural frequencies leading to pipe fatigue 4 umbilical cable failures in general subsea umbilicals consist of an arrangement of high collapse resistance hcr hoses to chemical injection thermoplastic hoses to hydraulic control of valves electrical cables signal control or power supply tensile armors and a polymer layers when a subsea component fail operators have two options to perform an underwater repair or bring equipment up to the surface to repair it in the case of umbilical cables depending on the damage extension it is often necessary to stop production remove the whole umbilical and replace it resulting in high costs to the company the failure in umbilical cables can occur during manufacture installation and service bryant 1990 describes the most common failure mechanisms for such equipment the author divides umbilical cable failures according to their driving mechanisms tension or compression torsion fatigue wear and sheaving in general tension and compression loads are within the umbilical working limits of and are predominantly supported by armor and other system reinforcements the failures caused by tension or compression can be avoided by preventing the umbilical minimum bend radius and remaining it within the manufacturers recommendations for tensile loading both when the umbilical is straight and bent as a rule umbilical cables have low torsional stiffness and therefore are susceptible to damage resulting from excessive application of torsional loads according to bryant 1990 the risk of torsion damage is higher during umbilical installation such damage may occur at the point immediately below the final sheave on a laying vessel as the vessel makes a turn the mechanism involves the contribution of umbilical weight forcing the twist induced by the vessel maneuver in relation to the point where friction prevents umbilical rotation i e as it leaves the sheave the result of torsion damage will be either bird caging or necking of amour wires and or helical components many of the problems associated with laying umbilicals are related to torsion effects as looping these effects can be minimized by always keeping umbilicals under tension and with the aid of torque balanced armor bryant 1990 another very common damage in umbilicals is fretting damage because of continuous bending and load cycling to avoid such damage it is recommended the use of high abrasion resistance jackets to cover the most sensitive materials such as kevlar in addition to ensure that its internal components are maintained in relative position to each other it is necessary to provide fillers which ensure the most symmetrical configuration as possible according to bryant 1990 the braid of a hydraulic hose is sensitive to fretting damage since it is semi mobile the hose manufacturer must ensure that the amount of yarn on the braid layer is sufficient to withstand the loads generated by internal pressure and at the same time such amount of yarns does not result in tightly packed yarn which is susceptible to fretting damage fig 6 illustrates the cross section of a braid showing the difference between a low packing and a high packing braid the braid presented a less acute angle to the liner in case 2 than in case 1 and besides lowering its efficiency and capacity of load resistance it can also induce compressive failure in the braid fibers sheaving damage can be described as damage resulting from pulling of an umbilical around a sheave bryant 1990 generating a very rapid change of curvature close to the sheave if an umbilical is bent with constant curvature along the length the core will be somewhere on the convex tensile side and somewhere on the concave compression side of the umbilical the core components will of course tend to move from the compression to the tensile part of the core if the umbilical is also axially loaded there will be a pressure and a friction force between the different components waloen et al 1993 benjaminsen et al 1992 tried to determine the stresses and fatigue life of an axially loaded electrical umbilical running back and forth over a sheave the authors did cyclic bending fatigue tests to investigate the influence of factors affecting fatigue life lubrication sheave diameter axial load conductor type etc bend stiffness tests to measure the force required to bend umbilical samples over a range of sheaves in order to evaluate its bend stiffness core movement tests to study relative sliding of core components during bending over a sheave and deflection tests to study the effect of differential contraction and elongation of internal elements as the umbilical goes on and off a sheave those experimental tests were important to gather physical data for the development of an analytical procedure to calculate internal stresses in an umbilical being bent over a sheave which was reported in benjaminsen et al 1992 ricketts and kipling 1995 focused their studies in fatigue tests of an electrohydraulic umbilical passing through a sheave aiming to establish the effect of axial load hose pressure sheave diameter and wrap angle on the measured life among the results obtained the effects of sheave diameter and wrap angle can be highlighted even though the electrical unit was central and hence close to the neutral axis for a bending diameter reduction of 33 the measured reduction in the electrical conductor fatigue life was 96 the effect of wrap angle was also marked with a reduction from 180 to 90 leading to a life increase superior to 100 according to bryant 1990 the majority of umbilical damage is associated with the use of static sheaves such as curved plates high sheaving loads can result in removal of protective jackets and consequently in corrosion problems in addition sheaving under high loads can also result in high stress concentration in internal components of the umbilical leading to failure a particular interesting failure mechanism can be observed in hydraulic hoses related to sheaving under tensile loads as represented in fig 7 the stages of sheaving failure in hydraulic hoses comprise a transition between a perfect circular hose 1 an oval hose 2 and a point 3 at which the lower surface turns in on itself at this point the inwardly pointing material will be chased along the axis of the umbilical as it is pulled along over the sheave in some cases this type of damage is recoverable by re inflating the hose but the material life will certainly be reduced in other cases the heart shaped geometry is so pronounced that it resists inflation and subsequent bursts will occur due to the separation of the braid from the liner rabelo 2013 suggested that to avoid damage in hydraulic hoses it is necessary to keep the hoses pressurized by hydraulic fluid when the umbilical passes through pulleys and tensioners during installation umbilical cables are installed by launching vessels pipe laying support vessels plsvs fig 8 illustrates a plsv used for the installation of umbilical cables these vessels receive reeled umbilical cables and release them through tensioners the minimum radial compression on the tensioners is that required to maintain the set suspended when it is released this minimum grip should be ensured by the tensioner throughout the operation of release and for that a nominal value is set required crushing load the maximum value maximum crushing load is twice the difference between the nominal radial compression and minimum radial compression according to batrony et al 2012 it is important that these crush load limits are defined realistically and derived using verifiably accurate methods this requires fundamental understanding of the internal components failure modes subject to crush loading and analysis tools which are calibrated against actual test data batrony et al 2012 presented a preliminary study comparing experimental results with fea simulations on a sample steel tube umbilical under crush loading the minimum radial compression required in tensioners is function of the load being transferred the lower dynamic friction coefficient between the external coating and tensioner shoe structure the length of the tensioner and the number of tensioners which will be effectively employed the maximum radial compression specified design crushing load is dependent on the active traction because this could end up stretching the wires of the armour and inducing the effect of crushing squeeze in the inner layers dieumegard and fellows 2003 describe the design and installation of a deepwater metallic tube umbilical and give reference to the total length of tensioner required to install it under several water depths and umbilical weights as shown on fig 9 the total length of tensioner required to install an umbilical in ultra deepwater can be significant umbilical sections are submitted to radial compression when passing through tensioners and launching wheel and these loadings can cause significant bending in the internal components of the umbilical in addition the tensile armor submits the functional elements to mechanical pressure inducing ovalizations in the umbilical hoses rabelo 2013 concludes that it is essential to launch the umbilical cable with the hydraulic hoses completely full of hydraulic fluid to avoid hose failure rabelo 2013 describes a study of petrobras about the main causes of failures in umbilicals installed in production wells this study compiled installation and inspection reports of the company publications of other operators and consultation to umbilicals manufacturers in order to catalog the major non compliances that occurred in this equipment major cataloged failures include a cracks in the outer jacket nucleation and propagation of cracks in high density polyethylene hdpe b ripples loss of functionality of internal components due to non uniform stress distribution during the passage through plsv tensioners c kinks umbilical twist generating balancing loss d offset of the external sheath in hdpe offset of the outer jacket allowing exposure of the tensile armour e tensile armour wire break break of the wire in the welding region these failures illustrated in fig 10 occurred because of manufacturing defects handling or design fitness to supplier manufacturing facilities according to rabelo 2013 the problems caused by handling installation and operation are closely linked to hydraulic hoses failures these hoses have low resistance to collapse and this failure mode appears as the main cause of umbilical failures experienced the collapse is manifested by gradual increase of ovalization in hose section after some loading cycles such crease leads the hose to burst fig 11 illustrates the failure of a hydraulic hose due to the hydraulic hoses limitation to external pressure from 150 to 200 psi it was established as prerequisite and design premise that the umbilical installation in any depth must be made under internally pressurized hoses and no air inside the presence of air or other compressible fluid allows the development of creases and deformation ovality that result in hose failure rabelo 2013 reported a true case of umbilical cable hydraulic hose failure it corresponds to a gtx 443 injection well in water depths of 1181 m connecting the platform p 93 by a five functions electro hydraulic umbilical containing five hydraulic hoses of 3 8 the leakage of the hydraulic fluid driven in four of the five hoses was identified after valve control loss one of these hoses was dissected and the combination of external and internal pressure was identified as the most probable failure reason according to rabelo 2013 the main findings about the hoses failure were rupture of the polyurethane outer jacket burst aspect in the aramid layer extensive crease along sample length nylon 11 liner showing yellow coloration fig 12 shows a dissected hose and illustrates the failure aspect by burst almeida et al 2013 also conducted a study on hydraulic hoses failure due to pressure loads the authors proposed a new arrange to umbilical internal components aiming to reduce the applied tensile load on hoses to this end numerical fe analyses as well experimental tests were conducted according to this study due to the helical configuration of the tensile armour part of the applied load is transferred as pressure on the intermediate layers which can lead to the crushing of the internal components of the umbilical electrical cables hydraulic hoses etc from the numerical results the authors realized that the hoses were the components with higher tension levels during dynamic tests they suggested modifications of the umbilical cross section to reduce tensile levels by changing the mobility of internal components hydraulic hoses and electrical cables the simulation of the new cross section arrange demonstrated that it behaves inversely to the older one in which the electrical cables were free to move before they come in contact with the inner sheath with the new cross section arrange the hoses were made free to move which caused a reduction of about 53 in the maximum stress additionally the stresses became better distributed and symmetric in contrast to the older arrange where some regions of stress concentration were observed recently drumond et al 2016 studied the failure of umbilicals hydraulic hoses due to pressure loads and proposed an alternative material for the manufacture of the hose inner layer the authors based their work on the comparison between the material currently used polyamide 11 and a fluorinated elastomer viton to compare the mechanical behavior of both materials uniaxial tensile tests as well as nonlinear fe simulations were performed the numerical results obtained showed that both polyamide 11 and viton did not fail under external pressure however polyamide 11 concentrates high plastic deformations after collapse which can lead to localized hose rupture under internal pressure for viton it was found that the material concentrates deformations during collapse but they are recovered when internal pressure is applied to propose the replacement of polyamide 11 by viton it was showed that the latter has chemical compatible with the hydraulic fluid then ageing tests under temperature were conducted to check if the polymer loose mass swell and preserve its mechanical properties drumond et al 2016 after ageing it was found that the changes in mechanical properties were not severe as well as the swelling and mass loss effects a previous work legallais et al 1993 reported another failure mode on umbilicals hydraulic hoses the ability of some fluids and gases to permeate the hose layers despite of being small permeation rate at large distances leads to loss of significant fluid volume legallais et al 1993 based their research on a fluid commonly injected in wells the methanol a new material based on cross linked polyethylene was developed in order to replace polyamide 11 or thermoplastic polyester inner layer of hydraulic hoses for these materials methanol permeation rates vary with temperature from 150 to 5 g m2 mm dia for polyester and from 190 to 13 g m2 mm dia for polyamide 11 legallais et al 1993 have developed a specific degree of cross linked high density polyethylene named ducoflex such material is applicable to methanol injection or other fluids and can replace polyamide 11 or thermoplastic polyester at temperatures up to 90 c 5 conclusions this paper aims at reporting a literature review on failure events experienced by the oil and gas industry concerning pipelines risers and umbilical cables pipelines are structures widely used in oil and gas production facilities and occasionally may fail leading to hydrocarbons releases in the past ten years three hundred offshore pipeline incidents happened and seventy one of them involved hydrocarbon releases aljaroudi et al 2015 these numbers are relevant and pointed out the need of deeper studies about the causes of these structural failures the main failure modes experienced by pipelines during production are identified as mechanical damage impact or accidental damage external and or internal corrosion construction defect material or mechanical failure natural hazards and fatigue taking into account the failure events reported impact is indicated as the most frequent cause of failure modes representing 56 of the incidents in the north sea another relevant failure mode is associated with internal corrosion which represents 31 of the incidents in the us internal corrosion is mostly explained by microbiologically induced corrosion mic or by ingress of co2 traces combined with h2s facing these statistics further studies and analysis addressing impact and corrosion failures in pipelines are strongly recommended for future studies additionally pipe buckling and overbending can result from longitudinal compressive stresses caused by an increase of temperature combined with the presence of soil friction or constrained ends simonsen 2014 concerning the pipeline seabed interaction under waves and or currents a vast review of published researches is presented by fredsøe 2016 including three issues scour liquefaction and lateral stability of pipelines the process of scour around a pipeline is dependent on the pipeline seabed interaction which is influenced by the movement of the pipeline due to bending along the scour process when the pipe is located in a free span it may vibrate as a result of waves and or current sumer et al 1989 shen et al 2000 zhao and cheng 2010 which causes an additional pulsating flow around the pipe leading to an expansion of the scoured bed profile noncohesive soil in the seabed exposed to waves may undergo liquefaction when pipelines placed on the seabed may sink if their submerged density is higher than the liquefied soil density similarly buried pipelines may float to the bed surface when their submerged density is lower than that of the surrounding liquefied soil fredsøe 2016 in terms of flow pipe soil interaction mechanism advances were shown by gao et al 2002 2007 and teh et al 2003 gao et al 2002 identified three characteristic stages in the process of pipe lateral instability a onset of sand scour b pipe rocking and c pipe breakout rigid risers can be split into top tensioned risers ttr and steel catenary risers scr the main failure incidents to the former occur in workover drilling operations the main failure modes associated are drilling induced vibration fatigue and riser wear due to contact with the drill string even though steel catenary risers are not widely used they are a very attractive option for deeper waters however they are very sensitive to cyclic loadings and consequently susceptible to fatigue failure there are two critical fatigue areas in these structures the vessel hang off point and the touchdown point where the bending moment is the highest it can be noticed from literature review that few studies about failure in rigid risers were accomplished according to hokstad et al 2010 approximately 85 of floating systems risers are of flexible pipe type this is a huge number which deserves high attention to possible failures modes considering their wide application by industry after a comprehensive literature review some failure modes were identified collapse burst tensile rupture compressive rupture overbending torsional rupture fatigue erosion and corrosion although flexible risers may fail in different ways collapse due to external pressure was reported as the most frequent failure mode failure cases involving tensile armors rupture and burst were also reported the paper also discussed failures in umbilical cables bryant 1990 reported failures due to tension or compression torsion fatigue wear and sheaving the last one is a frequent failure mechanism associated with the use of static sheaves such as curved plates during umbilical installation another author rabelo 2013 cataloged the major non compliances that occurred in umbilical cables such as cracks in the outer jacket ripples kinks offset of the external sheath and tensile armour wire break these failure modes are widely covered by the industry with a lot of studies and projects aiming to mitigate or solve the related problems although the readers may be concerned about the failure mechanisms of the reported structures it is not possible to explore them in a single article here the aim is to bring a general view of the documented failures so that the reader can go in deep from the mentioned references from the analyzed structures some key factors should be highlighted in view of the reported failures i e water depth structure complexity and environmental conditions the increasing water depth potentially makes the installation and operation of such structures more dangerous since the involved loads are higher i e axial tension external pressure bending and torsion most of the reported failures are directly related to conditions of extreme loads or combinations of them structural complexity also increases the mechanical response modes and so far the failure possibilities it is clear that the multi layered pipes and cables present much more failure mechanisms than single wall structures certainly there are hundreds of publications addressing these different failure mechanisms and the readers are encouraged to access them finally the environmental conditions are always harmful for such engineering structures they can be corrosive chemically aggressive dynamical causing fatigue and sometimes extreme within severe weather conditions because of this the design installation and operation of pipelines risers and umbilicals will be always a challenging task acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from qpi brasil petróleo ltda anp r d program during

23676,the exploratory frontier of offshore oil and gas industry comes into deeper waters with the 3000 m water depth barrier hurdled in the us gulf of mexico in 2003 at these water depths the extremely high external pressures low temperatures long distance tie backs and high environmental loads due to waves currents and wind combined brings the employed equipment to its operational limit this paper presents a literature review on failure events experienced by the industry concerning pipelines risers and umbilical cables describing their causes consequences and severity from the several failure modes reported up to now it is possible to select the ones that are more frequent and deserves attention from academia and industry concerning pipelines the main failure modes reported are due to mechanical damage corrosion construction defect natural hazards and fatigue additionally a vast review of published researches concerning the pipeline seabed interaction is presented with regard to floating risers approximately 85 of them are of flexible type although flexible risers may fail in different ways collapse due to external pressure is reported as the most frequent failure mode for umbilical cables the major failure modes are found to occur under tension or compression torsion fatigue wear and sheaving keywords equipments failures deepwater oil and gas industry 1 introduction oil and gas exploration and production in deepwater is associated with the use of highly sophisticated equipment and increasing innovative technology however the failure of this equipment can cause serious consequences including material loss and environmental pollution critical accidents can even cause the loss of human lives based on a literature review this paper aims to identify past typical failures experienced in the industry concerning pipelines risers and umbilicals detailing the causes consequences and severity of these failures pipelines are the safest method to export liquid and gaseous petroleum products or chemicals roche 2007 however like any engineering structure pipelines do occasionally fail the main failure modes experienced by pipelines during production are identified as mechanical damage impact or accidental damage external and or internal corrosion construction defect material or mechanical failure natural hazards and fatigue risers are oil and gas transfer lines of much importance to offshore oil and gas production systems they comprise the dynamic segment of an exportation pipeline or a production flowline connecting seabed to the production unit at sea level they are affected by mechanical stress environmental issues and individual conditions resulting from the geographic location where the production unit has been installed risers can be classified as flexible or rigid for flexible risers the major failures experienced are due to fatigue corrosion torsion burst collapse and overbending for rigid risers the most common external threats are impacts internal and or external corrosion overstress fatigue structural wear structural instability material degradation and fire explosion in surface segments umbilical cables are responsible to control subsea equipment like xmas trees manifolds pumps separators etc bryant 1990 identifies the failure modes of umbilical cables as tension or compression torsion fatigue wear and sheaving these failures modes are discussed with particular focus on sheaving which is associated with the use of static sheaves such as curved plates during umbilical installation this work is motivated by the need of extensively address studies about the safety of offshore operations in deepwater and ultra deepwater scenarios like pre salt fields in the brazilian santos basin the compiled information can be used as a guide to initiate studies on structural integrity the possibility of contributing to the establishment of a national program of offshore safety in brazil with emphasis on technological advances that aim the prevention of accidents is also a motivation for this research 2 pipeline failures according to the us pipeline hazardous materials safety administration phmsa 2014 there were a few more than three hundred offshore pipeline incidents in the u s in the past ten years seventy one involving hydrocarbon releases aljaroudi et al 2015 pipeline failures are usually related to a breakdown in the system for example the loss of corrosion protection meaning a combination of ageing coating aggressive environment and rapid corrosion growth that may lead to a failure this type of failure is not simply a corrosion failure but a corrosion control system failure similar observations can be drawn for failures due to external interference stress corrosion cracking etc cosham and hopkins 2002 based on four different databases that include only accidents that led to loss of containment de stefani and carr 2010 pointed out the following as the most probable failure modes in pipelines mechanical damage which includes impact and any external damage external or internal corrosion construction defect mechanical or material failure and natural hazards stadie frohbös and lampe 2013 also studied offshore pipeline failures based on existing codes as dnv rp f116 2009 and historical records considering 22 offshore pipelines the authors concluded that beside the failure modes mentioned above erosion structural threats fatigue and static overloads particularly at free spans and unpredicted operation are also possible failure modes based on pipeline and riser loss of containment parloc 2003 and data from phmsa 2014 stadie frohbös and lampe 2013 concluded that impact is the major cause of failures in offshore pipelines in operation at north sea representing 56 of the total failures between 1971 and 2000 in the us comparing all failures reported between 1995 and 2011 31 are caused by corrosion these numbers and those of other failure causes are summarized in fig 1 the difference between the two scenarios us and north sea may be explained by geographic reasons at the shallow waters of north sea the impact of a dropped object is most probably than at us deepwaters since the current action can deviate the object from the undesirable target on the other hand hurricanes are frequent at us increasing the failures by natural hazards at those fields anyway corrosion is always an issue of concern for both scenarios review and analysis of historical causes of pipeline failures worldwide indicate that corrosion especially internal corrosion is the most widely reported cause of failure of offshore pipelines followed by maritime activities anchor or trawling damage and vessel collisions and natural forces like storms and mudslides hokstad et al 2010 corrosion reduces the pipeline s strength and capacity to endure operating pressure leading to two possible failure events leakage or burst leakage failure occurs when corrosion fully penetrates the pipeline wall thickness while burst failure occurs when operating pressure exceeds the maximum allowable pressure at a defect point aljaroudi et al 2015 all internal and external corrosion occurrences affecting pipelines used in the oil gas industry are of electrochemical nature i e they need the presence of water in contact with steel and oxidizing species dissolved in water for feeding corrosion cells roche 2007 at ultra deepwater scenarios thickness reduction can cause collapse under external pressure rather than burst under internal pressure cathode protection cp and coatings are used to protect offshore transportation pipelines according to roche 2004 as long as coatings remain bonded to steel and cathode protection is correctly applied monitored and maintained no external corrosion risk exists however the same author in another paper published three years later stated that not even the risk of corrosion under unbonded coating is a concern to offshore pipelines integrity this is probably due to the high conductivity and homogeneity of seawater which makes easier the access of cp current underneath electrical shields roche 2007 according to roche 2007 most of the leaks due to internal corrosion have been explained by microbiologically induced corrosion mic or by ingress of co2 traces combined with h2s the first parameter determining corrosion risks is the presence of water in contact with steel surfaces this contact is obvious for injection water lines in the case of oil pipelines water may be in contact with steel at the bottom of the pipe settled by gravity and on the flow pattern depending on the water content for wet gas pipelines water is separate also at the pipeline bottom line but in some cases condensation may occur if the gas is hot at the top line when cooling from outside is significant enough several types of corrosion may occur at locations where water is in contact with steel as long as oxidizing species are present the most frequent species are co2 light organic acids h2s and o2 most often corrosion pattern is in the form of pits craters or more uniform wall thinning in india offshore facilities premature leaks in subsea water injection pipelines due to rupture were observed analysis of different operating parameters and water quality indicated failure due to microbial induced internal corrosion according to samant and singh 1998 this kind of corrosion was due to low flow velocities insoluble corrosion products suspended iron oxide iron sulfide and bacteria present in the water accumulated at the bottom of the pipe moreover non pigging of the pipeline might have allowed bacteria to multiply rapidly and develop colonies and biofilm which provides a hiding sites for bacteria and shielded them from effective treatment by bactericides due to lack of frequent pigging and an effective microbiocidal treatment procedure the uncontrolled growth of bacteria occurred consequently microbial activities dominated and led to an acidic environment that ultimately caused internal severe localized corrosion samant and singh 1998 another pipeline failure case was reported by rose 1999 and was attributed to girth weld problems at point pedernales field california a complete and sudden failure of a subsea pipeline caused the release of 163 barrels of crude oil into the pacific ocean a crack occurred at a girth weld between pipe body and the flange bell after investigation and analysis of the failure it was concluded that the crack initiated at the heat affected zone leading to a complete separation of the flange bell the examination revealed that the heat affected zone was brittle possibly due to a lack of preheating prior to welding therefore numerous microcracks have developed one of which being the failure initiation site rose 1999 amend 2010 attributed to welds the responsibility for more than 6 of significant pipeline failures the author stated that pipeline girth welds are unlikely to fail unless subjected to axial strains that far exceed the strains related to internal pressure alone girth welds containing significant workmanship flaws are likely to be resistant to failure at stresses less than the pipe yield strength unless the welds do not match specification and or are susceptible to brittle fracture initiation pipe buckling and overbending can result from longitudinal compressive stresses induced by a change of temperature simonsen 2014 if the temperature of a pipeline is increased due to a production fluid flow temperature the pipeline can deform both circumferentially and axially circumferential expansion is usually fully unconstrained but longitudinal expansion is often prevented by seabed friction and attachments generating compressive stresses that can lead to pipe buckling and overbending a vast review of published researches on the pipeline seabed interaction under waves and or currents is presented by fredsøe 2016 comprising three issues scour liquefaction and lateral stability of pipelines the process of scour around a pipeline is dependent on seabed interaction which is influenced by pipeline movement due to bending along the scour process fredsøe 2016 when the pipe is placed on or slightly embedded a certain distance e from the seabed piping may occur due to its submerged weight by the seepage flow below it fredsøe 2016 such flow is caused by the pressure difference between the upstream stagnation pressure point a in fig 2 and the lower pressure in the leeside wake point b in fig 2 as described by sumer et al 2001 the pressure gradient from a to b fig 2 is a function of the keulegan carpenter number kc for waves defined as 1 kc 2πa d where a is the orbital amplitude in steady flow the wake pressure is primarily governed by the pressure in the separation point point s in fig 2 which is slightly lower due to the small velocities in the wake compared to the outer flow in s the pressure is low since the outside flow is high the scour process initiated by piping was studied experimentally by chiew 1990 and sumer et al 2001 the onset of the scour beneath a pipeline strongly depends on the initial embedment e into the seabed an upper limit was found for the onset of scour when the pipe is embedded no onset was observed by chiew 1990 when e d exceeded 0 5 where d is the pipe diameter the scour process in the onset of piping in waves is similar to that in the current alone case with some particularities since the flow attack is bidirectional the impact of the length of the scour hole on the pipeline deformation was studied by leckie et al 2015 and draper et al 2015 they found that for long holes the pipe locally sags down into the hole causing strains along the pipe while for shorter holes the pipe sinks more uniformly a scoured hole around a pipeline may further undergo sediment backfilling which can be caused for instance by the touchdown of the pipe into the scoured hole this backfill process was observed experimentally by sumer and fredsøe 2002 the development of scour holes along the pipe affects the sinking velocity of the pipe into the bed faster spreading of the holes is related to faster pipe sinking when the pipe is located in a free span it may vibrate as a result of waves and or current sumer et al 1989 shen et al 2000 zhao and cheng 2010 which causes an additional pulsating flow around the pipe leading to an expansion of the scoured bed profile a mechanism to stop the expansion of the scour hole along the pipe is the increased embedment of the pipe in the shoulders which considerably reduces the scour below the pipe in the free span scour can be reduced or totally avoided by installing flexible mattresses around it placed either above or beneath the pipe the horizontal extent away from the pipe must be sufficient large so the edge scour at the outer periphery is sufficiently reduced to ensure the mat s stability fredsøe 2016 noncohesive soil in the seabed exposed to waves may undergo liquefaction when pipelines placed on the seabed may sink if their submerged density is higher than the liquefied soil density similarly buried pipelines may float to the bed surface when their submerged density is lower than that of the surrounding liquefied soil fredsøe 2016 usually liquefaction caused by earthquake is the major cause for liquefaction of soil due to its large amplitude in the oscillation and higher frequency fredsøe 2016 waves can also cause liquefaction jeng 2013 sumer 2014 regarding the lateral stability of pipelines wagner et al 1989 developed a model to predict the soil resistance to lateral motions of untrenched submarine pipelines including loading history effects to the coulomb friction model they conducted full scale laboratory tests of pipe soil interaction including both monotonic and cyclic lateral load tests on five offshore soil conditions loose silty fine sand loose medium coarse sand dense medium coarse sand soft clay and stiff clay the tests showed that any loading history that causes increased pipe penetration resulted in increased lateral resistance and this dependence is not addressed by the typical coulomb model a two term empirical lateral soil resistance model which depends on the pipe size and weight the soil strength and the lateral loading history was then developed by wagner et al 1989 2 f h f f f r where f h is the total lateral soil resistance f f is the sliding resistance and f r is the lateral passive soil resistance term in terms of flow pipe soil interaction mechanism the works of gao et al 2002 2007 and teh et al 2003 show advances in this area gao et al 2002 adopted a hydrodynamic loading method to better understand the physics of lateral stability of untrenched offshore pipelines under wave loading from the conduction of a series of experiments the authors identified three characteristic stages in the process of pipe lateral instability a onset of sand scour b pipe rocking and c pipe breakout the authors established a linear relationship between the pipe weight parameter g and hydrodynamic parameters f rb by means of an empirical formula that works as a guide for engineering practice more recently gao et al 2007 compared the results previously shown for the pipeline stability in waves with those in currents this comparison is summarized in fig 3 where it can be noticed that under wave loading after the fully stable stage a slight rocking stage of the pipeline takes place the time durations of both stages are approximately the same finally in the last stage the pipeline suddenly moves back and forth with large horizontal displacements i e the pipe loses lateral stability fig 3 a however under the current loading the pipe pushes the soil nearby ahead with a slight lateral displacement in the stream direction instead of with slight rocking after the totally stable stage in the stage of the pipeline losing stability the pipeline in the currents moves with large displacements only in the stream direction fig 3 b regarding the linear relationship between the pipe weight parameter and hydrodynamic parameters developed by the authors in 2002 different relationships for pipeline lateral stability in waves and in currents were found indicating that the pipeline directly laid on the sandy seabed in currents remains more stable than in waves for the same level of flow velocity the influence of the flow pipe soil interaction in the stability process was studied by teh et al 2003 which identified that even if the conventional design practice uses to assume the seabed itself as stable there is substantial field evidence that assumption may be incomplete for erodible seabed under severe wave condition the authors carried out a series of experiments to understand the behavior of a marine pipeline on a mobile and liquefied seabed two instability mechanisms were identified depending on the specific gravity of the pipelines if the pipeline is light enough it tends to become unstable earlier than the seabed does while if it is heavy enough the instability should be first reached by the seabed the results also showed that the pipeline sinking or floating depth in liquefied seabed depends on the pipeline specific gravity and liquefied soil parameters but not on the wave condition 3 riser failures subsea risers are a type of flowline developed for the vertical transportation of fluids or products from the seafloor to production and drilling facilities above the water surface as well as in the opposite way from the facility to the seafloor for injection purposes these conduits primarily transport produced hydrocarbons but also make the transportation of injection fluids control fluids and gas lift risers can be either rigid or flexible during operations these structures are susceptible to dynamic loads that can lead to failures the possible failure modes and some real incidents for each type of riser will be thoroughly discussed next due to its importance to oil and gas production a riser structural failure can lead to serious financial losses to operator it results in reduction or cessation of revenue by committing the production development it may also lead to spillage and pollution and may even endanger lives sen 2006 cook et al 2006 based their studies on bp s deepwater floating production facilities located in the gulf of mexico gom and developed an integrity management study for a range of riser types top tensioned vertical risers steel catenary risers and flexible pipe risers the following most probable external threats for risers were determined considering the deepwater environment in the gom impacts external corrosion overstress fatigue wear material degradation and fire explosion in above water sections among these external threats external corrosion is the most frequent another author anunobi 2012 stated that external corrosion is responsible for 70 of reported riser failure incidents 3 1 rigid risers the most severe consequences of a riser failure are typically associated with production export injection risers there are many riser configurations to these functions but vertical top tensioned rigid risers are historically most applied for production nazir et al 2008 according to hokstad et al 2010 approximately 15 of risers for floating systems worldwide are metallic risers inside this percentage 75 are top tensioned risers ttrs which are considered a mature technology that has been used for production since 1975 mcs 2009 this type of riser works as a conduit from the seabed to the facility and allows workover activity when it is necessary ttrs are subjected to fatigue loads due to platform motions and ocean currents thethi et al 2005 in 2009 the mcs advanced subsea engineering prepared an investigation into the causes and probabilities of top tensioned riser ttr failures due to workover and drilling operations existing single and dual casing production risers with a surface blowout preventer were then analyzed mcs 2009 for sidetrack and re drilling operations the most critical riser failure modes outside of typical production hazards included drilling induced vibration div fatigue and riser wear from direct contact with the drill string in both failure modes reduced thickness caused by production represents a major contributing factor for their occurrence if not noticed at the beginning div can reduce drastically riser life or even lead to a complete failure of the riser a top tensioned riser case study in the gom is presented in the recommended practice dnv rp f206 2008 in which are shown examples of possible failure mechanisms and their global failure modes as system failure modes can be listed burst collapse buckling with external and internal pressure leakage fracture due to fatigue and rupture due to overload as major causes of failures can be listed excessive pressure excessive temperature corrosion leading to critical material loss excessive tension excessive bending moment excessive fatigue loading physical damage by accident or during installation and manufacturing defects these failure mechanisms and failure modes are illustrated in table 1 steel catenary risers scrs are composed by a single wall rigid steel pipe and require minimal subsea equipment which makes it cheaper than other configurations buberg 2014 a scr is a seemingly relatively simple system where the riser is in continuity with the flowline and is made up from welding a number of steel pipe joints of standard length quintin et al 2007 scrs are not widely used but they are a very attractive option for deepwater operations because these risers have the advantage of being highly resistant to internal and external pressure however in terms of fatigue failure these risers deserve careful evaluation of the fatigue life since they are very sensitive to cyclic loadings sen 2006 in their study kimiaei et al 2010 stated that two critical fatigue areas could be highlighted in a scr the vessel hang off point and the touchdown point where the highest bending moment is observed according to sen 2008 the main contributors to fatigue damage are i first order vessel motion ii slow drift iii vortex induced vibration viv and iv fatigue during transportation a case study of a steel catenary riser in west africa is presented in the recommended practice dnv rp f206 2008 and the results for initial cause mechanism and failure modes are outlined in table 2 3 2 flexible risers as an alternative for conventional rigid steel pipes flexible risers have been used over the last 30 years simonsen 2014 the use of these structures allowed production in areas where rigid pipes were not an economically viable choice approximately 85 of risers designed for floating systems are flexible risers hokstad et al 2010 flexible pipes are crucial for subsea activities worldwide and mainly for norwegian oil and gas production facilities since 1986 leira et al 2015 there are two types of flexible pipes available bonded and unbonded as the unbonded pipes are largely used by oil and gas industry they will be the focus of this review there are more than 3500 dynamic unbonded flexible risers in operation worldwide the average riser age is more than 10 years and a great number of risers are soon reaching their original design service life of 15 25 years muren et al 2016 according to dos santos et al 2010 the technology qualification of flexible pipes was not capable to anticipate the variety of failure mechanisms that followed the first years in use the author attributes two main reasons for that the first is the high patented environment surrounding the flexible risers technology development where algorithms and degradation models are closed to the market and the second is the lack of high level independent design verification here high level regards the completeness of the verification with no judgment to its quality fig 4 exemplifies some of the failure modes that were described in this section summarized in table 3 due to their complex layered configuration flexible pipes are more vulnerable to damage and present high number of failure modes moreover the integrity management becomes more challenging because of each layer is made of a different material according to 4 subsea 2013 in a report for psa norway several flexible risers fail before reaching their intended lifetime actually 25 of offshore flexible risers in norway were replaced without meeting their design service life the need to study flexible pipes is obvious due to the knowledge and technology gaps that need to be overcome to meet integrity requirements in order to fill these gaps it is essential that manufacturers operators and regulatory agencies cooperate with each other in 2009 a joint industry project jip was started by oil and gas uk and led by sureflex including oil and gas operators a flexible pipe manufacturer and a regulatory authority the aim was to collect data about flexible pipe usage degradation and incidents recently norwegian petroleum safety authority psa started to manage the corrosion and damage database codam in order to report incidents and injuries of offshore structures and pipeline systems on the norwegian continental shelf ncs through exchanged information standards and guidelines for safe fabrication and operation of flexible pipe systems can be improved based on api rp 17b simonsen 2014 raised nine most probable failure modes that can occur in flexible pipes collapse burst tensile rupture compressive rupture overbending torsional rupture fatigue erosion and corrosion these failure modes will be explained next 3 2 1 collapse common failure mechanisms that could cause carcass collapse of a flexible riser are excessive force or pressure fabrication anomalies erosion carcass corrosion and installation damage simonsen 2014 focusing on flexible pipes used in production activities the main risk they are subject is the sand content in the produced fluids the sand can cause erosion on the innermost pipe layer carcass and by this way its collapse resistance decreases this situation is more likely to happen in gas production pipes clevelario et al 2010 developed a numerical model to predict flexible pipe collapse resistance when subjected to curvature the authors aim to assess and quantify the effects of curvature on the flexible pipe collapse resistance in the ultradeep water of brazilian pre salt according to the authors the flexible pipe bending configuration is amongst the factors that can affect its suitability to service in extreme water depths 2500 m since it creates a dissymmetry between both the compressed and extended pipe areas the carcass and pressure armour gaps in these areas vary and reduce the overall pipe collapse resistance however according to clevelario et al 2010 some simple design solutions can be incorporated into flexible pipes to improve its overall collapse resistance and compensate for any possible reduction caused by bending the reader is encouraged to read clevelario et al 2010 for more information about these design solutions based on data from codam collapse is the most common incident in the ncs being more susceptible to happen in double annulus risers statoil had several incidents of such risers with carcass collapse observed in three different double annulus risers at njord a visund and snorre b fields simonsen 2014 3 2 2 burst burst is mainly caused by rupture of tensile and or pressure armors due to excessive internal pressure the rupture of the external sheath can also causes loss of pipe integrity other defects and failures as fabrication imperfections internal corrosion and erosion or external abrasion can also lead to burst by pipe weakening simonsen 2014 many incidents in flexible risers due to burst are described in codam simonsen 2014 emphasized two events where rupture of external sheath led to burst the first one was a rupture in the external sheath caused by a leak which promoted an increase in internal pressure inside the annulus and ended in burst of the external sheath in the other case the rupture of the external sheath occurred because the annulus vent system was not working correctly in this case diffused gases built up the pressure until it became larger than the burst resistance of the external sheath this is a well known problem and according to simonsen 2014 past years studies were developed in order to guarantee well functioning of the vent system and gas monitoring in flexible pipes 3 2 3 tensile rupture considering that tensile armor wires are already designed to support loads higher than normal service loads tensile forces should be a problem only when they are excessive and act together with any factor that reduces the wire resistance as corrosion or anomalies according to codam and sureflex incident reports simonsen 2014 tensile rupture is not a common occurrence just representing a low percentage of observed failures simonsen 2014 concluded that tensile failure is a threat to pipe integrity just when it is combined with corrosion abrasion or any other factor that changes the resistance of the flexible pipe 3 2 4 compressive rupture ribeiro et al 2003 used a three dimensional finite element model to predict the local mechanical behavior of flexible risers under compression the authors concluded that the axial compression stiffness is much lower than the tension one the tensile armours and the plastic sheaths are responsible for this behavior the wires of the tensile armours not only move radially but also laterally resulting in high bending stresses in these wires and finally that compression in flexible risers also generate gaps between layers a failure mechanism called radial buckling or bird caging can happen when a flexible pipe experiences large compressive loads causing wire disordering this mechanism is usually avoided when the outer sheath is intact and buckling resistance is high it is no longer a common phenomenon because new pipes use to have a high strength kevlar tape preventing bird caging this failure mode is more likely to happen in static flowlines for a properly designed flexible riser with or without an intact outer sheath it should not be an issue muren 2007 however a later study done by sureflex simonsen 2014 stated that in 2010 5 of flexible pipes incidents around the world were classified as bird caging which indicates that this failure mode should also be addressed 3 2 5 overbending according to simonsen 2014 the overbending failure mode in risers is more likely to happen at the touch down point tpd overbending can affect almost all the layers of a flexible pipe simonsen 2014 stated that loads induced by overbending can affect the pipe in different ways collapse due to compression forces may occur at the carcass and internal pressure sheath rupture of internal or external pressure sheath due to tension forces induced by overbending cracking of the outer sheath and unlocking of carcass and pressure armor layers due to pipe strength reduction if the bending stress is excessive although overbending affects many layers of a flexible pipe only one incident concerning this failure mode was reported in the norwegian sector in this case the failure happened during installation this failure mode used to be a current uk problem in the 90 s but it is not frequent anymore simonsen 2014 3 2 6 torsional rupture as the tensile armour wires are configured in a helical pattern they are subjected to tension or compression as the riser is twisted excessive tension loads due to twisting may lead to rupture of one or several wires according to simonsen 2014 torsional force in either direction on the flexible pipe may pose problems if the force is in the same direction as the helical pattern of the wires they will tighten and the collapse of the carcass and or internal pressure sheath may occur if the torsional force acts in the other direction the wires may be subjected to excessive compression force causing radial buckling or unlocking of the armour wires thereby torsional rupture is a flexible riser failure mode to be aware of because it can lead to other failures modes like structure collapse however it is not reported as the main cause of incidents risers operating in hard environmental situations wind waves and current are more vulnerable to torsional failure 3 2 7 fatigue flexible pipes experience fatigue failure due to cumulated cyclic stresses in different layers the fatigue challenges for deepwater risers are mainly concentrated at top due to bending combined with high tension and at seabed touch down area due to bending combined with high pressure loads this is also driven by the fact that almost all deepwater risers are in a free standing configuration nielsen et al 2008 the norwegian offshore sector in the north sea has done a research about fatigue failure in flexible pipes and it was observed that in average flexible risers were in service just 50 of its intended lifetime muren 2007 de lemos et al 2005 stated the most important failure modes of unbonded flexible risers associated to fatigue as fatigue associated with the wear of the tensile armors pure fatigue of the tensile armors fatigue associated with the wear of the pressure armors corrosion fatigue fatigue of the polymeric layer and fatigue in the armors at the end fittings in deep water environments the fatigue failure of tension wires near the end connection is an occurrence to be aware of simonsen 2014 there is a significant change in stiffness between the riser and the connector in the region close to the end fitting this structural discontinuity strongly influences the fatigue processes in the tensile axial wires at and embedded in the connector progressive fatigue failure possible accelerated by corrosion can occur mccarthy and buttle 2012 the majority of the reported cases of damage to flexible risers describe damage located in the top section of the riser close to the bend these include external sheath damage corrosion and or fatigue induced damage to the tensile armors and torsional instability associated to tensile armor rupture elman and alvim 2008 damage to the outer sheath which may lead to flooded annulus and consequently corrosion of the tensile and pressure armor wires degradation of the polymer layers increase of fatigue damage and decrease of the service life of a pipe experimental tests and numerical models have been done in order to allow a better prediction of fatigue life of armor wires authors like corrignan et al 2009 and kershaw et al 2014 agree that the flexible riser external sheath has a higher risk of damage between the wave zone and the topsides hang off potentially resulting in tensile armor corrosion or corrosion fatigue nielsen et al 2008 attribute to vessel motion and wave loading as the riser fatigue drivers saunders and o sullivan 2007 pointed out that external sheath damage is the major cause of flexible risers failures representing around 37 of the damage population in 2007 as can be seen in fig 5 in their work nielsen et al 2008 stated that corrosion fatigue properties are highly reduced in connection with sour service the armour wires can be subjected to a corrosive environment in case of partly or entirely water filled annulus that changes significantly along its length due to the hydrostatic pressure head consequently the fatigue assessment may require that different s n curves be applied along riser sections reflecting the different partial pressures of the permeated constituents nielsen et al 2008 clements et al 2006 concentrates their studies on the processes of understanding the materials under corrosion fatigue conditions and the development of material design curves according to the authors although fatigue and corrosion fatigue testing of flexible pipe armour wires has been well documented over the years little has been published to describe the effect of different test protocols and test set ups the armour wire fatigue capacity based upon representative s n curves and the palmgren miner linear damage hypothesis is normally applied when accumulated fatigue damage nielsen et al 2008 is calculated clements et al 2006 reported the resulting s n curves from different test protocols and how these increase or reduce conservatism in service life analysis according to simonsen 2014 due to intense efforts in researches and technologies the number of incidents due to fatigue failures in flexible pipes is decreasing in norway for example there is no register of fatigue failure of tensile wires for latest years however when operations occur in sour environment like brazil and west africa fatigue failures in tensile armors are still occurring although it is a complicated failure mode considering that it affects all different layers of a flexible pipe its occurrence can be avoided with a high safety factor assuming that its mechanisms are not influenced by any other factor that could decrease the fatigue strength like corrosion 3 2 8 erosion according to simonsen 2014 erosion alone is not a potential cause of loss of pipe integrity however happening concomitantly with corrosion thinning of the carcass may cause rupture or collapse of a pipe in this case erosion destroys the corrosion protecting layer turning the carcass more susceptible to fail erosion can happen due to the presence of particles in produced fluids and also by the development of hydrates the particles collide with the internal wall of the carcass reducing the thickness of the steel layer the erosion is more likely to happen in gas production pipes where the solid fragments flow with higher velocity it is noticed that there is no report exposing failures in flexible pipes exclusively caused by erosion according to helgaker et al 2017 erosion in smooth pipes can be determined with industry standard erosion prediction methodologies however these models are usually valid for smooth pipes only with limited information available on erosion in flexible pipes the work of parsi et al 2014 describes key factors influencing erosion and reviews available erosion equations the authors discuss solid particle erosion modelling for oil and gas wells and pipelines these models are used to limit the maximum production flow rates and avoid excessive erosion damage oka et al 2005 and oka and yoshida 2005 developed an equation for estimating erosion damage caused by solid particle impact arabnejad et al 2015 proposed a semi mechanistic model for the erosion of different target materials due to solid particles these models can be used to predict erosion wear caused by sand production in oil and gas components 3 2 9 corrosion in the same work of simonsen 2014 the author stated that corrosion alone is not a typical cause of failure in flexible pipes however when in combination with high static or fatigue loads it can cause loss of pipe integrity the contact of the seawater saturated with oxygen with the steel layers induces oxidation and it is a common reason for corrosion the author concluded that corrosion happens mostly when seawater and oxygen can flow into the annulus due to a breach in the outer sheath breach normally occurs during transportation and installation of a flexible pipe when damage used to be neglected this problem is highly appearing in statistics and needs to be studied 3 2 10 other failure modes besides the nine failure modes previously described based on the api rp 17b seven other different failure modes were studied by seaflex and were reported by muren 2007 these failure modes include hydrogen embrittlement impacts pigging accidents ageing wear vibrations in gas pipes and annulus threat environment however facing that flexible pipe is a current and common topic of many early and recent studies these additional failure modes will not be deeply covered in this report for more data about failure in flexible pipes some studies can be suggested hokstad et al 2010 performed a wide study about subsea equipment with focus on common failures experienced by each layer of a flexible pipe braga et al 2011 addressed the use of continuous vibration measurements to detect rupture of wires in the tensile armor layers of flexible risers leira et al 2015 proposed integrity assessment and qualification of lifetime extension based on a specific case study and also repair solutions for outer sheath damage facing the fact that it is one of the most common failures in flexible pipes shen and jukes 2015 discussed key factors impacting on the stress and fatigue damage of unbonded flexible risers and the potential failure modes at a hpht deepwater environment 4 subsea 2013 reported a study about unbonded flexible pipes where some incidents observed by psa from codam database were analyzed considering their causes possible solutions and mitigation actions some works about vibration in gas pipes can be also emphasized swindell and belfroid 2007 addressed the technical issues associated with high amplitude pressure pulsations generated by gas flow through flexible risers zheng et al 2012 showed that the influence of chaotic response on the resulting fatigue damage can be as significant as that of higher harmonic components finally belfroid et al 2009 studied the flow induced pressure pulsations fip from shackle type carcass according to them when gas passes through the flexible riser vortex shedding occurs at each of the internal corrugations generating pressure pulsations which induce vibration forces and excite mechanical natural frequencies leading to pipe fatigue 4 umbilical cable failures in general subsea umbilicals consist of an arrangement of high collapse resistance hcr hoses to chemical injection thermoplastic hoses to hydraulic control of valves electrical cables signal control or power supply tensile armors and a polymer layers when a subsea component fail operators have two options to perform an underwater repair or bring equipment up to the surface to repair it in the case of umbilical cables depending on the damage extension it is often necessary to stop production remove the whole umbilical and replace it resulting in high costs to the company the failure in umbilical cables can occur during manufacture installation and service bryant 1990 describes the most common failure mechanisms for such equipment the author divides umbilical cable failures according to their driving mechanisms tension or compression torsion fatigue wear and sheaving in general tension and compression loads are within the umbilical working limits of and are predominantly supported by armor and other system reinforcements the failures caused by tension or compression can be avoided by preventing the umbilical minimum bend radius and remaining it within the manufacturers recommendations for tensile loading both when the umbilical is straight and bent as a rule umbilical cables have low torsional stiffness and therefore are susceptible to damage resulting from excessive application of torsional loads according to bryant 1990 the risk of torsion damage is higher during umbilical installation such damage may occur at the point immediately below the final sheave on a laying vessel as the vessel makes a turn the mechanism involves the contribution of umbilical weight forcing the twist induced by the vessel maneuver in relation to the point where friction prevents umbilical rotation i e as it leaves the sheave the result of torsion damage will be either bird caging or necking of amour wires and or helical components many of the problems associated with laying umbilicals are related to torsion effects as looping these effects can be minimized by always keeping umbilicals under tension and with the aid of torque balanced armor bryant 1990 another very common damage in umbilicals is fretting damage because of continuous bending and load cycling to avoid such damage it is recommended the use of high abrasion resistance jackets to cover the most sensitive materials such as kevlar in addition to ensure that its internal components are maintained in relative position to each other it is necessary to provide fillers which ensure the most symmetrical configuration as possible according to bryant 1990 the braid of a hydraulic hose is sensitive to fretting damage since it is semi mobile the hose manufacturer must ensure that the amount of yarn on the braid layer is sufficient to withstand the loads generated by internal pressure and at the same time such amount of yarns does not result in tightly packed yarn which is susceptible to fretting damage fig 6 illustrates the cross section of a braid showing the difference between a low packing and a high packing braid the braid presented a less acute angle to the liner in case 2 than in case 1 and besides lowering its efficiency and capacity of load resistance it can also induce compressive failure in the braid fibers sheaving damage can be described as damage resulting from pulling of an umbilical around a sheave bryant 1990 generating a very rapid change of curvature close to the sheave if an umbilical is bent with constant curvature along the length the core will be somewhere on the convex tensile side and somewhere on the concave compression side of the umbilical the core components will of course tend to move from the compression to the tensile part of the core if the umbilical is also axially loaded there will be a pressure and a friction force between the different components waloen et al 1993 benjaminsen et al 1992 tried to determine the stresses and fatigue life of an axially loaded electrical umbilical running back and forth over a sheave the authors did cyclic bending fatigue tests to investigate the influence of factors affecting fatigue life lubrication sheave diameter axial load conductor type etc bend stiffness tests to measure the force required to bend umbilical samples over a range of sheaves in order to evaluate its bend stiffness core movement tests to study relative sliding of core components during bending over a sheave and deflection tests to study the effect of differential contraction and elongation of internal elements as the umbilical goes on and off a sheave those experimental tests were important to gather physical data for the development of an analytical procedure to calculate internal stresses in an umbilical being bent over a sheave which was reported in benjaminsen et al 1992 ricketts and kipling 1995 focused their studies in fatigue tests of an electrohydraulic umbilical passing through a sheave aiming to establish the effect of axial load hose pressure sheave diameter and wrap angle on the measured life among the results obtained the effects of sheave diameter and wrap angle can be highlighted even though the electrical unit was central and hence close to the neutral axis for a bending diameter reduction of 33 the measured reduction in the electrical conductor fatigue life was 96 the effect of wrap angle was also marked with a reduction from 180 to 90 leading to a life increase superior to 100 according to bryant 1990 the majority of umbilical damage is associated with the use of static sheaves such as curved plates high sheaving loads can result in removal of protective jackets and consequently in corrosion problems in addition sheaving under high loads can also result in high stress concentration in internal components of the umbilical leading to failure a particular interesting failure mechanism can be observed in hydraulic hoses related to sheaving under tensile loads as represented in fig 7 the stages of sheaving failure in hydraulic hoses comprise a transition between a perfect circular hose 1 an oval hose 2 and a point 3 at which the lower surface turns in on itself at this point the inwardly pointing material will be chased along the axis of the umbilical as it is pulled along over the sheave in some cases this type of damage is recoverable by re inflating the hose but the material life will certainly be reduced in other cases the heart shaped geometry is so pronounced that it resists inflation and subsequent bursts will occur due to the separation of the braid from the liner rabelo 2013 suggested that to avoid damage in hydraulic hoses it is necessary to keep the hoses pressurized by hydraulic fluid when the umbilical passes through pulleys and tensioners during installation umbilical cables are installed by launching vessels pipe laying support vessels plsvs fig 8 illustrates a plsv used for the installation of umbilical cables these vessels receive reeled umbilical cables and release them through tensioners the minimum radial compression on the tensioners is that required to maintain the set suspended when it is released this minimum grip should be ensured by the tensioner throughout the operation of release and for that a nominal value is set required crushing load the maximum value maximum crushing load is twice the difference between the nominal radial compression and minimum radial compression according to batrony et al 2012 it is important that these crush load limits are defined realistically and derived using verifiably accurate methods this requires fundamental understanding of the internal components failure modes subject to crush loading and analysis tools which are calibrated against actual test data batrony et al 2012 presented a preliminary study comparing experimental results with fea simulations on a sample steel tube umbilical under crush loading the minimum radial compression required in tensioners is function of the load being transferred the lower dynamic friction coefficient between the external coating and tensioner shoe structure the length of the tensioner and the number of tensioners which will be effectively employed the maximum radial compression specified design crushing load is dependent on the active traction because this could end up stretching the wires of the armour and inducing the effect of crushing squeeze in the inner layers dieumegard and fellows 2003 describe the design and installation of a deepwater metallic tube umbilical and give reference to the total length of tensioner required to install it under several water depths and umbilical weights as shown on fig 9 the total length of tensioner required to install an umbilical in ultra deepwater can be significant umbilical sections are submitted to radial compression when passing through tensioners and launching wheel and these loadings can cause significant bending in the internal components of the umbilical in addition the tensile armor submits the functional elements to mechanical pressure inducing ovalizations in the umbilical hoses rabelo 2013 concludes that it is essential to launch the umbilical cable with the hydraulic hoses completely full of hydraulic fluid to avoid hose failure rabelo 2013 describes a study of petrobras about the main causes of failures in umbilicals installed in production wells this study compiled installation and inspection reports of the company publications of other operators and consultation to umbilicals manufacturers in order to catalog the major non compliances that occurred in this equipment major cataloged failures include a cracks in the outer jacket nucleation and propagation of cracks in high density polyethylene hdpe b ripples loss of functionality of internal components due to non uniform stress distribution during the passage through plsv tensioners c kinks umbilical twist generating balancing loss d offset of the external sheath in hdpe offset of the outer jacket allowing exposure of the tensile armour e tensile armour wire break break of the wire in the welding region these failures illustrated in fig 10 occurred because of manufacturing defects handling or design fitness to supplier manufacturing facilities according to rabelo 2013 the problems caused by handling installation and operation are closely linked to hydraulic hoses failures these hoses have low resistance to collapse and this failure mode appears as the main cause of umbilical failures experienced the collapse is manifested by gradual increase of ovalization in hose section after some loading cycles such crease leads the hose to burst fig 11 illustrates the failure of a hydraulic hose due to the hydraulic hoses limitation to external pressure from 150 to 200 psi it was established as prerequisite and design premise that the umbilical installation in any depth must be made under internally pressurized hoses and no air inside the presence of air or other compressible fluid allows the development of creases and deformation ovality that result in hose failure rabelo 2013 reported a true case of umbilical cable hydraulic hose failure it corresponds to a gtx 443 injection well in water depths of 1181 m connecting the platform p 93 by a five functions electro hydraulic umbilical containing five hydraulic hoses of 3 8 the leakage of the hydraulic fluid driven in four of the five hoses was identified after valve control loss one of these hoses was dissected and the combination of external and internal pressure was identified as the most probable failure reason according to rabelo 2013 the main findings about the hoses failure were rupture of the polyurethane outer jacket burst aspect in the aramid layer extensive crease along sample length nylon 11 liner showing yellow coloration fig 12 shows a dissected hose and illustrates the failure aspect by burst almeida et al 2013 also conducted a study on hydraulic hoses failure due to pressure loads the authors proposed a new arrange to umbilical internal components aiming to reduce the applied tensile load on hoses to this end numerical fe analyses as well experimental tests were conducted according to this study due to the helical configuration of the tensile armour part of the applied load is transferred as pressure on the intermediate layers which can lead to the crushing of the internal components of the umbilical electrical cables hydraulic hoses etc from the numerical results the authors realized that the hoses were the components with higher tension levels during dynamic tests they suggested modifications of the umbilical cross section to reduce tensile levels by changing the mobility of internal components hydraulic hoses and electrical cables the simulation of the new cross section arrange demonstrated that it behaves inversely to the older one in which the electrical cables were free to move before they come in contact with the inner sheath with the new cross section arrange the hoses were made free to move which caused a reduction of about 53 in the maximum stress additionally the stresses became better distributed and symmetric in contrast to the older arrange where some regions of stress concentration were observed recently drumond et al 2016 studied the failure of umbilicals hydraulic hoses due to pressure loads and proposed an alternative material for the manufacture of the hose inner layer the authors based their work on the comparison between the material currently used polyamide 11 and a fluorinated elastomer viton to compare the mechanical behavior of both materials uniaxial tensile tests as well as nonlinear fe simulations were performed the numerical results obtained showed that both polyamide 11 and viton did not fail under external pressure however polyamide 11 concentrates high plastic deformations after collapse which can lead to localized hose rupture under internal pressure for viton it was found that the material concentrates deformations during collapse but they are recovered when internal pressure is applied to propose the replacement of polyamide 11 by viton it was showed that the latter has chemical compatible with the hydraulic fluid then ageing tests under temperature were conducted to check if the polymer loose mass swell and preserve its mechanical properties drumond et al 2016 after ageing it was found that the changes in mechanical properties were not severe as well as the swelling and mass loss effects a previous work legallais et al 1993 reported another failure mode on umbilicals hydraulic hoses the ability of some fluids and gases to permeate the hose layers despite of being small permeation rate at large distances leads to loss of significant fluid volume legallais et al 1993 based their research on a fluid commonly injected in wells the methanol a new material based on cross linked polyethylene was developed in order to replace polyamide 11 or thermoplastic polyester inner layer of hydraulic hoses for these materials methanol permeation rates vary with temperature from 150 to 5 g m2 mm dia for polyester and from 190 to 13 g m2 mm dia for polyamide 11 legallais et al 1993 have developed a specific degree of cross linked high density polyethylene named ducoflex such material is applicable to methanol injection or other fluids and can replace polyamide 11 or thermoplastic polyester at temperatures up to 90 c 5 conclusions this paper aims at reporting a literature review on failure events experienced by the oil and gas industry concerning pipelines risers and umbilical cables pipelines are structures widely used in oil and gas production facilities and occasionally may fail leading to hydrocarbons releases in the past ten years three hundred offshore pipeline incidents happened and seventy one of them involved hydrocarbon releases aljaroudi et al 2015 these numbers are relevant and pointed out the need of deeper studies about the causes of these structural failures the main failure modes experienced by pipelines during production are identified as mechanical damage impact or accidental damage external and or internal corrosion construction defect material or mechanical failure natural hazards and fatigue taking into account the failure events reported impact is indicated as the most frequent cause of failure modes representing 56 of the incidents in the north sea another relevant failure mode is associated with internal corrosion which represents 31 of the incidents in the us internal corrosion is mostly explained by microbiologically induced corrosion mic or by ingress of co2 traces combined with h2s facing these statistics further studies and analysis addressing impact and corrosion failures in pipelines are strongly recommended for future studies additionally pipe buckling and overbending can result from longitudinal compressive stresses caused by an increase of temperature combined with the presence of soil friction or constrained ends simonsen 2014 concerning the pipeline seabed interaction under waves and or currents a vast review of published researches is presented by fredsøe 2016 including three issues scour liquefaction and lateral stability of pipelines the process of scour around a pipeline is dependent on the pipeline seabed interaction which is influenced by the movement of the pipeline due to bending along the scour process when the pipe is located in a free span it may vibrate as a result of waves and or current sumer et al 1989 shen et al 2000 zhao and cheng 2010 which causes an additional pulsating flow around the pipe leading to an expansion of the scoured bed profile noncohesive soil in the seabed exposed to waves may undergo liquefaction when pipelines placed on the seabed may sink if their submerged density is higher than the liquefied soil density similarly buried pipelines may float to the bed surface when their submerged density is lower than that of the surrounding liquefied soil fredsøe 2016 in terms of flow pipe soil interaction mechanism advances were shown by gao et al 2002 2007 and teh et al 2003 gao et al 2002 identified three characteristic stages in the process of pipe lateral instability a onset of sand scour b pipe rocking and c pipe breakout rigid risers can be split into top tensioned risers ttr and steel catenary risers scr the main failure incidents to the former occur in workover drilling operations the main failure modes associated are drilling induced vibration fatigue and riser wear due to contact with the drill string even though steel catenary risers are not widely used they are a very attractive option for deeper waters however they are very sensitive to cyclic loadings and consequently susceptible to fatigue failure there are two critical fatigue areas in these structures the vessel hang off point and the touchdown point where the bending moment is the highest it can be noticed from literature review that few studies about failure in rigid risers were accomplished according to hokstad et al 2010 approximately 85 of floating systems risers are of flexible pipe type this is a huge number which deserves high attention to possible failures modes considering their wide application by industry after a comprehensive literature review some failure modes were identified collapse burst tensile rupture compressive rupture overbending torsional rupture fatigue erosion and corrosion although flexible risers may fail in different ways collapse due to external pressure was reported as the most frequent failure mode failure cases involving tensile armors rupture and burst were also reported the paper also discussed failures in umbilical cables bryant 1990 reported failures due to tension or compression torsion fatigue wear and sheaving the last one is a frequent failure mechanism associated with the use of static sheaves such as curved plates during umbilical installation another author rabelo 2013 cataloged the major non compliances that occurred in umbilical cables such as cracks in the outer jacket ripples kinks offset of the external sheath and tensile armour wire break these failure modes are widely covered by the industry with a lot of studies and projects aiming to mitigate or solve the related problems although the readers may be concerned about the failure mechanisms of the reported structures it is not possible to explore them in a single article here the aim is to bring a general view of the documented failures so that the reader can go in deep from the mentioned references from the analyzed structures some key factors should be highlighted in view of the reported failures i e water depth structure complexity and environmental conditions the increasing water depth potentially makes the installation and operation of such structures more dangerous since the involved loads are higher i e axial tension external pressure bending and torsion most of the reported failures are directly related to conditions of extreme loads or combinations of them structural complexity also increases the mechanical response modes and so far the failure possibilities it is clear that the multi layered pipes and cables present much more failure mechanisms than single wall structures certainly there are hundreds of publications addressing these different failure mechanisms and the readers are encouraged to access them finally the environmental conditions are always harmful for such engineering structures they can be corrosive chemically aggressive dynamical causing fatigue and sometimes extreme within severe weather conditions because of this the design installation and operation of pipelines risers and umbilicals will be always a challenging task acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from qpi brasil petróleo ltda anp r d program during

23677,in this study detailed information about the fundamentals energy and power potentials devices technologies installed capacities annual generation and future of ocean energy sources tidal wave temperature and salinity gradients are given as an up to date global review detailed analysis showed that aggregate global annual potential of different ocean energy sources is significantly greater than our global annual electricity demand as a result many countries around the globe aim to utilise ocean energy sources for power generation however this is currently not possible on a large scale because most of the ocean energy technologies are still under development and there are many economic technical and environmental problems to be solved therefore the research and development in ocean energy engineering should be fostered by governments and private sector around the globe so that we can use these reliable and clean renewable energy sources for supplying our increasing global electricity demand finally this study could offer some assistance to the academia and industry for the utilisation of different ocean energy sources for achieving a sustainable future keywords energy ocean osmotic thermal tidal wave 1 introduction in the second half of the 20th century there was a general belief that the 21st century would be the age of nuclear and renewable energy sources melikoglu 2017a 2014 however as of today most of global electricity is still being generated from fossil fuels valente et al 2017 besides the economic burdens fossil fuel consumption pollute the environment and accelerate global warming lonngren and bai 2008 the share of fossil fuels in global electricity generation is simply immense according to the united states u s energy information administration eia international energy outlook 2016 ieo2016 nearly 67 2 of global net electricity generation was supplied from fossil fuels coal petroleum and natural gas in the year 2012 eia 2017a according to the same study the share of renewable energy sources were only 21 9 of global net electricity generation eia 2017a this means slightly more than one fifth of global electricity generation was supplied from renewable energy sources in the year 2012 details of global net electricity generation in 2012 is shown in fig 1 eia 2017a as a note of caution values are calculated based on the data for 5 energy sources groups coal natural gas nuclear petroleum renewable energy sources renewable energy sources have huge economic and environmental benefits el farra and christofides 2017 he et al 2016 hua et al 2016 noel 2017 they are regenerative resources and do not deplete over time hil baky et al 2017 there is an immense potential for renewable energy sources which are abundant and diverse around the globe therefore if utilised properly renewable energy sources could eventually provide energy security for countries around the globe reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help us tackle may be stop global warming which is one of the key global problems of the 21st century as a result there is a global trend of using more renewable energy sources and it is expected that the share of renewable energy sources in global electricity generation will increase in the next decades melikoglu 2017b according to the ieo2016 reference case renewable energy sources are the fastest growing source of electricity generation and in the year 2040 nearly 29 2 of global net electricity generation is projected to be supplied from renewable energy sources eia 2017a although this sounds promising it also means that renewable energy sources still would not dominate global electricity market in the next 25 years ieo2016 shows that in the year 2040 nearly 58 5 of global net electricity generation is projected to be supplied from fossil fuels coal petroleum and natural gas eia 2017a it simply means that the share of renewable energy sources would still be smaller than one third of global net electricity generation and more than half of global net electricity generation would still be supplied from fossil fuels in the year 2040 details of global net electricity generation projection for 2040 is given in fig 2 eia 2017a again as a note of caution values are calculated based on the aforementioned data for 5 energy sources groups biomass geothermal hydroelectric hydropower ocean marine solar and wind are different types of renewable energy sources ct 2017 in 2017 hydropower wind solar geothermal and biomass are currently used in different parts of the world at commercial scale however progress in the commercialization of ocean energy is much slower than other renewable energy sources this is because the technology for the exploitation of ocean energy sources is still mostly under development and there are a number of challenges standing between the sector s current status and the aim of commercial utilisation adrian de andres et al 2017a b according to the international energy agency iea ocean power can be exploited using the following five different technologies i tidal rise and fall barrages ii tidal ocean currents iii waves iv temperature gradients and v salinity gradients iea 2017a out of these five technologies so far focus has been mostly given to tidal and wave power i iii whereas technological development for the iv temperature and v salinity gradients remained behind this is also reflected to the number of publications in the literature according to the iea 2016 medium term renewable energy market report global ocean energy power capacity in the year 2014 was nearly 530 mw and it was predicted that this could reach to 640 mw by the year 2021 iea 2017a this is almost negligible when compared with global installed capacities of other renewable energy sources for example in the year 2014 global total installed solar photovoltaic pv capacity was nearly 180 000 mw bp 2017 this clearly shows the lag in technological and concurrent capacity development of ocean energy sources aforementioned lag is not related to the energy potential of oceans on the contrary there is a great potential of renewable energy that is stored in oceans khan et al 2017 more than 70 of earth s surface is covered by oceans ressurreição et al 2011 and they act as the largest solar collectors and capture thermal energy from the sun khan et al 2017 gravitational pull of the moon drives tides and wind generates ocean waves energy 2013a compared to other renewable energy sources ocean energy sources have a number of important advantages that include abundance homma 1985 availability high load factor benbouzid et al 2017 lower environmental impact should be validated again when commercial utilisation increases hammar et al 2017 and source predictability yaakob et al 2016 in a recent study the theoretical annual potential of marine ocean energy is reported between 4 and 18 million tonnes of oil equivalent toe per annum derakhshan et al 2017 the global deployment potential of ocean power is estimated to be 337 gw and over 885 twh of electricity could be generated from this potential annually a de andres et al 2017a b in another study global marine energy potential is estimated 32 tw wahyudie et al 2017 khan and colleagues reported around the globe ocean energy sources have the following potentials tidal 800 twh per annum osmotic 2000 twh per annum wave between 8000 and 80 000 twh per annum and thermal sources are between 10 000 and 87 600 twh per annum potential total of which is significantly greater than global electricity demand of 16 000 twh per annum valid for the year when that study was conducted khan et al 2017 finally according to the iea ocean energy systems technology collaboration programme oes tcp if worldwide deployment could be achieved different ocean energy technologies could supply current global electricity demand of close to 20 000 twh valid for the year when that study was conducted iea 2017b as stated above technological development is the key parameter for the exploitation of ocean energy sources therefore in order to accelerate the research and technological development in the field of ocean energy an up to date solid review about the fundamentals energy and power potentials devices technologies that can be used for the exploitation and future of different ocean energy sources is urgently required by the academia and industry as a result this paper is prepared with the intention of providing this information the focus will be given mostly on tidal and wave energy sources since much of the work in the field of ocean energy is focused on these two sources in sections 2 and 3 information in the published literature about tidal and wave energy will be scrutinised after that in section 4 concise facts about temperature and salinity gradients will be given since the information about these two is lesser in the published literature finally the conclusions drawn from this analysis will be given in last section of this paper 2 tidal energy 2 1 fundamentals of tidal energy tidal energy is a type of renewable of energy which is classified under ocean marine energy the elevation differences between high and low tides can be used for electricity generation polis et al 2017 tidal energy appears in two forms tidal potential energy and tidal current energy soleimani et al 2015 there are different technologies being developed to harness the energy stored in tides polis et al 2017 tidal potential energy is generally extracted by constructing a dam or barrage along an estuary or river whereas tidal current energy is generally extracted using different types of turbines soleimani et al 2015 or fences overall tidal energy presents high energy density low environmental impact and high predictability el tawil et al 2017 tidal energy was first used in europe to operate grain mills more than a 1000 years ago eia 2017b today it is mainly used for electricity generation however a tidal range of at least 10 feet or 3 05 m is required for economically feasible power generation eia 2017b for tidal energy the potential power p is essentially proportional to the square of the water head difference h 2 facilitated between the upstream and downstream sides of the impoundment and the impounded wetted plan surface area a as shown in equation 1 angeloudis et al 2016 kadiri et al 2014 1 p a h 2 the instantaneous power of a tidal stream can be expressed using equation 2 bahaj 2011 chen et al 2015 iyer et al 2013 neill et al 2016 2 p 1 2 c p ρ a u 3 in equation 2 p is power in watt w c p is the device efficiency or power coefficient ρ is density of water which is approximately 1025 kg m3 a is cross sectional area of flow intercepted by the device or swept area in m2 u is current velocity in m s bahaj 2011 chen et al 2015 iyer et al 2013 neill et al 2016 it is a widely known fact that many renewable energy sources have an intermittent nature tidal currents are an exception to this tides are considered as highly predictable energy sources chen and liu 2017 because they are generated by the astronomical oscillatory gravitational forces and their sinusoidal character create an advantage over other renewable energy sources like ocean waves solar and wind marta almeida et al 2017 the earth sun and earth moon systems generate the astronomical tide baker 1991 which is triggered by gravitational forces together with the rotation of the earth lewis et al 2017 tidal energy source also have high load factors chen and liu 2017 tidal power is generated directly from the sheer power of moving water this is similar to wind energy although most of the time water flows at much lower speeds than wind its density nearly 800 times denser than air generates huge amounts power as a result of this high energy density and high reliability marine ocean tidal resource become a hot global research topic for the academia and industry baker 1991 sheng et al 2017 resource assessment and energy potential should be clear and well documented for better understanding of tidal energy sources around the globe global tidal power potential is estimated at nearly 2 5 tw bahaj 2011 bai et al 2016 global total tidal energy potential is estimated at between 500 and 1000 twh per annum bahaj 2011 bai et al 2016 hammons 1993 stephen j sangiuliano 2017a b global technically harvestable tidal power from areas close to the coast is estimated at nearly 1 terawatts tw and the potential for tidal current technologies is estimated to be larger than for tidal range barrage irena 2014a after global total information country wise information about tidal power and energy potentials found from a detailed literature review is given in the following paragraphs it has been estimated that china s theoretical tidal power generating capacity can be up to 1 1 108 kw there are 242 potential tidal energy barrage dam sites available with installed capacities from 200 to 1000 kw with a total capacity of 12 3 104 kw and with a total energy output capacity of 3 05 108 kwh per annum lee et al 2017 it has been estimated that china s tidal power resource potential can be up to 190 gw and 38 5 gw of this potential is available for development lee et al 2017 according to zheng and co workers theoretical mean power of tidal stream energy in china is more than 8 2 gw and much of this power could come from zhoushan islands in zhejiang province zheng et al 2015 liu and co workers estimated the tidal current energy potential in china as nearly 61 3 twh per annum liu et al 2011 a significant number of estuaries in the united kingdom uk have a high tidal range and present strong tidal currents thus providing the opportunity for building and operating tidal farms for power generation garcia oliva et al 2017 globally the first leased sites for tidal stream generation is the pentland firth and orkney waters pfow in the uk commin et al 2017 the pentland firth is one of the most promising areas for tidal stream energy development around the globe and the power potential is estimated at between 1 and 18 gw draper et al 2014 fairley et al 2015 the uk s theoretical tidal stream tidal range barrage schemes and tidal range lagoon schemes potentials are estimated as 95 twh year 32 gw 96 twh year 45 gw and 25 twh year 14 gw respectively the crown estate 2012 in 2011 the carbon trust s marine energy accelerator mea program pinpointed that tidal energy devices under development could practically and economically capture nearly 21 twh of tidal energy per annum from the uk waters carbon trust 2011 in the same study technical tidal current resource for waters around great britain northern ireland and the channel islands is estimated as nearly 29 twh per annum carbon trust 2011 o rourke and colleagues estimated theoretical tidal current energy resource for ireland as 230 twh per annum o rourke et al 2010 grabbe and co workers estimated theoretical tidal energy potential of norway by analysing 104 sites as 17 twh per annum grabbe et al 2009 tidal electric energy generation potential of the united states is estimated to be nearly 250 twh per annum nrel 2016 tang et al 2014 as can be seen from the literature review given above there is an immense tidal energy resource potential around the globe consequently for the conversion of this potential into electricity devices are required by the energy industry there are mainly three types of tidal energy technologies converters i tidal barrages or dams ii tidal turbines and iii tidal fences eia 2017b energy 2013b details of which will be explained in the next subsection 2 2 devices for the exploitation of tidal energy 2 2 1 tidal barrages or dams a tidal barrage can produce electricity via construction of a dam in an estuary or basin that can harness the energy between high and low tides polis et al 2017 around the globe and specifically in asia europe and north america experimentations to extract energy from large estuaries or oceans have been carried for decades since the opening of first tidal power plant in the rance river mouth france in 1966 marta almeida et al 2017 this site is known as rance tidal power station and it has peak capacity of 240 mw angeloudis et al 2016 currently most tidal energy generation originates from marine tidal barrages built between 1966 and 2011 which make use of bidirectional tidal flows alvarez et al 2016 there are different modes of operation of a tidal barrage ebb only one way flood only one way and flood ebb two way kadiri et al 2014 there are several operational tidal barrages around the globe the sihwa lake tidal power station in south korea has the largest electricity generation capacity at 254 mw la rance tidal power plant in france has 240 mw of electricity generation capacity the tidal power plant in annapolis royal in nova scotia canada is the next largest with an electricity generation capacity of 20 mw the jiangxia tidal power plant which is located in zhejiang province of china is in operation since 1980 and it has an installed capacity of nearly 4 1 mw li and pan 2017 russia and south korea also have smaller tidal power plants alvarez et al 2016 eia 2017b putting the power benefits aside tidal barrages or dams have high construction costs and they have considerable environmental impacts alvarez et al 2016 because a large scale tidal barrage which can generate large amounts of electricity has the potential to modify the characteristics of an estuary such as altering the tidal flushing regime to an extent which depends on the mode of operation of the barrage kadiri et al 2014 it has been reported that globally tidal barrages diminish aquatic habitat connectivity and limit fish movements specifically for diadromous migrating species silva et al 2017 also tidal barrages or dams are site specific technologies location must be fixed which limits its global deployment as a result of these size cost location and environmental problems nowadays the tidal energy industry is moving to adopt tidal turbines as a viable global alternative consequently details of tidal turbines will be explained in the next subsection 2 2 2 tidal turbines there are different nomenclature and abbreviations in the literature about tidal turbines and associated energy terms and this might create an ambiguity for the readers to understand this topic more clearly in this section these different identifications and abbreviations will be explained for starters tidal current turbines and tidal stream turbines can be used synonymously in the literature however the source publication should be clearly read to understand that the tidal stream or tidal current energy represents energy generation from tidal resource without building a barrage or dam and directly using the tidal current stream for power generation using energy converting devices turbines also in some studies tidal current or marine current energy can be used interchangeably chen and lam 2014 hence the associated terms marine current turbine also known as a hydro kinetic turbine goude and lundin 2017 and tidal current turbine can sometimes be used in the same way yet again the source publication should be clearly read to understand that these refer to technologies that utilise the kinetic energy originated from tidal driven marine currents to generate electricity rahimian et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 tidal current energy turbines can harness the energy generated when elevation differences between high and low tides produce strong currents similar to wind energy to produce electricity polis et al 2017 tidal current turbines tcts are emerging renewable energy technologies which operate to extract kinetic energy from the lateral movement of tides in locations with considerable tidal velocities stephen joseph sangiuliano 2017a b other nomenclature is also used for tcts in the literature such as tidal stream turbines tsts morris et al 2016 tidal energy converters tecs gunawan et al 2014 and tidal stream generators tsgs markus et al 2013 tcts can be grouped as horizontal axis turbines hats and vertical axis turbines vats sheng et al 2016 other nomenclature is also used for hats in the literature such as horizontal axis tidal turbine hatt concept priegue and stoesser 2017 horizontal axis tidal stream turbine hatst seo et al 2016 for vats the following nomenclature is also used vertical axis tidal turbines vatt priegue and stoesser 2017 according to priegue and stoesser hatt concept is widely used by tidal developers mainly due to its fairly simple operating principle and high efficiency 35 priegue and stoesser 2017 on the other hand vats can reach higher torque at a lower tip speed ratio and lower current velocity range which makes them auspicious in weak current conditions sheng et al 2016 xu and co workers stated that horizontal axis tidal current turbine hatct is considered to be one of the most promising amongst various tidal current energy devices xu et al 2016 the selection between hatt and vat depends mostly on the site specific conditions the platform of tidal current power station tcps is used to support generators turbines and other equipment tools and there are different types of tcps platforms which can be classified as i floating moored systems ii pile mounted systems and iii sea bed mounted gravity based systems sheng et al 2016 sheng and co workers clearly explained the advantages of these different tcps as follows i the floating moored systems are easy to install and remove have simpler maintenance schedules and more preferable at locations where sea bed is mostly stone and sea conditions are deeper ii the pile mounted system is practical for deep water conditions 30 60 m and the structure is very rigid and iii the sea bed system is fit for shallow water where the effects from wave and wind are minimal sheng et al 2016 tidal resources can be used for power generation in the scale of a few kilowatts kw by mini power stations with turbines or in the scale of multi megawatt mw tidal power farms pacheco et al 2014 a tidal farm is a cluster of inter connected tidal turbines that work together in the same locale and follow a shared control law elie et al 2017 for these farms 3 different scales can be taken into account for the study of tidal turbines which are i the scale of the tidal turbine itself ii the scale of the tidal turbine farm and iii the regional scale elie et al 2017 it has been reported that farms consisting of hundreds of tidal stream turbines have the potential to produce hundreds of megawatts electricity with high predictability funke et al 2016 however these farms must be prudently designed in order to be economically feasible and designers must consider the following two important parameters first the positions of the turbines and then the number of turbines making up the farm funke et al 2016 tidal turbines are subject to bio fouling cavitation problems sedimentation issues wave effects and experience different reynolds number re regimes and stall characteristics liu et al 2017 consequently tidal turbines must be designed as robust and reliable enough to withstand normal operating loads along with the occasional harsh sea conditions liu et al 2017 in addition knowledge about the influence of tidal energy devices to the marine benthic environment is particularly inadequate broadhurst and orme 2014 therefore extensive research must be carried out to understand the long term effects of these devices to the benthic environment in order to advance understanding the power extracting mechanism from a tidal turbine and interaction effects between flow and a turbine flow field measurements must be carried out in the wake behind a turbine seo et al 2016 tidal turbine technology is still developing with focus on different factors such as environment hydrodynamics and operation pacheco and ferreira 2016 it has been reported that with the current technology 1st generation tidal stream energy devices require spring peak tide velocities sv in excess of nearly 2 5 m s and water depths in the range between 25 and 50 m iyer et al 2013 lewis et al 2015 currently tidal stream energy projects are not profitable enough therefore public subsidisation methods such as feed in tariffs fit can play a decisive role in the development of tidal stream energy until it can be solely funded privately vazquez and iglesias 2015a in order to reduce the costs and enhance operational flexibility a tidal turbine should perform evenly for bi directional flow and there are various efforts to design such a tidal turbine micha premkumar and chatterjee 2015 finally it should be emphasized that tidal stream energy projects are not likely to be fully commercialized unless they are proven to be economically feasible vazquez and iglesias 2015b it is suggested that these economic problems should be solved in the near future for this promising technology to be commercialized in a recent study zhou and co workers listed the following companies which have pilot marine current turbine mct farms that will become operation in the following years dcns edf meygen mct atlantis resources andritz hydro hammerfest ahh sabella ge alstom energy zhou et al 2017 therefore the readers could also check the websites of these companies to have an up to date commercial information about the progress on marine tidal current turbine technologies 2 2 3 tidal fences a tidal fence system is composed of vertical axis turbines which are mounted in a fence or a row that is placed on the sea bed energy 2013b similar to tidal turbines the water passing through the turbines in a tidal fence system generates electricity eia 2017b as the end of 2016 there are no operational tidal fence projects around the globe eia 2017b 2 3 current tidal and wave energy capacity and generation around the world according to the international renewable energy agency irena in the year 2012 total tidal range deployment was nearly 514 mw and tidal current deployment was nearly 6 mw of which nearly 5 mw was deployed in the uk irena 2014a the eia also provides information about tidal and wave energy aspects of ocean energy global tide and wave energy capacity and generation based on data from the eia are given in tables 1 and 2 respectively eia 2017c since the eia reports global tide and wave energy capacities and generation together data given in tables 1 and 2 includes cumulative tide and wave data hence the titling of this subsection 2 3 includes the wave term here it should be emphasized that these tables will also be used when wave energy is scrutinised in section 3 as can be seen from table 1 total tide and wave energy capacity of the world in the year 2014 was nearly 2730 mw eia 2017c here it should be emphasized that this value is more than the global ocean energy capacity for the same year 530 mw iea 2017a reported by the iea at the end of section 1 and by definition ocean energy encompasses tidal and wave energy therefore these values should be cross checked by the iea and the eia authorities for validation since no other up to date information is found from the literature it should be safer to say that global ocean energy capacity was between 500 and 2750 mw in the year 2014 2 4 future of tidal energy currently tidal barrages or dams are considered as established energy technologies that can provide commercial scale electricity the research and development in tidal energy is mostly in the field of tidal turbines and fences it is believed that tidal stream energy might become a fully commercially viable energy source over the next decades and for this to be real complete knowledge on the subject of tidal stream resource assessment is vital ramos and ringwood 2016 currently tidal stream energy projects require high amounts of capital investment vazquez and iglesias 2016 the cost of electricity generation from tidal stream energy resource is much higher than that from traditional energy sources vazquez and iglesias 2015c also there are still uncertainties about environmental impacts of tidal energy device installation and operation on marine inhabitants and birds in the long term koh and ng 2017 mccann and bell 2017 wiesebron et al 2016 these problems must be well understood by the academia and industry if a solution is aimed to be found in the next decades for tidal barrages or dams the future seems brighter since the technology is proven for almost half a century it has been reported that there are extensive plans for tidal barrage projects in india korea the philippines and russia adding up to nearly 115 gw gw and deployment projections for tidal current up to the year 2020 are in the range of 200 mw irena 2014a starting from 2000s two proposals for tidal lagoons in swansea bay which is located in the bristol channel as a part of the severn estuary have appeared in the uk petley and aggidis 2016 currently the swansea bay tidal lagoon is the most advanced project in the uk and it is expected to generate electricity in 2019 waters and aggidis 2016 when constructed it is expected that the swansea bay tidal lagoon would be able to produce a total rated output of nearly 320 mw by using kaplan bulb turbines each producing 16 mw and power nearly 155 000 homes waters and aggidis 2016 it is estimated that nearly 1bn is required the construction of the swansea bay tidal lagoon waters and aggidis 2016 on a larger scale it is proposed that a tidal barrage in the severn estuary could alone generate 5 of the uk s electricity requirements which is equivalent to nearly 2500 offshore wind turbines valid for the year when that study was conducted kadiri et al 2014 however it is estimated that the construction cost of the severn barrage could be nearly 34bn waters and aggidis 2016 for tidal turbine technology the future could also be bright if the aforementioned problems are solved according to the eia stangford lough and uldolmok tidal power stations each have nearly 1 5 mw tidal turbines there is one tidal turbine project is under development in new york and another project is in development in northern scotland with a capacity up to 400 mw eia 2017b to sum up in this section the literature is scrutinised to prepare an up to date review of tidal energy around the globe the study will continue with the analysis of global wave energy resources in the next section 3 wave energy 3 1 fundamentals of wave energy ocean wave energy is one of the most abundant clean frequent renewable periodic and predicted energy sources around the globe which has the potential to compete with the current use of fossil fuels alamian et al 2017 mustapa et al 2017 the wind blowing over the surface of the ocean creates waves and in many areas around the globe wind blows with enough force and consistency to generate continuous waves which contain huge energy potential boem 2017 wave energy can be extracted directly from surface waves or from pressure fluctuations below the surface boem 2017 it has been reported that ocean waves can provide up to 2 terawatts of electricity energy 2013c in swan acronym for simulating waves nearshore swan which is a third generation spectral phased average model used for wave studies developed at delft university

wave power estimates assessing the fluctuation of encountered energy levels lavidas and venugopal 2017b according to falnes per unit area of sea surface a stored energy amounts to an average as shown in equation 6 falnes 2007 in equation 6 e is stored energy associated with the wave per unit area of sea surface ρ is the density of sea water which is nearly 1030 kg m3 g is the acceleration of

should be clear and well documented for better understanding of wave energy sources around the globe it has been reported that north western coast of the united states particularly alaska northern canada western coasts of scotland southern africa and australia have abundant wave power resource potential boem 2017 global wave power potential is estimated to be between 1 and 10 tw and annual wave energy is estimated to reach nearly 93 000 twh per annum mustapa et al 2017 the global power potential of waves that hit all coasts around the globe is estimated to be nearly 1 tw however if wave energy is harvested on open oceans then the global wave power input is estimated to be nearly 10 tw which is comparable with the current global power consumption valid for the year when that study was conducted falnes 2007 falnes and løvseth 1991 other researchers estimated global wave energy potential as 2 tw wahyudie et al 2017 according to the irena global theoretical wave energy potential could be up to 29 500 twh per annum irena 2014b after total global information the following country wise information about wave energy potentials are found from the detailed review of the literature in the united states electric generation from waves could amount to more than 1170 twh per annum which is almost one third of the 4000 twh of electricity used in the united states each year valid for the year when that study was conducted nrel 2016 the united states naturally available and technically recoverable wave energy resources are given in table 3 nrel 2016 estimates of total wave energy resource hitting the uk waters change between 250 and 600 twh per annum whereas the carbon trust s practical wave energy resource estimate is 50 twh per annum carbon trust 2011 whereas in another study the uk s theoretical wave energy potential is estimated as 69 twh year 27 gw the crown estate 2012 australia north west coast of the north america south america south coast of africa and west coast of europe are high density wave energy coast lines with maximum power capacity potentials up to 90 kw per meter of the coast line younesian and alam 2017 following the global information about wave energy resource potentials in the following subsection details of the devices that can be used for electricity generation from waves will be explained 3 2 devices for the exploitation wave energy ocean wave energy conversion devices can be used nearshore offshore and far offshore locations boem 2017 a number of wave energy converter wec prototypes are being developed around the globe due to the increasing interest in ocean wave energy lettenmaier et al 2017 basically wave energy conversion consists of two steps first wave energy is converted into mechanical energy and then mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy through generators kim et al 2017 do and co workers explained the main working principle of a wave energy converter as follows wave energy is converted into a high pressure hydraulic on using a wave energy converter then this energy is used to drive a hydraulic motor which is coaxially connected to an electric generator do et al 2017 hydraulic power take off mechanism or commonly known as the power take off pto is the name given to the mechanism by which energy is transferred from waves to the wave energy converter and directly or subsequently into the useful form do et al 2017 in the 20th century many wave energy converters with different power take off systems have been developed c liang et al 2017b some of those devices included air turbines hydroelectric components and linear electromagnetic motors c liang et al 2017b according to alamian and colleagues currently there are nearly 80 wave energy conversion technologies and wave energy conversion systems which can be grouped based on installation on the coast sea or seabed alamian et al 2014 wave energy conversion systems can also be grouped into four major categories attenuators oscillating water columns overtopping systems and point absorbers which are explained in detail below alamian et al 2014 clément et al 2002 do et al 2017 falcão 2010 mora et al 2017 mustapa et al 2017 i attenuator systems are adjusted parallel to the incident wave to face it and gradually harness energy from it noad and porter 2017 anaconda pelamis salter duck and wave star are existing attenuator type wave energy converters alamian et al 2014 ii oscillating water column owc systems are made of a floating or fixed hollow configuration which is open to the water below the surface falcão et al 2017 owc systems consist of a compartment encompassing a water column subjected to the stroke of incident waves and an air pocket alternatively compressed and expanded by the motion of generated water column oscillations malara et al 2017 the confined air is forced to pass through a turbine which is combined to an electrical generator falcão et al 2017 in most designs the turbines rotational direction remains same irrespective of the air flow direction which means they are self rectifying falcão et al 2017 falcão and henriques 2016 malara et al 2017 it is estimated that these devices produce an averaged power between 15 and 25 kw m per annum alamian et al 2014 limpet mighty whale oceanlinx osprey and pico plant are amongst the existing oscillating water column type of wave energy converters alamian et al 2014 also according to liu the owc systems have the highest chance of commercialization amongst different types of wave energy conversion systems liu 2016 iii overtopping systems simply be made up of a barrier over which the waves overtop and the overtopped water is entrapped in a reservoir which in turn owing to its head can run a turbine mostly a conventional low head turbine soleimani et al 2015 that generates electricity sannasiraj and sundar 2016 sea wave slot cone generator ssg tapchan and wave dragon are amongst the existing overtopping system type of wave energy converters alamian et al 2014 iv point absorber systems are generally installed in large arrays since they are small compared to the incident wavelength noad and porter 2017 point absorber systems comprise of floating bodies or buoys that are used to extract energy from the motion of waves khojasteh and kamali 2016 aquabuoy canada archimedes buoy scotland biowave australia l10 buoy sweden opt power usa pendulum japan searev france uppsala sweden wavebob usa and waveroller finland are amongst the existing point absorber system type of wave energy converters alamian et al 2014 according to the bureau of ocean energy management boem there are also four types of ocean wave energy conversion devices which may be suitable for deployment on the outer continental shelf ocs boem 2017 these are attenuators overtopping devices point absorbers and terminators boem 2017 this is different than the list given above according to the boem oscillating water column is a form of terminator type of wave energy conversion system boem 2017 by definition terminator type of devices extend perpendicular to the direction of the wave and they capture or reflect the power of the wave for energy generation boem 2017 3 3 current wave energy capacity and generation around the world as explained prior the eia reports cumulative global tide and wave energy capacities and generation and data for this was given in tables 1 and 2 in section 2 3 3 4 future of wave energy similar to tidal turbine technology the costs of wave energy converters are too high when compared to other renewable technologies and this is one of the greatest disadvantages in front of the commercialization of these novel devices contestabile et al 2017 the following improvements are required for large scale commercialization of wave energy converters power take offs are still considered as the most important challenge in ocean wave energy technology which should be solved c liang et al 2017b liu reported that the losses in the energy conversion chain of oscillating water column wave energy converters should be decreased liu 2016 this is not specific to oscillating water column wave energy converters but it must be applied to other types of wave energy converters the service life of the wave energy converter systems should be enhanced especially the service life of mooring lines and power cables used in these systems yang et al 2017 also problems related to fatigue and marine biofouling should be solved yang et al 2017 obtaining precise and consistent wave climate data is one of the key steps in the wave energy resource assessment and this can be solved by numerical modelling using continually standardised data supplied from buoys coastal stations research ships or satellites rusu and onea 2017 finally peak to average power ratio control peak shaving must be enhanced in most wave energy converters henriques et al 2016 yet when these problems are solved the future of wave energy converters could be bright based on ongoing projects just 40 mw of tidal and 26 mw of wave energy total 66 mw of ocean energy are expected to be deployed within the european union by 2018 while the target is to reach an installed capacity of 100 gw ocean energy wave and tidal in europe by 2050 magagna and uihlein 2015 a de andres et al 2017a b vasileiou et al 2017 this clearly shows the sheer amount of work that must be done in the field of wave energy in europe and all around the globe for utilising this clean reliable and abundant renewable energy source in the next decades consequently in this section the literature is scrutinised to prepare an up to date review of wave energy around the globe the study will continue with the analysis of global ocean thermal energy conversion processes and salinity gradients in the next section 4 ocean thermal energy conversion otec processes and salinity gradients temperature gradients exploit the temperature gradient between the sea ocean surface and deep water using different ocean thermal energy conversion otec processes iea 2017a otec systems operate best when the temperature difference between warmer located at top layer of the ocean and colder water deep ocean water is nearly 36 f 20 c energy 2013d according to the united states department of energy office of energy efficiency renewable energy there are 3 kinds of otec systems closed cycle open cycle and hybrid energy 2013d closed cycle otec systems uses a working fluid refrigerant or a low boiling fluid such as ammonia r 134a r 22 or r 32 that runs between two heat exchangers in a closed cycle aydin et al 2014 faizal and ahmed 2013 the working principle of a closed cycle otec systems is as follows low boiling point fluid is vaporised using warm surface sea water which is pumped through a heat exchanger electricity is generated in the turbo generator using the expanding vapour then the vapour is condensed in a second heat exchanger using cold deep seawater and recycled back into the system for the repetition of the cycle aydin et al 2014 energy 2013d etemadi et al 2011 faizal and ahmed 2013 open cycle otec systems the working fluid is a low pressure steam nihous and syed 1997 steam is generated from warm surface water via placing it into a low pressure container here it should be emphasized that the steam is almost pure fresh water because it has left its salt behind in the low pressure container the steam is used to generate electricity via a generator then the steam is condensed by exposure to cold deep ocean water damy and marvaldi 1987 energy 2013d kim et al 2016 nihous and syed 1997 olsson 1982 hybrid otec systems by definition such systems aim to combine the characteristics of closed cycle and open cycle otec systems for a synergistic exploitation of the thermal resource for generation electricity and desalinization of sea water similar to an open cycle evaporation process warm seawater is flash evaporated into steam via letting into a vacuum chamber then similar to a closed cycle loop the steam is used to vaporise a low boiling point fluid which drives a turbine to generate electricity energy 2013d kim et al 2016 2009 soto and vergara 2014 since the 19th century mankind tried to utilise the solar energy collected in the oceans mcgowan 1976 the first demonstration scale otec plant with a design capacity of 22 kw was built in cuba in 1930 by georges claude this was followed by another project built in brazil in 1935 with a design capacity of 2 2 mw however these two otec plants could not become operational and could not provide net power kim et al 2016 vanzwieten et al 2017 the progress on otec technology was on halt until 1979 when a pilot scale otec was installed by natural energy laboratory of the hawaiian authority nelha in hawaii with 50 kw gross power 18 kw net this was followed by another project in 1981 kim et al 2016 vanzwieten et al 2017 in the same year another demonstration scale otec plant was opened in tokyo which had 120 kw gross power 30 kw net uehara et al 1988 vanzwieten et al 2017 in 1993 a land based open cycle otec plant was constructed by nelha with 103 kw net power kim et al 2016 vanzwieten et al 2017 lately in 2015 makai ocean engineering launched the first closed cycle onshore otec power plant with 100 kw generation in north kona hawaii by nelha vanzwieten et al 2017 also an up to date list of currently operational and at design state otec plants are given in a recent publication of osorio and co workers osorio et al 2016 finally according to the irena global otec potential is nearly 300 ej or nearly 83 300 twh per annum irena 2014c salinity gradient energy is also known as osmotic power abbasi garravand et al 2016 salinity gradients exploits the energy associated with the salinity gradient located mostly at the mouth of rivers where freshwater mixes with saltwater using pressure retarded reverse osmosis processes and associated conversion technologies iea 2017a the power released from the osmotic pressure difference between fresh and salty water is called salinity gradient power wick 1978 reverse or reversed electrodialysis can also be used for the exploitation of salinity gradient energy wick 1978 according to the irena global technical and theoretical salinity gradient potentials could be nearly 5200 and 27 700 twh per annum irena 2014d finally it should be emphasized most of the otec and salinity gradient technologies are currently under development iea 2017a therefore more research and development studies should be carried out before wider and commercial utilisation of these technologies 5 conclusion in this study global ocean energy sources are analysed in detail to prepare an up to date technical review the following conclusions are drawn from this study there is an immense energy potential in the oceans detailed analysis of the literature showed that different ocean energy sources have the following global annual potentials tidal nearly 1000 twh bahaj 2011 bai et al 2016 hammons 1993 stephen j sangiuliano 2017a b wave up to 93 000 twh mustapa et al 2017 temperature gradients thermal up to 87 600 twh khan et al 2017 and salinity gradients osmotic between 2000 and 5200 twh or maybe even up to 27 700 twh irena 2014d khan et al 2017 however the literature review also clearly showed that there are significant differences between the ocean energy resource potential estimates in the published literature therefore an up to date global ocean energy resource potential map or database should be prepared by the authorities to avoid future uncertainty in addition as stated in section 2 3 the eia reported that total tide and wave energy capacity of the world in the year 2014 was nearly 2730 mw eia 2017c however this value is much more than the global ocean energy capacity reported by the iea for the same year 530 mw iea 2017a it is known that by definition ocean energy involves tidal and wave energy therefore the author of this study suggests that these values should be cross checked by the iea and the eia authorities for validation since no other up to date information is found from the literature global ocean energy capacity in the year 2014 was reported as between 500 and 2750 mw in this study this is believed to be a crucial finding many countries around the globe aim to utilise ocean energy sources to supply their increasing energy demand in a sustainable manner however as of today technologies to exploit the power of the oceans and seas are still at an early stage of development except tidal barrages or dams and even the most advanced technologies specifically tidal current and ocean wave still encounter substantial problems and obstacles consequently innovation and research and development r d in this field can help overcome those problems uihlein and magagna 2016 as stated above tidal barrages or dams are the only proven technologies however their capacity and site selection is limited also research about the environmental impacts of marine renewable energy devices remains incomplete because many of these devices should be set and tested in the marine environments zangiabadi et al 2017 yet when these problems are solved and the technological development is complete marine ocean energy is expected to provide a significant amount of electricity to our global economy therefore the research and development in ocean energy engineering should fostered by nations with access to these reliable and clean renewable energy sources finally this study could offer some assistance to the academia and industry in the exploitation of different ocean energy sources for achieving a more sustainable future acknowledgements i would like to dedicate this paper to my lovely wife bengi melikoğlu i wish you health i would also like to thank my parents nebile tülay melikoğlu and kazım melikoğlu for their support 
23677,in this study detailed information about the fundamentals energy and power potentials devices technologies installed capacities annual generation and future of ocean energy sources tidal wave temperature and salinity gradients are given as an up to date global review detailed analysis showed that aggregate global annual potential of different ocean energy sources is significantly greater than our global annual electricity demand as a result many countries around the globe aim to utilise ocean energy sources for power generation however this is currently not possible on a large scale because most of the ocean energy technologies are still under development and there are many economic technical and environmental problems to be solved therefore the research and development in ocean energy engineering should be fostered by governments and private sector around the globe so that we can use these reliable and clean renewable energy sources for supplying our increasing global electricity demand finally this study could offer some assistance to the academia and industry for the utilisation of different ocean energy sources for achieving a sustainable future keywords energy ocean osmotic thermal tidal wave 1 introduction in the second half of the 20th century there was a general belief that the 21st century would be the age of nuclear and renewable energy sources melikoglu 2017a 2014 however as of today most of global electricity is still being generated from fossil fuels valente et al 2017 besides the economic burdens fossil fuel consumption pollute the environment and accelerate global warming lonngren and bai 2008 the share of fossil fuels in global electricity generation is simply immense according to the united states u s energy information administration eia international energy outlook 2016 ieo2016 nearly 67 2 of global net electricity generation was supplied from fossil fuels coal petroleum and natural gas in the year 2012 eia 2017a according to the same study the share of renewable energy sources were only 21 9 of global net electricity generation eia 2017a this means slightly more than one fifth of global electricity generation was supplied from renewable energy sources in the year 2012 details of global net electricity generation in 2012 is shown in fig 1 eia 2017a as a note of caution values are calculated based on the data for 5 energy sources groups coal natural gas nuclear petroleum renewable energy sources renewable energy sources have huge economic and environmental benefits el farra and christofides 2017 he et al 2016 hua et al 2016 noel 2017 they are regenerative resources and do not deplete over time hil baky et al 2017 there is an immense potential for renewable energy sources which are abundant and diverse around the globe therefore if utilised properly renewable energy sources could eventually provide energy security for countries around the globe reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help us tackle may be stop global warming which is one of the key global problems of the 21st century as a result there is a global trend of using more renewable energy sources and it is expected that the share of renewable energy sources in global electricity generation will increase in the next decades melikoglu 2017b according to the ieo2016 reference case renewable energy sources are the fastest growing source of electricity generation and in the year 2040 nearly 29 2 of global net electricity generation is projected to be supplied from renewable energy sources eia 2017a although this sounds promising it also means that renewable energy sources still would not dominate global electricity market in the next 25 years ieo2016 shows that in the year 2040 nearly 58 5 of global net electricity generation is projected to be supplied from fossil fuels coal petroleum and natural gas eia 2017a it simply means that the share of renewable energy sources would still be smaller than one third of global net electricity generation and more than half of global net electricity generation would still be supplied from fossil fuels in the year 2040 details of global net electricity generation projection for 2040 is given in fig 2 eia 2017a again as a note of caution values are calculated based on the aforementioned data for 5 energy sources groups biomass geothermal hydroelectric hydropower ocean marine solar and wind are different types of renewable energy sources ct 2017 in 2017 hydropower wind solar geothermal and biomass are currently used in different parts of the world at commercial scale however progress in the commercialization of ocean energy is much slower than other renewable energy sources this is because the technology for the exploitation of ocean energy sources is still mostly under development and there are a number of challenges standing between the sector s current status and the aim of commercial utilisation adrian de andres et al 2017a b according to the international energy agency iea ocean power can be exploited using the following five different technologies i tidal rise and fall barrages ii tidal ocean currents iii waves iv temperature gradients and v salinity gradients iea 2017a out of these five technologies so far focus has been mostly given to tidal and wave power i iii whereas technological development for the iv temperature and v salinity gradients remained behind this is also reflected to the number of publications in the literature according to the iea 2016 medium term renewable energy market report global ocean energy power capacity in the year 2014 was nearly 530 mw and it was predicted that this could reach to 640 mw by the year 2021 iea 2017a this is almost negligible when compared with global installed capacities of other renewable energy sources for example in the year 2014 global total installed solar photovoltaic pv capacity was nearly 180 000 mw bp 2017 this clearly shows the lag in technological and concurrent capacity development of ocean energy sources aforementioned lag is not related to the energy potential of oceans on the contrary there is a great potential of renewable energy that is stored in oceans khan et al 2017 more than 70 of earth s surface is covered by oceans ressurreição et al 2011 and they act as the largest solar collectors and capture thermal energy from the sun khan et al 2017 gravitational pull of the moon drives tides and wind generates ocean waves energy 2013a compared to other renewable energy sources ocean energy sources have a number of important advantages that include abundance homma 1985 availability high load factor benbouzid et al 2017 lower environmental impact should be validated again when commercial utilisation increases hammar et al 2017 and source predictability yaakob et al 2016 in a recent study the theoretical annual potential of marine ocean energy is reported between 4 and 18 million tonnes of oil equivalent toe per annum derakhshan et al 2017 the global deployment potential of ocean power is estimated to be 337 gw and over 885 twh of electricity could be generated from this potential annually a de andres et al 2017a b in another study global marine energy potential is estimated 32 tw wahyudie et al 2017 khan and colleagues reported around the globe ocean energy sources have the following potentials tidal 800 twh per annum osmotic 2000 twh per annum wave between 8000 and 80 000 twh per annum and thermal sources are between 10 000 and 87 600 twh per annum potential total of which is significantly greater than global electricity demand of 16 000 twh per annum valid for the year when that study was conducted khan et al 2017 finally according to the iea ocean energy systems technology collaboration programme oes tcp if worldwide deployment could be achieved different ocean energy technologies could supply current global electricity demand of close to 20 000 twh valid for the year when that study was conducted iea 2017b as stated above technological development is the key parameter for the exploitation of ocean energy sources therefore in order to accelerate the research and technological development in the field of ocean energy an up to date solid review about the fundamentals energy and power potentials devices technologies that can be used for the exploitation and future of different ocean energy sources is urgently required by the academia and industry as a result this paper is prepared with the intention of providing this information the focus will be given mostly on tidal and wave energy sources since much of the work in the field of ocean energy is focused on these two sources in sections 2 and 3 information in the published literature about tidal and wave energy will be scrutinised after that in section 4 concise facts about temperature and salinity gradients will be given since the information about these two is lesser in the published literature finally the conclusions drawn from this analysis will be given in last section of this paper 2 tidal energy 2 1 fundamentals of tidal energy tidal energy is a type of renewable of energy which is classified under ocean marine energy the elevation differences between high and low tides can be used for electricity generation polis et al 2017 tidal energy appears in two forms tidal potential energy and tidal current energy soleimani et al 2015 there are different technologies being developed to harness the energy stored in tides polis et al 2017 tidal potential energy is generally extracted by constructing a dam or barrage along an estuary or river whereas tidal current energy is generally extracted using different types of turbines soleimani et al 2015 or fences overall tidal energy presents high energy density low environmental impact and high predictability el tawil et al 2017 tidal energy was first used in europe to operate grain mills more than a 1000 years ago eia 2017b today it is mainly used for electricity generation however a tidal range of at least 10 feet or 3 05 m is required for economically feasible power generation eia 2017b for tidal energy the potential power p is essentially proportional to the square of the water head difference h 2 facilitated between the upstream and downstream sides of the impoundment and the impounded wetted plan surface area a as shown in equation 1 angeloudis et al 2016 kadiri et al 2014 1 p a h 2 the instantaneous power of a tidal stream can be expressed using equation 2 bahaj 2011 chen et al 2015 iyer et al 2013 neill et al 2016 2 p 1 2 c p ρ a u 3 in equation 2 p is power in watt w c p is the device efficiency or power coefficient ρ is density of water which is approximately 1025 kg m3 a is cross sectional area of flow intercepted by the device or swept area in m2 u is current velocity in m s bahaj 2011 chen et al 2015 iyer et al 2013 neill et al 2016 it is a widely known fact that many renewable energy sources have an intermittent nature tidal currents are an exception to this tides are considered as highly predictable energy sources chen and liu 2017 because they are generated by the astronomical oscillatory gravitational forces and their sinusoidal character create an advantage over other renewable energy sources like ocean waves solar and wind marta almeida et al 2017 the earth sun and earth moon systems generate the astronomical tide baker 1991 which is triggered by gravitational forces together with the rotation of the earth lewis et al 2017 tidal energy source also have high load factors chen and liu 2017 tidal power is generated directly from the sheer power of moving water this is similar to wind energy although most of the time water flows at much lower speeds than wind its density nearly 800 times denser than air generates huge amounts power as a result of this high energy density and high reliability marine ocean tidal resource become a hot global research topic for the academia and industry baker 1991 sheng et al 2017 resource assessment and energy potential should be clear and well documented for better understanding of tidal energy sources around the globe global tidal power potential is estimated at nearly 2 5 tw bahaj 2011 bai et al 2016 global total tidal energy potential is estimated at between 500 and 1000 twh per annum bahaj 2011 bai et al 2016 hammons 1993 stephen j sangiuliano 2017a b global technically harvestable tidal power from areas close to the coast is estimated at nearly 1 terawatts tw and the potential for tidal current technologies is estimated to be larger than for tidal range barrage irena 2014a after global total information country wise information about tidal power and energy potentials found from a detailed literature review is given in the following paragraphs it has been estimated that china s theoretical tidal power generating capacity can be up to 1 1 108 kw there are 242 potential tidal energy barrage dam sites available with installed capacities from 200 to 1000 kw with a total capacity of 12 3 104 kw and with a total energy output capacity of 3 05 108 kwh per annum lee et al 2017 it has been estimated that china s tidal power resource potential can be up to 190 gw and 38 5 gw of this potential is available for development lee et al 2017 according to zheng and co workers theoretical mean power of tidal stream energy in china is more than 8 2 gw and much of this power could come from zhoushan islands in zhejiang province zheng et al 2015 liu and co workers estimated the tidal current energy potential in china as nearly 61 3 twh per annum liu et al 2011 a significant number of estuaries in the united kingdom uk have a high tidal range and present strong tidal currents thus providing the opportunity for building and operating tidal farms for power generation garcia oliva et al 2017 globally the first leased sites for tidal stream generation is the pentland firth and orkney waters pfow in the uk commin et al 2017 the pentland firth is one of the most promising areas for tidal stream energy development around the globe and the power potential is estimated at between 1 and 18 gw draper et al 2014 fairley et al 2015 the uk s theoretical tidal stream tidal range barrage schemes and tidal range lagoon schemes potentials are estimated as 95 twh year 32 gw 96 twh year 45 gw and 25 twh year 14 gw respectively the crown estate 2012 in 2011 the carbon trust s marine energy accelerator mea program pinpointed that tidal energy devices under development could practically and economically capture nearly 21 twh of tidal energy per annum from the uk waters carbon trust 2011 in the same study technical tidal current resource for waters around great britain northern ireland and the channel islands is estimated as nearly 29 twh per annum carbon trust 2011 o rourke and colleagues estimated theoretical tidal current energy resource for ireland as 230 twh per annum o rourke et al 2010 grabbe and co workers estimated theoretical tidal energy potential of norway by analysing 104 sites as 17 twh per annum grabbe et al 2009 tidal electric energy generation potential of the united states is estimated to be nearly 250 twh per annum nrel 2016 tang et al 2014 as can be seen from the literature review given above there is an immense tidal energy resource potential around the globe consequently for the conversion of this potential into electricity devices are required by the energy industry there are mainly three types of tidal energy technologies converters i tidal barrages or dams ii tidal turbines and iii tidal fences eia 2017b energy 2013b details of which will be explained in the next subsection 2 2 devices for the exploitation of tidal energy 2 2 1 tidal barrages or dams a tidal barrage can produce electricity via construction of a dam in an estuary or basin that can harness the energy between high and low tides polis et al 2017 around the globe and specifically in asia europe and north america experimentations to extract energy from large estuaries or oceans have been carried for decades since the opening of first tidal power plant in the rance river mouth france in 1966 marta almeida et al 2017 this site is known as rance tidal power station and it has peak capacity of 240 mw angeloudis et al 2016 currently most tidal energy generation originates from marine tidal barrages built between 1966 and 2011 which make use of bidirectional tidal flows alvarez et al 2016 there are different modes of operation of a tidal barrage ebb only one way flood only one way and flood ebb two way kadiri et al 2014 there are several operational tidal barrages around the globe the sihwa lake tidal power station in south korea has the largest electricity generation capacity at 254 mw la rance tidal power plant in france has 240 mw of electricity generation capacity the tidal power plant in annapolis royal in nova scotia canada is the next largest with an electricity generation capacity of 20 mw the jiangxia tidal power plant which is located in zhejiang province of china is in operation since 1980 and it has an installed capacity of nearly 4 1 mw li and pan 2017 russia and south korea also have smaller tidal power plants alvarez et al 2016 eia 2017b putting the power benefits aside tidal barrages or dams have high construction costs and they have considerable environmental impacts alvarez et al 2016 because a large scale tidal barrage which can generate large amounts of electricity has the potential to modify the characteristics of an estuary such as altering the tidal flushing regime to an extent which depends on the mode of operation of the barrage kadiri et al 2014 it has been reported that globally tidal barrages diminish aquatic habitat connectivity and limit fish movements specifically for diadromous migrating species silva et al 2017 also tidal barrages or dams are site specific technologies location must be fixed which limits its global deployment as a result of these size cost location and environmental problems nowadays the tidal energy industry is moving to adopt tidal turbines as a viable global alternative consequently details of tidal turbines will be explained in the next subsection 2 2 2 tidal turbines there are different nomenclature and abbreviations in the literature about tidal turbines and associated energy terms and this might create an ambiguity for the readers to understand this topic more clearly in this section these different identifications and abbreviations will be explained for starters tidal current turbines and tidal stream turbines can be used synonymously in the literature however the source publication should be clearly read to understand that the tidal stream or tidal current energy represents energy generation from tidal resource without building a barrage or dam and directly using the tidal current stream for power generation using energy converting devices turbines also in some studies tidal current or marine current energy can be used interchangeably chen and lam 2014 hence the associated terms marine current turbine also known as a hydro kinetic turbine goude and lundin 2017 and tidal current turbine can sometimes be used in the same way yet again the source publication should be clearly read to understand that these refer to technologies that utilise the kinetic energy originated from tidal driven marine currents to generate electricity rahimian et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 tidal current energy turbines can harness the energy generated when elevation differences between high and low tides produce strong currents similar to wind energy to produce electricity polis et al 2017 tidal current turbines tcts are emerging renewable energy technologies which operate to extract kinetic energy from the lateral movement of tides in locations with considerable tidal velocities stephen joseph sangiuliano 2017a b other nomenclature is also used for tcts in the literature such as tidal stream turbines tsts morris et al 2016 tidal energy converters tecs gunawan et al 2014 and tidal stream generators tsgs markus et al 2013 tcts can be grouped as horizontal axis turbines hats and vertical axis turbines vats sheng et al 2016 other nomenclature is also used for hats in the literature such as horizontal axis tidal turbine hatt concept priegue and stoesser 2017 horizontal axis tidal stream turbine hatst seo et al 2016 for vats the following nomenclature is also used vertical axis tidal turbines vatt priegue and stoesser 2017 according to priegue and stoesser hatt concept is widely used by tidal developers mainly due to its fairly simple operating principle and high efficiency 35 priegue and stoesser 2017 on the other hand vats can reach higher torque at a lower tip speed ratio and lower current velocity range which makes them auspicious in weak current conditions sheng et al 2016 xu and co workers stated that horizontal axis tidal current turbine hatct is considered to be one of the most promising amongst various tidal current energy devices xu et al 2016 the selection between hatt and vat depends mostly on the site specific conditions the platform of tidal current power station tcps is used to support generators turbines and other equipment tools and there are different types of tcps platforms which can be classified as i floating moored systems ii pile mounted systems and iii sea bed mounted gravity based systems sheng et al 2016 sheng and co workers clearly explained the advantages of these different tcps as follows i the floating moored systems are easy to install and remove have simpler maintenance schedules and more preferable at locations where sea bed is mostly stone and sea conditions are deeper ii the pile mounted system is practical for deep water conditions 30 60 m and the structure is very rigid and iii the sea bed system is fit for shallow water where the effects from wave and wind are minimal sheng et al 2016 tidal resources can be used for power generation in the scale of a few kilowatts kw by mini power stations with turbines or in the scale of multi megawatt mw tidal power farms pacheco et al 2014 a tidal farm is a cluster of inter connected tidal turbines that work together in the same locale and follow a shared control law elie et al 2017 for these farms 3 different scales can be taken into account for the study of tidal turbines which are i the scale of the tidal turbine itself ii the scale of the tidal turbine farm and iii the regional scale elie et al 2017 it has been reported that farms consisting of hundreds of tidal stream turbines have the potential to produce hundreds of megawatts electricity with high predictability funke et al 2016 however these farms must be prudently designed in order to be economically feasible and designers must consider the following two important parameters first the positions of the turbines and then the number of turbines making up the farm funke et al 2016 tidal turbines are subject to bio fouling cavitation problems sedimentation issues wave effects and experience different reynolds number re regimes and stall characteristics liu et al 2017 consequently tidal turbines must be designed as robust and reliable enough to withstand normal operating loads along with the occasional harsh sea conditions liu et al 2017 in addition knowledge about the influence of tidal energy devices to the marine benthic environment is particularly inadequate broadhurst and orme 2014 therefore extensive research must be carried out to understand the long term effects of these devices to the benthic environment in order to advance understanding the power extracting mechanism from a tidal turbine and interaction effects between flow and a turbine flow field measurements must be carried out in the wake behind a turbine seo et al 2016 tidal turbine technology is still developing with focus on different factors such as environment hydrodynamics and operation pacheco and ferreira 2016 it has been reported that with the current technology 1st generation tidal stream energy devices require spring peak tide velocities sv in excess of nearly 2 5 m s and water depths in the range between 25 and 50 m iyer et al 2013 lewis et al 2015 currently tidal stream energy projects are not profitable enough therefore public subsidisation methods such as feed in tariffs fit can play a decisive role in the development of tidal stream energy until it can be solely funded privately vazquez and iglesias 2015a in order to reduce the costs and enhance operational flexibility a tidal turbine should perform evenly for bi directional flow and there are various efforts to design such a tidal turbine micha premkumar and chatterjee 2015 finally it should be emphasized that tidal stream energy projects are not likely to be fully commercialized unless they are proven to be economically feasible vazquez and iglesias 2015b it is suggested that these economic problems should be solved in the near future for this promising technology to be commercialized in a recent study zhou and co workers listed the following companies which have pilot marine current turbine mct farms that will become operation in the following years dcns edf meygen mct atlantis resources andritz hydro hammerfest ahh sabella ge alstom energy zhou et al 2017 therefore the readers could also check the websites of these companies to have an up to date commercial information about the progress on marine tidal current turbine technologies 2 2 3 tidal fences a tidal fence system is composed of vertical axis turbines which are mounted in a fence or a row that is placed on the sea bed energy 2013b similar to tidal turbines the water passing through the turbines in a tidal fence system generates electricity eia 2017b as the end of 2016 there are no operational tidal fence projects around the globe eia 2017b 2 3 current tidal and wave energy capacity and generation around the world according to the international renewable energy agency irena in the year 2012 total tidal range deployment was nearly 514 mw and tidal current deployment was nearly 6 mw of which nearly 5 mw was deployed in the uk irena 2014a the eia also provides information about tidal and wave energy aspects of ocean energy global tide and wave energy capacity and generation based on data from the eia are given in tables 1 and 2 respectively eia 2017c since the eia reports global tide and wave energy capacities and generation together data given in tables 1 and 2 includes cumulative tide and wave data hence the titling of this subsection 2 3 includes the wave term here it should be emphasized that these tables will also be used when wave energy is scrutinised in section 3 as can be seen from table 1 total tide and wave energy capacity of the world in the year 2014 was nearly 2730 mw eia 2017c here it should be emphasized that this value is more than the global ocean energy capacity for the same year 530 mw iea 2017a reported by the iea at the end of section 1 and by definition ocean energy encompasses tidal and wave energy therefore these values should be cross checked by the iea and the eia authorities for validation since no other up to date information is found from the literature it should be safer to say that global ocean energy capacity was between 500 and 2750 mw in the year 2014 2 4 future of tidal energy currently tidal barrages or dams are considered as established energy technologies that can provide commercial scale electricity the research and development in tidal energy is mostly in the field of tidal turbines and fences it is believed that tidal stream energy might become a fully commercially viable energy source over the next decades and for this to be real complete knowledge on the subject of tidal stream resource assessment is vital ramos and ringwood 2016 currently tidal stream energy projects require high amounts of capital investment vazquez and iglesias 2016 the cost of electricity generation from tidal stream energy resource is much higher than that from traditional energy sources vazquez and iglesias 2015c also there are still uncertainties about environmental impacts of tidal energy device installation and operation on marine inhabitants and birds in the long term koh and ng 2017 mccann and bell 2017 wiesebron et al 2016 these problems must be well understood by the academia and industry if a solution is aimed to be found in the next decades for tidal barrages or dams the future seems brighter since the technology is proven for almost half a century it has been reported that there are extensive plans for tidal barrage projects in india korea the philippines and russia adding up to nearly 115 gw gw and deployment projections for tidal current up to the year 2020 are in the range of 200 mw irena 2014a starting from 2000s two proposals for tidal lagoons in swansea bay which is located in the bristol channel as a part of the severn estuary have appeared in the uk petley and aggidis 2016 currently the swansea bay tidal lagoon is the most advanced project in the uk and it is expected to generate electricity in 2019 waters and aggidis 2016 when constructed it is expected that the swansea bay tidal lagoon would be able to produce a total rated output of nearly 320 mw by using kaplan bulb turbines each producing 16 mw and power nearly 155 000 homes waters and aggidis 2016 it is estimated that nearly 1bn is required the construction of the swansea bay tidal lagoon waters and aggidis 2016 on a larger scale it is proposed that a tidal barrage in the severn estuary could alone generate 5 of the uk s electricity requirements which is equivalent to nearly 2500 offshore wind turbines valid for the year when that study was conducted kadiri et al 2014 however it is estimated that the construction cost of the severn barrage could be nearly 34bn waters and aggidis 2016 for tidal turbine technology the future could also be bright if the aforementioned problems are solved according to the eia stangford lough and uldolmok tidal power stations each have nearly 1 5 mw tidal turbines there is one tidal turbine project is under development in new york and another project is in development in northern scotland with a capacity up to 400 mw eia 2017b to sum up in this section the literature is scrutinised to prepare an up to date review of tidal energy around the globe the study will continue with the analysis of global wave energy resources in the next section 3 wave energy 3 1 fundamentals of wave energy ocean wave energy is one of the most abundant clean frequent renewable periodic and predicted energy sources around the globe which has the potential to compete with the current use of fossil fuels alamian et al 2017 mustapa et al 2017 the wind blowing over the surface of the ocean creates waves and in many areas around the globe wind blows with enough force and consistency to generate continuous waves which contain huge energy potential boem 2017 wave energy can be extracted directly from surface waves or from pressure fluctuations below the surface boem 2017 it has been reported that ocean waves can provide up to 2 terawatts of electricity energy 2013c in swan acronym for simulating waves nearshore swan which is a third generation spectral phased average model used for wave studies developed at delft university

should be clear and well documented for better understanding of wave energy sources around the globe it has been reported that north western coast of the united states particularly alaska northern canada western coasts of scotland southern africa and australia have abundant wave power resource potential boem 2017 global wave power potential is estimated to be between 1 and 10 tw and annual wave energy is estimated to reach nearly 93 000 twh per annum mustapa et al 2017 the global power potential of waves that hit all coasts around the globe is estimated to be nearly 1 tw however if wave energy is harvested on open oceans then the global wave power input is estimated to be nearly 10 tw which is comparable with the current global power consumption valid for the year when that study was conducted falnes 2007 falnes and løvseth 1991 other researchers estimated global wave energy potential as 2 tw wahyudie et al 2017 according to the irena global theoretical wave energy potential could be up to 29 500 twh per annum irena 2014b after total global information the following country wise information about wave energy potentials are found from the detailed review of the literature in the united states electric generation from waves could amount to more than 1170 twh per annum which is almost one third of the 4000 twh of electricity used in the united states each year valid for the year when that study was conducted nrel 2016 the united states naturally available and technically recoverable wave energy resources are given in table 3 nrel 2016 estimates of total wave energy resource hitting the uk waters change between 250 and 600 twh per annum whereas the carbon trust s practical wave energy resource estimate is 50 twh per annum carbon trust 2011 whereas in another study the uk s theoretical wave energy potential is estimated as 69 twh year 27 gw the crown estate 2012 australia north west coast of the north america south america south coast of africa and west coast of europe are high density wave energy coast lines with maximum power capacity potentials up to 90 kw per meter of the coast line younesian and alam 2017 following the global information about wave energy resource potentials in the following subsection details of the devices that can be used for electricity generation from waves will be explained 3 2 devices for the exploitation wave energy ocean wave energy conversion devices can be used nearshore offshore and far offshore locations boem 2017 a number of wave energy converter wec prototypes are being developed around the globe due to the increasing interest in ocean wave energy lettenmaier et al 2017 basically wave energy conversion consists of two steps first wave energy is converted into mechanical energy and then mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy through generators kim et al 2017 do and co workers explained the main working principle of a wave energy converter as follows wave energy is converted into a high pressure hydraulic on using a wave energy converter then this energy is used to drive a hydraulic motor which is coaxially connected to an electric generator do et al 2017 hydraulic power take off mechanism or commonly known as the power take off pto is the name given to the mechanism by which energy is transferred from waves to the wave energy converter and directly or subsequently into the useful form do et al 2017 in the 20th century many wave energy converters with different power take off systems have been developed c liang et al 2017b some of those devices included air turbines hydroelectric components and linear electromagnetic motors c liang et al 2017b according to alamian and colleagues currently there are nearly 80 wave energy conversion technologies and wave energy conversion systems which can be grouped based on installation on the coast sea or seabed alamian et al 2014 wave energy conversion systems can also be grouped into four major categories attenuators oscillating water columns overtopping systems and point absorbers which are explained in detail below alamian et al 2014 clément et al 2002 do et al 2017 falcão 2010 mora et al 2017 mustapa et al 2017 i attenuator systems are adjusted parallel to the incident wave to face it and gradually harness energy from it noad and porter 2017 anaconda pelamis salter duck and wave star are existing attenuator type wave energy converters alamian et al 2014 ii oscillating water column owc systems are made of a floating or fixed hollow configuration which is open to the water below the surface falcão et al 2017 owc systems consist of a compartment encompassing a water column subjected to the stroke of incident waves and an air pocket alternatively compressed and expanded by the motion of generated water column oscillations malara et al 2017 the confined air is forced to pass through a turbine which is combined to an electrical generator falcão et al 2017 in most designs the turbines rotational direction remains same irrespective of the air flow direction which means they are self rectifying falcão et al 2017 falcão and henriques 2016 malara et al 2017 it is estimated that these devices produce an averaged power between 15 and 25 kw m per annum alamian et al 2014 limpet mighty whale oceanlinx osprey and pico plant are amongst the existing oscillating water column type of wave energy converters alamian et al 2014 also according to liu the owc systems have the highest chance of commercialization amongst different types of wave energy conversion systems liu 2016 iii overtopping systems simply be made up of a barrier over which the waves overtop and the overtopped water is entrapped in a reservoir which in turn owing to its head can run a turbine mostly a conventional low head turbine soleimani et al 2015 that generates electricity sannasiraj and sundar 2016 sea wave slot cone generator ssg tapchan and wave dragon are amongst the existing overtopping system type of wave energy converters alamian et al 2014 iv point absorber systems are generally installed in large arrays since they are small compared to the incident wavelength noad and porter 2017 point absorber systems comprise of floating bodies or buoys that are used to extract energy from the motion of waves khojasteh and kamali 2016 aquabuoy canada archimedes buoy scotland biowave australia l10 buoy sweden opt power usa pendulum japan searev france uppsala sweden wavebob usa and waveroller finland are amongst the existing point absorber system type of wave energy converters alamian et al 2014 according to the bureau of ocean energy management boem there are also four types of ocean wave energy conversion devices which may be suitable for deployment on the outer continental shelf ocs boem 2017 these are attenuators overtopping devices point absorbers and terminators boem 2017 this is different than the list given above according to the boem oscillating water column is a form of terminator type of wave energy conversion system boem 2017 by definition terminator type of devices extend perpendicular to the direction of the wave and they capture or reflect the power of the wave for energy generation boem 2017 3 3 current wave energy capacity and generation around the world as explained prior the eia reports cumulative global tide and wave energy capacities and generation and data for this was given in tables 1 and 2 in section 2 3 3 4 future of wave energy similar to tidal turbine technology the costs of wave energy converters are too high when compared to other renewable technologies and this is one of the greatest disadvantages in front of the commercialization of these novel devices contestabile et al 2017 the following improvements are required for large scale commercialization of wave energy converters power take offs are still considered as the most important challenge in ocean wave energy technology which should be solved c liang et al 2017b liu reported that the losses in the energy conversion chain of oscillating water column wave energy converters should be decreased liu 2016 this is not specific to oscillating water column wave energy converters but it must be applied to other types of wave energy converters the service life of the wave energy converter systems should be enhanced especially the service life of mooring lines and power cables used in these systems yang et al 2017 also problems related to fatigue and marine biofouling should be solved yang et al 2017 obtaining precise and consistent wave climate data is one of the key steps in the wave energy resource assessment and this can be solved by numerical modelling using continually standardised data supplied from buoys coastal stations research ships or satellites rusu and onea 2017 finally peak to average power ratio control peak shaving must be enhanced in most wave energy converters henriques et al 2016 yet when these problems are solved the future of wave energy converters could be bright based on ongoing projects just 40 mw of tidal and 26 mw of wave energy total 66 mw of ocean energy are expected to be deployed within the european union by 2018 while the target is to reach an installed capacity of 100 gw ocean energy wave and tidal in europe by 2050 magagna and uihlein 2015 a de andres et al 2017a b vasileiou et al 2017 this clearly shows the sheer amount of work that must be done in the field of wave energy in europe and all around the globe for utilising this clean reliable and abundant renewable energy source in the next decades consequently in this section the literature is scrutinised to prepare an up to date review of wave energy around the globe the study will continue with the analysis of global ocean thermal energy conversion processes and salinity gradients in the next section 4 ocean thermal energy conversion otec processes and salinity gradients temperature gradients exploit the temperature gradient between the sea ocean surface and deep water using different ocean thermal energy conversion otec processes iea 2017a otec systems operate best when the temperature difference between warmer located at top layer of the ocean and colder water deep ocean water is nearly 36 f 20 c energy 2013d according to the united states department of energy office of energy efficiency renewable energy there are 3 kinds of otec systems closed cycle open cycle and hybrid energy 2013d closed cycle otec systems uses a working fluid refrigerant or a low boiling fluid such as ammonia r 134a r 22 or r 32 that runs between two heat exchangers in a closed cycle aydin et al 2014 faizal and ahmed 2013 the working principle of a closed cycle otec systems is as follows low boiling point fluid is vaporised using warm surface sea water which is pumped through a heat exchanger electricity is generated in the turbo generator using the expanding vapour then the vapour is condensed in a second heat exchanger using cold deep seawater and recycled back into the system for the repetition of the cycle aydin et al 2014 energy 2013d etemadi et al 2011 faizal and ahmed 2013 open cycle otec systems the working fluid is a low pressure steam nihous and syed 1997 steam is generated from warm surface water via placing it into a low pressure container here it should be emphasized that the steam is almost pure fresh water because it has left its salt behind in the low pressure container the steam is used to generate electricity via a generator then the steam is condensed by exposure to cold deep ocean water damy and marvaldi 1987 energy 2013d kim et al 2016 nihous and syed 1997 olsson 1982 hybrid otec systems by definition such systems aim to combine the characteristics of closed cycle and open cycle otec systems for a synergistic exploitation of the thermal resource for generation electricity and desalinization of sea water similar to an open cycle evaporation process warm seawater is flash evaporated into steam via letting into a vacuum chamber then similar to a closed cycle loop the steam is used to vaporise a low boiling point fluid which drives a turbine to generate electricity energy 2013d kim et al 2016 2009 soto and vergara 2014 since the 19th century mankind tried to utilise the solar energy collected in the oceans mcgowan 1976 the first demonstration scale otec plant with a design capacity of 22 kw was built in cuba in 1930 by georges claude this was followed by another project built in brazil in 1935 with a design capacity of 2 2 mw however these two otec plants could not become operational and could not provide net power kim et al 2016 vanzwieten et al 2017 the progress on otec technology was on halt until 1979 when a pilot scale otec was installed by natural energy laboratory of the hawaiian authority nelha in hawaii with 50 kw gross power 18 kw net this was followed by another project in 1981 kim et al 2016 vanzwieten et al 2017 in the same year another demonstration scale otec plant was opened in tokyo which had 120 kw gross power 30 kw net uehara et al 1988 vanzwieten et al 2017 in 1993 a land based open cycle otec plant was constructed by nelha with 103 kw net power kim et al 2016 vanzwieten et al 2017 lately in 2015 makai ocean engineering launched the first closed cycle onshore otec power plant with 100 kw generation in north kona hawaii by nelha vanzwieten et al 2017 also an up to date list of currently operational and at design state otec plants are given in a recent publication of osorio and co workers osorio et al 2016 finally according to the irena global otec potential is nearly 300 ej or nearly 83 300 twh per annum irena 2014c salinity gradient energy is also known as osmotic power abbasi garravand et al 2016 salinity gradients exploits the energy associated with the salinity gradient located mostly at the mouth of rivers where freshwater mixes with saltwater using pressure retarded reverse osmosis processes and associated conversion technologies iea 2017a the power released from the osmotic pressure difference between fresh and salty water is called salinity gradient power wick 1978 reverse or reversed electrodialysis can also be used for the exploitation of salinity gradient energy wick 1978 according to the irena global technical and theoretical salinity gradient potentials could be nearly 5200 and 27 700 twh per annum irena 2014d finally it should be emphasized most of the otec and salinity gradient technologies are currently under development iea 2017a therefore more research and development studies should be carried out before wider and commercial utilisation of these technologies 5 conclusion in this study global ocean energy sources are analysed in detail to prepare an up to date technical review the following conclusions are drawn from this study there is an immense energy potential in the oceans detailed analysis of the literature showed that different ocean energy sources have the following global annual potentials tidal nearly 1000 twh bahaj 2011 bai et al 2016 hammons 1993 stephen j sangiuliano 2017a b wave up to 93 000 twh mustapa et al 2017 temperature gradients thermal up to 87 600 twh khan et al 2017 and salinity gradients osmotic between 2000 and 5200 twh or maybe even up to 27 700 twh irena 2014d khan et al 2017 however the literature review also clearly showed that there are significant differences between the ocean energy resource potential estimates in the published literature therefore an up to date global ocean energy resource potential map or database should be prepared by the authorities to avoid future uncertainty in addition as stated in section 2 3 the eia reported that total tide and wave energy capacity of the world in the year 2014 was nearly 2730 mw eia 2017c however this value is much more than the global ocean energy capacity reported by the iea for the same year 530 mw iea 2017a it is known that by definition ocean energy involves tidal and wave energy therefore the author of this study suggests that these values should be cross checked by the iea and the eia authorities for validation since no other up to date information is found from the literature global ocean energy capacity in the year 2014 was reported as between 500 and 2750 mw in this study this is believed to be a crucial finding many countries around the globe aim to utilise ocean energy sources to supply their increasing energy demand in a sustainable manner however as of today technologies to exploit the power of the oceans and seas are still at an early stage of development except tidal barrages or dams and even the most advanced technologies specifically tidal current and ocean wave still encounter substantial problems and obstacles consequently innovation and research and development r d in this field can help overcome those problems uihlein and magagna 2016 as stated above tidal barrages or dams are the only proven technologies however their capacity and site selection is limited also research about the environmental impacts of marine renewable energy devices remains incomplete because many of these devices should be set and tested in the marine environments zangiabadi et al 2017 yet when these problems are solved and the technological development is complete marine ocean energy is expected to provide a significant amount of electricity to our global economy therefore the research and development in ocean energy engineering should fostered by nations with access to these reliable and clean renewable energy sources finally this study could offer some assistance to the academia and industry in the exploitation of different ocean energy sources for achieving a more sustainable future acknowledgements i would like to dedicate this paper to my lovely wife bengi melikoğlu i wish you health i would also like to thank my parents nebile tülay melikoğlu and kazım melikoğlu for their support 
23678,the two dimensional water entry of wedges with different inclination angles is numerically investigated using a constrained interpolation profile cip based model which is developed on the ground of a fixed cartesian grid and governed by the navier stokes n s equations a high order finite difference method is employed as the flow solver where the cip method is used to discretize the convective term the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing slope weighting thinc sw is adopted to capture the free surface interface and an immersed boundary method is applied to simulate the motion of bodies the present numerical model involving symmetric water entry is verified in comparison with the previous numerical and experimental results in the literature the results of the asymmetric water entry are provided in terms of the penetration depth velocity pile up coefficients impact force of wedges and velocity and pressure distributions of fluid considerable attention is paid into the effects of deadrise and inclination angles it is found that the presence of the inclination angle significantly influences both the velocity and pressure field and further regulates the penetration depth velocity pile up coefficients and impact force on the wedge specifically wedges entering into the water with small deadrise angles are found to be more sensitive to the inclination angle than those with large deadrise angle keywords asymmetric water entry wedge free falling cip method vof method immersed boundary method 1 introduction the hull slamming generated by the impact of an object on water is of particular interest in ocean engineering such as ditching of airplane on the sea water entry of projectiles ship slamming and so on when a vessel sails in rough seas or a spacecraft lands on the water surface such motion always causes an asymmetric impact the quasi v shaped cross sections are commonly used near the bottom of vessels for the sake of simplicity it is convenient to use a wedge to investigate the asymmetric impact problems it is well known that the presence of an inclination angle can lead to fully different hydrodynamic behaviours between the asymmetric and symmetric entries thus the present work will focus on the influence of inclination angle in hydrodynamics the water entry problems falls into two main difficulties i the duration of impact order of milliseconds ii the very complicated flow phenomenon such as jet flow splashing flow separation air cushion and cavitation this phenomenon has received considerable attention in the past decades seddon and moatamedi 2006 abrate 2011 truscott et al 2014 based on the conservation of momentum von karman 1929 firstly introduced added mass concept and predicted the impact pressure to study the water entry problem of two dimensional wedge the fluid was assumed to be inviscid and irrotational the surface tension gravity the piled up water on the wedge and structural elasticity effects were neglected his results underestimated the impact force when the deadrise angle of wedge was small then wagner 1932 extended von karman 1929 s method to predict the pressure distribution on a two dimensional wedge during water entry the piled up water on the wedge has been taken into account by simply introducing a constant surface wetting factor as a result the impact force for wedges with small deadrise angle was overestimated the jet flow and flow separation were still neglected in the study most of following analytical models for asymmetric water entry derived from wagner s theory and overcame its drawbacks garabedian 1953 initiated the study of oblique entry problem based on wagner s theory subsequently korobkin 1988 studied the inclined entry of a blunt profile into an ideal fluid at the initial stage toyama 1993 extended wagner s theory by considering the piled up water at the free surface near the wedge which is associated with the pressure distribution and the peak value to predict the slamming pressure distribution on the surface of asymmetric wedges however the flow separation was omitted vorus 1996 extended tulin 1957 s slender surface model to flat cylinder theory following this theory xu et al 1998 studied the asymmetric impact problems the jet formation and initially separated flow due to large asymmetry were investigated they classified the asymmetric impact flow model into two types and demonstrated the role of the inclination angle on the acceleration of a wedge impacting the still water asymmetrically semenov and iafrati 2006 presented a nonlinear analytical self similar solution to the asymmetric water entry flow of a wedge with vertical velocity the flow in the jet was considered as well the free surface elevation contact angles at the intersection with the wedge boundary pressure distribution force and moment coefficients were examined due to the water entry of a wedge is not generally self similar especially for the free fall of asymmetric wedges the boundary element method on the frame of potential flow theory has also been used for the water entry problem xu et al 2008 adopted wu et al 2004 s boundary element method to analyze the free surface elevation pressure distribution over the wedge surface and impact force under the considerations of different deadrise angles and oblique entry with constant velocity in addition the analytical solutions based on the shallow water approximation was used to model the jet flow all theoretical studies provide valuable insight to asymmetric water entry however which are limited to understand the complicated phenomena during water entry the application of refined flow measurements offers a good way to thoroughly study the physics of impact compared to symmetric entry the asymmetry of flow field brings more challenges thus the experiments on the asymmetric cases are quite rare xu et al 1999 conducted a series of experiments to validate xu et al 1998 s method for predicting impact force and moment a wedge with different heel angles and weights was freely dropped from different heights the resulting motions of test models at asymmetric impact include vertical water entry and transverse rolling judge et al 2004 experimentally studied a wedge of 37 deadrise angle with a heel angle of 0 to 34 and an oblique entry velocity initial separation ventilation of the flow near the wedge keel due to asymmetric impact or horizontal vertical impact velocity was observed in their works shams et al 2015 considered a wedge of 37 deadrise angle with a heel angle of 0 to 35 which impacts the quiescent fluid vertically from a fixed height they solved the poisson equation in the fluid domain to reconstruct the pressure field with piv particle image velocimetry data flow field generated by the impact and hydrodynamic force on the wedge was analyzed barjasteh et al 2016 experimentally studied the asymmetric entry as well in their works the wedges entered the water surface with an orthogonal velocity and the influence of initial deadrise angle inclination angle and impact speed and impact pressure were evaluated however the effects of the inclination angle on the pressure and velocity fields have not been analyzed although experimental studies contribute to the thorough understanding of the physics of asymmetric impact the cost is highly with the development of computer science computational fluid dynamics cfd has become an alternative method to solve the water entry problems the cfd method solving the navier stokes equations can reproduce large free surface deformation and flow separation during the penetration one difficulty in the cfd study is how to deal with the interfaces between gas liquid and solid there are meshless and mesh based methods to solve this problem oger et al 2006 adopted a smoothed particles hydrodynamics sph method which is a kind of meshless method to simulate completely free falling wedge impact when a wedge with an initial heel angle freely impacting onto the water surface the linear and angular acceleration of wedge lead to the flow field becoming asymmetry the vertical and angular acceleration and pressure field of the fluid were analyzed mesh based methods for solving the interface include volume of the fluid vof method and level set ls method panahi 2012 introduced a finite volume based moving mesh algorithm to simulate symmetric and asymmetric water entry of wedges the free surface was captured by the compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes cicsam which is a kind of vof method by ubbink and issa 1999 gu et al 2014 developed a numerical model with the free surface captured by the ls function and the partial cell method combined with a local relative velocity approach was applied to treat the motion of moving body the wedges impacted the calm water surface with both vertical and oblique velocities initial separation ventilation of the flow near the wedge keel due to asymmetric impact or horizontal vertical impact velocity were investigated the pressure distribution velocity and pressure field of fluid were presented wei et al 2015 combined the cip method with the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme to study the impact of a wedge on the water surface in a free fall with an initial heel angle the linear and angular acceleration of a wedge of 20 deadrise angle with a heel angle of 5 were compared with those of experiments ghazizade ahsaee and nikseresht 2013 farsi and ghadimi 2015 numerically studied the wedge entering into water asymmetrically as well and their results were encouraging from the above discussion it appears that most of the studies on the water entry of asymmetric wedges focused on the wedges impact water surface with the horizontal velocity component the flow field generated by the asymmetric entry without the horizontal velocity component is distinguished from that by the oblique entry the lack of a systematic study of the flow field for asymmetric water entry only with the vertical velocity component can be clearly seen especially for the velocity field and pressure distribution in this work an improved numerical model is applied to investigate the effect of inclination angles on the penetration velocity and depth of wedges velocity and pressure field maximum pressure coefficient and force acting on the wedges with different deadrise angles in the model a cip method is applied for the flow solver however contrast to wei et al 2015 a more accurate vof type method the tangent of hyperbola for capturing slope weighting thinc sw scheme is adopted to predict free surface and an immersed boundary method is employed to treat moving bodies a wedge impacting on the still water surface with purely vertical velocity is simulated using the proposed model and the results are compared with available experimental and numerical data from the literature the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the governing equations and the numerical methods will be presented the numerical model is validated in section 3 in section 4 the asymmetric water entry of wedges with different deadrise angles and different inclination angles are discussed finally some conclusions are obtained 2 numerical models 2 1 governing equations the fluid is assumed incompressible and viscous which satisfies the mass conservation equation and the navier stokes momentum equations as follows 1 u i x i 0 and 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ s i j x j f i where t is

gravity and s i j is the viscous term given by 3 s i j μ u i x j where μ is the dynamic viscosity the numerical simulation will encounter severe diffusion due to the steep gradients in density and viscosity across the interface the volume function ϕ m m 1 2 3 is used to capture the interface among the three phases the evolution of the volume function is governed by 4 ϕ m t u i ϕ m x i 0 where ϕ m m 1 2 3 are the volume functions of liquid gas and solid the sum of the volume functions of gas liquid and solid is unity everywhere to treat the instabilities at the interface density and viscosity of liquid and solid are assumed to be the same in this study the volume function for solid ϕ 3 is determined by a lagrangian method in which a rigid body is assumed and the volume function for gas ϕ 2 is determined by ϕ 2 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 after all volume functions have been calculated the physical property λ such as the density and viscosity in every cell can be defined as 5 λ m 1 3 ϕ m λ m 2 2 navier stokes solver following hu and kashiwagi 2004 zhao et al 2014 and ye et al 2016 the numerical model is built under a staggered grid system to ensure strong pressure and velocity coupling the finite difference method is adopted to discretize eqs 1 4 on a nonuniform mesh the discretization process is divided into three steps advection phase non advection phase i and non advection phase ii the advection term is firstly solved by a cip scheme yabe and wang 1991 yabe et al 2001 then a centre difference scheme is employed to calculate the non advection phase i the pressure distribution is obtained by solving poisson equation and finally velocity can be updated by a projection method for the sake of brevity the key parts of the model are given in the following eqs 6 9 6 u i t u j u i x j 0 7 u i u i δ t 1 ρ s i j x j f i 8 x i 1 ρ p x i 1 δ t u i x i 9 u i n 1 u i δ t ρ p x i here the superscript indicates the intermediate value after the calcaulation of advection phase superscript indicates the intermediate value after the calcaulation of non advection phase i in the first step we neglect the diffusion term and pressure term then eq 2 is rewritten in a convection equation form and solved by cip method see eq 6 in the next step for the non advection phase i the diffusion term is taken into consideration an euler explicit method is used for the time integration and a central difference scheme is used for the source terms of the spatial derivatives subsequently the renewed intermediate velocities are obtained see eq 7 for the non advection phase ii the velocities are updated by coupling with pressure field with sor successive over relaxation see eqs 8 and 9 finally the total flow field information is updated and this iterative process continues till the end of the computations more details about the flow solver can be found in hu and kashiwagi 2004 and zhao et al 2014 2 3 thinc sw scheme for capturing free surface the thinc sw scheme xiao et al 2011 which is a kind of vof type method is applied to capture the free surface in addition a smoothed hyperbolic tangent heaviside function is used to ensure the density or viscosity vary smoothly in the thinc sw method the slope of the interface is adaptively scaled to a proper thickness according to the interface orientation which significantly improves the geometrical accuracy of the original thinc scheme in thinc sw scheme for the profile of a volume function f 0 f 1 a piecewise hyperbolic tangent function with adjustable parameter is used to interpolate inside an upwind cell which can be described as 10 f i x α 2 1 γ tanh β x x i 1 2 δ x i δ where α γ β are parameters to determine the quality of the numerical solution α and γ are used to avoid interface smearing given as follows 11 α ϕ i 1 i f ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 o t h e r w i s e 12 γ 1 i f ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 1 o t h e r w i s e parameter δ is used to determine the middle point of the transition jump in the hyperbolic tangent function and is solved by 13 1 δ x i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 f i x d x ϕ i n parameter β is a prescribed parameter to control the slope and the thickness of the jump in the interpolation function in the original thinc scheme a constant β 3 5 is usually used that may result in ruffling the interface which aligns nearly in the direction of the velocity to avoid this problem in thinc sw β is determined adaptively according to the orientation of the interface in a 2d case β can be written as 14 β x 2 3 n x 0 001 a n d β y 2 3 n y 0 001 2 4 immersed boundary treatment an immersed boundary method proposed by hu and kashiwagi 2009 is employed for the solid body treatment in this method the fluid solid interface is treated as a set of virtual particles in the first stage of a computation in each time step the governing equations of fluid motion are solved everywhere in the computational domain including the solid then the locations of liquid and solid phases are captured by thinc sw method as a result the velocity coupling fluid and solid is described as follows 15 u i n 1 ϕ 3 u b 1 ϕ 3 u i here u i is the flow velocity u b denotes the local velocity of the solid body after the hydrodynamic force exerting on the solid body is achieved by integrating the pressure on the body surface newton s law is used to compute the body acceleration and velocities more details about solid body treatment can be found in hu and kashiwagi 2009 and zhao and hu 2012 2 5 initial and boundary conditions figs 1 and 2 show the computational domain the flow is described in a cartesian coordinate system o x y the x axis is located at the calm water surface and the y axis lies in the vertical line coinciding with the apex of wedge the size of the computation domain will be given in section 3 a non uniform mesh is employed in the domain to save cpu time the mesh density is large both near the free surface along the y direction and around the wedge in the x direction and decreases gradually away from the impact region and the free surface as presented in fig 3 initial pressure field is set zero on all the rigid boundaries a non slip boundary is used in the computations the density of water is 1 103 kg m3 and for the air 1 25 kg m3 the water has viscosity 1 10 3 kg m s and for the air 1 10 5 kg m s 3 model validation the validation is first carried out in the case of the water entry of a 2d symmetric wedge with a deadrise angle β 0 of 30 the numerical results are compared with those obtained by zhao et al 1996 fig 1 a shows the geometry of the wedge the dimensions of the computational domain are 2 86 m in length and 0 9 m in depth and the water depth is 0 5 m the domain is sufficiently large in all directions to make sure that the wedge moves within the liquid region freely and the simulation results are independent of the domain size for the wedge the breadth b of the test section is 0 5 m the total length of the test section l 1 m the length of the measuring section 0 2 m and the total mass of the drop rig 241 kg to show the mesh resolution convergence three kinds of mesh sizes used are listed in table 1 unless otherwise specified t 0 means the keel point touches the undisturbed water surface for all the following cases the initial vertical velocity is 6 15 m s the present numerical results are compared with the experimental and numerical data obtained by kleefsman et al 2005 oger et al 2006 shown in figs 4 and 6 it can be observed that the numerical results agree well with previous numerical and experimental results for the acceleration which is not provided in the literature fig 5 only displays the computed vertical acceleration used three types of mesh sizes through the results of the velocity vertical acceleration and force computed by the mesh sizes in mesh 1 and mesh 2 mesh convergence is achieved thus mesh 2 will be adopted to the following simulations to save cpu time fig 4 illustrates the variations of wedge velocity against time t at t 0 0 s the free falling wedge touches on the still water surface symmetrically the time series of the vertical forces acting on the wedge are shown in fig 6 from figs 4 and 6 it can be seen that the penetration can be roughly divided into two stages in the first stage for 0 ms t 16 ms the vertical acceleration and force increases rapidly at first which leads to an abruptly decrease of the velocity in the inverse direction and then increases gradually to the peak in the second stage the vertical acceleration and force drop fast after coming up to the peak value resulting in the velocity decrease gradually the numerical results in the present work show a better agreement with the experimental data than those conducted by kleefsman et al 2005 and oger et al 2006 however compared to the experimental data all results obtained by numerical methods overestimate the peak value of impact force which results in wedge entering into the water more slowly this overestimation may be induced by the neglect of three dimensional effects water compressibility and surface tension another important reason is that after the wedge has entered the water the motion of wedge is suppressed by a spring in the experiment which is not taken into account in the numerical simulation to further verify the validation of the numerical model the available experimental data by barjasteh et al 2016 is chosen to take comparison firstly the symmetric cases are examined where the computation domain is 1 122 m in length and 0 681 m in depth the total mass of the wedge is 44 kg and the side length of the wedge is 0 205 m as shown in fig 7 which is similar to that described in the experiment conducted by barjasteh et al 2016 p1 p2 p3 p4 are the pressure sensors used in the experiment instantaneous impact pressure were recorded at 25 khz sampling rate to ensure the sampling rate in the computation is the same as the experiment the time step in the simulation is set to be 4 10 5 s the distance from the keel of the wedge to the water surface is 0 5 m so the initial water entry velocity is 3 13 m s fig 8 illustrates the time series of pressure at p2 when the water depth d is 0 3 m 0 45 m and 0 6 m respectively the comparison confirms that the recorded pressures are independent of the selected water levels therefore the water level is chosen as 0 45 m for all cases to decrease the computing time the left and right wetted lengths r 1 and r 2 and the reference wetted lengths d 1 and d 1 are defined in fig 2 the so called pile up coefficients or wetting factors for the left and right side are defined as r 1 d 1 and r 2 d 2 fig 9 displays the predicted pile up coefficients against the penetration depth where deadrise angle of the wedges varies from 5 to 45 as the side length of the wedge is constant the vertical height of the chine above the apex of the wedge increases with the deadrise angle increasing the computation stops when the whole chine is wetted therefore the penetration depth in fig 9 is smaller as deadrise angles is relatively small as observed by mei 1998 and tveitnes et al 2008 even under free fall the pile up coefficients are nearly constant and reduced with the deadrise angle increasing since the pile up coefficients equal to the value of the position of the maximum pressure plus 1 which will be discussed further in section 4 2 4 numerical results the computation domain and the initial position of the asymmetric wedge is shown in fig 1 b for an asymmetric entry the wedge is counterclockwise rotated by a desired inclination angle ϕ 0 after rotation the deadrise angle of left side becomes β 0 ϕ 0 while the deadrise angle of right side is β 0 ϕ 0 all computation configurations are summarized in table 2 numerical results will be discussed in this section 4 1 penetration depth velocity and pile up analysis the penetration depths of symmetric and asymmetric wedges are shown in fig 10 where fig 10 a shows the results of β 0 20 and fig 10 b gives the results of β 0 30 the penetration depth increases monotonically as a function of time for all symmetrical and asymmetrical wedges with the inclination angle ϕ 0 increasing the influence of the asymmetry is obvious gradually the penetration depth decreases as the inclination angle increases however in the early stage of the impact 0 ms t 5 ms especially for β 0 30 the discrepancy of different inclination angles can be ignored the asymmetry has a significant effect on the penetration depth for the deadrise angle β 0 20 while this effect becomes weak for the deadrise angle β 0 30 see fig 10 a and b fig 11 shows the penetration velocity of symmetric and asymmetric wedges during water entry as the wedge penetrates the water surface the velocity monotonically decreases as penetration depth increases at the onset of water entry the penetration velocity decreases rapidly and the variation tends to be mild as the penetration depth advances the effect of the inclination angles on penetration velocity resembles that on penetration depth as the inclination angle increases asymmetric effects become more significant as well the increment of inclination angle results in the decrease of the wedge velocity and further influence the penetration depth namely reducing the depth as shown in fig 10 it is noted that the influence of asymmetry on water entry is moderate as the deadrise angle increases large inclination angle means the small deadrise angle at the left side consequently the velocity drops more abruptly as estimated by von karman 1929 further explanation can be found in section 4 4 as the wedge asymmetrically penetrates the water surface the water pile up differs between the left and right sides see fig 12 it can be interestingly observed that pile up coefficients are nearly constant under the asymmetric impact and the pile up phenomenon tends to be self similar in addition the effect of the asymmetry on the pile up coefficients decreases with the deadrise and inclination angles increasing which can be concluded by comparing fig 12 a c with fig 12 d f for the symmetric wedge with constant velocity impacting calm water as pointed out by mei et al 1999 and payne 1994 the pile up coefficients vary from 1 to π 2 however for the water entry of asymmetric wedge as shown in fig 12 the pile up coefficients exceed π 2 as the water is pushed from the small deadrise angle side to the large deadrise angle side the pile up coefficients of right side are larger than those of the symmetric wedges with the same deadrise angle and exceed π 2 especially for β 0 20 and the inclination angle ϕ 0 15 as shown in 12 c at the left side the discrepancies between the symmetric wedges and asymmetric wedges are small unfortunately a clear dependence of the pile up coefficients on the inclination angle is difficult to be identified as reported by shams et al 2015 for the wedge with horizontal and vertical velocities impacting the calm water however for a given deadrise angle as the inclination angle raises up the pile up coefficients of the left side decrease while those of the right side increase 4 2 influence of the asymmetry on the pressure field in this section in order to analyze the maximum pressure of asymmetric wedges the maximum pressure coefficient is used 16 c p m a x p m a x 0 5 ρ w v 0 2 where ρ w is the density of water p m a x the maximum pressure over the surface of wedge the initial water entry velocity v 0 2 g h 1 2 3 13 m s fig 13 compares the maximum pressure coefficient in the present work with those obtained by wagner 1932 yettou et al 2006 barjasteh et al 2016 and mei et al 1999 the results agree well with these studies the wagner model neglected air drag cushioning effect and water compressibility and the wedge was also assumed to impacting onto the water surface with constant velocity accordingly wagner s method overestimates the maximum pressure coefficient for small deadrise angles as plotted in fig 14 the predicted pressure distributions on the wetted surface of present work have been compared with the numerical values from toyama 1993 and xu et al 1998 as well as the experimental results from barjasteh et al 2016 the time corresponds to the instant at which the simulated pressure comes up to the peak values as presented in figs 17 and 18 the non dimensional time is calculated as τ v t 0 5 b when the deadrise angle of the left side is 5 the analytical models of toyama 1993 and xu et al 1998 overestimated the pressure coefficients on the left side as the inclination angle decreases the present study agrees well with the other solutions on the left side in particular for the solutions obtained by xu et al 1998 in the case of the right side the comparison shows a fair agreement additionally the wetted length along the wedge surface in the present work is larger than the analytical solution furthermore the positions of the maximum pressure coefficients for different deadrise angles defined as the ratio of the y coordinate of the position of the maximum pressure to the penetration depth of the wedge are plotted in fig 15 the positions of maximum pressures in present work are compared with those by zhao and faltinsen 1993 which evaluated by the similarity solution the asymptotic method and the boundary element method bem respectively the results in fig 15 show that the present predictions for small deadrise angles are lower than other calculations while they are in good agreement when the deadrise angle is larger than 20 as the deadrise angle increases the position becomes lower note that when the deadrise angle is 40 the position of the maximum pressure is located near the keel the positions of the maximum pressures equal to the value of the pile up coefficients subtracting 1 as the wetted length along the wedge surface is larger than the length of the maximum pressure occurring on the wedge surface the results in fig 15 is smaller than the value of the pile up coefficients subtracting 1 the positions of maximum pressure for asymmetric water entry are compared with the analytical results from toyama 1993 in fig 16 the predictions for the left side from present work are higher than analytical results while for the right side are lower than analytical results as the inclination angle increases the position of the maximum pressure becomes lower on the left side while higher on the right side figs 17 and 18 display the pressure field for fluid near the wedges the pressure field in figs 17 and 18 is magnified and the position of the wedges can be determined by the edge of the pressure field the maximum pressure coefficient is in the pile up region and near the spray root of the jet the maximum pressure values on the left side are much larger than those on the right side in accordance with the study of wagner 1932 the large deadrise angle may account for the low impact pressure in the symmetric water entry problem as disclosed in fig 13 it is reasonable to attribute the increment of the wetted breadth to the decrease of the deadrise angle consequently it will generate a jumping up of the impact pressure fig 19 shows the pressure field after flow separation on the two sides of the wedge it is found that the pressure on the two sides decreases when the flow separates moreover the maximum pressure values on the right side are larger than those on the left side in order to study the evolution of the pressure field during water entry fig 20 presents the pressure field of β 0 30 ϕ 0 15 for both chines dry and wet fig 19 b presents the pressure field of β 0 30 ϕ 0 15 for left chine wet and right chine dry it can be seen from figs 18 d 19 b and 20 the maximum pressure values of the left side increase until reaching the maximum pressure values in 18 d after the left chine wet the maximum values of pressure field move from the left side to the right side and the maximum pressure values decreasing as the penetration depth increases it can be observed that the effect of the asymmetry on the pressure field increases as the inclination angle becomes larger meanwhile the pressure at the left side increases but declines at the right side which leads to the asymmetry distribution of the pressure field a larger inclination angle indicates a decrease of the left side deadrise angle and a rise of the corresponding impact pressure similar analysis can also be made for the pressure reduction at the right side to investigate the interaction between the deadrise angles of both sides the maximum pressure coefficient in fig 17 b is compared with the symmetric results in fig 21 the pressure peak for β l 15 in fig 17 b is smaller than those obtained by the symmetric water entry for β 0 15 in fig 21 a the reason is β 0 β r thus the wetted breadth of a symmetric wedge with β 0 15 is larger than a asymmetric wedge with β l 15 the similar explanation can be given for the maximum pressure for β r 25 in fig 17 b is larger than β 0 25 in fig 21 b 4 3 influence of the asymmetry on the velocity field figs 22 and 23 illustrate the contours of velocity near the wedges which correspond to the pressure fields at the different time instants discussed in section 4 2 for the symmetric impact in fig 22 a the flow is symmetric and the maximum flow velocity is in the pile up region where a water jet is formed however the flow field is no longer symmetric for the asymmetric impact therefore the velocity at the left side is larger than that at the right side and the deadrise angle of the left side is smaller than the right as the inclination angle increases the maximum flow velocity increases at the left side whereas it decreases at the right side it can also be found that the discrepancy of maximum flow velocity for β 0 30 with different inclination angles is small while that for β 0 20 is remarkable after the flow separation the tendency of the maximum velocity is the same as the pressure field as shown in fig 24 the results in figs 23 d 24 b and 25 show the evolution of velocity field for β 0 30 ϕ 0 15 as the penetration depth increases the maximum velocity values of the fluid field increase after the left chine wet the maximum velocity values move from the left side to right it can be seen that the maximum flow velocity is in the pile up region for both symmetrical and asymmetrical wedges similar results have been reported by semenov and iafrati 2006 and shams et al 2015 where the maximum flow velocity was in the pile up region only for small inclination angles different from their results the maximum value of flow velocity is attained in the pile up region for all cases no matter the inclination angle is small or not the reason is that the purely vertical velocity of the wedge is taken into account in the present study 4 4 impact force the vertical impact force on the wedge during the water impact can be given by 17 f f v m g m a where f is the vertical impact force f v is the vertical force m is mass of the wedge a is the acceleration of the wedge fig 26 illustrates the vertical impact force on the wedges it is found that the increment of the peak value of impact force is accompanied by an increase of the inclination angle especially for β 0 20 the peak value is nearly doubled when the inclination angle ranges from 5 to 15 additionally when the deadrise angle is constant the peak value of the impact force happens earlier for a lager inclination angle as seen in eq 17 when the vertical impact force becomes larger the acceleration of the wedge with a constant mass becomes larger thus the velocity of wedge drops more abruptly as presented in fig 11 as reported by fairlie clarke and tveitnes 2008 the ratio of the gravity to the vertical impact force decreases as the deadrise angle decreases with the increase of the inclination angle correspondingly the deadrise angle of the left side decreases as a result the vertical impact force and the acceleration of the wedge are small for ϕ 0 5 tveitnes et al 2008 revealed that the vertical impact force is composed of the hydrostatic force a residual gravity force and a hydrodynamic force at the onset of water entry impact force is dominated by the change rate of added mass momentum and rises quickly until the wedge gets wetted after the wedge is wetted the added mass flow momentum force and residual gravity force reduces but the upward hydrostatic force rises as a result the total impact force decreases it is noted that the penetration velocity of wedge first decreases rapidly and then decreases gradually compared to β 0 20 the change rate of peak value for β 0 30 is insignificant which is consistent with the penetration velocity of wedges presented in fig 11 5 conclusions in this work we have studied the water entry of asymmetric wedges using a cip based method numerical results of symmetric water entry are initially compared with available experimental data the good agreements reveal the ability of our model to solve the water entry problems the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the initial deadrise and inclination angles have significant effect on the penetration depth wedge velocity and pile up coefficients as the inclination angle increases the decrease of the wedge velocity can result in reduction of the penetration depth and the pile up coefficients increase on the right side while decrease on the other side 2 the pressure and velocity fields of the asymmetric impact are different from those of symmetric impact the location of the maximum pressure becomes lower on the smaller deadrise angle side while higher on the other side as the inclination angle increases when the inclination angle is 15 the maximum pressure value becomes larger specifically for asymmetric wedges with pure vertical velocity the present studies indicate that the maximum flow velocity is always in the pile up region even for a large inclination angle 3 furthermore it is found that the impact force on the wedge is strongly influenced by the inclination angle the larger the inclination angle the higher the peak value is for β 0 20 the peak value is nearly doubled when the inclination angle ranges from 5 to 15 4 comparing the asymmetric water entry results for β 0 20 and β 0 30 it is clear that wedges with small deadrise angles are more sensitive to the inclination angle than those with large deadrise angle acknowledgement this study was partially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos

23678,the two dimensional water entry of wedges with different inclination angles is numerically investigated using a constrained interpolation profile cip based model which is developed on the ground of a fixed cartesian grid and governed by the navier stokes n s equations a high order finite difference method is employed as the flow solver where the cip method is used to discretize the convective term the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing slope weighting thinc sw is adopted to capture the free surface interface and an immersed boundary method is applied to simulate the motion of bodies the present numerical model involving symmetric water entry is verified in comparison with the previous numerical and experimental results in the literature the results of the asymmetric water entry are provided in terms of the penetration depth velocity pile up coefficients impact force of wedges and velocity and pressure distributions of fluid considerable attention is paid into the effects of deadrise and inclination angles it is found that the presence of the inclination angle significantly influences both the velocity and pressure field and further regulates the penetration depth velocity pile up coefficients and impact force on the wedge specifically wedges entering into the water with small deadrise angles are found to be more sensitive to the inclination angle than those with large deadrise angle keywords asymmetric water entry wedge free falling cip method vof method immersed boundary method 1 introduction the hull slamming generated by the impact of an object on water is of particular interest in ocean engineering such as ditching of airplane on the sea water entry of projectiles ship slamming and so on when a vessel sails in rough seas or a spacecraft lands on the water surface such motion always causes an asymmetric impact the quasi v shaped cross sections are commonly used near the bottom of vessels for the sake of simplicity it is convenient to use a wedge to investigate the asymmetric impact problems it is well known that the presence of an inclination angle can lead to fully different hydrodynamic behaviours between the asymmetric and symmetric entries thus the present work will focus on the influence of inclination angle in hydrodynamics the water entry problems falls into two main difficulties i the duration of impact order of milliseconds ii the very complicated flow phenomenon such as jet flow splashing flow separation air cushion and cavitation this phenomenon has received considerable attention in the past decades seddon and moatamedi 2006 abrate 2011 truscott et al 2014 based on the conservation of momentum von karman 1929 firstly introduced added mass concept and predicted the impact pressure to study the water entry problem of two dimensional wedge the fluid was assumed to be inviscid and irrotational the surface tension gravity the piled up water on the wedge and structural elasticity effects were neglected his results underestimated the impact force when the deadrise angle of wedge was small then wagner 1932 extended von karman 1929 s method to predict the pressure distribution on a two dimensional wedge during water entry the piled up water on the wedge has been taken into account by simply introducing a constant surface wetting factor as a result the impact force for wedges with small deadrise angle was overestimated the jet flow and flow separation were still neglected in the study most of following analytical models for asymmetric water entry derived from wagner s theory and overcame its drawbacks garabedian 1953 initiated the study of oblique entry problem based on wagner s theory subsequently korobkin 1988 studied the inclined entry of a blunt profile into an ideal fluid at the initial stage toyama 1993 extended wagner s theory by considering the piled up water at the free surface near the wedge which is associated with the pressure distribution and the peak value to predict the slamming pressure distribution on the surface of asymmetric wedges however the flow separation was omitted vorus 1996 extended tulin 1957 s slender surface model to flat cylinder theory following this theory xu et al 1998 studied the asymmetric impact problems the jet formation and initially separated flow due to large asymmetry were investigated they classified the asymmetric impact flow model into two types and demonstrated the role of the inclination angle on the acceleration of a wedge impacting the still water asymmetrically semenov and iafrati 2006 presented a nonlinear analytical self similar solution to the asymmetric water entry flow of a wedge with vertical velocity the flow in the jet was considered as well the free surface elevation contact angles at the intersection with the wedge boundary pressure distribution force and moment coefficients were examined due to the water entry of a wedge is not generally self similar especially for the free fall of asymmetric wedges the boundary element method on the frame of potential flow theory has also been used for the water entry problem xu et al 2008 adopted wu et al 2004 s boundary element method to analyze the free surface elevation pressure distribution over the wedge surface and impact force under the considerations of different deadrise angles and oblique entry with constant velocity in addition the analytical solutions based on the shallow water approximation was used to model the jet flow all theoretical studies provide valuable insight to asymmetric water entry however which are limited to understand the complicated phenomena during water entry the application of refined flow measurements offers a good way to thoroughly study the physics of impact compared to symmetric entry the asymmetry of flow field brings more challenges thus the experiments on the asymmetric cases are quite rare xu et al 1999 conducted a series of experiments to validate xu et al 1998 s method for predicting impact force and moment a wedge with different heel angles and weights was freely dropped from different heights the resulting motions of test models at asymmetric impact include vertical water entry and transverse rolling judge et al 2004 experimentally studied a wedge of 37 deadrise angle with a heel angle of 0 to 34 and an oblique entry velocity initial separation ventilation of the flow near the wedge keel due to asymmetric impact or horizontal vertical impact velocity was observed in their works shams et al 2015 considered a wedge of 37 deadrise angle with a heel angle of 0 to 35 which impacts the quiescent fluid vertically from a fixed height they solved the poisson equation in the fluid domain to reconstruct the pressure field with piv particle image velocimetry data flow field generated by the impact and hydrodynamic force on the wedge was analyzed barjasteh et al 2016 experimentally studied the asymmetric entry as well in their works the wedges entered the water surface with an orthogonal velocity and the influence of initial deadrise angle inclination angle and impact speed and impact pressure were evaluated however the effects of the inclination angle on the pressure and velocity fields have not been analyzed although experimental studies contribute to the thorough understanding of the physics of asymmetric impact the cost is highly with the development of computer science computational fluid dynamics cfd has become an alternative method to solve the water entry problems the cfd method solving the navier stokes equations can reproduce large free surface deformation and flow separation during the penetration one difficulty in the cfd study is how to deal with the interfaces between gas liquid and solid there are meshless and mesh based methods to solve this problem oger et al 2006 adopted a smoothed particles hydrodynamics sph method which is a kind of meshless method to simulate completely free falling wedge impact when a wedge with an initial heel angle freely impacting onto the water surface the linear and angular acceleration of wedge lead to the flow field becoming asymmetry the vertical and angular acceleration and pressure field of the fluid were analyzed mesh based methods for solving the interface include volume of the fluid vof method and level set ls method panahi 2012 introduced a finite volume based moving mesh algorithm to simulate symmetric and asymmetric water entry of wedges the free surface was captured by the compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes cicsam which is a kind of vof method by ubbink and issa 1999 gu et al 2014 developed a numerical model with the free surface captured by the ls function and the partial cell method combined with a local relative velocity approach was applied to treat the motion of moving body the wedges impacted the calm water surface with both vertical and oblique velocities initial separation ventilation of the flow near the wedge keel due to asymmetric impact or horizontal vertical impact velocity were investigated the pressure distribution velocity and pressure field of fluid were presented wei et al 2015 combined the cip method with the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme to study the impact of a wedge on the water surface in a free fall with an initial heel angle the linear and angular acceleration of a wedge of 20 deadrise angle with a heel angle of 5 were compared with those of experiments ghazizade ahsaee and nikseresht 2013 farsi and ghadimi 2015 numerically studied the wedge entering into water asymmetrically as well and their results were encouraging from the above discussion it appears that most of the studies on the water entry of asymmetric wedges focused on the wedges impact water surface with the horizontal velocity component the flow field generated by the asymmetric entry without the horizontal velocity component is distinguished from that by the oblique entry the lack of a systematic study of the flow field for asymmetric water entry only with the vertical velocity component can be clearly seen especially for the velocity field and pressure distribution in this work an improved numerical model is applied to investigate the effect of inclination angles on the penetration velocity and depth of wedges velocity and pressure field maximum pressure coefficient and force acting on the wedges with different deadrise angles in the model a cip method is applied for the flow solver however contrast to wei et al 2015 a more accurate vof type method the tangent of hyperbola for capturing slope weighting thinc sw scheme is adopted to predict free surface and an immersed boundary method is employed to treat moving bodies a wedge impacting on the still water surface with purely vertical velocity is simulated using the proposed model and the results are compared with available experimental and numerical data from the literature the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the governing equations and the numerical methods will be presented the numerical model is validated in section 3 in section 4 the asymmetric water entry of wedges with different deadrise angles and different inclination angles are discussed finally some conclusions are obtained 2 numerical models 2 1 governing equations the fluid is assumed incompressible and viscous which satisfies the mass conservation equation and the navier stokes momentum equations as follows 1 u i x i 0 and 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ s i j x j f i where t is the time ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure x i i 1 2 are the coordinates in a cartesian coordinate system u i i 1 2 are the velocity components f i are the body forces here it represents gravity and s i j is the viscous term given by 3 s i j μ u i x j where μ is the dynamic viscosity the numerical simulation will encounter severe diffusion due to the steep gradients in density and viscosity across the interface the volume function ϕ m m 1 2 3 is used to capture the interface among the three phases the evolution of the volume function is governed by 4 ϕ m t u i ϕ m x i 0 where ϕ m m 1 2 3 are the volume functions of liquid gas and solid the sum of the volume functions of gas liquid and solid is unity everywhere to treat the instabilities at the interface density and viscosity of liquid and solid are assumed to be the same in this study the volume function for solid ϕ 3 is determined by a lagrangian method in which a rigid body is assumed and the volume function for gas ϕ 2 is determined by ϕ 2 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 after all volume functions have been calculated the physical property λ such as the density and viscosity in every cell can be defined as 5 λ m 1 3 ϕ m λ m 2 2 navier stokes solver following hu and kashiwagi 2004 zhao et al 2014 and ye et al 2016 the numerical model is built under a staggered grid system to ensure strong pressure and velocity coupling the finite difference method is adopted to discretize eqs 1 4 on a nonuniform mesh the discretization process is divided into three steps advection phase non advection phase i and non advection phase ii the advection term is firstly solved by a cip scheme yabe and wang 1991 yabe et al 2001 then a centre difference scheme is employed to calculate the non advection phase i the pressure distribution is obtained by solving poisson equation and finally velocity can be updated by a projection method for the sake of brevity the key parts of the model are given in the following eqs 6 9 6 u i t u j u i x j 0 7 u i u i δ t 1 ρ s i j x j f i 8 x i 1 ρ p x i 1 δ t u i x i 9 u i n 1 u i δ t ρ p x i here the superscript indicates the intermediate value after the calcaulation of advection phase superscript indicates the intermediate value after the calcaulation of non advection phase i in the first step we neglect the diffusion term and pressure term then eq 2 is rewritten in a convection equation form and solved by cip method see eq 6 in the next step for the non advection phase i the diffusion term is taken into consideration an euler explicit method is used for the time integration and a central difference scheme is used for the source terms of the spatial derivatives subsequently the renewed intermediate velocities are obtained see eq 7 for the non advection phase ii the velocities are updated by coupling with pressure field with sor successive over relaxation see eqs 8 and 9 finally the total flow field information is updated and this iterative process continues till the end of the computations more details about the flow solver can be found in hu and kashiwagi 2004 and zhao et al 2014 2 3 thinc sw scheme for capturing free surface the thinc sw scheme xiao et al 2011 which is a kind of vof type method is applied to capture the free surface in addition a smoothed hyperbolic tangent heaviside function is used to ensure the density or viscosity vary smoothly in the thinc sw method the slope of the interface is adaptively scaled to a proper thickness according to the interface orientation which significantly improves the geometrical accuracy of the original thinc scheme in thinc sw scheme for the profile of a volume function f 0 f 1 a piecewise hyperbolic tangent function with adjustable parameter is used to interpolate inside an upwind cell which can be described as 10 f i x α 2 1 γ tanh β x x i 1 2 δ x i δ where α γ β are parameters to determine the quality of the numerical solution α and γ are used to avoid interface smearing given as follows 11 α ϕ i 1 i f ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 o t h e r w i s e 12 γ 1 i f ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 1 o t h e r w i s e parameter δ is used to determine the middle point of the transition jump in the hyperbolic tangent function and is solved by 13 1 δ x i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 f i x d x ϕ i n parameter β is a prescribed parameter to control the slope and the thickness of the jump in the interpolation function in the original thinc scheme a constant β 3 5 is usually used that may result in ruffling the interface which aligns nearly in the direction of the velocity to avoid this problem in thinc sw β is determined adaptively according to the orientation of the interface in a 2d case β can be written as 14 β x 2 3 n x 0 001 a n d β y 2 3 n y 0 001 2 4 immersed boundary treatment an immersed boundary method proposed by hu and kashiwagi 2009 is employed for the solid body treatment in this method the fluid solid interface is treated as a set of virtual particles in the first stage of a computation in each time step the governing equations of fluid motion are solved everywhere in the computational domain including the solid then the locations of liquid and solid phases are captured by thinc sw method as a result the velocity coupling fluid and solid is described as follows 15 u i n 1 ϕ 3 u b 1 ϕ 3 u i here u i is the flow velocity u b denotes the local velocity of the solid body after the hydrodynamic force exerting on the solid body is achieved by integrating the pressure on the body surface newton s law is used to compute the body acceleration and velocities more details about solid body treatment can be found in hu and kashiwagi 2009 and zhao and hu 2012 2 5 initial and boundary conditions figs 1 and 2 show the computational domain the flow is described in a cartesian coordinate system o x y the x axis is located at the calm water surface and the y axis lies in the vertical line coinciding with the apex of wedge the size of the computation domain will be given in section 3 a non uniform mesh is employed in the domain to save cpu time the mesh density is large both near the free surface along the y direction and around the wedge in the x direction and decreases gradually away from the impact region and the free surface as presented in fig 3 initial pressure field is set zero on all the rigid boundaries a non slip boundary is used in the computations the density of water is 1 103 kg m3 and for the air 1 25 kg m3 the water has viscosity 1 10 3 kg m s and for the air 1 10 5 kg m s 3 model validation the validation is first carried out in the case of the water entry of a 2d symmetric wedge with a deadrise angle β 0 of 30 the numerical results are compared with those obtained by zhao et al 1996 fig 1 a shows the geometry of the wedge the dimensions of the computational domain are 2 86 m in length and 0 9 m in depth and the water depth is 0 5 m the domain is sufficiently large in all directions to make sure that the wedge moves within the liquid region freely and the simulation results are independent of the domain size for the wedge the breadth b of the test section is 0 5 m the total length of the test section l 1 m the length of the measuring section 0 2 m and the total mass of the drop rig 241 kg to show the mesh resolution convergence three kinds of mesh sizes used are listed in table 1 unless otherwise specified t 0 means the keel point touches the undisturbed water surface for all the following cases the initial vertical velocity is 6 15 m s the present numerical results are compared with the experimental and numerical data obtained by kleefsman et al 2005 oger et al 2006 shown in figs 4 and 6 it can be observed that the numerical results agree well with previous numerical and experimental results for the acceleration which is not provided in the literature fig 5 only displays the computed vertical acceleration used three types of mesh sizes through the results of the velocity vertical acceleration and force computed by the mesh sizes in mesh 1 and mesh 2 mesh convergence is achieved thus mesh 2 will be adopted to the following simulations to save cpu time fig 4 illustrates the variations of wedge velocity against time t at t 0 0 s the free falling wedge touches on the still water surface symmetrically the time series of the vertical forces acting on the wedge are shown in fig 6 from figs 4 and 6 it can be seen that the penetration can be roughly divided into two stages in the first stage for 0 ms t 16 ms the vertical acceleration and force increases rapidly at first which leads to an abruptly decrease of the velocity in the inverse direction and then increases gradually to the peak in the second stage the vertical acceleration and force drop fast after coming up to the peak value resulting in the velocity decrease gradually the numerical results in the present work show a better agreement with the experimental data than those conducted by kleefsman et al 2005 and oger et al 2006 however compared to the experimental data all results obtained by numerical methods overestimate the peak value of impact force which results in wedge entering into the water more slowly this overestimation may be induced by the neglect of three dimensional effects water compressibility and surface tension another important reason is that after the wedge has entered the water the motion of wedge is suppressed by a spring in the experiment which is not taken into account in the numerical simulation to further verify the validation of the numerical model the available experimental data by barjasteh et al 2016 is chosen to take comparison firstly the symmetric cases are examined where the computation domain is 1 122 m in length and 0 681 m in depth the total mass of the wedge is 44 kg and the side length of the wedge is 0 205 m as shown in fig 7 which is similar to that described in the experiment conducted by barjasteh et al 2016 p1 p2 p3 p4 are the pressure sensors used in the experiment instantaneous impact pressure were recorded at 25 khz sampling rate to ensure the sampling rate in the computation is the same as the experiment the time step in the simulation is set to be 4 10 5 s the distance from the keel of the wedge to the water surface is 0 5 m so the initial water entry velocity is 3 13 m s fig 8 illustrates the time series of pressure at p2 when the water depth d is 0 3 m 0 45 m and 0 6 m respectively the comparison confirms that the recorded pressures are independent of the selected water levels therefore the water level is chosen as 0 45 m for all cases to decrease the computing time the left and right wetted lengths r 1 and r 2 and the reference wetted lengths d 1 and d 1 are defined in fig 2 the so called pile up coefficients or wetting factors for the left and right side are defined as r 1 d 1 and r 2 d 2 fig 9 displays the predicted pile up coefficients against the penetration depth where deadrise angle of the wedges varies from 5 to 45 as the side length of the wedge is constant the vertical height of the chine above the apex of the wedge increases with the deadrise angle increasing the computation stops when the whole chine is wetted therefore the penetration depth in fig 9 is smaller as deadrise angles is relatively small as observed by mei 1998 and tveitnes et al 2008 even under free fall the pile up coefficients are nearly constant and reduced with the deadrise angle increasing since the pile up coefficients equal to the value of the position of the maximum pressure plus 1 which will be discussed further in section 4 2 4 numerical results the computation domain and the initial position of the asymmetric wedge is shown in fig 1 b for an asymmetric entry the wedge is counterclockwise rotated by a desired inclination angle ϕ 0 after rotation the deadrise angle of left side becomes β 0 ϕ 0 while the deadrise angle of right side is β 0 ϕ 0 all computation configurations are summarized in table 2 numerical results will be discussed in this section 4 1 penetration depth velocity and pile up analysis the penetration depths of symmetric and asymmetric wedges are shown in fig 10 where fig 10 a shows the results of β 0 20 and fig 10 b gives the results of β 0 30 the penetration depth increases monotonically as a function of time for all symmetrical and asymmetrical wedges with the inclination angle ϕ 0 increasing the influence of the asymmetry is obvious gradually the penetration depth decreases as the inclination angle increases however in the early stage of the impact 0 ms t 5 ms especially for β 0 30 the discrepancy of different inclination angles can be ignored the asymmetry has a significant effect on the penetration depth for the deadrise angle β 0 20 while this effect becomes weak for the deadrise angle β 0 30 see fig 10 a and b fig 11 shows the penetration velocity of symmetric and asymmetric wedges during water entry as the wedge penetrates the water surface the velocity monotonically decreases as penetration depth increases at the onset of water entry the penetration velocity decreases rapidly and the variation tends to be mild as the penetration depth advances the effect of the inclination angles on penetration velocity resembles that on penetration depth as the inclination angle increases asymmetric effects become more significant as well the increment of inclination angle results in the decrease of the wedge velocity and further influence the penetration depth namely reducing the depth as shown in fig 10 it is noted that the influence of asymmetry on water entry is moderate as the deadrise angle increases large inclination angle means the small deadrise angle at the left side consequently the velocity drops more abruptly as estimated by von karman 1929 further explanation can be found in section 4 4 as the wedge asymmetrically penetrates the water surface the water pile up differs between the left and right sides see fig 12 it can be interestingly observed that pile up coefficients are nearly constant under the asymmetric impact and the pile up phenomenon tends to be self similar in addition the effect of the asymmetry on the pile up coefficients decreases with the deadrise and inclination angles increasing which can be concluded by comparing fig 12 a c with fig 12 d f for the symmetric wedge with constant velocity impacting calm water as pointed out by mei et al 1999 and payne 1994 the pile up coefficients vary from 1 to π 2 however for the water entry of asymmetric wedge as shown in fig 12 the pile up coefficients exceed π 2 as the water is pushed from the small deadrise angle side to the large deadrise angle side the pile up coefficients of right side are larger than those of the symmetric wedges with the same deadrise angle and exceed π 2 especially for β 0 20 and the inclination angle ϕ 0 15 as shown in 12 c at the left side the discrepancies between the symmetric wedges and asymmetric wedges are small unfortunately a clear dependence of the pile up coefficients on the inclination angle is difficult to be identified as reported by shams et al 2015 for the wedge with horizontal and vertical velocities impacting the calm water however for a given deadrise angle as the inclination angle raises up the pile up coefficients of the left side decrease while those of the right side increase 4 2 influence of the asymmetry on the pressure field in this section in order to analyze the maximum pressure of asymmetric wedges the maximum pressure coefficient is used 16 c p m a x p m a x 0 5 ρ w v 0 2 where ρ w is the density of water p m a x the maximum pressure over the surface of wedge the initial water entry velocity v 0 2 g h 1 2 3 13 m s fig 13 compares the maximum pressure coefficient in the present work with those obtained by wagner 1932 yettou et al 2006 barjasteh et al 2016 and mei et al 1999 the results agree well with these studies the wagner model neglected air drag cushioning effect and water compressibility and the wedge was also assumed to impacting onto the water surface with constant velocity accordingly wagner s method overestimates the maximum pressure coefficient for small deadrise angles as plotted in fig 14 the predicted pressure distributions on the wetted surface of present work have been compared with the numerical values from toyama 1993 and xu et al 1998 as well as the experimental results from barjasteh et al 2016 the time corresponds to the instant at which the simulated pressure comes up to the peak values as presented in figs 17 and 18 the non dimensional time is calculated as τ v t 0 5 b when the deadrise angle of the left side is 5 the analytical models of toyama 1993 and xu et al 1998 overestimated the pressure coefficients on the left side as the inclination angle decreases the present study agrees well with the other solutions on the left side in particular for the solutions obtained by xu et al 1998 in the case of the right side the comparison shows a fair agreement additionally the wetted length along the wedge surface in the present work is larger than the analytical solution furthermore the positions of the maximum pressure coefficients for different deadrise angles defined as the ratio of the y coordinate of the position of the maximum pressure to the penetration depth of the wedge are plotted in fig 15 the positions of maximum pressures in present work are compared with those by zhao and faltinsen 1993 which evaluated by the similarity solution the asymptotic method and the boundary element method bem respectively the results in fig 15 show that the present predictions for small deadrise angles are lower than other calculations while they are in good agreement when the deadrise angle is larger than 20 as the deadrise angle increases the position becomes lower note that when the deadrise angle is 40 the position of the maximum pressure is located near the keel the positions of the maximum pressures equal to the value of the pile up coefficients subtracting 1 as the wetted length along the wedge surface is larger than the length of the maximum pressure occurring on the wedge surface the results in fig 15 is smaller than the value of the pile up coefficients subtracting 1 the positions of maximum pressure for asymmetric water entry are compared with the analytical results from toyama 1993 in fig 16 the predictions for the left side from present work are higher than analytical results while for the right side are lower than analytical results as the inclination angle increases the position of the maximum pressure becomes lower on the left side while higher on the right side figs 17 and 18 display the pressure field for fluid near the wedges the pressure field in figs 17 and 18 is magnified and the position of the wedges can be determined by the edge of the pressure field the maximum pressure coefficient is in the pile up region and near the spray root of the jet the maximum pressure values on the left side are much larger than those on the right side in accordance with the study of wagner 1932 the large deadrise angle may account for the low impact pressure in the symmetric water entry problem as disclosed in fig 13 it is reasonable to attribute the increment of the wetted breadth to the decrease of the deadrise angle consequently it will generate a jumping up of the impact pressure fig 19 shows the pressure field after flow separation on the two sides of the wedge it is found that the pressure on the two sides decreases when the flow separates moreover the maximum pressure values on the right side are larger than those on the left side in order to study the evolution of the pressure field during water entry fig 20 presents the pressure field of β 0 30 ϕ 0 15 for both chines dry and wet fig 19 b presents the pressure field of β 0 30 ϕ 0 15 for left chine wet and right chine dry it can be seen from figs 18 d 19 b and 20 the maximum pressure values of the left side increase until reaching the maximum pressure values in 18 d after the left chine wet the maximum values of pressure field move from the left side to the right side and the maximum pressure values decreasing as the penetration depth increases it can be observed that the effect of the asymmetry on the pressure field increases as the inclination angle becomes larger meanwhile the pressure at the left side increases but declines at the right side which leads to the asymmetry distribution of the pressure field a larger inclination angle indicates a decrease of the left side deadrise angle and a rise of the corresponding impact pressure similar analysis can also be made for the pressure reduction at the right side to investigate the interaction between the deadrise angles of both sides the maximum pressure coefficient in fig 17 b is compared with the symmetric results in fig 21 the pressure peak for β l 15 in fig 17 b is smaller than those obtained by the symmetric water entry for β 0 15 in fig 21 a the reason is β 0 β r thus the wetted breadth of a symmetric wedge with β 0 15 is larger than a asymmetric wedge with β l 15 the similar explanation can be given for the maximum pressure for β r 25 in fig 17 b is larger than β 0 25 in fig 21 b 4 3 influence of the asymmetry on the velocity field figs 22 and 23 illustrate the contours of velocity near the wedges which correspond to the pressure fields at the different time instants discussed in section 4 2 for the symmetric impact in fig 22 a the flow is symmetric and the maximum flow velocity is in the pile up region where a water jet is formed however the flow field is no longer symmetric for the asymmetric impact therefore the velocity at the left side is larger than that at the right side and the deadrise angle of the left side is smaller than the right as the inclination angle increases the maximum flow velocity increases at the left side whereas it decreases at the right side it can also be found that the discrepancy of maximum flow velocity for β 0 30 with different inclination angles is small while that for β 0 20 is remarkable after the flow separation the tendency of the maximum velocity is the same as the pressure field as shown in fig 24 the results in figs 23 d 24 b and 25 show the evolution of velocity field for β 0 30 ϕ 0 15 as the penetration depth increases the maximum velocity values of the fluid field increase after the left chine wet the maximum velocity values move from the left side to right it can be seen that the maximum flow velocity is in the pile up region for both symmetrical and asymmetrical wedges similar results have been reported by semenov and iafrati 2006 and shams et al 2015 where the maximum flow velocity was in the pile up region only for small inclination angles different from their results the maximum value of flow velocity is attained in the pile up region for all cases no matter the inclination angle is small or not the reason is that the purely vertical velocity of the wedge is taken into account in the present study 4 4 impact force the vertical impact force on the wedge during the water impact can be given by 17 f f v m g m a where f is the vertical impact force f v is the vertical force m is mass of the wedge a is the acceleration of the wedge fig 26 illustrates the vertical impact force on the wedges it is found that the increment of the peak value of impact force is accompanied by an increase of the inclination angle especially for β 0 20 the peak value is nearly doubled when the inclination angle ranges from 5 to 15 additionally when the deadrise angle is constant the peak value of the impact force happens earlier for a lager inclination angle as seen in eq 17 when the vertical impact force becomes larger the acceleration of the wedge with a constant mass becomes larger thus the velocity of wedge drops more abruptly as presented in fig 11 as reported by fairlie clarke and tveitnes 2008 the ratio of the gravity to the vertical impact force decreases as the deadrise angle decreases with the increase of the inclination angle correspondingly the deadrise angle of the left side decreases as a result the vertical impact force and the acceleration of the wedge are small for ϕ 0 5 tveitnes et al 2008 revealed that the vertical impact force is composed of the hydrostatic force a residual gravity force and a hydrodynamic force at the onset of water entry impact force is dominated by the change rate of added mass momentum and rises quickly until the wedge gets wetted after the wedge is wetted the added mass flow momentum force and residual gravity force reduces but the upward hydrostatic force rises as a result the total impact force decreases it is noted that the penetration velocity of wedge first decreases rapidly and then decreases gradually compared to β 0 20 the change rate of peak value for β 0 30 is insignificant which is consistent with the penetration velocity of wedges presented in fig 11 5 conclusions in this work we have studied the water entry of asymmetric wedges using a cip based method numerical results of symmetric water entry are initially compared with available experimental data the good agreements reveal the ability of our model to solve the water entry problems the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the initial deadrise and inclination angles have significant effect on the penetration depth wedge velocity and pile up coefficients as the inclination angle increases the decrease of the wedge velocity can result in reduction of the penetration depth and the pile up coefficients increase on the right side while decrease on the other side 2 the pressure and velocity fields of the asymmetric impact are different from those of symmetric impact the location of the maximum pressure becomes lower on the smaller deadrise angle side while higher on the other side as the inclination angle increases when the inclination angle is 15 the maximum pressure value becomes larger specifically for asymmetric wedges with pure vertical velocity the present studies indicate that the maximum flow velocity is always in the pile up region even for a large inclination angle 3 furthermore it is found that the impact force on the wedge is strongly influenced by the inclination angle the larger the inclination angle the higher the peak value is for β 0 20 the peak value is nearly doubled when the inclination angle ranges from 5 to 15 4 comparing the asymmetric water entry results for β 0 20 and β 0 30 it is clear that wedges with small deadrise angles are more sensitive to the inclination angle than those with large deadrise angle acknowledgement this study was partially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos

23679,the laying of subsea pipelines often produces situations where the pipeline is suspended above the seabed due to local erosion of sediment in this paper flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder close to a plane boundary in an oscillatory flow is studied through two dimensional numerical simulations the circular cylinder and the plane boundary represents a pipeline and the seabed respectively it is found that the plane boundary affects the vibration amplitude in the cross flow direction significantly the vibration in the vertical direction ceases if reduced velocity exceeds 6 for kc 5 and 12 for kc 10 respectively the vibration in the cross flow direction stops when the reduced velocity exceeds a critical value because the effective kc number and the effective reduced velocity which are both based on the relative velocity of the cylinder to the fluid motion are extremely small for kc 10 the vortex shedding is found to be in one pair regime for most of the reduced velocities and non vortex shedding regime exists at large reduced velocities because the shear layers generated from the plane boundary attract the vortices generated from the cylinder vortex shedding

suspended when local scour i e the erosion of the seabed sediment below the pipeline occurs the suspension of a pipeline may cause the vibration of the pipeline the vibration of a suspended pipeline caused by waves and currents can lead to a catastrophic pipeline failure low and srinil 2016 because the vibration is generated by the vortex shedding flow the vibration of cylindrical structures in fluid flows are generally called vortex induced vibration viv the aim of this paper is to investigate the viv of a circular cylinder close to a plane boundary in oscillatory flow while many experimental and numerical studies have been performed to understand the dynamics of viv in steady flow viv of a circular cylinder in an oscillatory flow has received much less attention vortex induced vibration of cylinders in the cross flow direction has been discussed extensively in review articles bearman 1984 parkinson 1989 sarpkaya 1979 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 the classic experimental study of viv of an elastically mounted cylinder in wind by feng 1968 where the mass damping parameter the product of mass ratio and damping ratio is quite high shows that the response can be divided into two branches namely the initial and the upper branches williamson and roshko 1988 conducted experiments of forced vibration of a cylinder in the cross flow direction in a fluid flow and found the relation between the amplitude of the cylinder and the vortex shedding characteristics by conducting experiments of vibration of a cylinder in water flows khalak and williamson 1999 identified three branches of the response when the mass damping is low blevins and coughran 2009 and jauvtis and williamson 2004 studied two degree of freedom 2dof viv of a circular cylinder in steady flows and found that the trajectories of the cylinder vibration were strongly dependant on the reduced velocity laneville 2006 found that the vortex shedding modes were influenced by the x y motion of the circular cylinders govardhan and williamson 2006 found that the effect of the reynolds number should be taken into account in addition to the mass damping when evaluating viv in the offshore oil and gas engineering cylindrical structures such as subsea pipelines are subject to oscillatory flows very limited experimental and numerical studies of viv of cylinders in oscillatory flow are available in literature kozakiewicz et al 1994 1996 and sumer and fredsøe 1988 conducted experimental studies of one degree of freedom 1dof vibration of a cylinder in the cross flow direction in an oscillatory flow for kc numbers ranging from 5 to 100 the kc number is defined as kc u m t d where u m is the velocity amplitude t is the period of the oscillatory flow and d is the diameter of the cylinder it was found that the response pattern of the cylinder at a constant kc number varies with the reduced velocity one of the typical characteristics of the response of a cylinder in the oscillatory flow is that the frequency of the vibration is multiple of the frequency of the oscillatory flow anagnostopoulos and iliadis 1998 simulated the in line vibration of a circular cylinder in oscillatory flow numerically for re 200 and kc numbers between 2 and 20 it was observed that the large oscillation amplitude at resonance has a significant effect on the flow pattern and the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder some numerical studies of 2dof viv of a circular cylinder in the oscillatory flow show that the trajectory of the vibration is strongly dependent on the kc number and the reduced velocity zhao et al 2013 zhao et al 2012 simulated 1dof viv of a circular cylinder in the cross flow direction of the oscillatory flow and showed that the viv modes observed in the laboratory can be well predicted by the numerical model based on the rans equations lipsett and williamson 1994 conducted laboratory tests in a u tube to study the xy trajectories of vibration by changing kc number from 2 to 60 and the ratio of natural frequency in water to the frequency of oscillation of the u tube from 1 to 9 zhao 2013 also performed 2dof numerical study on viv of circular cylinder subject to oscillatory flow it was observed that as the kc number increases the vibration becomes irregular and chaotic with increasing amplitude of the vibration for a fixed cylinder close to a plane boundary in a steady flow it was demonstrated that the vortex shedding will be suppressed for a small cylinder to boundary gap ratio bearman and zdravkovich 1978 taniguchi and miyakoshi 1990 buresti and lanciotti 1992 lei et al 1999 ong et al 2010 vibration of a circular cylinder in steady flow close to a plane boundary was investigated in a few papers yang et al 2008 zhao and cheng 2011 hsieh et al 2016 vibration of a subsea pipeline also has significant effect on the local scour i e the erosion of the seabed sediment below the pipeline yang et al 2008 zhao and cheng 2010 gao et al 2006 the results of experimental studies tsahalis and jones 1981 tsahalis 1984 suggested that the cylinder undergoes an oval shape motion in contrast to the common figure eight of viv in steady flow if the gap between the cylinder and the plane boundary is equal to cylinder diameter fredsøe et al 1987 found that the transverse vibration frequency is close to the frequency of the vortex shedding of a stationary cylinder if the reduced velocity is less than 3 and the gap ratio is greater than 0 3 for reduced velocity between 3 v r 8 and 0 e d 1 where e is the distance between the bottom of the cylinder and the plane boundary the transverse vibrating frequency is quite different from the vortex shedding frequency of a stationary cylinder moreover jacobsen et al 1984 and tsahalis 1984 studied vibration of a flexible cylinder near a plane boundary in combined waves and currents chioukh and narayanan 1997 conducted an experimental study of transverse vibrations of elastically mounted cylinders over a plane boundary in waves it was found that a cylinder can vibrate even when the initial gap ratio between the cylinder and the plane boundary is very small in this study two dimensional numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the effects of a plane boundary on viv of a circular cylinder subject to an oscillatory flow the cylinder oscillates in both the transverse and inline directions with respect to the flow the reynolds number and the mass ratio are defined as r e u m d ν and m m π ρ d 2 4 respectively where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid m is the mass of cylinder and ρ is the density of the fluid the reynolds number the mass ratio and the damping ratio are selected as 5000 2 and 0 respectively simulations are carried out for two keulegan carpenter kc numbers of 5 and 10 and four gap ratios e d of 0 01 0 4 1 and the range of reduced velocities considered in the simulations is from 1 to 15 the reduced velocity is defined as v r u m f n d where f n is the natural frequency of the cylinder the focus of the study is to investigate the effect of the gap ratio e d on the inline and cross flow vibrations of the circular cylinder

section 6 2 numerical method the oscillatory flow around an elastically mounted circular cylinder close to a plane boundary as shown in fig 1 is simulated numerically using two dimensional simulations the fluid velocity of the oscillatory flow is expressed as 1 u 1 t u m cos 2 π t t and u 2 t 0 where u i is the fluid velocity component in the x i direction x 1 x and x 2 y are the cartesian coordinates parallel and perpendicular to the plane boundary respectively and t is the time the vortex structures behind a fixed cylinder at re 5000 are three dimensional aljure et al 2017 the governing equations for simulating the turbulent flow are the unsteady two dimensional incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and the shear stress transport sst k ω model menter 1994 is used to simulate the turbulence in this study the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method is applied to deal with the moving boundaries of the cylinder the ale form of the rans equations in the cartesian coordinate system is expressed as 2 u i x i 0 3 u i t u j u ˆ j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j 2 ν s i j u i u j where u ˆ j is the moving mesh velocity the reynolds stress tensor u i u j is computed by u i u j ν t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ks ij where ν t is the turbulent viscosity k is the turbulent energy and s i j is the mean strain tensor respectively defined as s i j u i x j u j x i 2 the rans equations and the k ω turbulence equations are solved by the same petrov galerkin method that has been used in zhao 2013 a 50d long and 13d high rectangular computational domain is used for the numerical simulations the cylinder static balance position is initially located at the centre of the computational domain and at a gap e static balance position above the plane boundary the boundary conditions for the governing equations of fluid flow are as follows at the surfaces of the cylinders and the plane boundary the no slip boundary condition is employed i e the fluid velocity is the same as the vibrating velocity of the cylinder on the cylinder surface and zero on the plane boundary the specific dissipation rate ω is given at the nodal points next to the wall surface as ω 6 δ 1 ν where δ1 is the distance from the wall on the left and right boundaries the velocity is given based on eq 1 and pressure is given based on the gradient of the undisturbed incoming flow velocity in the x direction as p x b 2 π t sin 2 π t t where x b is the x coordinate of the boundary symmetric boundary condition is used on the top surface of the domain the 2dof equation of the motion for the displacement of the cylinder is 4 m d 2 x i d t 2 c d x i d t k x i f i where x 1 x and x 2 y are the displacements of the cylinder in the x and y directions respectively m c and k are the mass the damping coefficient and the stiffness of the system respectively f i is the hydrodynamic force in the x i direction which is calculated by integrating the pressure and shear stress over the cylinder surface the fourth order runge kutta method is used to solve the equation of motion the deformation of the mesh due to the displacement of the cylinder is calculated by zhao and cheng 2011 5 γ a i 0 where a i represents the displacement of the nodal points in the x i direction γ is a parameter that controls the mesh deformation which is set to be γ 1 a in a finite element with a being the area of the element the displacement of the mesh nodes is the same as the displacement of the cylinder on the cylinder surface to allow the mesh to slide along the plane boundary the gradient of a 1 in the y direction is zero and a 2 is zero on the plane boundary on other boundaries the displacement of the mesh nodes are zero in both x and y directions by giving the displacements at all the boundaries eq 5 is solved by a galerkin finite element method collision between the cylinder and the plane boundary may happen if e d is very small to avoid over distortion of the mesh between the cylinder and the rigid plane boundary during the computations the cylinder is forced to be bounced back when the distance between the cylinder and the plane boundary reaches 0 01d a very small initial gap of 0 01d is expected to enable the numerical setup to represent the case of a cylinder initially on a plane boundary zhao and cheng 2011 after the cylinder is bounced back from the plane boundary the horizontal velocity remains unchanged while the vertical velocity reverses with the unchanged magnitude fig 2 shows an example of the computational mesh near the cylinder for an initial gap ratio of e d 0 01 the computational domain is divided into 35248 quadrilateral linear finite elements for this case the minimum non dimensional mesh size in the radial direction next to the cylinder surface is 0 0032d the normalized distance is defined as y u f δ 1 ν where u f is the friction velocity used to estimate the near wall mesh density the maximum y near the gap is less than 3 when the gap between the cylinder and the bed reaches its minimum the y outside of the gap is always less than 1 3 comparison with experimental results the numerical model used in the simulations is validated against the results of the laboratory tests of viv of a cylinder in oscillatory flow generated in a u tube by lipsett and williamson 1994 who conducted experiments using u tube with a width of 600 mm and three cylinders with different diameters the results of the cylinder with d 63 8 mm corresponding to a u tube width to cylinder diameter ratio of 9 4 are used to validate the numerical model lipsett and williamson 1994 defined the ratio of the reynolds number to the kc number as the frequency parameter for the 63 8 mm diameter cylinder the frequency parameter was 1250 in the experiments in the tests the mass ratio is 1 and the damping ratio measured in water is 0 05 numerical simulations of viv of a cylinder in a uniform oscillatory flow are performed under same parameters as those used in the experiments except the damping ratio the structural natural frequency and the structural damping ratio are needed in the numerical simulations the structural damping ratio could not be measured directly because the spring was very soft lipsett and williamson 1994 in the numerical simulations the structural damping ratio is set as zero in the experiments the reduced velocity is defined based on the natural frequency measured in water in this study the natural frequency in water and the reduced velocity based on the natural frequency measured in water are defined as f nw and v r w u m f n w d respectively the natural frequency measured in water by lipsett and williamson 1994 is converted to the structural natural frequency measured in vacuum based on the relationship of f n f n w c a m m where c a is the added mass coefficient equal to 1 the xy trajectories of the cylinder response are obtained numerically for a range of kc number from 2 to 60 and ratio of natural frequency of the cylinder in water to the frequency of oscillation of the u tube f nw f w from 1 to 9 fig 3 shows the comparison of the xy trajectories between the laboratory tests and the present numerical simulations it can be seen that the xy trajectories obtained from the numerical model are very close to the results obtained from the laboratory tests it is further observed that the xy trajectories are symmetric about the vertical axis at x d 0 the vibration trajectory depends on both the kc number and the reduced velocity 4 numerical results of viv of a cylinder close to a plane boundary the reynolds number the mass ratio m and the damping ratio of the cylinder are 5000 2 and 0 respectively in all the numerical simulations the gap ratios e d used in this study are 0 01 0 4 1 and where e d represents the case of viv of a circular cylinder in a uniform oscillatory flow without a plane boundary simulations are carried out for reduced velocities ranging from 1 to 15 to ensure a steady state vibration has been achieved simulation for each case is performed for at least 20 periods of the oscillatory flow the time histories for several typical cases with kc 5 and 10 are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively if the collision between the cylinder and the plane boundary occurs the maximum displacement of the cylinder in the downward direction is the same as the cylinder to boundary gap in some cases the cylinder reaches the plane boundary and is bounced back a number of times in one flow period for example the cylinder hits the plane boundary twice in one period of the oscillatory flow at kc e d v r 5 0 01 4 and four times when kc e d v r 10 0 01 4 and in these two cases high amplitude jump and low amplitude jump of the cylinder occur alternatively i e every high jump is followed by a low jump and vice versa sometimes every high jump of the cylinder is followed by two low jumps for example when kc e d v r 10 0 4 8 in some cases the maximum height of the cylinder vibration in the vertical direction does not have obvious change for example when kc e d v r 5 0 4 5 the dynamics of vortex induced vibrations viv of the cylinder become highly complex and nonlinear due to the presence of plane boundary as the kc number increases from 5 to 10 as the gap ratio e d is increased from 0 01 to the effect of plane boundary on viv reduces the effect of plane boundary on the vibration of the cylinder is small when e d 1 because the vibration appears to be symmetric with its static balance position and the cylinder does not collide with the plane boundary as shown in fig 4 e and f fig 6 shows the amplitude spectra of the response in the cross flow direction and the xy trajectories for some representative cases for kc 5 the cylinder vibrates mostly with double frequency mode for all the gap ratios i e the cylinder attains its maximum amplitude twice in one oscillatory flow cycle and the corresponding xy trajectories are regular and repeatable in some cases the spectrum of the cross flow vibration is dominated by the oscillatory flow frequency mainly because the vibration in one half period is very different from that in the other half period if the vibration is strictly symmetric i e the vibration in the first half period is exactly the same as that in the second half there is only double frequency component in the spectrum as shown in fig 6 e at large reduced velocities see fig 6 f the cylinder only goes up and down once in one period of the flow leading to a single frequency vibration mode fig 7 shows the amplitude spectra of the cylinder response in the cross flow direction and the xy trajectories for kc 10 the cylinder vibrates mostly with a multiple frequency mode and the amplitude spectra is broad banded with some exceptions for example kc e d v r 10 0 4 2 and kc e d v r 10 1 10 the pre dominant frequency ratio f f w varies between 1 and 4 depending on the reduced velocity the amplitude spectra with multiple peaks correspond to the cases where the vibration mode is transitioning from one frequency mode to the other frequency mode when the reduced velocity is 2 there are two vibration periods in half period of the oscillatory flow resulting in a vibration frequency four times the oscillatory flow frequency when the cylinder vibrates mostly in a distinct double or single frequency mode the corresponding xy trajectories are regular and repeatable for example kc e d v r 10 4 the xy trajectories for v r 11 5 are not shown because the vibration is pre dominantly in the x direction and the amplitude in the cross flow direction is negligibly small fig 8 a d shows the variations of the maximum and minimum displacements in both the inline and cross flow directions with the reduced velocity for kc 5 fig 8 e shows the variation of the vibration frequency f y f w in the cross flow direction with the reduced velocity for kc 5 the response frequencies for v r 6 are not shown in fig 8 because the vibration amplitudes in the cross flow direction are nearly zero and the vibration is very irregular collision between the cylinder and the plane boundary occurs in the reduced velocity range of 2 v r 5 5 for e d 0 01 and 0 4 and does not occur at any reduced velocities for e d 1 both y max d and y min d vary with reduced velocity oscillatorily for e d 1 and where the cylinder does not reach the plane boundary the oscillatory nature of the response at e d 1 and is that y max d and y min d drop suddenly at around v r 4 sumer and fredsøe 1988 reported that if the cylinder is only allowed to vibrate in the cross flow direction in a uniform oscillatory flow the multiple peak behaviour of the vibration amplitude with the reduced velocity occurs because lock in occurs several times in this study lock in in the cross flow direction does not occur after reduced velocity exceeds 6 because the response amplitude becomes zero in this study a lock in range of the reduced velocity is defined as the range between the starting reduced velocity of the first lock in and the ending reduced velocity of the last lock in when multiple lock in occurs for kc 5 the lock in range is found to be between 2 and 5 5 for all the gap ratios the variations of x max d and x min d with the reduced velocity do not change significantly as the gap ratio changes except in the lock in range the magnitudes x max d and x min d are not exactly the same as each other in some cases because the vibration is not symmetric as demonstrated in fig 7 the amplitude of the oscillatory motion of the fluid particles is defined as a fluid and is related to the kc number as a f l u i d d k c 2 π it is interesting that the amplitude of the cylinder in the in line direction is greater than the amplitude of the fluid motion in the reduced velocity range of 3 v r 7 when the reduced velocity is greater than 7 the amplitude of the cylinder is slightly smaller than the amplitude of the fluid motion lipsett and williamson 1994 found that an integer number of transverse response cycles were completed for each in line cycle when studying viv of a cylinder in an oscillatory flow in both in line and cross flow directions since the vibration frequency in the cross flow direction is generally multiple of the oscillatory flow frequency zhao 2013 named the response modes to be double triple and quadruple frequency modes etc the minimum values of y max d and y min d occur at v r 4 5 and 4 for e d 1 and respectively it can be seen from fig 8 that at these two reduced velocities where the vibration amplitude is the minimum the response frequency changes from one mode to the other however if the cylinder collides with the plane boundary at small gap ratios of e d 0 01 and 0 4 the multiple peak behaviour of the response disappears the reduction in the response amplitude at the boundary reduced velocity between two response modes is not observed and the response amplitude is consistently high in the lock in range of the reduced velocity fig 9 shows the variations of the maximum and minimum displacements of the cylinder in both the inline and cross flow directions and the vibration frequency in the cross flow direction with the reduced velocity for kc 10 compared with that for kc 5 the high amplitude response reduced velocity range is widened for both e d 0 01 and 0 4 collision between the cylinder and the plane boundary occurs in the reduced velocity range of 2 v r 12 which is the whole lock in range when e d multiple maximum values of the response amplitude in the cross flow direction are also observed at v r 3 5 5 and 11 5 respectively and the minimum response amplitudes in the cross flow direction occur at reduced velocities where the vibration frequency changes for e d 0 01 0 4 and 1 the minimum values of y max d are not obvious and high amplitude is observed in the entire lock in regime the amplitude of the vibration in the cross flow direction is generally higher than its counterpart at kc 5 the effects of plane boundary on the viv become negligible when the gap ratio e d is 1 and similar to the observation for kc 5 the maximum and minimum displacements x max d and x min d in the in line direction are also almost symmetric to each other with some exceptions due to the symmetry of the flow and the system in the in line direction as in the case of kc 5 the vibration of the cylinder in the in line direction is always dominated by the oscillatory flow frequency because the inertia force on the cylinder due to the oscillation of the fluid contributes to the vibration more than the vortex shedding compared with that of kc 5 the maximum amplitude in the inline direction is significantly increased at kc 10 the maximum amplitude of the cylinder displacement in the in line direction with kc 10 occurs at v r 10 where the oscillation flow frequency is close to the natural frequency of the cylinder the vibration of the cylinder in the inline direction is found to be dominated by the frequency of the oscillatory flow for both kc 5 and 10 when a cylinder vibrates in both the inline and the cross flow directions the velocity of the cylinder in the in line direction relative to the fluid will be reduced if the cylinder movement in the inline direction is in phase with the fluid velocity and increased if the former is out of phase with the latter then the effective reduced velocity and kc number will be altered the phase difference between the displacement of the fluid motion defined as x f and the displacement of the cylinder vibration defined as x is discussed based on eq 1 the displacement of the fluid motion is calculated according to x f u m t 2 π sin 2 π t t the cross correlation coefficient between x f t and x t is defined as c τ and is calculated using n periods of data by c τ 1 n t 0 n t x f t x f x t τ x d t σ x f σ x where τ is the time lag σ x f and σ x are the standard deviations of x f t and x t respectively and x f and x are the mean values of x f t and x t respectively it is seen from the definition that the cross correlation varies with τ periodically and its period is the same as the period of the oscillatory flow the cross correlation coefficient c τ for 0 τ t is calculated and the maximum value of c τ is denoted by c m if x f and x are perfectly correlated c m 1 the phase between x f and x is defined as φ φ x f φ x where φ x f and φ x are the phases of vibrations of x f and x respectively the time lag corresponding to the maximum value of c m is defined as τ m and time lag is converted to the phase difference by φ 2 π τ m t fig 10 a and b shows the correlation between the oscillation displacement of the fluid particles and the cylinder displacement in the x direction as a function of reduced velocity excellent correlation between the oscillatory flow and the displacement of the cylinder in the x directions is observed for most of the gap ratios except for e d 0 4 and small reduced velocities where the correlation coefficient is still greater than 0 75 since the oscillation of the fluid and the vibration of the cylinder are correlated well the phase difference φ between the fluid motion and the cylinder vibration is calculated and shown in fig 10 c and d the positive and negative phase angles indicate that the phase of the cylinder motion lags and leads the fluid motion respectively when the reduced velocity is very small the oscillatory flow is nearly out of phase with the inline displacement of the fluid i e the cylinder moves in the opposition of the fluid motion it can be seen that the phase of the cylinder motion leads that of the fluid motion and the magnitude of the phase difference decreases almost linearly with increasing v r until v r 6 for kc 5 and v r 12 and for kc 10 after the reduced velocity exceeds the upper boundary of the lock in regime the phase difference remains nearly zero the closeness between the amplitudes of the cylinder motion and fluid motion and the in phase between displacements of the cylinder and fluid particles at large reduced velocities indicate that the cylinder moves passively with the fluid at large reduced velocities if both the cylinder and the fluid oscillate in the x direction the flow characteristics and the vibration of the cylinder depend on the relative velocity of the undisturbed fluid motion to the cylinder the relative velocity of the fluid motion in the x direction to the cylinder is defined as u r e l t u m cos 2 π t t d x d t and the effective reduced velocity and the effective kc number are calculated by v r e f f u m r e l f n d and k c e f f u m r e l t d where u m rel is the maximum value of u r e l t the effective reduced velocity and the effective kc number are shown in fig 11 it can be seen that for kc 5 both the effective reduced velocity and the effective kc number reach their minimum values at about v r 7 the effective kc number is less than 2 when v r 6 for all the gap ratios for a stationary cylinder in an oscillatory flow the flow is symmetric and no vortex shedding occurs as kc 4 williamson 1985 for kc 5 the vibration of the cylinder in the cross flow direction ceases when v r 6 because the effective kc number is extremely small 2 for kc 10 both the effective reduced velocity and the effective kc number reach their minimum values at about v r 14 except for e d 0 4 for all the gap ratios both v r e f f and k c e f f are very small in the range of 12 5 v r 15 this explains why the vibration of the cylinder in the cross flow direction ceases when 12 5 v r 15 the effective kc number is small at large reduced velocities because the fluid motion and the cylinder motion are in phase with each other as shown in fig 10 and the amplitude of the cylinder and that of the fluid motion are very close to each other as shown in fig 8 5 vortex shedding when a stationary cylinder is placed in an oscillatory flow the vortex shedding flow is classified into different regimes based on the number of vortex pairs that are shed from the cylinder during one period of the oscillatory flow the flow is in the mode of pair of attached vortices when kc 5 where a pair of asymmetric vortices are generated from the cylinder in half cycle but vortex shedding does not occur and one pair regime when kc 10 where a pair of vortices are shed from only one side of the cylinder williamson 1985 if the circular cylinder is allowed to vibrate it is found that in addition to kc number and reduced velocity the number of vortex pair that are shed from the cylinder in one oscillatory flow is also dependent upon the gap ratio e d in addition to the gap ratio the vortex shedding also depends on the relative velocity between fluid motion and cylinder inline motion and the effective kc number fig 12 shows the flow structure for kc 10 and v r 2 for one oscillatory flow cycle when the gap ratio e d and the corresponding instants of vorticity contours in the time histories of cross flow direction the two vortices a and b grow in size until the flow reverses after that vortex a is swept back on the cylinder to form two new vortices c and d before being shed in the meantime vortex b is shed from the bottom of the cylinder fig 12b in the second half cycle vortices a and d are swept back on the cylinder and another two new vortices e and f are generated vortex c is shed from the bottom of the cylinder fig 12d in one cycle of the oscillatory flow vortices b and c are shed from the cylinder forming a one pair vortex shedding pattern because the vibration amplitudes of the cylinder in both the in line and the cross flow directions are very small the effective kc eff almost equals to kc it is further found that the flow structure in this case replicates the regime d found by tatsuno and bearman 1990 in their flow visualization experiment around a stationary cylinder subject to an oscillatory flow with kc 6 28 high frequency vibration is observed because each vortex that is shed from the cylinder attacks the cylinder after the flow reverses resulting in a high frequency force fig 13 shows the vorticity contours and the time histories of the vibration in the cross flow direction within one flow cycle for kc 10 and v r 5 when gap ratio e d vortex a and b are shed from the previous oscillatory flow it can be seen from fig 13 b that two vortices c and d are shed from the cylinder in the first half of oscillatory flow because vortex c is actually separated from the main negative vortex and is extremely weak it has little effect on the vibration the flow structure in the second half cycle is identical to the one in the first half cycle in one cycle two vortices d and e are shed from the cylinder forming an one pair vortex shedding pattern the two vortices c and h are too weak to have influences on the flow it was shown by zhao 2013 that the vibration frequency normalized by the flow frequency is equal to the number of vortex pair shed from the cylinder plus one since one pair of vortex is shed from the cylinder for this reduced velocity therefore the vibration frequency is twice the flow frequency fig 14 shows the vorticity contours and time histories of the cylinder in the cross flow direction in one flow cycle for kc 10 and v r 9 5 when gap ratio e d one pair of vortex is shed from the cylinder vortex a is the one that is shed from the cylinder before the flow direction changes from negative to positive when the flow direction is positive fig 14 b and c vortex b is shed from the cylinder the cylinder vibration frequency in the cross flow direction is twice the oscillatory flow frequency because the flow reversals contribute to the increase of the vibration frequency it is also observed that the large vibration amplitude of the cylinder in the x direction results in a relative velocity less than the oscillatory flow velocity as a result the effective kc number is also reduced to around 6 it can be concluded from the vorticity contours and frequency plot for kc 10 in fig 9 e that one pair of vortex is shed from the cylinder in one flow cycle for reduced velocity range of 3 5 v r 9 5 the cylinder vibration frequency in the cross flow direction is very close to the natural frequency at v r 5 therefore maximum amplitude is observed at this reduced velocity as the reduced velocity is increased beyond v r 5 the vibration frequency desynchronizes with the natural frequency consequently lowest amplitude is observed at v r 9 5 the effective kc is around 6 when v r 9 5 it is also clear from relative velocity plot of fig 11e that the v r eff increases with increasing reduced velocity and reaches maximum at around v r 8 5 after which it decreases hence the timing of the vortex shedding changes with reduced velocity due to the changing of v r eff and kc eff fig 15 shows the vorticity contours and the time histories of the cylinder displacement in the cross flow direction during one flow period for kc 10 v r 11 and a gap ratio e d the negative vortex at the top of the cylinder does not change its shape and strength throughout the whole cycle no vortex shedding is observed mainly because the effective kc number is very small the main positive vortex and the main negative vortex are found to rotate around the cylinder the same flow structure is repeated in each oscillatory flow period hence the corresponding xy trajectories are regular and repeatable the cylinder vibration frequency in the y direction is the same as the oscillatory flow frequency fig 16 shows the vorticity contours in one flow cycle for kc 10 v r 15 and gap ratio e d the effective kc number is extremely small at large reduced velocities because the fluid motion and the cylinder motion are in phase with each other as shown in fig 10 and have almost the same amplitude as shown in fig 8 as a result of this very small effective kc number 2 extremely weak vortices are observed for this reduced velocity and the vibration of the cylinder is only in the in line direction the flow structure for kc 10 v r 10 and e d 0 4 is shown in fig 17 there is significant influence of the shear layer from the plane boundary on the vortex shedding from the cylinder the cylinder also collides with the plane boundary once in each flow cycle in this case the changes of the vortices far away from the cylinder within a cycle can hardly be identified when the cylinder moves in the left direction one positive vortex is shed from the cylinder this vortex is shed from the cylinder mainly because of the collision of the cylinder with the plane boundary which disconnects the shear layer at the bottom of the cylinder as shown in fig 17 a the positive vortices that are shed from the bottom right of the cylinder merge into a large positive vortex at the right hand side of the cylinder when the cylinder is moving in the right direction no vortex shedding is observed however small negative vortices are found to split from the cylinder when the cylinder collides with the plane boundary and these negative vortices further merge into the main negative vortex to the left of the cylinder because the flow in one half cycle is different from that in the other half cycle the vibration frequency is the same as the oscillation flow frequency since the cylinder collides with the plane boundary sufficiently large amplitude is observed at this reduced velocity when the cylinder is close to a plane boundary the vortices are found to be shed only from the bottom side of the cylinder regardless of the reduced velocity because the vorticity of shear layers generated from the plane boundary and the shear layer generated from bottom of the cylinder have opposite directions to each other the shear layers from the plane boundary attract the vortices generated from the cylinder and lead to vortex shedding from the bottom side of the cylinder 6 conclusions vortex induced vibration of an elastically mounted circular cylinder close to a plane boundary and in an oscillatory flow is numerically investigated the study is aimed to investigate the effects of the interaction between the cylinder and the plane boundary on the vibration amplitude simulations are carried out for two kc numbers of 5 and 10 four gap ratios of 0 01 0 4 1 and and reduced velocities ranging from 1 to 15 the effect of gap ratio e d on the viv is studied following conclusions are drawn based on this study the effect of plane boundary on the viv becomes weak as the gap ratio e d is increased to 1 for both kc 5 and 10 the lock in range of the reduced velocity is widened when kc number increases from 5 to 10 the viv at kc 10 is more complex than that at kc 5 which can be reflected by the strong fluctuation of y max with increasing reduced velocity 2 v r 12 as e d the vibration amplitude in the cross flow direction decreases suddenly around v r 4 for kc 5 and v r 3 5 and 9 5 for kc 10 these sudden decreases of the amplitude in the cross flow direction are attributed to the transition of frequency from one mode to the other mode due to this transition the vibration frequency desynchronizes with the vortex shedding frequency and the corresponding xy trajectories become irregular and chaotic the cylinder vibrates mostly in double frequency mode when kc 5 and 10 however most of the amplitude spectra of the vibration displacement contain multiple peaks at kc 10 and the corresponding xy trajectories are irregular and non periodic the free stream oscillatory flow and the in line displacement of the cylinder are found to be correlated well with each other it is further observed that the cylinder vibration and the undisturbed oscillatory fluid motion are nearly out of phase at lowest reduced velocity the phase of the cylinder motion leads the phase of the fluid motion and the phase difference between the cylinder motion and the undisturbed oscillatory flow motion decreases with increasing reduced velocity the cylinder motion and oscillatory fluid motion become in phase with each other as the reduced velocity is beyond their critical values of 6 and 12 for kc 5 and 10 respectively if the reduced velocity is greater than critical reduced velocities for both kc 5 and 10 the effective kc number is extremely small 2 no vortex shedding occurs and the amplitude of transverse vibration is almost zero the vortex shedding is highly dependent on the reduced velocities for kc 10 and e d the vortex shedding is in one pair flow regime for most of the reduced velocities when there is a plane boundary the vortices are shed only from the bottom side of the cylinder if vortex shedding occurs this is because the shear layers generated from the plane boundary attract the vortices generated from the cylinder downwards acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the support from national natural science foundation of china through international

23679,the laying of subsea pipelines often produces situations where the pipeline is suspended above the seabed due to local erosion of sediment in this paper flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder close to a plane boundary in an oscillatory flow is studied through two dimensional numerical simulations the circular cylinder and the plane boundary represents a pipeline and the seabed respectively it is found that the plane boundary affects the vibration amplitude in the cross flow direction significantly the vibration in the vertical direction ceases if reduced velocity exceeds 6 for kc 5 and 12 for kc 10 respectively the vibration in the cross flow direction stops when the reduced velocity exceeds a critical value because the effective kc number and the effective reduced velocity which are both based on the relative velocity of the cylinder to the fluid motion are extremely small for kc 10 the vortex shedding is found to be in one pair regime for most of the reduced velocities and non vortex shedding regime exists at large reduced velocities because the shear layers generated from the plane boundary attract the vortices generated from the cylinder vortex shedding

caused by waves and currents can lead to a catastrophic pipeline failure low and srinil 2016 because the vibration is generated by the vortex shedding flow the vibration of cylindrical structures in fluid flows are generally called vortex induced vibration viv the aim of this paper is to investigate the viv of a circular cylinder close to a plane boundary in oscillatory flow while many experimental and numerical studies have been performed to understand the dynamics of viv in steady flow viv of a circular cylinder in an oscillatory flow has received much less attention vortex induced vibration of cylinders in the cross flow direction has been discussed extensively in review articles bearman 1984 parkinson 1989 sarpkaya 1979 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 the classic experimental study of viv of an elastically mounted cylinder in wind by feng 1968 where the mass damping parameter the product of mass ratio and damping ratio is quite high shows that the response can be divided into two branches namely the initial and the upper branches williamson and roshko 1988 conducted experiments of forced vibration of a cylinder in the cross flow direction in a fluid flow and found the relation between the amplitude of the cylinder and the vortex shedding characteristics by conducting experiments of vibration of a cylinder in water flows khalak and williamson 1999 identified three branches of the response when the mass damping is low blevins and coughran 2009 and jauvtis and williamson 2004 studied two degree of freedom 2dof viv of a circular cylinder in steady flows and found that the trajectories of the cylinder vibration were strongly dependant on the reduced velocity laneville 2006 found that the vortex shedding modes were influenced by the x y motion of the circular cylinders govardhan and williamson 2006 found that the effect of the reynolds number should be taken into account in addition to the mass damping when evaluating viv in the offshore oil and gas engineering cylindrical structures such as subsea pipelines are subject to oscillatory flows very limited experimental and numerical studies of viv of cylinders in oscillatory flow are available in literature kozakiewicz et al 1994 1996 and sumer and fredsøe 1988 conducted experimental studies of one degree of freedom 1dof vibration of a cylinder in the cross flow direction in an oscillatory flow for kc numbers ranging from 5 to 100 the kc number is defined as kc u m t d where u m is the velocity amplitude t is the period of the oscillatory flow and d is the diameter of the cylinder it was found that the response pattern of the cylinder at a constant kc number varies with the reduced velocity one of the typical characteristics of the response of a cylinder in the oscillatory flow is that the frequency of the vibration is multiple of the frequency of the oscillatory flow anagnostopoulos and iliadis 1998 simulated the in line vibration of a circular cylinder in oscillatory flow numerically for re 200 and kc numbers between 2 and 20 it was observed that the large oscillation amplitude at resonance has a significant effect on the flow pattern and the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder some numerical studies of 2dof viv of a circular cylinder in the oscillatory flow show that the trajectory of the vibration is strongly dependent on the kc number and the reduced velocity zhao et al 2013 zhao et al 2012 simulated 1dof viv of a circular cylinder in the cross flow direction of the oscillatory flow and showed that the viv modes observed in the laboratory can be well predicted by the numerical model based on the rans equations lipsett and williamson 1994 conducted laboratory tests in a u tube to study the xy trajectories of vibration by changing kc number from 2 to 60 and the ratio of natural frequency in water to the frequency of oscillation of the u tube from 1 to 9 zhao 2013 also performed 2dof numerical study on viv of circular cylinder subject to oscillatory flow it was observed that as the kc number increases the vibration becomes irregular and chaotic with increasing amplitude of the vibration for a fixed cylinder close to a plane boundary in a steady flow it was demonstrated that the vortex shedding will be suppressed for a small cylinder to boundary gap ratio bearman and zdravkovich 1978 taniguchi and miyakoshi 1990 buresti and lanciotti 1992 lei et al 1999 ong et al 2010 vibration of a circular cylinder in steady flow close to a plane boundary was investigated in a few papers yang et al 2008 zhao and cheng 2011 hsieh et al 2016 vibration of a subsea pipeline also has significant effect on the local scour i e the erosion of the seabed sediment below the pipeline yang et al 2008 zhao and cheng 2010 gao et al 2006 the results of experimental studies tsahalis and jones 1981 tsahalis 1984 suggested that the cylinder undergoes an oval shape motion in contrast to the common figure eight of viv in steady flow if the gap between the cylinder and the plane boundary is equal to cylinder diameter fredsøe et al 1987 found that the transverse vibration frequency is close to the frequency of the vortex shedding of a stationary cylinder if the reduced velocity is less than 3 and the gap ratio is greater than 0 3 for reduced velocity between 3 v r 8 and 0 e d 1 where e is the distance between the bottom of the cylinder and the plane boundary the transverse vibrating frequency is quite different from the vortex shedding frequency of a stationary cylinder moreover jacobsen et al 1984 and tsahalis 1984 studied vibration of a flexible cylinder near a plane boundary in combined waves and currents chioukh and narayanan 1997 conducted an experimental study of transverse vibrations of elastically mounted cylinders over a plane boundary in waves it was found that a cylinder can vibrate even when the initial gap ratio between the cylinder and the plane boundary is very small in this study two dimensional numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the effects of a plane boundary on viv of a circular cylinder subject to an oscillatory flow the cylinder oscillates in both the transverse and inline directions with respect to the flow the reynolds number and the mass ratio are defined as r e u m d ν and m m π ρ d 2 4 respectively where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid m is the mass of cylinder and ρ is the density of the fluid the reynolds number the mass ratio and the damping ratio are selected as 5000 2 and 0 respectively simulations are carried out for two keulegan carpenter kc numbers of 5 and 10 and four gap ratios e d of 0 01 0 4 1 and the range of reduced velocities considered in the simulations is from 1 to 15 the reduced velocity is defined as v r u m f n d where f n is the natural frequency of the cylinder the focus of the study is to investigate the effect of the gap ratio e d on the inline and cross flow vibrations of the circular cylinder the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the governing equations and the numerical model used in this study are presented in section 3 the numerical model is validated by comparing the numerical results with laboratory test results in section 4 simulations are performed for two keulegan carpenter kc numbers of 5 and 10 four gap ratios e d of 0 01 0 4 1 and and a reduced velocities ranging from 1 to 15 then the effects of plane boundary on viv of the circular cylinder are discussed in section 5 flow structures at kc 10 are analysed finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 numerical method the oscillatory flow around an elastically mounted circular cylinder close to a plane boundary as shown in fig 1 is simulated numerically using two dimensional simulations the fluid velocity of the oscillatory flow is expressed as 1 u 1 t u m cos 2 π t t and u 2 t 0 where u i is the fluid velocity component in the x i direction x 1 x and x 2 y are the cartesian coordinates parallel and perpendicular to the plane boundary respectively and t is the time the vortex structures behind a fixed cylinder at re 5000 are three dimensional aljure et al 2017 the governing equations for simulating the turbulent flow are the unsteady two dimensional incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and the shear stress transport sst k ω model menter 1994 is used to simulate the turbulence in this study the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method is applied to deal with the moving boundaries of the cylinder the ale form of the rans equations in the cartesian coordinate system is expressed as 2 u i x i 0 3 u i t u j u ˆ j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j 2 ν s i j u i u j where u ˆ j is the moving mesh velocity the reynolds stress tensor u i u j is computed by u i u j ν t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ks ij where ν t is the turbulent viscosity k is the turbulent energy and s i j is the mean strain tensor respectively defined as s i j u i x j u j x i 2 the rans equations and the k ω turbulence equations are solved by the same petrov galerkin method that has been used in zhao 2013 a 50d long and 13d high rectangular computational domain is used for the numerical simulations the cylinder static balance position is initially located at the centre of the computational domain and at a gap e static balance position above the plane boundary the boundary conditions for the governing equations of fluid flow are as follows at the surfaces of the cylinders and the plane boundary the no slip boundary condition is employed i e the fluid velocity is the same as the vibrating velocity of the cylinder on the cylinder surface and zero on the plane boundary the specific dissipation rate ω is given at the nodal points next to the wall surface as ω 6 δ 1 ν where δ1 is the distance from the wall on the left and right boundaries the velocity is given based on eq 1 and pressure is given based on the gradient of the undisturbed incoming flow velocity in the x direction as p x b 2 π t sin 2 π t t where x b is the x coordinate of the boundary symmetric boundary condition is used on the top surface of the domain the 2dof equation of the motion for the displacement of the cylinder is 4 m d 2 x i d t 2 c d x i d t k x i f i where x 1 x and x 2 y are the displacements of the cylinder in the x and y directions respectively m c and k are the mass the damping coefficient and the stiffness of the system respectively f i is the hydrodynamic force in the x i direction which is calculated by integrating the pressure and shear stress over the cylinder surface the fourth order runge kutta method is used to solve the equation of motion the deformation of the mesh due to the displacement of the cylinder is calculated by zhao and cheng 2011 5 γ a i 0 where a i represents the displacement of the nodal points in the x i direction γ is a parameter that controls the mesh deformation which is set to be γ 1 a in a finite element with a being the area of the element the displacement of the mesh nodes is the same as the displacement of the cylinder on the cylinder surface to allow the mesh to slide along the plane boundary the gradient of a 1 in the y direction is zero and a 2 is zero on the plane boundary on other boundaries the displacement of the mesh nodes are zero in both x and y directions by giving the displacements at all the boundaries eq 5 is solved by a galerkin finite element method collision between the cylinder and the plane boundary may happen if e d is very small to avoid over distortion of the mesh between the cylinder and the rigid plane boundary during the computations the cylinder is forced to be bounced back when the distance between the cylinder and the plane boundary reaches 0 01d a very small initial gap of 0 01d is expected to enable the numerical setup to represent the case of a cylinder initially on a plane boundary zhao and cheng 2011 after the cylinder is bounced back from the plane boundary the horizontal velocity remains unchanged while the vertical velocity reverses with the unchanged magnitude fig 2 shows an example of the computational mesh near the cylinder for an initial gap ratio of e d 0 01 the computational domain is divided into 35248 quadrilateral linear finite elements for this case the minimum non dimensional mesh size in the radial direction next to the cylinder surface is 0 0032d the normalized distance is defined as y u f δ 1 ν where u f is the friction velocity used to estimate the near wall mesh density the maximum y near the gap is less than 3 when the gap between the cylinder and the bed reaches its minimum the y outside of the gap is always less than 1 3 comparison with experimental results the numerical model used in the simulations is validated against the results of the laboratory tests of viv of a cylinder in oscillatory flow generated in a u tube by lipsett and williamson 1994 who conducted experiments using u tube with a width of 600 mm and three cylinders with different diameters the results of the cylinder with d 63 8 mm corresponding to a u tube width to cylinder diameter ratio of 9 4 are used to validate the numerical model lipsett and williamson 1994 defined the ratio of the reynolds number to the kc number as the frequency parameter for the 63 8 mm diameter cylinder the frequency parameter was 1250 in the experiments in the tests the mass ratio is 1 and the damping ratio measured in water is 0 05 numerical simulations of viv of a cylinder in a uniform oscillatory flow are performed under same parameters as those used in the experiments except the damping ratio the structural natural frequency and the structural damping ratio are needed in the numerical simulations the structural damping ratio could not be measured directly because the spring was very soft lipsett and williamson 1994 in the numerical simulations the structural damping ratio is set as zero in the experiments the reduced velocity is defined based on the natural frequency measured in water in this study the natural frequency in water and the reduced velocity based on the natural frequency measured in water are defined as f nw and v r w u m f n w d respectively the natural frequency measured in water by lipsett and williamson 1994 is converted to the structural natural frequency measured in vacuum based on the relationship of f n f n w c a m m where c a is the added mass coefficient equal to 1 the xy trajectories of the cylinder response are obtained numerically for a range of kc number from 2 to 60 and ratio of natural frequency of the cylinder in water to the frequency of oscillation of the u tube f nw f w from 1 to 9 fig 3 shows the comparison of the xy trajectories between the laboratory tests and the present numerical simulations it can be seen that the xy trajectories obtained from the numerical model are very close to the results obtained from the laboratory tests it is further observed that the xy trajectories are symmetric about the vertical axis at x d 0 the vibration trajectory depends on both the kc number and the reduced velocity 4 numerical results of viv of a cylinder close to a plane boundary the reynolds number the mass ratio m and the damping ratio of the cylinder are 5000 2 and 0 respectively in all the numerical simulations the gap ratios e d used in this study are 0 01 0 4 1 and where e d represents the case of viv of a circular cylinder in a uniform oscillatory flow without a plane boundary simulations are carried out for reduced velocities ranging from 1 to 15 to ensure a steady state vibration has been achieved simulation for each case is performed for at least 20 periods of the oscillatory flow the time histories for several typical cases with kc 5 and 10 are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively if the collision between the cylinder and the plane boundary occurs the maximum displacement of the cylinder in the downward direction is the same as the cylinder to boundary gap in some cases the cylinder reaches the plane boundary and is bounced back a number of times in one flow period for example the cylinder hits the plane boundary twice in one period of the oscillatory flow at kc e d v r 5 0 01 4 and four times when kc e d v r 10 0 01 4 and in these two cases high amplitude jump and low amplitude jump of the cylinder occur alternatively i e every high jump is followed by a low jump and vice versa sometimes every high jump of the cylinder is followed by two low jumps for example when kc e d v r 10 0 4 8 in some cases the maximum height of the cylinder vibration in the vertical direction does not have obvious change for example when kc e d v r 5 0 4 5 the dynamics of vortex induced vibrations viv of the cylinder become highly complex and nonlinear due to the presence of plane boundary as the kc number increases from 5 to 10 as the gap ratio e d is increased from 0 01 to the effect of plane boundary on viv reduces the effect of plane boundary on the vibration of the cylinder is small when e d 1 because the vibration appears to be symmetric with its static balance position and the cylinder does not collide with the plane boundary as shown in fig 4 e and f fig 6 shows the amplitude spectra of the response in the cross flow direction and the xy trajectories for some representative cases for kc 5 the cylinder vibrates mostly with double frequency mode for all the gap ratios i e the cylinder attains its maximum amplitude twice in one oscillatory flow cycle and the corresponding xy trajectories are regular and repeatable in some cases the spectrum of the cross flow vibration is dominated by the oscillatory flow frequency mainly because the vibration in one half period is very different from that in the other half period if the vibration is strictly symmetric i e the vibration in the first half period is exactly the same as that in the second half there is only double frequency component in the spectrum as shown in fig 6 e at large reduced velocities see fig 6 f the cylinder only goes up and down once in one period of the flow leading to a single frequency vibration mode fig 7 shows the amplitude spectra of the cylinder response in the cross flow direction and the xy trajectories for kc 10 the cylinder vibrates mostly with a multiple frequency mode and the amplitude spectra is broad banded with some exceptions for example kc e d v r 10 0 4 2 and kc e d v r 10 1 10 the pre dominant frequency ratio f f w varies between 1 and 4 depending on the reduced velocity the amplitude spectra with multiple peaks correspond to the cases where the vibration mode is transitioning from one frequency mode to the other frequency mode when the reduced velocity is 2 there are two vibration periods in half period of the oscillatory flow resulting in a vibration frequency four times the oscillatory flow frequency when the cylinder vibrates mostly in a distinct double or single frequency mode the corresponding xy trajectories are regular and repeatable for example kc e d v r 10 4 the xy trajectories for v r 11 5 are not shown because the vibration is pre dominantly in the x direction and the amplitude in the cross flow direction is negligibly small fig 8 a d shows the variations of the maximum and minimum displacements in both the inline and cross flow directions with the reduced velocity for kc 5 fig 8 e shows the variation of the vibration frequency f y f w in the cross flow direction with the reduced velocity for kc 5 the response frequencies for v r 6 are not shown in fig 8 because the vibration amplitudes in the cross flow direction are nearly zero and the vibration is very irregular collision between the cylinder and the plane boundary occurs in the reduced velocity range of 2 v r 5 5 for e d 0 01 and 0 4 and does not occur at any reduced velocities for e d 1 both y max d and y min d vary with reduced velocity oscillatorily for e d 1 and where the cylinder does not reach the plane boundary the oscillatory nature of the response at e d 1 and is that y max d and y min d drop suddenly at around v r 4 sumer and fredsøe 1988 reported that if the cylinder is only allowed to vibrate in the cross flow direction in a uniform oscillatory flow the multiple peak behaviour of the vibration amplitude with the reduced velocity occurs because lock in occurs several times in this study lock in in the cross flow direction does not occur after reduced velocity exceeds 6 because the response amplitude becomes zero in this study a lock in range of the reduced velocity is defined as the range between the starting reduced velocity of the first lock in and the ending reduced velocity of the last lock in when multiple lock in occurs for kc 5 the lock in range is found to be between 2 and 5 5 for all the gap ratios the variations of x max d and x min d with the reduced velocity do not change significantly as the gap ratio changes except in the lock in range the magnitudes x max d and x min d are not exactly the same as each other in some cases because the vibration is not symmetric as demonstrated in fig 7 the amplitude of the oscillatory motion of the fluid particles is defined as a fluid and is related to the kc number as a f l u i d d k c 2 π it is interesting that the amplitude of the cylinder in the in line direction is greater than the amplitude of the fluid motion in the reduced velocity range of 3 v r 7 when the reduced velocity is greater than 7 the amplitude of the cylinder is slightly smaller than the amplitude of the fluid motion lipsett and williamson 1994 found that an integer number of transverse response cycles were completed for each in line cycle when studying viv of a cylinder in an oscillatory flow in both in line and cross flow directions since the vibration frequency in the cross flow direction is generally multiple of the oscillatory flow frequency zhao 2013 named the response modes to be double triple and quadruple frequency modes etc the minimum values of y max d and y min d occur at v r 4 5 and 4 for e d 1 and respectively it can be seen from fig 8 that at these two reduced velocities where the vibration amplitude is the minimum the response frequency changes from one mode to the other however if the cylinder collides with the plane boundary at small gap ratios of e d 0 01 and 0 4 the multiple peak behaviour of the response disappears the reduction in the response amplitude at the boundary reduced velocity between two response modes is not observed and the response amplitude is consistently high in the lock in range of the reduced velocity fig 9 shows the variations of the maximum and minimum displacements of the cylinder in both the inline and cross flow directions and the vibration frequency in the cross flow direction with the reduced velocity for kc 10 compared with that for kc 5 the high amplitude response reduced velocity range is widened for both e d 0 01 and 0 4 collision between the cylinder and the plane boundary occurs in the reduced velocity range of 2 v r 12 which is the whole lock in range when e d multiple maximum values of the response amplitude in the cross flow direction are also observed at v r 3 5 5 and 11 5 respectively and the minimum response amplitudes in the cross flow direction occur at reduced velocities where the vibration frequency changes for e d 0 01 0 4 and 1 the minimum values of y max d are not obvious and high amplitude is observed in the entire lock in regime the amplitude of the vibration in the cross flow direction is generally higher than its counterpart at kc 5 the effects of plane boundary on the viv become negligible when the gap ratio e d is 1 and similar to the observation for kc 5 the maximum and minimum displacements x max d and x min d in the in line direction are also almost symmetric to each other with some exceptions due to the symmetry of the flow and the system in the in line direction as in the case of kc 5 the vibration of the cylinder in the in line direction is always dominated by the oscillatory flow frequency because the inertia force on the cylinder due to the oscillation of the fluid contributes to the vibration more than the vortex shedding compared with that of kc 5 the maximum amplitude in the inline direction is significantly increased at kc 10 the maximum amplitude of the cylinder displacement in the in line direction with kc 10 occurs at v r 10 where the oscillation flow frequency is close to the natural frequency of the cylinder the vibration of the cylinder in the inline direction is found to be dominated by the frequency of the oscillatory flow for both kc 5 and 10 when a cylinder vibrates in both the inline and the cross flow directions the velocity of the cylinder in the in line direction relative to the fluid will be reduced if the cylinder movement in the inline direction is in phase with the fluid velocity and increased if the former is out of phase with the latter then the effective reduced velocity and kc number will be altered the phase difference between the displacement of the fluid motion defined as x f and the displacement of the cylinder vibration defined as x is discussed based on eq 1 the displacement of the fluid motion is calculated according to x f u m t 2 π sin 2 π t t the cross correlation coefficient between x f t and x t is defined as c τ and is calculated using n periods of data by c τ 1 n t 0 n t x f t x f x t τ x d t σ x f σ x where τ is the time lag σ x f and σ x are the standard deviations of x f t and x t respectively and x f and x are the mean values of x f t and x t respectively it is seen from the definition that the cross correlation varies with τ periodically and its period is the same as the period of the oscillatory flow the cross correlation coefficient c τ for 0 τ t is calculated and the maximum value of c τ is denoted by c m if x f and x are perfectly correlated c m 1 the phase between x f and x is defined as φ φ x f φ x where φ x f and φ x are the phases of vibrations of x f and x respectively the time lag corresponding to the maximum value of c m is defined as τ m and time lag is converted to the phase difference by φ 2 π τ m t fig 10 a and b shows the correlation between the oscillation displacement of the fluid particles and the cylinder displacement in the x direction as a function of reduced velocity excellent correlation between the oscillatory flow and the displacement of the cylinder in the x directions is observed for most of the gap ratios except for e d 0 4 and small reduced velocities where the correlation coefficient is still greater than 0 75 since the oscillation of the fluid and the vibration of the cylinder are correlated well the phase difference φ between the fluid motion and the cylinder vibration is calculated and shown in fig 10 c and d the positive and negative phase angles indicate that the phase of the cylinder motion lags and leads the fluid motion respectively when the reduced velocity is very small the oscillatory flow is nearly out of phase with the inline displacement of the fluid i e the cylinder moves in the opposition of the fluid motion it can be seen that the phase of the cylinder motion leads that of the fluid motion and the magnitude of the phase difference decreases almost linearly with increasing v r until v r 6 for kc 5 and v r 12 and for kc 10 after the reduced velocity exceeds the upper boundary of the lock in regime the phase difference remains nearly zero the closeness between the amplitudes of the cylinder motion and fluid motion and the in phase between displacements of the cylinder and fluid particles at large reduced velocities indicate that the cylinder moves passively with the fluid at large reduced velocities if both the cylinder and the fluid oscillate in the x direction the flow characteristics and the vibration of the cylinder depend on the relative velocity of the undisturbed fluid motion to the cylinder the relative velocity of the fluid motion in the x direction to the cylinder is defined as u r e l t u m cos 2 π t t d x d t and the effective reduced velocity and the effective kc number are calculated by v r e f f u m r e l f n d and k c e f f u m r e l t d where u m rel is the maximum value of u r e l t the effective reduced velocity and the effective kc number are shown in fig 11 it can be seen that for kc 5 both the effective reduced velocity and the effective kc number reach their minimum values at about v r 7 the effective kc number is less than 2 when v r 6 for all the gap ratios for a stationary cylinder in an oscillatory flow the flow is symmetric and no vortex shedding occurs as kc 4 williamson 1985 for kc 5 the vibration of the cylinder in the cross flow direction ceases when v r 6 because the effective kc number is extremely small 2 for kc 10 both the effective reduced velocity and the effective kc number reach their minimum values at about v r 14 except for e d 0 4 for all the gap ratios both v r e f f and k c e f f are very small in the range of 12 5 v r 15 this explains why the vibration of the cylinder in the cross flow direction ceases when 12 5 v r 15 the effective kc number is small at large reduced velocities because the fluid motion and the cylinder motion are in phase with each other as shown in fig 10 and the amplitude of the cylinder and that of the fluid motion are very close to each other as shown in fig 8 5 vortex shedding when a stationary cylinder is placed in an oscillatory flow the vortex shedding flow is classified into different regimes based on the number of vortex pairs that are shed from the cylinder during one period of the oscillatory flow the flow is in the mode of pair of attached vortices when kc 5 where a pair of asymmetric vortices are generated from the cylinder in half cycle but vortex shedding does not occur and one pair regime when kc 10 where a pair of vortices are shed from only one side of the cylinder williamson 1985 if the circular cylinder is allowed to vibrate it is found that in addition to kc number and reduced velocity the number of vortex pair that are shed from the cylinder in one oscillatory flow is also dependent upon the gap ratio e d in addition to the gap ratio the vortex shedding also depends on the relative velocity between fluid motion and cylinder inline motion and the effective kc number fig 12 shows the flow structure for kc 10 and v r 2 for one oscillatory flow cycle when the gap ratio e d and the corresponding instants of vorticity contours in the time histories of cross flow direction the two vortices a and b grow in size until the flow reverses after that vortex a is swept back on the cylinder to form two new vortices c and d before being shed in the meantime vortex b is shed from the bottom of the cylinder fig 12b in the second half cycle vortices a and d are swept back on the cylinder and another two new vortices e and f are generated vortex c is shed from the bottom of the cylinder fig 12d in one cycle of the oscillatory flow vortices b and c are shed from the cylinder forming a one pair vortex shedding pattern because the vibration amplitudes of the cylinder in both the in line and the cross flow directions are very small the effective kc eff almost equals to kc it is further found that the flow structure in this case replicates the regime d found by tatsuno and bearman 1990 in their flow visualization experiment around a stationary cylinder subject to an oscillatory flow with kc 6 28 high frequency vibration is observed because each vortex that is shed from the cylinder attacks the cylinder after the flow reverses resulting in a high frequency force fig 13 shows the vorticity contours and the time histories of the vibration in the cross flow direction within one flow cycle for kc 10 and v r 5 when gap ratio e d vortex a and b are shed from the previous oscillatory flow it can be seen from fig 13 b that two vortices c and d are shed from the cylinder in the first half of oscillatory flow because vortex c is actually separated from the main negative vortex and is extremely weak it has little effect on the vibration the flow structure in the second half cycle is identical to the one in the first half cycle in one cycle two vortices d and e are shed from the cylinder forming an one pair vortex shedding pattern the two vortices c and h are too weak to have influences on the flow it was shown by zhao 2013 that the vibration frequency normalized by the flow frequency is equal to the number of vortex pair shed from the cylinder plus one since one pair of vortex is shed from the cylinder for this reduced velocity therefore the vibration frequency is twice the flow frequency fig 14 shows the vorticity contours and time histories of the cylinder in the cross flow direction in one flow cycle for kc 10 and v r 9 5 when gap ratio e d one pair of vortex is shed from the cylinder vortex a is the one that is shed from the cylinder before the flow direction changes from negative to positive when the flow direction is positive fig 14 b and c vortex b is shed from the cylinder the cylinder vibration frequency in the cross flow direction is twice the oscillatory flow frequency because the flow reversals contribute to the increase of the vibration frequency it is also observed that the large vibration amplitude of the cylinder in the x direction results in a relative velocity less than the oscillatory flow velocity as a result the effective kc number is also reduced to around 6 it can be concluded from the vorticity contours and frequency plot for kc 10 in fig 9 e that one pair of vortex is shed from the cylinder in one flow cycle for reduced velocity range of 3 5 v r 9 5 the cylinder vibration frequency in the cross flow direction is very close to the natural frequency at v r 5 therefore maximum amplitude is observed at this reduced velocity as the reduced velocity is increased beyond v r 5 the vibration frequency desynchronizes with the natural frequency consequently lowest amplitude is observed at v r 9 5 the effective kc is around 6 when v r 9 5 it is also clear from relative velocity plot of fig 11e that the v r eff increases with increasing reduced velocity and reaches maximum at around v r 8 5 after which it decreases hence the timing of the vortex shedding changes with reduced velocity due to the changing of v r eff and kc eff fig 15 shows the vorticity contours and the time histories of the cylinder displacement in the cross flow direction during one flow period for kc 10 v r 11 and a gap ratio e d the negative vortex at the top of the cylinder does not change its shape and strength throughout the whole cycle no vortex shedding is observed mainly because the effective kc number is very small the main positive vortex and the main negative vortex are found to rotate around the cylinder the same flow structure is repeated in each oscillatory flow period hence the corresponding xy trajectories are regular and repeatable the cylinder vibration frequency in the y direction is the same as the oscillatory flow frequency fig 16 shows the vorticity contours in one flow cycle for kc 10 v r 15 and gap ratio e d the effective kc number is extremely small at large reduced velocities because the fluid motion and the cylinder motion are in phase with each other as shown in fig 10 and have almost the same amplitude as shown in fig 8 as a result of this very small effective kc number 2 extremely weak vortices are observed for this reduced velocity and the vibration of the cylinder is only in the in line direction the flow structure for kc 10 v r 10 and e d 0 4 is shown in fig 17 there is significant influence of the shear layer from the plane boundary on the vortex shedding from the cylinder the cylinder also collides with the plane boundary once in each flow cycle in this case the changes of the vortices far away from the cylinder within a cycle can hardly be identified when the cylinder moves in the left direction one positive vortex is shed from the cylinder this vortex is shed from the cylinder mainly because of the collision of the cylinder with the plane boundary which disconnects the shear layer at the bottom of the cylinder as shown in fig 17 a the positive vortices that are shed from the bottom right of the cylinder merge into a large positive vortex at the right hand side of the cylinder when the cylinder is moving in the right direction no vortex shedding is observed however small negative vortices are found to split from the cylinder when the cylinder collides with the plane boundary and these negative vortices further merge into the main negative vortex to the left of the cylinder because the flow in one half cycle is different from that in the other half cycle the vibration frequency is the same as the oscillation flow frequency since the cylinder collides with the plane boundary sufficiently large amplitude is observed at this reduced velocity when the cylinder is close to a plane boundary the vortices are found to be shed only from the bottom side of the cylinder regardless of the reduced velocity because the vorticity of shear layers generated from the plane boundary and the shear layer generated from bottom of the cylinder have opposite directions to each other the shear layers from the plane boundary attract the vortices generated from the cylinder and lead to vortex shedding from the bottom side of the cylinder 6 conclusions vortex induced vibration of an elastically mounted circular cylinder close to a plane boundary and in an oscillatory flow is numerically investigated the study is aimed to investigate the effects of the interaction between the cylinder and the plane boundary on the vibration amplitude simulations are carried out for two kc numbers of 5 and 10 four gap ratios of 0 01 0 4 1 and and reduced velocities ranging from 1 to 15 the effect of gap ratio e d on the viv is studied following conclusions are drawn based on this study the effect of plane boundary on the viv becomes weak as the gap ratio e d is increased to 1 for both kc 5 and 10 the lock in range of the reduced velocity is widened when kc number increases from 5 to 10 the viv at kc 10 is more complex than that at kc 5 which can be reflected by the strong fluctuation of y max with increasing reduced velocity 2 v r 12 as e d the vibration amplitude in the cross flow direction decreases suddenly around v r 4 for kc 5 and v r 3 5 and 9 5 for kc 10 these sudden decreases of the amplitude in the cross flow direction are attributed to the transition of frequency from one mode to the other mode due to this transition the vibration frequency desynchronizes with the vortex shedding frequency and the corresponding xy trajectories become irregular and chaotic the cylinder vibrates mostly in double frequency mode when kc 5 and 10 however most of the amplitude spectra of the vibration displacement contain multiple peaks at kc 10 and the corresponding xy trajectories are irregular and non periodic the free stream oscillatory flow and the in line displacement of the cylinder are found to be correlated well with each other it is further observed that the cylinder vibration and the undisturbed oscillatory fluid motion are nearly out of phase at lowest reduced velocity the phase of the cylinder motion leads the phase of the fluid motion and the phase difference between the cylinder motion and the undisturbed oscillatory flow motion decreases with increasing reduced velocity the cylinder motion and oscillatory fluid motion become in phase with each other as the reduced velocity is beyond their critical values of 6 and 12 for kc 5 and 10 respectively if the reduced velocity is greater than critical reduced velocities for both kc 5 and 10 the effective kc number is extremely small 2 no vortex shedding occurs and the amplitude of transverse vibration is almost zero the vortex shedding is highly dependent on the reduced velocities for kc 10 and e d the vortex shedding is in one pair flow regime for most of the reduced velocities when there is a plane boundary the vortices are shed only from the bottom side of the cylinder if vortex shedding occurs this is because the shear layers generated from the plane boundary attract the vortices generated from the cylinder downwards acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the support from national natural science foundation of china through international
