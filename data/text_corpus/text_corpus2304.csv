11520,climate change is leading to the intensification of drought effects worldwide which considerably reduce crop production a better understanding of the drought tolerance mechanisms would lead into a more productive agriculture the arbuscular mycorrhizal am symbiosis has been shown to improve plant tolerance to drought salicylic acid sa is a phenolic compound involved in many aspects of plant growth and development apart from its role in biotic interactions it is also involved in the regulation of important plant physiological processes including plant water relations under stressful conditions however despite the importance of sa in plant physiology and in am colonization little is known about its effect on regulation of root water transport thus the aim of this work was to study the combined effect of am symbiosis and sa on root hydraulic properties under drought stress with special focus on how these factors can alter radial root water transport pathways through aquaporin regulation also the crosstalk between sa and other phytohormones was taken into account results showed that the am symbiosis modifies root hydraulic responses to drought episodes under these conditions am plants showed increased lpr and lo exogenous sa application decreased lpr and lo under drought sa modulation of water conductivity could be due to a fine regulation of root aquaporins as zmpip2 4 or zmtip1 1 furthermore sa application differently modulated the percentage of water flowing by the apoplastic pathway decreasing its contribution to total root water flow in am plants and increasing it in non am plants an intricate relationship between lpr aquaporins and endogenous levels of sa aba and jasmonic acid was observed future studies should explore more in detail the crosstalk mechanism between these hormones in the regulation of water transport in am roots in order to better understand the mechanism through which the am symbiosis copes with drought stress keywords aquaporin arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis drought root hydraulic conductivity 1 introduction climate change is leading to the intensification of drought effects and cultivable soils are progressively drying worldwide trenberth et al 2014 with more often drought events that considerably reduce crop production lesk et al 2016 agricultural drought reduces plant growth and affects essential plant physiological and biochemical processes as stomatal conductance transpiration root water uptake photosynthesis or membrane functions it also increases the production of reactive oxygen species ros producing oxidative stress that damages cells and even leads to plant death hasanuzzaman et al 2014 thus a better understanding of the mechanisms that help plants to improve their water status during water stress would lead into a more productive agriculture phytohormones play essential roles and coordinate different signalling pathways during abiotic stress responses wani et al 2016 among these salicylic acid sa is a phenolic compound involved in many aspects of growth and plant development as well as in the regulation of the response to different abiotic and biotic stresses khan et al 2015 miura and tada 2014 salicylic acid has been studied mainly in relation to plant pathogen interactions since it has the ability to induce systemic acquired resistance to different pathogens in plants gunes et al 2007 indeed it coordinates the plant s defence against biotrophic pathogens lu 2009 and foo et al 2013 suggested that sa might also have a role during arbuscular mycorrhizal am colonization previous studies point in this direction with a short lived rise in sa levels during the early stages of am colonization blilou et al 1999 herrera medina et al 2003 showed that the rate of am colonization was affected by the sa content they found that transgenic plants with reduced sa levels exhibited a more rapid am colonization while wild type plants with constitutive sa biosynthesis retarded am colonization of roots although the final level of colonization was unaltered apart from this role in biotic interactions sa is also involved in the regulation of important plant physiological processes such as nitrogen metabolism photosynthesis antioxidant defense system and plant water relations under stress conditions and thereby provides protection in plants against abiotic stresses faried et al 2017 khan et al 2015 sa has been found to improve plant tolerance to salt stress jini and joseph 2017 miura and tada 2014 and to affect plant physiology in maize plants subjected to salinity gunes et al 2007 indeed exogenous sa may induce stomatal closure miura and tada 2014 regulates biosynthesis of osmolytes li et al 2016 misra and saxena 2009 and increases antioxidative defenses in stressed tissues nazar et al 2011 however sa is thought to interact in a complex way with other hormonal compounds such as ethylene gharbi et al 2016 thus its effects on plant physiology can be direct or indirect through alteration of other plant hormones finally sa influences plant functions in a dose dependent manner where induced or inhibited plant functions can be possible with low and high sa concentrations respectively khan et al 2015 there are increasing evidences of enhanced drought tolerance when exogenous sa is applied alam et al 2013 miura and tada 2014 li et al 2016 however this regulation is orchestrated in a complex cross talk between different phytohormones auxins cytokinins aba gibberellins under optimal and stressful conditions munné bosch and müller 2013 on the other hand am fungi which establish a mutualistic relationship with most crop plants have been described to improve water and nutrient uptake enhancing tolerance to abiotic stresses such as drought ruiz lozano et al 2012 being a possible alternative to the use of inorganic fertilizers zoppellari et al 2014 this amelioration is achieved by allowing plants the access to distant water from the soil and by altering root hydraulic properties bárzana et al 2012 water transport in roots according to the composite model steudle and peterson 1998 occurs as the sum of three pathways apoplastic via the cell wall continuum symplastic via plasmodesmata and transcellular across the cell membranes the last two pathways cannot be differentiated empirically being reduced to the so called cell to cell pathway aquaporins play an important regulatory role in this last pathway and within this protein family water channel activity is mainly found in the pip2 subfamily maurel et al 2008 by measuring root hydraulic conductivity lpr root water transport capacity can be estimated providing information on plant water status and water mobilization capacity of roots it is known that under non stressful conditions the radial water flow is mainly apoplastic following the hydrostatic gradient created by transpiration however when transpiration is restricted as under drought water goes mainly by the cell to cell pathway following an osmotic gradient between soil solution and xylem sap thus relative contribution of these two pathway to overall water uptake or hydraulic conductivity may change substantially hachez et al 2006 martínez ballesta et al 2003 vadez et al 2013 and under drought conditions root hydraulics is adjusted by switching between both pathways ranathunge et al 2004 it is expected that aquaporins play a key role in the regulation of water flow in plants under conditions of water limitation affecting important parameters such as the root hydraulic conductivity hachez et al 2006 zarrouk et al 2016 moreover there is growing evidence that the contribution of aquaporin mediated water transport to root water uptake is much larger than previously thought even under conditions of high transpiration knipfer and fricke 2010 2011 previous studies have investigated the effects of the am symbiosis on water pathways in the roots of host plants combined with the use of an inhibitor of aquaporins activity bárzana et al 2012 results showed that roots of am plants enhanced significantly the water circulating by apoplastic pathway as compared to non am plants both under well watered and under drought stress conditions data also showed that the presence of the am fungus in the roots of the host plants could modulate the switching between cell to cell and apoplastic water transport pathways this was interpreted as a way to provide higher flexibility in the response of am plants to water shortage according to the demands from the shoot bárzana et al 2012 other recent evidences suggest that the modulation of aba auxins and or sa levels in the host plant may contribute to this switching between water pathways mediated by the am fungus calvo polanco et al 2014 sánchez romera et al 2016 indeed aba was found to increased lpr at root cortical cell and organ levels in maize facilitating water uptake under water limiting conditions hose et al 2000 and aba was identified as a possible aquaporin regulator boursiac et al 2008 wan et al 2004 studies in arabidopsis indicated that indole acetic acid iaa acts through an auxin response factor 7 arf7 dependent path to inhibit the expression of most pips at both transcriptional and translational levels péret et al 2012 similarly sa down regulates pip aquaporins and root hydraulic conductivity by a ros mediated mechanism which provoked membrane internalization of pip aquaporins boursiac et al 2008 despite the importance of sa in plant physiology and in am colonization as well as its putative role under drought conditions little is known about its effect on root hydraulic conductivity and regulation of water transport in roots and to the best of our knowledge studies about the combined effect of exogenous sa application and am symbiosis are lacking thus the aim of this research was to study the combined effect of am symbiosis and sa on root hydraulic properties under drought stress being specially focused on how these factors can alter radial root water transport pathways through aquaporin regulation for that we applied exogenous sa or an inhibitor of its biosynthesis 2 aminoindan 2 phosphonic acid aip pan et al 2006 also the crosstalk between sa and other plant hormones under the former conditions will be discussed the results of this study could lead to a better understanding of water uptake mechanisms and plant tolerance to drought when the am fungus is present increasing our knowledge of its effect on plant water balance 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment consisted of a factorial design with three factors 1 inoculation treatment with non inoculated control plants c and plants inoculated with the am fungus rhizophagus irregularis strain eez 58 ri 2 chemical treatment so that one group of each inoculation treatment was maintained without hormone untreated another group of plants was treated with salicylic acid sa and the last group was treated with 2 aminoindan 2 phosphonic acid aip as inhibitor of sa biosynthesis 3 watering treatment so that half of the plants were grown under well watered ww conditions throughout the entire experiment and the other half was subjected to drought stress for 15 days before harvest ds the different combination of these factors gave a total of 12 treatments each treatment had 10 replicates giving a total of 120 plants 2 2 biological material and growth conditions a loamy soil was collected at the grounds of ifapa granada spain sieved 2 mm

plants were grown in 1l pots filled with 1250 g of a mixture of soil sand 1 9 for 8 weeks at the time of planting half of the plants were inoculated with ten grams of mycorrhizal inoculum from rhizophagus irregularis schenck and smith strain eez 58 mycorrhizal inoculum consisted of soil spores mycelia and infected root fragments non inoculated plants received a 5 ml aliquot of a filtrate 20 μm of the am inoculum in order to provide the natural microbial population free of am propagules plants were grown for 8 weeks in a greenhouse at 19 25 c 16 8 light dark period 50 60 relative humidity and an average photosynthetic photon flux density of 800 μmol m 2 s 1 as measured with a light meter licor lincoln ne usa model li 188b plants were irrigated three times per week with 50 ml of hoagland nutrient solution hoagland and arnon 1950 modified to contain 25 p in order to avoid am symbiosis inhibition the same amount of water was applied on alternate days a drought stress treatment was applied for the last 2 weeks by irrigating plants with half the water hoagland volume of well watered ones 25 ml vs 50 ml this water stress was similar as in a previous work with similar experimental design quiroga et al 2017 it could be considered as a severe stress as evidenced by a drop of stomatal conductance by around 75 table 1 salicylic acid 20 μm and aip 75 μm were applied with the nutrient solution 6 h before harvesting dose of the phytohormone and its inhibitor as well as the exposure time needed to affect root hydraulic conductivity were established in previous experiments ranging from 20 to 150 μm sa 25 100 μm aip and exposure times of 1 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 biomass production and symbiotic development at harvest the shoot and root system of ten replicates per treatment were collected and used for fresh weight recording then 5 replicates per treatment were dried in a hot air oven at 70 c for 2 days and dry weights were recorded the other 5 replicates were immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c until they were used roots of maize were stained according to phillips and hayman 1970 in order to differentiate fungal structures the extent of mycorrhizal colonization was calculated according to the gridline intersect method giovannetti and mosse 1980 in five replicates per treatment 2 3 2 stomatal conductance stomatal conductance gs was measured two hours after the onset of photoperiod in the second youngest leaf from 10 plants per treatment with a porometer system porometer ap4 delta t devices ltd cambridge uk following the manufacter s instructions measurements were taken one day before harvest 2 3 3 photosynthetic efficiency the efficiency of photosystem ii was measured with fluorpen fp100 photon systems instruments brno czech republic which allows a non invasive assessment of plant photosynthetic performance by measuring chlorophyll a fluorescence fluorpen quantifies the quantum yield of photosystem ii as the ratio between the actual fluorescence yield in the light adapted state fv and the maximum fluorescence yield in the light adapted state fm according to oxborough and baker 1997 measurements were taken in the second youngest leaf of 10 different plants of each treatment one day before harvest 2 3 4 membrane electrolyte leakage leaf electrolyte leakage was determined in 10 plants per treatment leaf samples were washed with deionized water to remove surface adhered electrolytes the samples were placed in 15 ml falcon tubes containing 10 ml of deionized water and incubated at 25 c on a rotary shaker at 100 rpm during 3 h and the electrical conductivity of the solution e0 was determined using a conductivity meter mettler toledo ag 8603 switzerland samples were then placed at 80 c for 2 h subsequently tubes were incubated again at room temperature under smoothly agitation and the final electrical conductivity ef was obtained after 3 h under these conditions the electrolyte leakage was defined as follows e0 ewater ef ewater x 100 where ewater is the electrical conductivity of the deionized water used to incubate the samples 2 3 5 osmotic root hydraulic conductivity lo lo was measured at noon on detached roots exuding under atmospheric pressure by the free exudation method benabdellah et al 2009 under these conditions water is only moving following an osmotic gradient therefore the water would be moving through the cell to cell path steudle and peterson 1998 the exuded sap was collected after 2 h and weighed the osmolarity of the exuded sap and the nutrient solution was determined using a cryoscopic osmometer and used for lo calculation according to aroca et al 2007 lo was calculated as lo jv δy where jv is the exuded sap flow rate and δψ the osmotic potential difference between the exuded sap and the nutrient solution where the pots were immersed measurements were carried out 6 h after starting the chemical treatment 2 3 6 hydrostatic root hydraulic conductivity lpr the lpr was determined at noon in five plants n 5 per treatment with a scholander pressure chamber 6 h after starting the chemical treatment and following the method described by bárzana et al 2012 a gradual increase of pressure 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mpa was applied at 2 min intervals to the detached roots sap was collected after 2 min at the three pressure points sap flow was plotted against pressure with the slope being the root hydraulic conductance l value lpr was determined by dividing l by root dry weight rdw and expressed as mg h2o g rdw 1 mpa 1 h 1 aliquots of the collected sap were used for subsequent hormonal determination 2 3 7 relative apoplastic water flow relative changes in apoplastic water flux were estimated using light green dye light green sf yellowish sigma aldrich chemical gillingham dorset colour index 42095 molecular weight 792 85 g mol 1 which has the ability to move apoplastically but not symplastically lópez pérez et al 2007 detopped root systems were immersed in 250 μmol l 1 light green solution inside the pressure chamber 5 min before pressure application and kept in this solution during measurement sap was collected after 2 min at 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mpa in a scholander pressure chamber at the end the concentration of the dye in the whole collected sap was determined immediately at 630 nm bárzana et al 2012 the average baseline fluorescence value in the nutrient solution before addition of the dye was subtracted to the values obtained after adding the dye and in the collected sap the percentage of apoplastic pathway was calculated from the ratio between dye concentration in the sap flow and in the nutrient solution the concentration of dye in the nutrient solution of each treatment was considered to be 100 2 3 8 sap and root hormonal content in sap iaa aba sa and ja were analysed according to albacete et al 2008 with some modifications briefly xylem sap samples were filtered through 13 mm diameter millex filters with 0 22 μm pore size nylon membrane millipore bedford ma usa ten μl of filtrated extract were injected in a u hplc ms system consisting of an accela series u hplc thermofisher scientific waltham ma usa coupled to an exactive mass spectrometer thermofisher scientific waltham ma usa using a heated electrospray ionization hesi interface mass spectra were obtained using xcalibur software version 2 2 thermofisher scientific waltham ma usa for quantification of the plant hormones calibration curves were constructed for each analysed component 1 10 50 and 100 μg l 1 in plant roots iaa aba sa ja and ja ile were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization high resolution accurate mass spectrometry hplc esi hrms as described in ibort et al 2017 2 3 9 pip aquaporins abundance and phosphorylation status microsomal fraction isolation and elisa were performed as described previously by calvo polanco et al 2014 we used five different primary antibodies at a dilution of 1 1000 two antibodies that recognize several pip1 s and pip2s and three antibodies that recognize the phosphorylation of pip2 proteins in the c terminal region pip2a ser 280 pip2 b ser 283 and pip2c ser 280 ser 283 calvo polanco et al 2014 2 3 10 gene expression analysis through quantitative real time rt pcr total rna was extracted from five biological replicates of maize roots harvested 8 weeks after sowing and conserved at 80 c prior to use isolation was carried out by a phenol chloroform extraction method followed by precipitation with licl kay et al 1987 the integrity of rna was checked electrophoretically and quality assessment of total rna was measured with nanodrop thermo scientific nanodrop 1000 first strand cdna was synthesized using 1 μg of purified rna with the maxima first strand cdna synthesis kit for rt qpcr with dsdnase thermo scientific according to the manufacter s protocol to rule out the possibility of a genomic dna contamination all the cdna sets were checked by running control pcr reactions with aliquots of the same rna that have been subjected to the dnase treatment but not to the reverse transcription step the expression of a group of maize aquaporins previously selected as regulated by the am symbiosis bárzana et al 2014 quiroga et al 2017 was studied by real time pcr by using icycler system bio rad hercules ca usa adjusting protocols to optimize the pcr reaction to each gene the primer sets used to amplify each aquaporin gene were designed in the 3 and 5 untranslated regions of each gene in order to avoid unspecific amplification of the different aquaporin genes bárzana et al 2014 hachez et al 2006 polymerase chain reactions were performed in a 96 well plate with an icycler 5 system bio rad hercules california usa using kapa sybr fast qpcr kit master mix 2x universal kapabiosystems boston massachusetts united states the following standard thermal profile was used for all pcr reactions enzyme activation 95 c for 3 min denaturation annealing and extension cycles repeated 40 times 95 c for 25 s 60 c for 25 s 72 c for 30 s and dissociation curve 70 c for 2 min 55 c for 10 s the elongation factor 1 gi 2282583 was used as reference gene for normalization as it was the best performing reference gene under the specific growing conditions the relative abundance of transcripts was calculated from three biological and two technical replicates by using the 2 δδct method livak and schmittgen 2001 negative controls without cdna were used in all pcr reactions 2 4 statistical analysis within each watering regime data were analysed using spssstatistics version 23 ibm analytics and subjected to analysis of variance anova with inoculation treatment and chemical treatment as sources of variation post hoc comparisons with duncan test were used to find out differences between means at α 0 05 correlations between the different parameters were performed by calculating the pearson correlation coefficients 3 results 3 1 root mycorrhization plant growth and ecophysiological paramaters plants inoculated with rhizophagus irregularis am presented around 65 of mycorrhizal root length showing no significant differences between water treatments whereas non inoculated plants did not show am colonization table 1 shoot and root dry weight decreased significantly by 40 in average due to drought stress treatment but am plants maintained higher plant dry weight than non am ones regardless of water regime table 1 thus under well watered conditions the shoot dry weight was 13 higher in am plants and under drought stress conditions the increase was by 11 membrane electrolyte leakage el was significantly enhanced by 79 in non am plants after drought stress in contrast am plants maintained steady state levels as compared to well watered treatments table 1 stomatal conductance gs was significantly reduced after two weeks of water limited conditions both in am and in non am plants table 1 no differences were found in the efficiency of photosystem ii due to water availability or am fungal inoculation table 1 3 2 hydrostatic and osmotic root hydraulic conductivities and percentage of apoplastic water flow under well watered conditions lpr was enhanced significantly by sa application in non am plants fig 1 a am inoculation also enhanced lpr as compared to non am plants but no further enhancement was observed in these plants due to sa application the application of aip in non am plants maintained lpr values similar to control untreated plants under drought stress conditions lpr values were also higher in am plants than in non am plants fig 1a the application of sa inhibited lpr by 47 in am plants while the application of aip maintained steady state lpr values in non am plants lpr exhibited the lowest values and no effects of either sa or aip were observed under well watered conditions lo resulted unaffected by am inoculation sa or aip application fig 1b under drought stress conditions lo values where always considerably and consistently higher in am plants than in non am plants the application of sa inhibited lo both in am plants by 23 and in non am plants by 51 the application of aip maintained steady state lo values in both kinds of plants the percentage of apoplastic water flow under well watered conditions was similar in am and non am plants fig 1c the sa application reduced significantly this value only in am plants while the application of aip reduced this value both in am and non am plants under drought stress conditions the application of sa had contrasting effects in am and non am plants thus sa enhanced by 71 the percentage of apoplastic water flow in non am plants but decreased it by 50 in am plants again the application of aip did not affect the apoplastic water flow as compared to untreated plants 3 3 expression of maize aquaporin genes in this study we analyzed the expression of 8 maize aquaporin genes shown in a previous report to be consistently regulated by the am symbiosis under drought stress quiroga et al 2017 in well watered non am plants zmpip1 1 aquaporin relative expression level was unaltered by sa application but it showed a significant increase due to aip treatment fig 2 a in such conditions am inoculation resulted in zmpip1 1 expression drop in the case of untreated plants and plants treated with aip on the other hand droughted non am plants featured a significant decrease in zmpip1 1 expression in presence of external sa but no effect of am inoculation was detected similar results were obtained for zmpip2 2 relative expression of well watered plants fig 2b no effect after sa application but significant decreases due to am inoculation in untreated plants and in plants treated with aip under drought conditions sa and aip led to a significant decline in zmpip2 2 relative expression in non am plants whereas no effect of am inoculation was featured under well watered conditions zmpip1 3 relative expression was unaltered but when plants grew under water limited conditions its expression was reduced in non am plants after aip application fig 2c am inoculation also significantly decreased its expression but only in untreated plants fig 2c when analyzing the zmpip2 4 aquaporin mrna it was highlighted that when non am plants grew well irrigated sa application decreased its expression but aip maintained steady state expression level as comparted to control untreated plants fig 2d in such conditions am reduced zmpip2 4 relative expression in the case of untreated well watered plants or after aip treatment under drought stress conditions no chemical effect was shown and am inoculation only provoked zmpip2 4 expression to drop in the case of sa treated plants interestingly a similar pattern was found when comparing zmtip1 1 relative expression fig 2e fully watered non am plants also showed a significant decrease in gene expression after sa application and a significant increase when treated with aip am symbiosis contributed to zmtip1 1 relative expression drop in untreated or aip treated plants contrariwise none of the studied factors altered zmtip1 1 expression under drought stress conditions well watered plants did not show significant differences regarding zmtip2 3 relative gene expression but under water limited conditions a significant inhibition was observed due to am symbiosis in untreated plants fig 2f well watered plants did not feature changes regarding zmtip4 1 relative gene expression fig 2g however under drought stress sa application led to gene expression enhancement in non am plants which were maintained under steady state levels after aip treatment this behaviour was not observed when plants were inoculated with r irregularis since no changes were detected in zmtip4 1 relative gene expression after chemical treatment fig 2g concerning the relative expression of zmnip2 1 aquaporin no significant alterations were featured due to the studies treatments regardless of the water regime fig 2h 3 4 aquaporin protein abundance pip1 and pip2 aquaporin proteins abundance were measured besides it was quantified the pip2 phosphorylation state in roots as aquaporin water channel activity depends on this post transcriptional modification in this line the content of pip2 protein phosphorylated at ser 280 pip2a at ser 283 pip2b and double phosphorylated at ser 280 and ser 283 pip2c was also quantified in addition specific antibodies were used to quantify the abundance of zmtip1 1 and zmpip2 4 proteins under well watered conditions pip1 protein abundance was unaffected by chemical treatment but significantly decreased due to am fungus inoculation fig 3 a however when plants grew under drought stress conditions no significant alteration of pip1 proteins in roots was registered as result of the studied factors alone or in combination regarding the pip2 proteins abundance it is remarkable that fully irrigated plants showed no differences due to chemical treatment or fungal inoculation fig 3b nevertheless non am droughted plants increased pip2 proteins content after sa application phosphorylated pip2 proteins at ser 280 pip2a featured no relevant changes due to chemical treatment under well watered conditions fig 3c but a significant decrease after am inoculation in untreated plants was observed in the case of drought stressed treatments no changes were observed as result of chemical treatment or am symbiosis pip2 proteins phosphorylated at ser 283 pip2b of fully watered plants showed no significant differences because of the chemical treatment fig 3d but a significant drop due to am inoculation in the case of sa treated plants was observed pip2 b protein of plants subjected to drought stress did not feature any significant change related to chemical treatments or am symbiosis interestingly pip2c pip2 proteins phosphorylated at ser 280 and ser 283 showed a similar pattern than pip2b fig 3e in both cases when plants grew fully watered no alteration was due to the chemical treatment but they showed a significant decrease in their protein abundance because of the am inoculation in plants submitted to sa application the relative abundance of zmtip1 1 aquaporin was unaltered by the studied parameters under well watered conditions fig 3f nevertheless under water limitation am inoculation led to a significant increases in zmtip1 1 abundance when plants were either untreated or treated with aip and this effect was not found in sa treated plants fig 3f fully watered plants did not show significant changes in zmpip2 4 relative abundance due to sa or aip application and am inoculation these plants only featured enhanced aquaporin content when plants were am inoculated and treated with aip fig 3g under drought conditions zmpip2 4 abundance was not significantly altered by chemical application sa or aip in such circumstances am inoculation led to significant increase of zmpip2 4 protein abundance in untreated plants 3 5 sap and root phytohormone contents sap iaa content under well watered conditions was unaffected by any of the studied chemical treatment or even am inoculation fig 4 a however under drought conditions a greater iaa content in non am plants was shown after sa application in contrast this chemical treatment showed a significant drop in sap iaa when plants were am inoculated sap aba concentration featured no differences due to chemical treatment or fungal inoculation regardless of the water regime fig 4b similar trend was registered for sap sa content in well watered plants which were unaffected by chemical treatment fig 4c nevertheless under drought stress conditions sa application provoked the sap sa content to increase in non am plants remarkably in such stressed plants a significant decrease in sap sa content was found due to am inoculation sap ja concentration was unaffected by the studied hormone treatment when plants grew under full water regime fig 4d but under drought stress conditions am inoculation significantly increased ja levels of untreated plants root iaa content was unaffected by chemical treatment or am inoculation under well watered conditions fig 4e only in sa treated plants am inoculation significantly increased iaa concentration however when plants were submitted to water deficit am inoculation led to a significant root iaa increase in all chemical treatments particularly after sa application under well watered conditions plants featured no changes in root aba concentration due to chemical application but a significant increase because of am inoculation was observed in the case of untreated plants or plants treated with aip fig 4f in droughted plants root aba was not susceptible to change after chemical treatment but in all cases am inoculation led to significant increases in aba content regarding the root sa concentration plants were not significantly altered by chemical treatment regardless of the water regime fig 4g but am inoculated plants significantly increased their contents except in the case of well watered plants treated with sa it was also highlighted that under well watered conditions the combination of am inoculation and aip augmented root sa concentration under fully watered conditions aip application significantly increased root ja content in non am plants fig 4h in such water regime r irregularis led to root ja drop besides when plants were submitted to drought stress aip application also promoted root ja accumulation in non am plants however under drought stress no significant changes as consequence of am inoculation were featured regarding root ja root ja ile of well watered plants presented increased content after aip treatment in both am inoculated and non inoculated plants fig 4i but when plants were submitted to drought treatment no significant changes were observed due to the chemical or fungal treatments 3 6 correlations among root hydraulic properties and the studied parameters under well watered conditions hydrostatic root hydraulic conductivity lpr was found to be negatively correlated with zmpip2 4 and zmtip1 1 gene expression as reflected by the pearson correlation test table 2 however no correlation was found between osmotic root hydraulic conductivity lo and the measured parameters also none of the measured parameters showed significant correlation with the percentage of water flowing thought the apoplastic route table 2 our data also revealed the absence of correlation between root sa concentration and these variables however sap sa concentration was correlated positively with sap iaa and root aba content table 2 in contrast under drought stress conditions pearson correlation test revealed the positive correlation between lpr and lo table 2 both measurements of root hydraulic conductivity hydrostatic and osmotic were significantly and positively correlated with sap ja concentration zmpip2 4 and zmtip1 1 proteins abundance and negatively correlated with pip1 and pip2 proteins content besides lo also showed positive correlation with sap aba concentration and root aba content and was negatively correlated with pip2 b and pip2c proteins content as well as with zmpip2 4 gene expression relative apoplastic water flow and root sa concentration did not correlate with any of the measured parameters contrariwise sap sa concentration was positively correlated with sap aba concentration and root iaa content as well as negatively correlated with pip2c protein abundance and zmpip2 4 gene expression table 2 4 discussion in this study we shed light on the differential root water transport regulation under water shortage when an am fungus in this case r irregularis is present in plant roots our group has already reported the modulation between different water transport pathways by the am symbiosis in maize plants compared to non inoculated plants under drought stress bárzana et al 2012 now we go further on this mechanism by studying for the first time the implication of external sa application in water transport regulation of am plants 4 1 am enhances plant performance under drought the water stress imposed in this study produced a drop of gs by around 75 regardless of fungal am inoculation table 1 as in isohydric cultivars this is one of the earliest responses to water deprivation hasanuzzaman et al 2014 indeed the reduction in plant biomass production caused by drought stress has been related to direct effects on the plant photosynthetic capacity due to reduced stomatal conductance sheng et al 2008 moreover drought stress caused a significant reduction in plant biomass production in all treatments although am plants always maintained higher values of sdw and rdw than non am plants thus am improved drought tolerance in maize plants was firstly demonstrated by the higher biomass production by these plants under water deprivation treatment table 1 the positive effect of mycorrhization was also observed under well watered conditions both in shoot and root dry weights table 1 the enhancement of drought tolerance in maize and other plant species by am colonization involves greater plant biomass boomsma and vyn 2008 thanks in part to a better plant mineral nutrition smith and smith 2011 however a higher capacity for co2 fixation in am plants may also have accounted for this improved plant growth since enhanced rubisco activity in am grapevine and rice plants has been described under drought and salinity respectively porcel et al 2015 valentine et al 2006 in this study am symbiosis did not lead to the enhancement of gs values probably due to the higher biomass of am plants which implies an also higher total transpiration rate in am plants baslam et al 2012 however better membrane stability of droughted am plants compared to non am ones was observed by measuring the percentage of electrolyte leakage el in these plants el maintained the steady state values of well watered plants table 1 this effect of am association is consistent with our previous observation under drought stress conditions quiroga et al 2017 4 2 root water transport is regulated by am and sa application to cope with water scarcity plants have developed a variety of strategies including regulation of tissues permeability to water movement calvo polanco et al 2016 root hydraulic conductivity lpr was measured as an estimation of the root water transport potential and to determine its role under limited water availability drought stress produced a drop of lpr and lo fig 1a and b often addressed in the literature under water deprivation or other abiotic stresses like salinity boursiac et al 2005 martínez ballesta et al 2003 martre et al 2001 meng and fricke 2017 some authors argued that this phenomenon and the consequent decrease of water uptake by roots could be a mechanism for the avoidance of water loss when soils start to dry aroca et al 2012 however am plants enhanced lpr of droughted plants fig 1a and this positive effect was already observed in other studies sánchez romera et al 2016 probably because these plants do not suffer dehydration as much as non inoculated plants moreover in this study the effects of the applied chemical compound are mainly observed in water stressed plants fig 1a this could be due to a different dynamic of droughted roots for water uptake as compared to well watered roots and therefore to different efficiency for chemical uptake from the nutrient solution sa decreased lpr of droughted am plants while the application of aip maintained steady state lpr levels fig 1a in addition osmotic component of root hydraulic conductivity lo that gives information of water flowing through the cell to cell pathway where aquaporins participate maurel et al 2008 presented the same trend under drought stress than lpr fig 1b diminishing its levels when applying sa in both non am or am plants this suggests that sa may be also altering aquaporin regulation as it was previously pointed by boursiac et al 2008 and du et al 2013 however in this study the effects of sa on root hydraulic properties and aquaporin gene expression were not evident the lack of a clear correlation between sa mediated root hydraulic properties and sa mediated aquaporin gene expression may be due to the fact that some aquaporins genes cannot be regulated by sa because of the lack of sa responsive elements in their promoter region as evidenced by tungngoen et al 2011 for a hevea brasilensis pip aquaporin no information is available currently about the presence or absence of such elements in the promoter regions of the maize aquaporins moreover a delay between hormonal treatment iaa and aquaporin gene expression has been described in arabidopsis péret et al 2012 which may also occur here with sa thus the way through which sa regulates these membrane proteins is uncertain and the two studies mentioned above presented contradictory results about the regulation of aquaporin internalization by the hormone du et al 2013 found that increased sa levels hinder the constitutive recycling of membrane proteins like aquaporins increasing the abundance of some of them in the plasmalemma as a mechanism to control their activity in contrast boursiac et al 2008 described an stimulus induced internalization of pip proteins after sa application meditated by reactive oxygen species ros in any case aquaporin modulation was extensively reported to substantially contribute to total root water flow boursiac et al 2008 knipfer and fricke 2011 martínez ballesta et al 2000 martre et al 2001 vandeleur et al 2014 in our study significant correlation between aquaporin accumulation and lo was found exclusively under drought stress treatment table 2 but not under well watered conditions this supports the idea of ros involvement as they may accumulate under drought conditions leading to relocalization of aquaporins as reported by independent studies boursiac et al 2008 velikanov et al 2015 since plants undergo frequent environmental changes the activity of aquaporins must be regulated by mechanisms that allow rapid responses to these changes aquaporins regulate cell water flow either through changes in their abundance or channel gating tyerman et al 2002 post translational modifications are also necessary to achieve such rapid regulation vandeleur et al 2014 including phosphorylation de phosphorylation of specific serine residues the first post translational regulation mechanism found in aquaporins prado et al 2013 prak et al 2008 this modification generates conformational changes allowing aquaporin gating or modifying its subcellular localization in the membrane johansson et al 1998 prado et al 2013 prak et al 2008 and has been proposed as a mechanism to prevent water loss bárzana et al 2015 phosphorylation of c terminal residues ser 280 and ser 283 of pip2 aquaporins was correlated to the regulation of lpr in plants prado et al 2013 the present data show that pip2 b ser 283 and pip2c ser 280 and ser 283 both negatively correlated with lo under ds as well as pip2 and pip1 protein levels table 2 however when analysing zmpip2 4 root aquaporin abundance one of the most abundant aquaporins in maize roots with prominent role in water transport chaumont et al 2001 it correlated positively with lo under water shortage table 2 this could be contradictory but it must be taken into account that the pip2 antibody recognizes several different isoforms within the pip2 subfamily that may have different roles in water transport regulation zmtip1 1 protein abundance presented the same trend previously described for zmpip2 4 protein and consequently also correlated with lpr table 2 suggesting that these two proteins could be of high interest in regulating water transport in our experimental conditions surprisingly zmpip2 4 transcript levels negatively correlated with lo table 2 however expression levels of aquaporins do not always correlate with their protein abundance as both change along time and with the growing conditions chaumont and tyerman 2014 expression patterns of most analysed aquaporins differed in am and non am plants fig 2 which in general involved their downregulation in am plants as was shown in previous reports bárzana et al 2014 quiroga et al 2017 interestingly it has been highlighted the different behaviour of non am and am plants under drought after sa application whereas non am plants increased the percentage of apoplastic water flow in presence of exogenous sa plants inoculated with the am fungus decreased water circulating through this pathway when the hormone was applied fig 1c this effect can result from the differential effect of this hormone on lpr in plants inoculated with the symbiotic fungus under drought this is consistent with previous results where am plants were suggested to have a higher plasticity for switching between water transport pathways bárzana et al 2012 in addition this differential effect of sa on the apoplastic water flow in am and non am plants may be mediated by altered nitric oxide no content in these plants since it has been recently shown that sa induced no regulates maize water content and hydraulic conductivity under drought shan and wang 2017 moreover sánchez romera et al 2017 have suggested that no favours apoplastic water pathway inside roots and suggested that different outcomes in root hydraulic conductivity observed between am and non am plants could be mediated by differences in no content thus a higher no content in non am plants than in am ones could explain the sa induced enhancement of apoplastic water flow in non am plants and the opposite effect in am plants 4 3 implication of phytohormones in root water transport regulation salicylic acid has been previously shown to alter plant water relations under drought or salt stress conditions faried et al 2017 farooq et al 2010 khan et al 2015 on the light of our results no clear relationship between exogenous sa application and root or sap sa concentration increase was found although in sap an enhancement in such hormone occurred under drought fig 4c g and l however it is noteworthy that as mentioned above sa effects on plant functions are dose dependent khan et al 2015 miura and tada 2014 indeed an important aspect regarding the effect of sa application is the dose of sa and the method of application via foliar or via hydroponic solution generally low concentrations less than 0 5 mm of sa increase drought tolerance while high concentrations 2 3 mm decrease drought tolerance miura and tada 2014 thereby the selected dose in this study 0 02 mm applied via hydroponic solution is enough to affect lpr but may not be sufficient to alter hormonal tissue content nonetheless sa could be modifying lpr through the alteration of other phytohormones in roots as a complex crosstalk among these compounds may take place controlling plant performance under different environmental conditions munné bosch and müller 2013 in fact a consistent response in am plants was the increase of iaa aba and sa in roots under drought conditions compared to non am plants fig 4e f and g in this sense sa has been described to play a role in the regulation of am root colonization although the precise mechanism is not clear yet herrera medina et al 2003 moreover sa was also reported to induce genes involved in aba biosynthesis as well as to modify aba transport to the shoots horváth et al 2015 regarding the functioning of the am symbiosis aba was related to arbuscule formation thus being necessary for efficient am symbiosis establishment and functioning miransari et al 2012 an enhancement of the aba content by the am symbiosis was clearly reflected by our results fig 4f taking together these data and the previously described enhancement of lpr by aba aroca et al 2008 parent et al 2009 we hypothesize that enhanced aba in am inoculated plants may favour the increase in root conductivity under drought conditions this idea is also supported by the higher lpr and lo found in am plants under drought stress fig 1a and b in addition to this iaa is considered to be essential for am infection especially during pre symbiotic interactions hanlon and coenen 2011 and our result showed an important enhancement of root iaa content after amf root colonization especially in sa treated plants this enhanced iaa levels in am sa treated plants may have contributed to the reduction in the hydraulic parameters measured here since péret et al 2012 showed that exogenous iaa application inhibited most aquaporins genes in a thaliana and reduced root hydraulic conductivity both at the cell and whole organ level in relation with am development some authors also found alterations in root ja levels with root colonization liu et al 2013 pedranzani et al 2016 however no changes were found in other studies lópez ráez et al 2010 sánchez romera et al 2016 aba ja and sa were hypothesized to have some common regulatory elements in their signalling pathways although their clear relationship was not established yet proietti et al 2013 sa and ja interaction has normally been reported to be antagonistic in defence response koornneef et al 2008 although from hormonal content we cannot observe any clear relationship between them sap ja levels positively correlated with lo and lpr under drought table 2 and this is in line with previous results of ja on lpr sánchez romera et al 2014 2016 an opposite effect was induced by sa on these parameters which agree with results by volobueva et al 2004 who reported decreased water conductance in maize roots by sa addition and results by boursiac et al 2008 showing down regulation of root water transport by sa in arabidopsis plants thus from our data we could deduce that there is a relationship between these hormones in response to drought which is regulated by am colonization even if further research is needed to explain accurately the way these hormones interact 5 conclusions in the present work we demonstrated that am symbiosis can modify root hydraulic response to drought episodes under these conditions am plants showed both increased lpr and lo this together with the better exploration and exploitation of the soil water resources by the fungal hyphae that has been widely described in literature marulanda et al 2003 allen 2007 2009 ruth et al 2011 may results in greater amount of water available to the am plants and better performance of am plants under water deprivation exogenous sa application altered root hydraulic parameters decreasing lpr and lo under drought while application of its inhibitor aip maintained steady state levels for these parameters sa modulation of water conductivity could be due to a fine regulation of root aquaporins as zmpip2 4 or zmtip1 1 furthermore sa application differently modulated the percentage of water flowing by the apoplastic pathway under the imposed stress decreasing its contribution to total root water flow in am plants and increasing it in non am plants intricate relationship between lpr aquaporins and endogenous levels of phytohormones especially sa aba and ja was observed revealing a complex network controlling water transport in roots future researches should analyse the promoter regions of the maize aquaporin genes to search for hormone responsive elements and to explore more in detail the crosstalk mechanism between these hormones in the regulation of water transport in am roots in order to better understand

11520,climate change is leading to the intensification of drought effects worldwide which considerably reduce crop production a better understanding of the drought tolerance mechanisms would lead into a more productive agriculture the arbuscular mycorrhizal am symbiosis has been shown to improve plant tolerance to drought salicylic acid sa is a phenolic compound involved in many aspects of plant growth and development apart from its role in biotic interactions it is also involved in the regulation of important plant physiological processes including plant water relations under stressful conditions however despite the importance of sa in plant physiology and in am colonization little is known about its effect on regulation of root water transport thus the aim of this work was to study the combined effect of am symbiosis and sa on root hydraulic properties under drought stress with special focus on how these factors can alter radial root water transport pathways through aquaporin regulation also the crosstalk between sa and other phytohormones was taken into account results showed that the am symbiosis modifies root hydraulic responses to drought episodes under these conditions am plants showed increased lpr and lo exogenous sa application decreased lpr and lo under drought sa modulation of water conductivity could be due to a fine regulation of root aquaporins as zmpip2 4 or zmtip1 1 furthermore sa application differently modulated the percentage of water flowing by the apoplastic pathway decreasing its contribution to total root water flow in am plants and increasing it in non am plants an intricate relationship between lpr aquaporins and endogenous levels of sa aba and jasmonic acid was observed future studies should explore more in detail the crosstalk mechanism between these hormones in the regulation of water transport in am roots in order to better understand the mechanism through which the am symbiosis copes with drought stress keywords aquaporin arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis drought root hydraulic conductivity 1 introduction climate change is leading to the intensification of drought effects and cultivable soils are progressively drying worldwide trenberth et al 2014 with more often drought events that considerably reduce crop production lesk et al 2016 agricultural drought reduces plant growth and affects essential plant physiological and biochemical processes as stomatal conductance transpiration root water uptake photosynthesis or membrane functions it also increases the production of reactive oxygen species ros producing oxidative stress that damages cells and even leads to plant death hasanuzzaman et al 2014 thus a better understanding of the mechanisms that help plants to improve their water status during water stress would lead into a more productive agriculture phytohormones play essential roles and coordinate different signalling pathways during abiotic stress responses wani et al 2016 among these salicylic acid sa is a phenolic compound involved in many aspects of growth and plant development as well as in the regulation of the response to different abiotic and biotic stresses khan et al 2015 miura and tada 2014 salicylic acid has been studied mainly in relation to plant pathogen interactions since it has the ability to induce systemic acquired resistance to different pathogens in plants gunes et al 2007 indeed it coordinates the plant s defence against biotrophic pathogens lu 2009 and foo et al 2013 suggested that sa might also have a role during arbuscular mycorrhizal am colonization previous studies point in this direction with a short lived rise in sa levels during the early stages of am colonization blilou et al 1999 herrera medina et al 2003 showed that the rate of am colonization was affected by the sa content they found that transgenic plants with reduced sa levels exhibited a more rapid am colonization while wild type plants with constitutive sa biosynthesis retarded am colonization of roots although the final level of colonization was unaltered apart from this role in biotic interactions sa is also involved in the regulation of important plant physiological processes such as nitrogen metabolism photosynthesis antioxidant defense system and plant water relations under stress conditions and thereby provides protection in plants against abiotic stresses faried et al 2017 khan et al 2015 sa has been found to improve plant tolerance to salt stress jini and joseph 2017 miura and tada 2014 and to affect plant physiology in maize plants subjected to salinity gunes et al 2007 indeed exogenous sa may induce stomatal closure miura and tada 2014 regulates biosynthesis of osmolytes li et al 2016 misra and saxena 2009 and increases antioxidative defenses in stressed tissues nazar et al 2011 however sa is thought to interact in a complex way with other hormonal compounds such as ethylene gharbi et al 2016 thus its effects on plant physiology can be direct or indirect through alteration of other plant hormones finally sa influences plant functions in a dose dependent manner where induced or inhibited plant functions can be possible with low and high sa concentrations respectively khan et al 2015 there are increasing evidences of enhanced drought tolerance when exogenous sa is applied alam et al 2013 miura and tada 2014 li et al 2016 however this regulation is orchestrated in a complex cross talk between different phytohormones auxins cytokinins aba gibberellins under optimal and stressful conditions munné bosch and müller 2013 on the other hand am fungi which establish a mutualistic relationship with most crop plants have been described to improve water and nutrient uptake enhancing tolerance to abiotic stresses such as drought ruiz lozano et al 2012 being a possible alternative to the use of inorganic fertilizers zoppellari et al 2014 this amelioration is achieved by allowing plants the access to distant water from the soil and by altering root hydraulic properties bárzana et al 2012 water transport in roots according to the composite model steudle and peterson 1998 occurs as the sum of three pathways apoplastic via the cell wall continuum symplastic via plasmodesmata and transcellular across the cell membranes the last two pathways cannot be differentiated empirically being reduced to the so called cell to cell pathway aquaporins play an important regulatory role in this last pathway and within this protein family water channel activity is mainly found in the pip2 subfamily maurel et al 2008 by measuring root hydraulic conductivity lpr root water transport capacity can be estimated providing information on plant water status and water mobilization capacity of roots it is known that under non stressful conditions the radial water flow is mainly apoplastic following the hydrostatic gradient created by transpiration however when transpiration is restricted as under drought water goes mainly by the cell to cell pathway following an osmotic gradient between soil solution and xylem sap thus relative contribution of these two pathway to overall water uptake or hydraulic conductivity may change substantially hachez et al 2006 martínez ballesta et al 2003 vadez et al 2013 and under drought conditions root hydraulics is adjusted by switching between both pathways ranathunge et al 2004 it is expected that aquaporins play a key role in the regulation of water flow in plants under conditions of water limitation affecting important parameters such as the root hydraulic conductivity hachez et al 2006 zarrouk et al 2016 moreover there is growing evidence that the contribution of aquaporin mediated water transport to root water uptake is much larger than previously thought even under conditions of high transpiration knipfer and fricke 2010 2011 previous studies have investigated the effects of the am symbiosis on water pathways in the roots of host plants combined with the use of an inhibitor of aquaporins activity bárzana et al 2012 results showed that roots of am plants enhanced significantly the water circulating by apoplastic pathway as compared to non am plants both under well watered and under drought stress conditions data also showed that the presence of the am fungus in the roots of the host plants could modulate the switching between cell to cell and apoplastic water transport pathways this was interpreted as a way to provide higher flexibility in the response of am plants to water shortage according to the demands from the shoot bárzana et al 2012 other recent evidences suggest that the modulation of aba auxins and or sa levels in the host plant may contribute to this switching between water pathways mediated by the am fungus calvo polanco et al 2014 sánchez romera et al 2016 indeed aba was found to increased lpr at root cortical cell and organ levels in maize facilitating water uptake under water limiting conditions hose et al 2000 and aba was identified as a possible aquaporin regulator boursiac et al 2008 wan et al 2004 studies in arabidopsis indicated that indole acetic acid iaa acts through an auxin response factor 7 arf7 dependent path to inhibit the expression of most pips at both transcriptional and translational levels péret et al 2012 similarly sa down regulates pip aquaporins and root hydraulic conductivity by a ros mediated mechanism which provoked membrane internalization of pip aquaporins boursiac et al 2008 despite the importance of sa in plant physiology and in am colonization as well as its putative role under drought conditions little is known about its effect on root hydraulic conductivity and regulation of water transport in roots and to the best of our knowledge studies about the combined effect of exogenous sa application and am symbiosis are lacking thus the aim of this research was to study the combined effect of am symbiosis and sa on root hydraulic properties under drought stress being specially focused on how these factors can alter radial root water transport pathways through aquaporin regulation for that we applied exogenous sa or an inhibitor of its biosynthesis 2 aminoindan 2 phosphonic acid aip pan et al 2006 also the crosstalk between sa and other plant hormones under the former conditions will be discussed the results of this study could lead to a better understanding of water uptake mechanisms and plant tolerance to drought when the am fungus is present increasing our knowledge of its effect on plant water balance 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment consisted of a factorial design with three factors 1 inoculation treatment with non inoculated control plants c and plants inoculated with the am fungus rhizophagus irregularis strain eez 58 ri 2 chemical treatment so that one group of each inoculation treatment was maintained without hormone untreated another group of plants was treated with salicylic acid sa and the last group was treated with 2 aminoindan 2 phosphonic acid aip as inhibitor of sa biosynthesis 3 watering treatment so that half of the plants were grown under well watered ww conditions throughout the entire experiment and the other half was subjected to drought stress for 15 days before harvest ds the different combination of these factors gave a total of 12 treatments each treatment had 10 replicates giving a total of 120 plants 2 2 biological material and growth conditions a loamy soil was collected at the grounds of ifapa granada spain sieved 2 mm

plants were grown in 1l pots filled with 1250 g of a mixture of soil sand 1 9 for 8 weeks at the time of planting half of the plants were inoculated with ten grams of mycorrhizal inoculum from rhizophagus irregularis schenck and smith strain eez 58 mycorrhizal inoculum consisted of soil spores mycelia and infected root fragments non inoculated plants received a 5 ml aliquot of a filtrate 20 μm of the am inoculum in order to provide the natural microbial population free of am propagules plants were grown for 8 weeks in a greenhouse at 19 25 c 16 8 light dark period 50 60 relative humidity and an average photosynthetic photon flux density of 800 μmol m 2 s 1 as measured with a light meter licor lincoln ne usa model li 188b plants were irrigated three times per week with 50 ml of hoagland nutrient solution hoagland and arnon 1950 modified to contain 25 p in order to avoid am symbiosis inhibition the same amount of water was applied on alternate days a drought stress treatment was applied for the last 2 weeks by irrigating plants with half the water hoagland volume of well watered ones 25 ml vs 50 ml this water stress was similar as in a previous work with similar experimental design quiroga et al 2017 it could be considered as a severe stress as evidenced by a drop of stomatal conductance by around 75 table 1 salicylic acid 20 μm and aip 75 μm were applied

system of ten replicates per treatment were collected and used for fresh weight recording then 5 replicates per treatment were dried in a hot air oven at 70 c for 2 days and dry weights were recorded the other 5 replicates were immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c until they were used roots of maize were stained according to phillips and hayman 1970 in order to differentiate fungal structures the extent of mycorrhizal colonization was calculated according to the gridline intersect method giovannetti and mosse 1980 in five replicates per treatment 2 3 2 stomatal conductance stomatal conductance gs was measured two hours after the onset of photoperiod in the second youngest leaf from 10 plants per treatment with a porometer system porometer ap4 delta t devices ltd cambridge uk following the manufacter s instructions measurements were taken one day before harvest 2 3 3 photosynthetic efficiency the efficiency of photosystem ii was measured with fluorpen fp100 photon systems instruments brno czech republic which allows a non invasive assessment of plant photosynthetic performance by measuring chlorophyll a fluorescence fluorpen quantifies the quantum yield of photosystem ii as the ratio between the actual fluorescence yield in the light adapted state fv and the maximum fluorescence yield in the light adapted state fm according to oxborough and baker 1997 measurements were taken in the second youngest leaf of 10 different plants of each treatment one day before harvest 2 3 4 membrane electrolyte leakage leaf electrolyte leakage was determined in 10 plants per treatment leaf samples were washed with deionized water to remove surface adhered electrolytes the samples were placed in 15 ml falcon tubes containing 10 ml of deionized water and incubated at 25 c on a rotary shaker at 100 rpm during 3 h and the electrical conductivity of the solution e0 was determined using a conductivity meter mettler toledo ag 8603 switzerland samples were then placed at 80 c for 2 h subsequently tubes were incubated again at room temperature under smoothly agitation and the final electrical conductivity ef was obtained after 3 h under these conditions the electrolyte leakage was defined as follows e0 ewater ef ewater x 100 where ewater is the electrical conductivity of the deionized water used to incubate the samples 2 3 5 osmotic root hydraulic conductivity lo lo was measured at noon on detached roots exuding under atmospheric pressure by the free exudation method benabdellah et al 2009 under these conditions water is only moving following an osmotic gradient therefore the water would be moving through the cell to cell path steudle and peterson 1998 the exuded sap was collected after 2 h and weighed the osmolarity of the exuded sap and the nutrient solution was determined using a cryoscopic osmometer and used for lo calculation according to aroca et al 2007 lo was calculated as lo jv δy where jv is the exuded sap flow rate and δψ the osmotic potential difference between the exuded sap and the nutrient solution where the pots were immersed measurements were carried out 6 h after starting the chemical treatment 2 3 6 hydrostatic root hydraulic conductivity lpr the lpr was determined at noon in five plants n 5 per treatment with a scholander pressure chamber 6 h after starting the chemical treatment and following the method described by bárzana et al 2012 a gradual increase of pressure 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mpa was applied at 2 min intervals to the detached roots sap was collected after 2 min at the three pressure points sap flow was plotted against pressure with the slope being the root hydraulic conductance l value lpr was determined by dividing l by root dry weight rdw and expressed as mg h2o g rdw 1 mpa 1 h 1 aliquots of the collected sap were used for subsequent hormonal determination 2 3 7 relative apoplastic water flow relative changes in apoplastic water flux were estimated using light green dye light green sf yellowish sigma aldrich chemical gillingham dorset colour index 42095 molecular weight 792 85 g mol 1 which has the ability to move apoplastically but not symplastically lópez pérez et al 2007 detopped root systems were immersed in 250 μmol l 1 light green solution inside the pressure chamber 5 min before pressure application and kept in this solution during measurement sap was collected after 2 min at 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mpa in a scholander pressure chamber at the end the concentration of the dye in the whole collected sap was determined immediately at 630 nm bárzana et al 2012 the average baseline fluorescence value in the nutrient solution before addition of the dye was subtracted to the values obtained after adding the dye and in the collected sap the percentage of apoplastic pathway was calculated from the ratio between dye concentration in the sap flow and in the nutrient solution the concentration of dye in the nutrient solution of each treatment was considered to be 100 2 3 8 sap and root hormonal content in sap iaa aba sa and ja were analysed according to albacete et al 2008 with some modifications briefly xylem sap samples were filtered through 13 mm diameter

contamination all the cdna sets were checked by running control pcr reactions with aliquots of the same rna that have been subjected to the dnase treatment but not to the reverse transcription step the expression of a group of maize aquaporins previously selected as regulated by the am symbiosis bárzana et al 2014 quiroga et al 2017 was studied by real time pcr by using icycler system bio rad hercules ca usa adjusting protocols to optimize the pcr reaction to each gene the primer sets used to amplify each aquaporin gene were designed in the 3 and 5 untranslated regions of each gene in order to avoid unspecific amplification of the different aquaporin genes bárzana et al 2014 hachez et al 2006 polymerase chain reactions were performed in a 96 well plate with an icycler 5 system bio

root length showing no significant differences between water treatments whereas non inoculated plants did not show am colonization table 1 shoot and root dry weight decreased significantly by 40 in average due to drought stress treatment but am plants maintained higher plant dry weight than non am ones regardless of water regime table 1 thus under well watered conditions the shoot dry weight was 13 higher in am plants and under drought stress conditions the increase was by 11 membrane electrolyte leakage el was significantly enhanced by 79 in non am plants after drought stress in contrast am plants maintained steady state levels as compared to well watered treatments table 1 stomatal conductance gs was significantly reduced after two weeks of water limited conditions both in am and in non am plants table 1 no differences were found in the efficiency of photosystem ii due to water availability or am fungal inoculation table 1 3 2 hydrostatic and osmotic root hydraulic conductivities and percentage of apoplastic water flow under well watered conditions lpr was enhanced significantly by sa application in non am plants fig 1 a am inoculation also enhanced lpr as compared to non am plants but no further enhancement was observed in these plants due to sa application the application of aip in non am plants maintained lpr values similar to control untreated plants under drought stress conditions lpr values were also higher in am plants than in non am plants fig 1a the application of sa inhibited lpr by 47 in am plants while the application of aip maintained steady state lpr values in non am plants lpr exhibited the lowest values and no effects of either sa or aip were observed under well watered conditions lo resulted unaffected by am inoculation sa or aip application fig 1b under drought stress conditions lo values where always considerably and consistently higher in am plants than in non am plants the application of sa inhibited lo both in am plants by 23 and in non am plants by 51 the application of aip maintained steady state lo values in both kinds of plants the percentage of apoplastic water flow under well watered conditions was similar in am and non am plants fig 1c the sa application reduced significantly this value only in am plants while the application of aip reduced this value both in am and non am plants under drought stress conditions the application of sa had contrasting effects in am and non am plants thus sa enhanced by 71 the percentage of apoplastic water flow in non am plants but decreased it by 50 in am plants again the application of aip did not affect the apoplastic water flow as compared to untreated plants 3 3 expression of maize aquaporin genes in this study we analyzed the expression of 8 maize aquaporin genes shown in a previous report to be consistently regulated by the am symbiosis under drought stress quiroga et al 2017 in well watered non am plants zmpip1 1 aquaporin relative expression level was unaltered by sa application but it showed a significant increase due to aip treatment fig 2 a in such conditions am inoculation resulted in zmpip1 1 expression drop in the case of untreated plants and plants treated with aip on the other hand droughted non am plants featured a significant decrease in zmpip1 1 expression in presence of external sa but no effect of am inoculation was detected similar results were obtained for zmpip2 2 relative expression of well watered plants fig 2b no effect after sa application but significant decreases due to am inoculation in untreated plants and in plants treated with aip under drought conditions sa and aip led to a significant decline in zmpip2 2 relative expression in non am plants whereas no effect of am inoculation was featured under well watered conditions zmpip1 3 relative expression was unaltered but when plants grew under water limited conditions its expression was reduced in non am plants after aip application fig 2c am inoculation also significantly decreased its expression but only in untreated plants fig 2c when analyzing the zmpip2 4 aquaporin mrna it was highlighted that when non am plants grew well irrigated sa application decreased its expression but aip maintained steady state expression level as comparted to control untreated plants fig 2d in such conditions am reduced zmpip2 4 relative expression in the case of untreated well watered plants or after aip treatment under drought stress conditions no chemical effect was shown and am inoculation only provoked zmpip2 4 expression to drop in the case of sa treated plants interestingly a similar pattern was found when comparing zmtip1 1 relative expression fig 2e fully watered non am plants also showed a significant decrease in gene expression after sa application and a significant increase when treated with aip am symbiosis contributed to zmtip1 1 relative expression drop in untreated or aip treated plants contrariwise none of the studied factors altered zmtip1 1 expression under drought stress conditions well watered plants did not show significant differences regarding zmtip2 3 relative gene expression but under water limited conditions a significant inhibition was observed due to am symbiosis in untreated plants fig 2f well watered plants did not feature changes regarding zmtip4 1 relative gene expression fig 2g however under drought stress sa application led to gene expression enhancement in non am plants which were maintained under steady state levels after aip treatment this behaviour was not observed when plants were inoculated with r irregularis since no changes were detected in zmtip4 1 relative gene expression after chemical treatment fig 2g concerning the relative expression of zmnip2 1 aquaporin no significant alterations were featured due to the studies treatments regardless of the water regime fig 2h 3 4 aquaporin protein abundance pip1 and pip2 aquaporin proteins abundance were measured besides it was quantified the pip2 phosphorylation state in roots as aquaporin water channel activity depends on this post transcriptional modification in this line the content of pip2 protein phosphorylated at ser 280 pip2a at ser 283 pip2b and double phosphorylated at ser 280 and ser 283 pip2c was also quantified in addition specific antibodies were used to quantify the abundance of zmtip1 1 and zmpip2 4 proteins under well watered conditions pip1 protein abundance was unaffected by chemical treatment but significantly decreased due to am fungus inoculation fig 3 a however when plants grew under drought stress conditions no significant alteration of pip1 proteins in roots was registered as result of the studied factors alone or in combination regarding the pip2 proteins abundance it is remarkable that fully irrigated plants showed no differences due to chemical treatment or fungal inoculation fig 3b nevertheless non am droughted plants increased pip2 proteins content after sa application phosphorylated pip2 proteins at ser 280 pip2a featured no relevant changes due to chemical treatment under well watered conditions fig 3c but a significant decrease after am inoculation in untreated plants was observed in the case of drought stressed treatments no changes were observed as result of chemical treatment or am symbiosis pip2 proteins phosphorylated at ser 283 pip2b of fully watered plants showed no significant differences because of the chemical treatment fig 3d but a significant drop due to am inoculation in the case of sa treated plants was observed pip2 b protein of plants subjected to drought stress did not feature any significant change related to chemical treatments or am symbiosis interestingly pip2c pip2 proteins phosphorylated at ser 280 and ser 283 showed a similar pattern than pip2b fig 3e in both cases when plants grew fully watered no alteration was due to the chemical treatment but they showed a significant decrease in their protein abundance because of the am inoculation in plants submitted to sa application the relative abundance of zmtip1 1 aquaporin was unaltered by the studied parameters under well watered conditions fig 3f nevertheless under water limitation am inoculation led to a significant increases in zmtip1 1 abundance when plants were either untreated or treated with aip and this effect was not found in sa treated plants fig 3f fully watered plants did not show significant changes in zmpip2 4 relative abundance due to sa or aip application and am inoculation these plants only featured enhanced aquaporin content when plants were am inoculated and treated with aip fig 3g under drought conditions zmpip2 4 abundance was not significantly altered by chemical application sa or aip in such circumstances am inoculation led to significant increase of zmpip2 4 protein abundance in untreated plants 3 5 sap and root phytohormone contents sap iaa content under well watered conditions was unaffected by any of the studied chemical treatment or even am inoculation fig 4 a however under drought conditions a greater iaa content in non am plants was shown after sa application in contrast this chemical treatment showed a significant drop in sap iaa when plants were am inoculated sap aba concentration featured no differences due to chemical treatment or fungal inoculation regardless of the water regime fig 4b similar trend was registered for sap sa content in well watered plants which were unaffected by chemical treatment fig 4c nevertheless under drought stress conditions sa application provoked the sap sa content to increase in non am plants remarkably in such stressed plants a significant decrease in sap sa content was found due to am inoculation sap ja concentration was unaffected by the studied hormone treatment when plants grew under full water regime fig 4d but under drought stress conditions am inoculation significantly increased ja levels of untreated plants root iaa content was unaffected by chemical treatment or am inoculation under well watered conditions fig 4e only in sa treated plants am inoculation significantly increased iaa concentration however when plants were submitted to water deficit am inoculation led to a significant root iaa increase in all chemical treatments particularly after sa application under well watered conditions plants featured no changes in root aba concentration due to chemical application but a significant increase because of am inoculation was observed in the case of untreated plants or plants treated with aip fig 4f in droughted plants root aba was not susceptible to change after chemical treatment but in all cases am inoculation led to significant increases in aba content regarding the root sa concentration plants were not significantly altered by chemical treatment regardless of the water regime fig 4g but am inoculated plants significantly increased their contents except in the case of well watered plants treated with sa it was also highlighted that under well watered conditions the combination of am inoculation and aip augmented root sa concentration under fully watered conditions aip application significantly increased root ja content in non am plants fig 4h in such water regime r irregularis led to root ja drop besides when plants were submitted to drought stress aip application also promoted root ja accumulation in non am plants however under drought stress no significant changes as consequence of am inoculation were featured regarding root ja root ja ile of well watered plants presented increased content after aip treatment in both am inoculated and non inoculated plants fig 4i but when plants were submitted to drought treatment no significant changes were observed due to the chemical or fungal treatments 3 6 correlations among root hydraulic properties and the studied parameters under well watered conditions hydrostatic root hydraulic conductivity lpr was found to be negatively correlated with zmpip2 4 and zmtip1 1 gene expression as reflected by the pearson correlation test table 2 however no correlation was found between osmotic root hydraulic conductivity lo and the measured parameters also none of the measured parameters showed significant correlation with the percentage of water flowing thought the apoplastic route table 2 our data also revealed the absence of correlation between root sa concentration and these variables however sap sa concentration was correlated positively with sap iaa and root aba content table 2 in contrast under drought stress conditions pearson correlation test revealed the positive correlation between lpr and lo table 2 both measurements of root hydraulic conductivity hydrostatic and osmotic were significantly and positively correlated with sap ja concentration zmpip2 4 and zmtip1 1 proteins abundance and negatively correlated with pip1 and pip2 proteins content besides lo also showed positive correlation with sap aba concentration and root aba content and was negatively correlated with pip2 b and pip2c proteins content as well as with zmpip2 4 gene expression relative apoplastic water flow and root sa concentration did not correlate with any of the measured parameters contrariwise sap sa concentration was positively correlated with sap aba concentration and root iaa content as well as negatively correlated with pip2c protein abundance and zmpip2 4 gene expression table 2 4 discussion in this study we shed light on the differential root water transport regulation under water shortage when an am fungus in this case r irregularis is present in plant roots our group has already reported the modulation between different water transport pathways by the am symbiosis in maize plants compared to non inoculated plants under drought stress bárzana et al 2012 now we go further on this mechanism by studying for the first time the implication of external sa application in water transport regulation of am plants 4 1 am enhances plant performance under drought the water stress imposed in this study produced a drop of gs by around 75 regardless of fungal am inoculation table 1 as in isohydric cultivars this is one of the earliest responses to water deprivation hasanuzzaman et al 2014 indeed the reduction in plant biomass production caused by drought stress has been related to direct effects on the plant photosynthetic capacity due to reduced stomatal conductance sheng et al 2008 moreover drought stress caused a significant reduction in plant biomass production in all treatments although am plants always maintained higher values of sdw and rdw than non am plants thus am improved drought tolerance in maize plants was firstly demonstrated by the higher biomass production by these plants under water deprivation treatment table 1 the positive effect of mycorrhization was also observed under well watered conditions both in shoot and root dry weights table 1 the enhancement of drought tolerance in maize and other plant species by am colonization involves greater plant biomass boomsma and vyn 2008 thanks in part to a better plant mineral nutrition smith and smith 2011 however a higher capacity for co2 fixation in am plants may also have accounted for this improved plant growth since enhanced rubisco activity in am grapevine and rice plants has been described under drought and salinity respectively porcel et al 2015 valentine et al 2006 in this study am symbiosis did not lead to the enhancement of gs values probably due to the higher biomass of am plants which implies an also higher total transpiration rate in am plants baslam et al 2012 however better membrane stability of droughted am plants compared to non am ones was observed by measuring the percentage of electrolyte leakage el in these plants el maintained the steady state values of well watered plants table 1 this effect of am association is consistent with our previous observation under drought stress conditions quiroga et al 2017 4 2 root water transport is regulated by am and sa application to cope with water scarcity plants have developed a variety of strategies including regulation of tissues permeability to water movement calvo polanco et al 2016 root hydraulic conductivity lpr was measured as an estimation of the root water transport potential and to determine its role under limited water availability drought stress produced a drop of lpr and lo fig 1a and b often addressed in the literature under water deprivation or other abiotic stresses like salinity boursiac et al 2005 martínez ballesta et al 2003 martre et al 2001 meng and fricke 2017 some authors argued that this phenomenon and the consequent decrease of water uptake by roots could be a mechanism for the avoidance of water loss when soils start to dry aroca et al 2012 however am plants enhanced lpr of droughted plants fig 1a and this positive effect was already observed in other studies sánchez romera et al 2016 probably because these plants do not suffer dehydration as much as non inoculated plants moreover in this study the effects of the applied chemical compound are mainly observed in water stressed plants fig 1a this could be due to a different dynamic of droughted roots for water uptake as compared to well watered roots and therefore to different efficiency for chemical uptake from the nutrient solution sa decreased lpr of droughted am plants while the application of aip maintained steady state lpr levels fig 1a in addition osmotic component of root hydraulic conductivity lo that gives information of water flowing through the cell to cell pathway where aquaporins participate maurel et al 2008 presented the same trend under drought stress than lpr fig 1b diminishing its levels when applying sa in both non am or am plants this suggests that sa may be also altering aquaporin regulation as it was previously pointed by boursiac et al 2008 and du et al 2013 however in this study the effects of sa on root hydraulic properties and aquaporin gene expression were not evident the lack of a clear correlation between sa mediated root hydraulic properties and sa mediated aquaporin gene expression may be due to the fact that some aquaporins genes cannot be regulated by sa because of the lack of sa responsive elements in their promoter region as evidenced by tungngoen et al 2011 for a hevea brasilensis pip aquaporin no information is available currently about the presence or absence of such elements in the promoter regions of the maize aquaporins moreover a delay between hormonal treatment iaa and aquaporin gene expression has been described in arabidopsis péret et al 2012 which may also occur here with sa thus the way through which sa regulates these membrane proteins is uncertain and the two studies mentioned above presented contradictory results about the regulation of aquaporin internalization by the hormone du et al 2013 found that increased sa levels hinder the constitutive recycling of membrane proteins like aquaporins increasing the abundance of some of them in the plasmalemma as a mechanism to control their activity in contrast boursiac et al 2008 described an stimulus induced internalization of pip proteins after sa application meditated by reactive oxygen species ros in any case aquaporin modulation was extensively reported to substantially contribute to total root water flow boursiac et al 2008 knipfer and fricke 2011 martínez ballesta et al 2000 martre et al 2001 vandeleur et al 2014 in our study significant correlation between aquaporin accumulation and lo was found exclusively under drought stress treatment table 2 but not under well watered conditions this supports the idea of ros involvement as they may accumulate under drought conditions leading to relocalization of aquaporins as reported by independent studies boursiac et al 2008 velikanov et al 2015 since plants undergo frequent environmental changes the activity of aquaporins must be regulated by mechanisms that allow rapid responses to these changes aquaporins regulate cell water flow either through changes in their abundance or channel gating tyerman et al 2002 post translational modifications are also necessary to achieve such rapid regulation vandeleur et al 2014 including phosphorylation de phosphorylation of specific serine residues the first post translational regulation mechanism found in aquaporins prado et al 2013 prak et al 2008 this modification generates conformational changes allowing aquaporin gating or modifying its subcellular localization in the membrane johansson et al 1998 prado et al 2013 prak et al 2008 and has been proposed as a mechanism to prevent water loss bárzana et al 2015 phosphorylation of c terminal residues ser 280 and ser 283 of pip2 aquaporins was correlated to the regulation of lpr in plants prado et al 2013 the present data show that pip2 b ser 283 and pip2c ser 280 and ser 283 both negatively correlated with lo under ds as well as pip2 and pip1 protein levels table 2 however when analysing zmpip2 4 root aquaporin abundance one of the most abundant aquaporins in maize roots with prominent role in water transport chaumont et al 2001 it correlated positively with lo under water shortage table 2 this could be contradictory but it must be taken into account that the pip2 antibody recognizes several different isoforms within the pip2 subfamily that may have different roles in water transport regulation zmtip1 1 protein abundance presented the same trend previously described for zmpip2 4 protein and consequently also correlated with lpr table 2 suggesting that these two proteins could be of high interest in regulating water transport in our experimental conditions surprisingly zmpip2 4 transcript levels negatively correlated with lo table 2 however expression levels of aquaporins do not always correlate with their protein abundance as both change along time and with the growing conditions chaumont and tyerman 2014 expression patterns of most analysed aquaporins differed in am and non am plants fig 2 which in general involved their downregulation in am plants as was shown in previous reports bárzana et al 2014 quiroga et al 2017 interestingly it has been highlighted the different behaviour of non am and am plants under drought after sa application whereas non am plants increased the percentage of apoplastic water flow in presence of exogenous sa plants inoculated with the am fungus decreased water circulating through this pathway when the hormone was applied fig 1c this effect can result from the differential effect of this hormone on lpr in plants inoculated with the symbiotic fungus under drought this is consistent with previous results where am plants were suggested to have a higher plasticity for switching between water transport pathways bárzana et al 2012 in addition this differential effect of sa on the apoplastic water flow in am and non am plants may be mediated by altered nitric oxide no content in these plants since it has been recently shown that sa induced no regulates maize water content and hydraulic conductivity under drought shan and wang 2017 moreover sánchez romera et al 2017 have suggested that no favours apoplastic water pathway inside roots and suggested that different outcomes in root hydraulic conductivity observed between am and non am plants could be mediated by differences in no content thus a higher no content in non am plants than in am ones could explain the sa induced enhancement of apoplastic water flow in non am plants and the opposite effect in am plants 4 3 implication of phytohormones in root water transport regulation salicylic acid has been previously shown to alter plant water relations under drought or salt stress conditions faried et al 2017 farooq et al 2010 khan et al 2015 on the light of our results no clear relationship between exogenous sa application and root or sap sa concentration increase was found although in sap an enhancement in such hormone occurred under drought fig 4c g and l however it is noteworthy that as mentioned above sa effects on plant functions are dose dependent khan et al 2015 miura and tada 2014 indeed an important aspect regarding the effect of sa application is the dose of sa and the method of application via foliar or via hydroponic solution generally low concentrations less than 0 5 mm of sa increase drought tolerance while high concentrations 2 3 mm decrease drought tolerance miura and tada 2014 thereby the selected dose in this study 0 02 mm applied via hydroponic solution is enough to affect lpr but may not be sufficient to alter hormonal tissue content nonetheless sa could be modifying lpr through the alteration of other phytohormones in roots as a complex crosstalk among these compounds may take place controlling plant performance under different environmental conditions munné bosch and müller 2013 in fact a consistent response in am plants was the increase of iaa aba and sa in roots under drought conditions compared to non am plants fig 4e f and g in this sense sa has been described to play a role in the regulation of am root colonization although the precise mechanism is not clear yet herrera medina et al 2003 moreover sa was also reported to induce genes involved in aba biosynthesis as well as to modify aba transport to the shoots horváth et al 2015 regarding the functioning of the am symbiosis aba was related to arbuscule formation thus being necessary for efficient am symbiosis establishment and functioning miransari et al 2012 an enhancement of the aba content by the am symbiosis was clearly reflected by our results fig 4f taking together these data and the previously described enhancement of lpr by aba aroca et al 2008 parent et al 2009 we hypothesize that enhanced aba in am inoculated plants may favour the increase in root conductivity under drought conditions this idea is also supported by the higher lpr and lo found in am plants under drought stress fig 1a and b in addition to this iaa is considered to be essential for am infection especially during pre symbiotic interactions hanlon and coenen 2011 and our result showed an important enhancement of root iaa content after amf root colonization especially in sa treated plants this enhanced iaa levels in am sa treated plants may have contributed to the reduction in the hydraulic parameters measured here since péret et al 2012 showed that exogenous iaa application inhibited most aquaporins genes in a thaliana and reduced root hydraulic conductivity both at the cell and whole organ level in relation with am development some authors also found alterations in root ja levels with root colonization liu et al 2013 pedranzani et al 2016 however no changes were found in other studies lópez ráez et al 2010 sánchez romera et al 2016 aba ja and sa were hypothesized to have some common regulatory elements in their signalling pathways although their clear relationship was not established yet proietti et al 2013 sa and ja interaction has normally been reported to be antagonistic in defence response koornneef et al 2008 although from hormonal content we cannot observe any clear relationship between them sap ja levels positively correlated with lo and lpr under drought table 2 and this is in line with previous results of ja on lpr sánchez romera et al 2014 2016 an opposite effect was induced by sa on these parameters which agree with results by volobueva et al 2004 who reported decreased water conductance in maize roots by sa addition and results by boursiac et al 2008 showing down regulation of root water transport by sa in arabidopsis plants thus from our data we could deduce that there is a relationship between these hormones in response to drought which is regulated by am colonization even if further research is needed to explain accurately the way these hormones interact 5 conclusions in the present work we demonstrated that am symbiosis can modify root hydraulic response to drought episodes under these conditions am plants showed both increased lpr and lo this together with the better exploration and exploitation of the soil water resources by the fungal hyphae that has been widely described in literature marulanda et al 2003 allen 2007 2009 ruth et al 2011 may results in greater amount of water available to the am plants and better performance of am plants under water deprivation exogenous sa application altered root hydraulic parameters decreasing lpr and lo under drought while application of its inhibitor aip maintained steady state levels for these parameters sa modulation of water conductivity could be due to a fine regulation of root aquaporins as zmpip2 4 or zmtip1 1 furthermore sa application differently modulated the percentage of water flowing by the apoplastic pathway under the imposed stress decreasing its contribution to total root water flow in am plants and increasing it in non am plants intricate relationship between lpr aquaporins and endogenous levels of phytohormones especially sa aba and ja was observed revealing a complex network controlling water transport in roots future researches should analyse the promoter regions of the maize aquaporin genes to search for hormone responsive elements and to explore more in detail the crosstalk mechanism between these hormones in the regulation of water transport in am roots in order to better understand the mechanism through which the am symbiosis copes with root dehydration and contributes to improved root hydraulic properties under drought conditions acknowledgements this work was financed by

11521,the projected climate scenario for south mediterranean europe predicts lower precipitation and higher temperatures that will negatively affect viticulture in the region the application of moderate deficit irrigation at crucial moments of berry ripening has been found to improve berry quality furthermore grapevine association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf may improve grapevine s ability to cope with abiotic stresses therefore the aims of this research were 1 to characterize the response of three clones of vitis vinifera l cv tempranillo to the combination of different water deficit programs and amf inoculation under elevated temperatures and 2 to determine whether amf inoculation can improve berry antioxidant properties under these conditions the study was carried out on three fruit bearing cuttings clones of cv tempranillo cl 260 cl 1089 and cl 843 inoculated m or not m with amf and subjected to two temperature regimes 24 14 c and 28 18 c day night combined with three irrigation regimes during berry ripening irrigation treatments were i water deficit from fruit set to veraison early deficit ed ii water deficit from veraison to maturity late deficit ld and iii full irrigation fi although each tempranillo clone seemed to have different abilities to respond to elevated temperatures and water supply in general at 24 14 c the ld treatment performed better than ed differences among clones were attenuated at 28 18 c in addition potential benefits of the ld treatment were improved by amf inoculation thus in all clones the loss of anthocyanins at 28 18 c detected in m plants after applying ld did not occur in the m plants moreover amf inoculation increased must antioxidant capacity in cl 843 under these environmental conditions our results suggest that the implementation of measures to promote the association of grapevines with appropriate amf for each variety could contribute to optimize effects of irrigation strategy on berry properties under future warming conditions keywords anthocyanins arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf climate change clonal variability dpph assay deficit irrigation 1 introduction the grapevine is one of the most widely cultivated crops with a total global surface area of 7 5 million ha under vines most harvested grapes are processed into wine leading to a global production of 274 million hectoliters in 2015 with spain being the third largest producer in the world 14 of the total world wine production oiv 2016a however the future climate scenario for south mediterranean europe is not favorable for agriculture in general and for viticulture in particular chaves et al 2010 lionello et al 2014 due to the predicted decreased precipitation increased air and soil temperatures and extreme climate events ipcc 2014 grapevine development has already suffered from significant impact from global climate change teixeira et al 2013 thus a growing body of evidence indicates that as the climate warms grapevine phenology progresses at a faster rate grapes ripen earlier webb et al 2012 berry sugar content and subsequent alcohol in the wine tends to increase petrie and sadras 2008 and phenolic ripeness is not always achieved mori et al 2007 sadras and moran 2012 in addition the tendency toward a decreased acidity of must sweetman et al 2014 has potential effects on wine aging capacity in the mediterranean region the climate may be quite dry during the grapevine growing season and vines may require additional irrigation to counteract water deficit stress chaves et al 2007 2010 currently irrigation of vineyards is below 10 of the total area in europe but the tendency towards irrigation is increasing in order to mitigate the negative impact of climate change costa et al 2016 severe water deficit exacerbates the accelerated accumulation of sugars in grapes caused by warm temperatures bonada et al 2015 which results in an imbalance between the levels of sugars and the phenolic ripening in berries sadras and moran 2012 in contrast several studies santesteban et al 2011 zarrouk et al 2012 niculcea et al 2014 have demonstrated that under moderate water restriction berries from red wine varieties such as tempranillo had increased levels of sugars and anthocyanins for several years moderate deficit irrigation has been applied in order to improve cluster microclimate increase water use efficiency control the vegetative development of grapevines reduce berry size and induce the accumulation of sugars and polyphenols in fruits wample and smithyman 2002 different deficit irrigation programs maintain plants at some degree of water deficit for a prescribed part of the season basile et al 2011 intrigliolo et al 2012 nevertheless high temperatures can constitute a relevant constraint to the implementation and success of the deficit irrigation shellie 2011 and the timing of water deficit might need to be revised to account for the deleterious effects of elevated temperatures in water stressed plants edwards et al 2011 thus it has been reported that alterations in berry primary metabolism such as sugars organic acids and amino acids due to warm temperatures was higher than in secondary metabolism i e anthocyanins and flavonoids which was mainly affected by timing of water deficit throughout ripening torres et al 2017 soil microorganisms can help crops to cope with abiotic stresses grover et al 2011 amongst these microorganisms arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf have received increasing attention due to their numerous benefits for their host plants the symbiotic association of plants with amf is a common phenomenon observed in nearly 80 of plant species including grapevines balestrini et al 2010 for this reason considerable progress has been made in the last decade towards the use of these symbiotic fungi to improve grapevine growth and yield mycorrhizal symbiosis has been associated with improved growth increased tolerance against drought and or enhanced mineral uptake from soils trouvelot et al 2015 moreover mycorrhizal plants can accumulate higher levels of phenolic compounds in their tissues than non mycorrhizal plants and this phenomenon is more evident when plants undergo water deficit rather than optimal irrigation baslam and goicoechea 2012 in grapevines mycorrhizal colonization enhances water use efficiency under drought valentine et al 2006 and induces the accumulation of phenolics in leaves eftekhari et al 2012 torres et al 2015 and berries torres et al 2016 under optimal irrigation with these latter results being highly dependent on intravarietal differences of grapevines and air temperatures throughout grapevine cultivation the phenolic compounds detected in grapes have generated remarkable interest because they have antioxidant properties that are beneficial for human health georgiev et al 2014 currently deficit irrigation in viticulture can be managed in order to increase the concentrations of phenolics in berries with attain the final objective of enhancing must quality and its nutraceutical properties however to our knowledge no studies have assessed the contribution of amf for improving or maintaining the benefits that different deficit irrigation programs can exert on berry quality in a future scenario of climate change in our previous studies we showed that the effects of warm temperatures on berry composition of tempranillo depended on the deficit irrigation system applied and on the clone chosen torres et al 2017 moreover under warm temperatures the benefits of amf inoculation on berry properties were also modulated by type of clone torres et al 2016 taking into account all these precedents the aims of the current research were 1 to characterize the response of three clones of vitis vinifera l cv tempranillo to the combination of different water deficit programs pre and post veraison deficit irrigation and amf inoculation under elevated day night temperatures and 2 to determine whether amf inoculation can improve berry antioxidant properties under different climatic scenarios previous research antolín et al 2010 morales et al 2016 has demonstrated that fruit bearing cuttings are a meaningful and useful model system to study the response of berry ripening to environmental factors thus potted vines were used to ensure that all clones experienced the same conditions and to control mycorrhizal inoculation and to have comparable non inoculated plants 2 material and methods 2 1 biological material and growth conditions dormant 400 500mm long vitis vinifera l cuttings from different clones of tempranillo were collected during the winter of 2014 from an experimental vineyard of the institute of sciences of vine and wine logroño spain denomination of origin rioja north of spain three clones cl 260 cl 1089 and cl 843 were selected in the field on the basis on their different agronomic traits table s1 and on the basis of our previous finding which showed that phenolic content and antioxidant activity were stimulated by the combination of elevated temperature and amf inoculation torres et al 2015 2016 cuttings of each clone were selected for fruit bearing according to the steps originally outlined by mullins 1966 with some modifications as described in ollat et al 1998 and antolín et al 2010 briefly rooting was made in a heat bed 27 c kept in a cool room 4 c one month later the cuttings were planted in 6 5 l plastic pots containing a mixture of vermiculite sand light peat 2 5 2 5 1 v v v properties of the

transplanting half of the plants were inoculated with the mycorrhizal inoculum glomygel vid olivo frutales mycovitro s l pinos puente spain m plants the concentrated commercial inoculum was derived from an in vitro culture of amf rhizophagus intraradices schenck smith walker schüßler comb nov krüger et al 2012 that contained 2000 mycorrhizal propagules inert pieces of roots colonized by amf spores and vegetative mycelium per ml inoculum the selection of in vitro produced inoculum of r intraradices was based on two expected benefits easy application of the product and low colonization of grape roots by contaminant fungi vimard et al 1999 in order to facilitate its application the concentrated commercial inoculum was diluted with distilled water to a mycorrhizal inoculum of 250 propagules ml 1 each m plant received 8ml diluted mycorrhizal inoculum close to the roots thus making 2000 propagules in total in order to compensate for a possible partial disinfection of mycorrhizal spores during the production of high quantities of the commercial inoculum a filtrate was added to plants that did not receive any inoculum m plants with the objective of restoring the helper microorganisms accompanying spores and hyphae of amf and which play an important role in the uptake of soil resources as well as on the infectivity and efficiency of amf isolates agnolucci et al 2015 the filtrate was obtained by passing diluted mycorrhizal inoculum through a layer of 15 20 mm filter paper with particle retention of 2 5mm whatman 42 ge healthcare little chalfont uk and each m plant

lincoln usa under these conditions bud break took place after one week careful control of vegetative growth before flowering improves the partitioning of stored carbon towards the roots and the reproductive structures thus only a single flowering stem was allowed to develop on each plant during growth until fruit set plants were watered twice per day with a nutrient solution 140mlday 1 with phosphorus level 0 30mm ollat et al 1998 alternated with water to maintain the soil water content at 80 of pot capacity the electric conductivity of the nutrient solution adjusted to ph 5 5 was 1 46 0

during the growing season the 28 18 c temperature regime was selected according to predictions of a rise of 4 0 c at the end of the present century ipcc 2014 both temperature regimes were maintained

allowed to pass through the holes in the bottom of the pot the surface of the plant containers was covered with quartz stones during the experiments to avoid water loss because of evaporation water volume supplied to the fi treatment was adjusted to increase plant development according to the daily measurements of the ec 5 water sensor fig s2 watering was performed with nutrient solution or deionised water in order to supply the different treatments with the same amount of nutrients during water deficit there were three replicates for each combination of mycorrhizal temperature irrigation treatment and clone 2 3 mycorrhizal colonization and relative mycorrhizal dependency rmd root samples were cleared and stained koske and gemma 1989 and amf colonization was determined by examining 1 cm root segments 45 per pot under the microscope then parameters of amf colonization were calculated for each pot as described previously torres et al 2015 the relative mycorrhizal dependency rmd index was estimated as reported by bagyaraj 1994 rmd bunch fresh matter of m plant 100 bunch fresh matter of m plant determination of rmd allows assessment of the dependency of a crop on the mycorrhizal condition to achieve its maximum growth or yield at a given level of soil fertility when yield in m plants is very similar to that achieved in m plants the value of rmd is equal to 100 values beyond 100 indicate that mycorrhizal symbiosis has improved plant yield rmd values lower than 100 indicate that mycorrhizal association has reduced yield 2 4 plant determinations predawn

tartaric acid once maceration was over the macerated samples were centrifuged at 4300g at 4 c for 10min anthocyanin content was determined in the supernatant by measuring absorbance at 520nm ribéreau gayon and stonestreet 1965 total polyphenol index tpi was calculated by the absorbance reading at 280nm in the supernatant obtained after maceration at ph 3 2 eec 1990 all analyses were run in triplicate 2 6 antioxidant capacity total antioxidant capacity was evaluated on the same must samples used for berry quality determinations by using the free radical scavenging activity α α diphenyl β picrylhydrazyl dpph assay brand williams et al 1995 the free radical scavenging activity using the free radical dpph was evaluated by measuring the variation in absorbance at 515nm after 30min of reaction in parafilm sealed glass cuvettes to avoid methanol evaporation at 25 c the reaction was started by adding 20μl of the corresponding sample to the cuvette containing 80mm methanol solution 980μl of the free radical dpph the final volume of the assay was 1ml the reaction was followed with a spectrophotometer jasco v 630 analytical instruments easton md usa the calibration curve was made using gallic acid as a standard 2 7 statistical analysis statistical analyses were carried out using statistical software the statistical package for the social sciences spss spss inc chicago il usa

differences in all measured parameters berry quality parameters and antioxidant activity data were analyzed by principal component analysis pca with the same software to determine general trends in the different samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 mycorrhizal colonization and relative mycorrhizal dependency rmd under moderate temperatures and optimal irrigation 100 of plants from cl 260 and cl 1089 had mycorrhizal structures mainly hyphae and vesicles fig 1 but percentages of root mycorrhizal colonization did not exceed 10 in fi plants from cl 843 grown at moderate temperatures the percentage of root colonization reached 15 but only 35 of plants showed mycorrhizal structures imposition of drought ed or ld and or elevated temperatures 28 18 c negatively affected mycorrhizal symbiosis in the three clones of tempranillo these low percentages of mycorrhizal colonization achieved at the final stage of fruit ripening could be due to several causes 1 disinfection of the amf spores during the production of in vitro mycorrhizal inoculum may have eliminated or at least reduced the bacteria associated with the fungus thus harming both the survival and the well timed germination and growth of spores and hyphae included in the applied inoculum roesti et al 2005 agnolucci et al 2015 2 low photosynthetic rates measured at fruit ripening data not shown could not allow the production of sufficient carbohydrates to support the mycorrhizal symbiosis and or 3 several sinks such as fruits and mycorrhizal fungus in roots would be competing for the scarce synthetized photoassimilates during this period of the grapevine life cycle in our study no clear effect of the irrigation regimes and or air temperatures on the percentage of mycorrhizal colonization was observed however several studies have revealed that climate change can affect indirectly through changes in host plant growth and physiology and directly the fungal development and the rates of root colonization by amf compant et al 2010 although fungal responses to environmental factors can be strain dependent in most cases increased soil temperature favors the mycorrhizal colonization of roots and the spread of hyphal networks while drought reduces amf colonization the future scenarios of climate change however predict that increased temperature will increase soil drying which subsequently will reduce the length of the growing season for mycorrhizal fungal hyphae allen et al 2014 on the other hand it is important to note that percentages of mycorrhizal colonization provides information about the root length colonized by amf but does not indicate the functionality of the symbiosis and thus its benefits for the host plant a low correlation between the root length colonized by the fungus and the mycorrhizal responsiveness of the host plant means that genetic factors other than those allowing colonization are determining the responsiveness of the host plant to the percent of its root colonized by the mycorrhizal fungus parke and kaeppler 2000 calculation of rmd allowed the assessment of the degree to which the studied tempranillo clones were dependent on the mycorrhizal conditions to produce their maximum yield results were highly dependent on the tempranillo clone and environmental conditions fig 2 in cl 260 mycorrhizal inoculation always decreased fruit yield rmd values lower than 100 which may be as a consequence of a sink effect caused by the presence of the fungus in roots that would have increased the translocation of sugars from the aerial part to the roots in detriment to fruit development the lower yield of m24 fi plants from cl 260 in comparison with that of m24 fi was accentuated by the ed treatment but attenuated when ed was imposed under elevated temperatures 28ed pischl and barber 2016 also found that non mycorrhizal bell peppers grown at optimal irrigation and ambient temperatures produced more fruits than mycorrhizal plants according to these authors under non stressed conditions the amf treatments incurred a cost that resulted in reduced growth and fitness relative to uncolonized plants in agreement with our results pischl and barber 2016 also observed that warm temperatures and drought reduced differences between treatments in contrast with findings in cl 260 mycorrhizal association improved yield in plants from cl 1089 grown at 24 14 c except for those undergoing ld fig 2 the highest benefit of amf inoculation on yield was observed when ed was applied in this case rmd values almost reached 200 in cl 843 at 24 14 c mycorrhizal inoculation enhanced yield in drought stressed plants 24ed and 24ld however at 28 18 c rmd only was significantly improved under full irrigation 28fi arbuscular mycorrhizal dependency can strongly vary not only among different plant species tawaraya 2003 but also among cultivars belonging to the same plant species tawaraya 2003 fahey et al 2016 which has also been assessed between different grape varieties eftekhari et al 2012 torres et al 2015 2016 root morphology root length length and frequency of the root hairs seems to be the main factor for determining the mycorrhizal dependency of a given plant species or cultivar because it strongly affects the efficiency of the host plant to acquire resources from the soil tawaraya 2003 any environmental factor that may alter the root morphology of host plants could also modify their mycorrhizal dependency in our study despite the interclonal differences between cl 1089 and cl 843 in general terms mycorrhizal inoculation improved yield in plants undergoing adverse conditions drought elevated temperatures or both which reinforces the idea that mycorrhizal symbiosis may be more beneficial for host plants under stressful conditions goicoechea et al 2004 and supports the results indicating that amf can improve the drought heat tolerance of vines schreiner and linderman 2005 valentine et al 2006 schreiner et al 2007 3 2 phenology and physiological characteristics during berry ripening clones of grapevine cv tempranillo tested in this study have significant diversity for some agronomic traits such as length of cycle yield bunch mass and berry mass table s1 with regard to phenology vineyard grown plants of cl 260 and cl 1089 were characterized by a shorter reproductive cycle than cl 843 in our experimental conditions temperature was the main factor influencing time to reach veraison that was shortened by increasing temperature to 28 18 c table s2 such observations show a consistent trend towards earlier veraison commonly observed at warm temperatures petrie and sadras 2008 webb et al 2012 torres et al 2016 however in cl 843 at 24 14 c the ed treatment also contributed to reduce time to reach veraison as showed by significant interaction between both factors t i p 0 05 in the same way several studies provided support for acceleration of the ripening process due to ed water restriction that was shown by the accelerated onset of anthocyanin synthesis castellarin et al 2007 herrera and castellarin 2016 the hormone abscisic acid aba plays a critical role in regulating berry ripening because berry aba concentration increases remarkably at veraison and stimulates anthocyanin synthesis by promoting expression of key biosynthetic genes fortes et al 2015 under water deficit it has been reported that aba pattern accumulation was altered and at veraison peak of aba was significantly higher in ed than fi niculcea et al 2014 possibly such changes could have contributed to reducing time to reach veraison in the ed treatment on the other hand temperature and irrigation were the main factors affecting the time course from veraison to maturity in cl 260 and cl 843 in cl 1089 there was also an additive effect of amf inoculation as indicated by the interaction between temperature amf inoculation and irrigation t m i p 0 05 grapevine water status throughout fruit ripening was significantly different per treatments as indicated by the decrease in predawn ψpd measured in plants subjected ed or ld compared with fi plants fig 3 during the ed treatment ψpd values reached in cl 260 cl 1089 and cl 843 varied between 1 2 and 1 5mpa and were not modified by amf inoculation and or elevated temperature in contrast in the ld treatment amf inoculation and elevated temperature modified plant water status moreover significant interactions among factors were observed at stages el 37 and el 38 in cl 260 t i and m i p 0 001 cl 1089 t m and t i p 0 05 and cl 843 t i p 0 01 m i p 0 05 and t m i p 0 01 thus the lowest values of ψpd were always recorded in the m28 treatment and were reached at stage e l37 ca 1 4mpa in cl 260 and at stage el 38 ca 1 7mpa in cl 1089 and cl 843 fig 3 similarly edwards et al 2011 showed an additive effect of temperature and water stress on plant water status which in our study seemed to be more accentuated in m plants this low ψpd in m28 treatment could be result from elevated water losses due to high leaf area and or high transpiration rates however this was not the case because leaf area was considerably smaller in m28 than in m24 plants 0 80 0 90m2 plant 1 in m24 and 0 25 0 40m2 plant 1 in m28 furthermore m28 plants had the lowest leaf conductance rates data not shown in disagreement with our results nikolaou et al 2003 measured higher ψpd in leaves of mycorrhizal cabernet sauvignon than in those of non mycorrhizal plants under drought conditions and the improved water relations in mycorrhizal grapevines were attributed to their higher cytokinin concentrations however the exposure of plants to high temperatures can cause reductions in the levels of cytokinins todorova et al 2005 yang et al 2016 which may explain the low ψpd measured in the m28 treatment in addition it should be noted that although decreases in the tissue ψpd depend mostly upon leaf dehydration it also depend both on initial osmolarity of the cell sap and on cell wall elasticity previous studies of our group showed that ψpd of mycorrhizal plants involved an increase in the percentage of apoplastic water without a decrease in osmotic ψ goicoechea et al 1997 this mechanism may allow mycorrhizal plants to tolerate drought without investing solutes into osmotic adjustment which may be of special importance when the production of carbohydrates to support several sinks fruits and mycorrhizal fungus is limited especially at the end of berry ripening in m28 plants 3 3 berry characteristics berry size was mainly modulated by both amf inoculation and irrigation in cl 260 and cl 1089 table 1 moreover a significant interaction between irrigation and temperature was highlighted for these clones t i p 0 01 and p 0 05 respectively showing that the ld treatment resulted in small berries when plants grew at 28 18 c our findings are in contrast with those presented by bonada et al 2015 which showed additive effects i e lack of interaction between temperature and water for berry mass in our study ed was the treatment that most reduced berry mass regardless of temperature and clone which agrees with previous studies in tempranillo girona et al 2009 santesteban et al 2011 intrigliolo et al 2012 niculcea et al 2014 torres et al 2017 on the other hand relative skin mass in cl 260 and cl 843 was affected by the three factors applied t m i p 0 001 for cl 260 and p 0 01 for cl 843 table 1 in these clones amf inoculation and or elevated temperature accentuated the ability of the ed treatment to increase relative skin mass table s3 which could be due to a reduction in berry flesh mass roby and matthews 2004 bonada et al 2015 in cl 1089 temperature had no effect on relative skin mass with this parameter being mainly modulated by amf inoculation p 0 05 and irrigation p 0 001 the increase of relative skin mass could be an interesting response under climate change conditions because flavour and colour compounds which determine wine quality are located principally in the berry skin on that basis at 28 18 c berries from 28ed cl 260 and cl 843 and m28 cl 843 treatments will be subject to less dilution of skin compounds during winemaking table 1 3 4 berry quality some studies have observed great phenotypic plasticity in berry composition between grapevine varieties in response to warm temperatures sadras et al 2013 barnuud et al 2014 and to water deficit irrigation basile et al 2011 niculcea et al 2014 our previous research provided evidence for clonal diversity within tempranillo that resulted in different abilities to respond to amf inoculation torres et al 2016 or to the irrigation schedule applied torres et al 2017 under elevated temperatures data from the current study showed that interaction between three factors temperature irrigation and amf inoculation modulated fruit composition to a different extent in each clone zarrouk et al 2016 demonstrated that the interaction between irrigation regime and high temperature controls berry ripening in tempranillo similarly in cl 260 temperature and irrigation were the main factors modulating berry quality parameters table 2 at 28 18 c total soluble solids were increased in the water deficit treatments t i p 0 001 which was explained by the fact that faster accumulation of sugars at warm temperatures may be intensified under water deficit conditions bonada et al 2015 the ed treatment caused the most significant changes in must ph and titratable acidity whereas malic acid was affected by all treatments and growth conditions this pattern was underlined by a significant interaction among factors t m i p 0 01 one of the clearest relationships between temperature and fruit quality occurs with grape berry acidity whereby high temperatures reduce the concentration and or increase the breakdown of malic acid our data coincide previous studies that showed that warm temperatures produced malate losses in shiraz sweetman et al 2014 cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay barnuud et al 2014 this has been related to an increased nad dependent malic enzyme activity and decreased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate kinase activities sweetman et al 2014 furthermore total polyphenol index tpi and anthocyanin content of cl 260 were also significantly modulated by all factors table 2 thus tpi tended to be low in response to elevated temperatures amf inoculation or ed irrigation and total anthocyanins decreased in plants grown at 28 18 c the decline of anthocyanins under water stress and elevated temperature likely results from the repression of anthocyanin biosynthesis at the onset of ripening and by a high degradation rate at later stages of berry ripening bonada et al 2015 zarrouk et al 2016 however this effect was clearly mitigated in m28 ld plants which achieved higher anthocyanins than m28 ld plants table s4 this finding indicates that the beneficial effects produced by amf inoculation on berry phenolic content under warming conditions torres et al 2016 was higher under ld in comparison to ed obtaining wines with improved nutritional and nutraceutical value gabriele et al 2016 similarly baslam and goicoechea 2012 reported that amf colonization improved the accumulation of anthocyanins in leaves of lettuce especially under water deficit conditions which may be due to ability of amf to stimulate the expression of key genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway bruisson et al 2016 in cl 1089 total soluble solids must ph and malic acid were modulated by the three factors and or their interactions but titratable acidity was only affected by elevated temperatures table 3 at 24 14 c total soluble solids were reduced by the ed treatment but such differences disappeared at 28 18 c t i p 0 01 malic acid decreased in response to elevated temperatures and amf inoculation under ed and ld which underlines the interactive effects of all factors on berry quality t m i p 0 05 bonada et al 2015 furthermore tpi was significantly modified by the combination of different factors t m p 0 01 t i p 0 05 and m i p 0 01 table 3 in general tpi diminished in response to amf inoculation or ed irrigation but interestingly the deleterious effect of the m ed treatment did not appear in m ed plants furthermore total anthocyanin content was significantly modulated by the interaction between all factors t m i p 0 05 at 24 14 c amf inoculation and or the ed treatment reduced the content of anthocyanins in berries however such differences were alleviated at warm temperatures table 3 which is in agreement with our previous observations showing that cl 1089 was quite tolerant of elevated temperatures torres et al 2016 interestingly although in the study of torres et al 2016 amf colonization deteriorated some aspects of berry quality of cl 1089 the current study shows that the irrigation schedule may modify this pattern thus the loss of anthocyanins detected in m28 ld plants in comparison with m24 ld plants did not occur in m ld plants when cultivated at 28 18 c instead of 24 14 c this observation highlights the potential benefit of amf inoculation on phenolic content maintenance under ld conditions applied to cl 1089 table s5 in cl 843 the berry quality parameters were significantly modified by warm temperatures and ed irrigation as indicated by increased concentration of total soluble sugars must ph and decreased titratable acidity t i p 0 001 p 0 01 and p 0 01 respectively table 4 in contrast to other clones the content of malic acid was modulated by mycorrhization and irrigation but not by temperature which highlights a clonal diversity within the tempranillo variety in malate metabolism under warm temperatures similarly sadras et al 2013 observed great phenotypic plasticity in the responsiveness for some traits such as titratable acidity and must ph furthermore all factors contributed to changes in tpi and anthocyanins as highlighted by the interaction between them t m i p 0 01 for tpi and p 0 001 for anthocyanins regarding tpi data showed that the m28 ld treatment performed better than the m28 ed treatment table s6 with regard to anthocyanins accumulated in berries of plants grown at 24 14 c both water restriction regimes ed and ld resulted in decreased anthocyanin contents in comparison with levels found in fi plants m24 fi or m24 fi this effect being more pronounced in m than in m plants table s6 in general anthocyanin content was reduced under elevated temperatures but the impact was also lower in m than in m plants in fact in cl 843 the loss of anthocyanins detected in m28 ld plants was not found in m28 ld plants in comparison with m24 ld and m24ld respectively this finding supports the notion that benefits of amf under elevated temperature on berry composition torres et al 2016 could be accentuated in combination with water deficit 3 5 antioxidant capacity fig 4 shows the results obtained from the dpph assay performed in must in order to test its total antioxidant capacity in cl 260 and cl 1089 all factors accounted for modifying total antioxidant capacity of berry extracts t m i p 0 05 in cl 260 there were small changes in total antioxidant capacity and only m28 fi plants exhibited a significant reduction in this parameter under warm temperatures however in cl 1089 amf inoculation exerted a positive effect on antioxidant capacity which was especially accentuated in m28 fi and m28 ed treatments in cl 843 total antioxidant capacity was modulated by the interaction between temperature and mycorrhization t m p 0 001 our data also revealed that elevated temperatures reduced total antioxidant capacity in m28 plants but it was clearly improved in m28 plants regardless irrigation regime applied fig 4 these findings suggest that in this clone the combination of amf inoculation and elevated temperatures exerted an additive effect in improving antioxidant power maya and matsubara 2013 torres et al 2016 3 6 principal component analysis fig 5 a shows the score plot obtained by pca where samples of each clone are grouped in the plot of the first and second principal components pc1 versus pc2 here pc1 accounted for about 27 66 of the total variance while pc2 covered 20 30 different tempranillo clones and amf inoculated or uninoculated plants could not be clearly distinguished fig 5a however a clear distinction between plants subjected to different irrigation treatments was shown across pc1 on the other hand temperature treatments were separated along pc2 these findings reveal that in our experimental model abiotic factors air temperature and water regime were more determinant than biotic factors tempranillo clones and mycorrhization for berry quality however the selection of a given clone of tempranillo and or the application of the mycorrhizal inoculum under specific environmental conditions modulated some concrete aspects related to characteristics table 1 and quality fig 4 tables 2 4 of berries which was demonstrated by the significant interactions between the main factors reflected in the results of anova the loading plot fig 5b highlighted the importance of ψpd e l35 tpi anthocyanin ph and acidity levels in explaining variance across pc1 separation between temperature treatments was related to ψpd at the final stages of berry ripening e l37 and e l38 the days between veraison to berry maturity and total soluble solids this analysis also showed that ld and fi appeared together under both temperature conditions reinforcing the idea that ld irrigation could continue being valid under a projected warming scenario in order to maintain berry quality and antioxidant properties with the aim to understand the different performance of biotic factors clones and mycorrhization in each temperature two more pca were conducted fig 6 fig 6a and b show the score and the loading plots generated at 24 14 c while fig 6c and d correspond to 28 18 c conditions at 24 14 c irrigation treatments were separated along pc1 which explained the 33 36 of the variance whereas pc2 covered 15 95 separation was due to the content of total anthocyanins tpi titratable acidity ψpd e l34 ph and the number of days between veraison and maturity results highlight the similarities between ld and fi at 24 14 c in the quality parameters and phenology data but clones and mycorrhizal treatments were not clearly distinguished fig 6a on the other hand the two first principal components from data of warming conditions covered 27 39 and 14 95 of the total variance respectively ed was distinguished from fi and ld due to pc1 according to their ψpd e l34 ψpd e l35 total anthocyanins titratable acidity and days from veraison to maturity however pc2 allowed establishing a difference between fi and ld treatments fig 6c in relation with ψpd e l37 ψpd e l38 and the brix fig 6d this result is not surprising due to the treatments were similar till berries reached e l37 and this period matched with the sugar accumulation period which has been recently shown to be faster under water deficit and warming bonada et al 2015 additionally the pc2 conducted at 28 18 c showed a slightly separation between m and m within each irrigation treatment fi and ld fig 6d suggesting that the effect of amf is more pronounced at 28 18 c under elevated air temperature and ld irrigation the association of tempranillo grapevine with the mycorrhizal fungus r intraradices favoured the antioxidant capacity of berries fig 4 in cl 843 and induced the accumulation of anthocyanins in berries of cl 260 table s4 and cl 843 table s6 because tempranillo clones responded differently to the inoculation with r intraradices and responses varied according to the environmental conditions we completely agree with sinclair et al 2014 when they concluded that it may be profitable to identify the amf inoculants most suitable for a given cultivar in a given environment 4 conclusions in a scenario of climate change effective water management should accomplish the dual purpose of reducing water supply at certain phenological stages to improve grape quality traits while ensuring plant water status to counteract the deleterious effects of elevated temperature in water stressed plants the findings in this study indicate that amf inoculation may alleviate the negative effects of water restriction and warming conditions in some clones of tempranillo grapevines in general post veraison ld water deficit performed better than pre veraison ed water deficit but such differences were attenuated at elevated temperatures furthermore at 28 18 c the potential benefits of ld can be improved by amf inoculation because the loss of anthocyanins detected in the non mycorrhizal plants did not occur when plants were inoculated with amf this benefit however was dependent on tempranillo intravarietal differences our results suggest that the implementation of measures to promote the association of grapevines with amf could contribute to optimize effects of irrigation strategy on berry properties under future warming conditions this research also offers the first evidence that the combined effect of water and temperature stress varied depending on amf inoculation and the clone studied future assays with different mycorrhizal inoculants may help to select the most adequate fungal species for benefiting yield and or berry quality of each clone of tempranillo cultivated under predicted warming scenarios acknowledgements this

11521,the projected climate scenario for south mediterranean europe predicts lower precipitation and higher temperatures that will negatively affect viticulture in the region the application of moderate deficit irrigation at crucial moments of berry ripening has been found to improve berry quality furthermore grapevine association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf may improve grapevine s ability to cope with abiotic stresses therefore the aims of this research were 1 to characterize the response of three clones of vitis vinifera l cv tempranillo to the combination of different water deficit programs and amf inoculation under elevated temperatures and 2 to determine whether amf inoculation can improve berry antioxidant properties under these conditions the study was carried out on three fruit bearing cuttings clones of cv tempranillo cl 260 cl 1089 and cl 843 inoculated m or not m with amf and subjected to two temperature regimes 24 14 c and 28 18 c day night combined with three irrigation regimes during berry ripening irrigation treatments were i water deficit from fruit set to veraison early deficit ed ii water deficit from veraison to maturity late deficit ld and iii full irrigation fi although each tempranillo clone seemed to have different abilities to respond to elevated temperatures and water supply in general at 24 14 c the ld treatment performed better than ed differences among clones were attenuated at 28 18 c in addition potential benefits of the ld treatment were improved by amf inoculation thus in all clones the loss of anthocyanins at 28 18 c detected in m plants after applying ld did not occur in the m plants moreover amf inoculation increased must antioxidant capacity in cl 843 under these environmental conditions our results suggest that the implementation of measures to promote the association of grapevines with appropriate amf for each variety could contribute to optimize effects of irrigation strategy on berry properties under future warming conditions keywords anthocyanins arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf climate change clonal variability dpph assay deficit irrigation 1 introduction the grapevine is one of the most widely cultivated crops with a total global surface area of 7 5 million ha under vines most harvested grapes are processed into wine leading to a global production of 274 million hectoliters in 2015 with spain being the third largest producer in the world 14 of the total world wine production oiv 2016a however the future climate scenario for south mediterranean europe is not favorable for agriculture in general and for viticulture in particular chaves et al 2010 lionello et al 2014 due to the predicted decreased precipitation increased air and soil temperatures and extreme climate events ipcc 2014 grapevine development has already suffered from significant impact from global climate change teixeira et al 2013 thus a growing body of evidence indicates that as the climate warms grapevine phenology progresses at a faster rate grapes ripen earlier webb et al 2012 berry sugar content and subsequent alcohol in the wine tends to increase petrie and sadras 2008 and phenolic ripeness is not always achieved mori et al 2007 sadras and moran 2012 in addition the tendency toward a decreased acidity of must sweetman et al 2014 has potential effects on wine aging capacity in the mediterranean region the climate may be quite dry during the grapevine growing season and vines may require additional irrigation to counteract water deficit stress chaves et al 2007 2010 currently irrigation of vineyards is below 10 of the total area in europe but the tendency towards irrigation is increasing in order to mitigate the negative impact of climate change costa et al 2016 severe water deficit exacerbates the accelerated accumulation of sugars in grapes caused by warm temperatures bonada et al 2015 which results in an imbalance between the levels of sugars and the phenolic ripening in berries sadras and moran 2012 in contrast several studies santesteban et al 2011 zarrouk et al 2012 niculcea et al 2014 have demonstrated that under moderate water restriction berries from red wine varieties such as tempranillo had increased levels of sugars and anthocyanins for several years moderate deficit irrigation has been applied in order to improve cluster microclimate increase water use efficiency control the vegetative development of grapevines reduce berry size and induce the accumulation of sugars and polyphenols in fruits wample and smithyman 2002 different deficit irrigation programs maintain plants at some degree of water deficit for a prescribed part of the season basile et al 2011 intrigliolo et al 2012 nevertheless high temperatures can constitute a relevant constraint to the implementation and success of the deficit irrigation shellie 2011 and the timing of water deficit might need to be revised to account for the deleterious effects of elevated temperatures in water stressed plants edwards et al 2011 thus it has been reported that alterations in berry primary metabolism such as sugars organic acids and amino acids due to warm temperatures was higher than in secondary metabolism i e anthocyanins and flavonoids which was mainly affected by timing of water deficit throughout ripening torres et al 2017 soil microorganisms can help crops to cope with abiotic stresses grover et al 2011 amongst these microorganisms arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf have received increasing attention due to their numerous benefits for their host plants the symbiotic association of plants with amf is a common phenomenon observed in nearly 80 of plant species including grapevines balestrini et al 2010 for this reason considerable progress has been made in the last decade towards the use of these symbiotic fungi to improve grapevine growth and yield mycorrhizal symbiosis has been associated with improved growth increased tolerance against drought and or enhanced mineral uptake from soils trouvelot et al 2015 moreover mycorrhizal plants can accumulate higher levels of phenolic compounds in their tissues than non mycorrhizal plants and this phenomenon is more evident when plants undergo water deficit rather than optimal irrigation baslam and goicoechea 2012 in grapevines mycorrhizal colonization enhances water use efficiency under drought valentine et al 2006 and induces the accumulation of phenolics in leaves eftekhari et al 2012 torres et al 2015 and berries torres et al 2016 under optimal irrigation with these latter results being highly dependent on intravarietal differences of grapevines and air temperatures throughout grapevine cultivation the phenolic compounds detected in grapes have generated remarkable interest because they have antioxidant properties that are beneficial for human health georgiev et al 2014 currently deficit irrigation in viticulture can be managed in order to increase the concentrations of phenolics in berries with attain the final objective of enhancing must quality and its nutraceutical properties however to our knowledge no studies have assessed the contribution of amf for improving or maintaining the benefits that different deficit irrigation programs can exert on berry quality in a future scenario of climate change in our previous studies we showed that the effects of warm temperatures on berry composition of tempranillo depended on the deficit irrigation system applied and on the clone chosen torres et al 2017 moreover under warm temperatures the benefits of amf inoculation on berry properties were also modulated by type of clone torres et al 2016 taking into account all these precedents the aims of the current research were 1 to characterize the response of three clones of vitis vinifera l cv tempranillo to the combination of different water deficit programs pre and post veraison deficit irrigation and amf inoculation under elevated day night temperatures and 2 to determine whether amf inoculation can improve berry antioxidant properties under different climatic scenarios previous research antolín et al 2010 morales et al 2016 has demonstrated that fruit bearing cuttings are a meaningful and useful model system to study the response of berry ripening to environmental factors thus potted vines were used to ensure that all clones experienced the same conditions and to control mycorrhizal inoculation and to have comparable non inoculated plants 2 material and methods 2 1 biological material and growth conditions dormant 400 500mm long vitis vinifera l cuttings from different clones of tempranillo were collected during the winter of 2014 from an experimental vineyard of the institute of sciences of vine and wine logroño spain denomination of origin rioja north of spain three clones cl 260 cl 1089 and cl 843 were selected in the field on the basis on their different agronomic traits table s1 and on the basis of our previous finding which showed that phenolic content and antioxidant activity were stimulated by the combination of elevated temperature and amf inoculation torres et al 2015 2016 cuttings of each clone were selected for fruit bearing according to the steps originally outlined by mullins 1966 with some modifications as described in ollat et al 1998 and antolín et al 2010 briefly rooting was made in a heat bed 27 c kept in a cool room 4 c one month later the cuttings were planted in 6 5 l plastic pots containing a mixture of vermiculite sand light peat 2 5 2 5 1 v v v properties of the peat floragard vilassar de mar barcelona spain were ph 5 2 6 0 nitrogen 70 150mgl 1 p2o5 80 180mgl 1 and k2o 140 220mgl 1 the peat was previously sterilised at 100 c for 1h on 3 consecutive days at transplanting half of the plants were inoculated with the mycorrhizal inoculum glomygel vid olivo frutales mycovitro s l pinos puente spain m plants the concentrated commercial inoculum was derived from an in vitro culture of amf rhizophagus intraradices schenck smith walker schüßler comb nov krüger et al 2012 that contained 2000 mycorrhizal propagules inert pieces of roots colonized by amf spores and vegetative mycelium per ml inoculum the selection of in vitro produced inoculum of r intraradices was based on two expected benefits easy application of the product and low colonization of grape roots by contaminant fungi vimard et al 1999 in order to facilitate its application the concentrated commercial inoculum was diluted with distilled water to a mycorrhizal inoculum of 250 propagules ml 1 each m plant received 8ml diluted mycorrhizal inoculum close to the roots thus making 2000 propagules in total in order to compensate for a possible partial disinfection of mycorrhizal spores during the production of high quantities of the commercial inoculum a filtrate was added to plants that did not receive any inoculum m plants with the objective of restoring the helper microorganisms accompanying spores and hyphae of amf and which play an important role in the uptake of soil resources as well as on the infectivity and efficiency of amf isolates agnolucci et al 2015 the filtrate was obtained by passing diluted mycorrhizal inoculum through a layer of 15 20 mm filter paper with particle retention of 2 5mm whatman 42 ge healthcare little chalfont uk and each m plant received 8ml filtrate close to the roots after transplanting the fruit bearing cuttings were transferred to greenhouses which were adapted to simulate climate change conditions see details in morales

lincoln usa under these conditions bud break took place after one week careful control of vegetative growth before flowering improves the partitioning of stored carbon towards the roots and the reproductive structures thus only a single flowering stem was allowed to develop on each plant during growth until fruit set plants were watered twice per day with a nutrient solution 140mlday 1 with phosphorus level 0 30mm ollat et al 1998 alternated with water to maintain the soil water content at 80 of pot capacity the electric conductivity of the nutrient solution adjusted to ph 5 5 was 1 46 0

month after bud break we established a three factorial design where two temperature regimes were combined with three water regimes that were applied to plants inoculated m or non inoculated m with amf at fruit set eichhorn and lorenz e l growth stage 27 coombe 1995 fruit bearing cuttings from m or m treatments 36 plants per clone were exposed to two different temperature regimes 24 14 c day night

during the growing season the 28 18 c temperature regime was selected according to predictions of a rise of 4 0 c at the end of the present century ipcc 2014 both temperature regimes were maintained

volume supplied to the fi treatment was adjusted to increase plant development according to the daily measurements of the ec 5 water sensor fig s2 watering was performed with nutrient solution or

on the mycorrhizal condition to achieve its maximum growth or yield at a given level of soil fertility when yield in m plants is very similar to that achieved in m plants the value of rmd is equal to 100 values beyond 100 indicate that mycorrhizal symbiosis has improved plant yield rmd values lower than 100 indicate that mycorrhizal association has reduced yield 2 4 plant determinations predawn

triplicate 2 6 antioxidant capacity total antioxidant capacity was evaluated on the same must samples used for berry quality determinations by using the free radical scavenging activity α α diphenyl β picrylhydrazyl dpph assay brand williams et al 1995 the free radical scavenging activity using the free radical dpph was evaluated by measuring the variation in absorbance at 515nm after 30min of

the different samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 mycorrhizal colonization and relative mycorrhizal dependency rmd under moderate temperatures and optimal irrigation 100 of plants from cl 260 and cl 1089 had mycorrhizal structures mainly hyphae and vesicles fig 1 but percentages of root mycorrhizal colonization did not exceed 10 in fi plants from cl 843 grown at moderate temperatures the percentage of root colonization reached 15 but only 35 of plants showed mycorrhizal structures imposition of drought ed or ld and or elevated temperatures 28 18 c negatively affected mycorrhizal symbiosis in the three clones of tempranillo these low percentages of mycorrhizal colonization achieved at the final stage of fruit ripening could be due to several causes 1 disinfection of the amf spores during the production of in vitro mycorrhizal inoculum may have eliminated or at least reduced the bacteria associated with the fungus thus harming both the survival and the well timed germination and growth of spores and hyphae included in the applied inoculum roesti et al 2005 agnolucci et al 2015 2 low photosynthetic rates measured at fruit ripening data not shown could not allow the production of sufficient carbohydrates to support the mycorrhizal symbiosis and or 3 several sinks such as fruits and mycorrhizal fungus in roots would be competing for the scarce synthetized photoassimilates during this period of the grapevine life cycle in our study no clear effect of the irrigation regimes and or air temperatures on the percentage of mycorrhizal colonization was observed however several studies have revealed that climate change can affect indirectly through changes in host plant growth and physiology and directly the fungal development and the rates of root colonization by amf compant et al 2010 although fungal responses to environmental factors can be strain dependent in most cases increased soil temperature favors the mycorrhizal colonization of roots and the spread of hyphal networks while drought reduces amf colonization the future scenarios of climate change however predict that increased temperature will increase soil drying which subsequently will reduce the length of the growing season for mycorrhizal fungal hyphae allen et al 2014 on the other hand it is important to note that percentages of mycorrhizal colonization provides information about the root length colonized by amf but does not indicate the functionality of the symbiosis and thus its benefits for the host plant a low correlation between the root length colonized by the fungus and the mycorrhizal responsiveness of the host plant means that genetic factors other than those allowing colonization are determining the responsiveness of the host plant to the percent of its root colonized by the mycorrhizal fungus parke and kaeppler 2000 calculation of rmd allowed the assessment of the degree to which the studied tempranillo clones were dependent on the mycorrhizal conditions to produce their maximum yield results were highly dependent on the tempranillo clone and environmental conditions fig 2 in cl 260 mycorrhizal inoculation always decreased fruit yield rmd values lower than 100 which may be as a consequence of a sink effect caused by the presence of the fungus in roots that would have increased the translocation of sugars from the aerial part to the roots in detriment to fruit development the lower yield of m24 fi plants from cl 260 in comparison with that of m24 fi was accentuated by the ed treatment but attenuated when ed was imposed under elevated temperatures 28ed pischl and barber 2016 also found that non mycorrhizal bell peppers grown at optimal irrigation and ambient temperatures produced more fruits than mycorrhizal plants according to these authors under non stressed conditions the amf treatments incurred a cost that resulted in reduced growth and fitness relative to uncolonized plants in agreement with our results pischl and barber 2016 also observed that warm temperatures and drought reduced differences between treatments in contrast with findings in cl 260 mycorrhizal association improved yield in plants from cl 1089 grown at 24 14 c except for those undergoing ld fig 2 the highest benefit of amf inoculation on yield was observed when ed was applied in this case rmd values almost reached 200 in cl 843 at 24 14 c mycorrhizal inoculation enhanced yield in drought stressed plants 24ed and 24ld however at 28 18 c rmd only was significantly improved under full irrigation 28fi arbuscular mycorrhizal dependency can strongly vary not only among different plant species tawaraya 2003 but also among cultivars belonging to the same plant species tawaraya 2003 fahey et al 2016 which has also been assessed between different grape varieties eftekhari et al 2012 torres et al 2015 2016 root morphology root length length and frequency of the root hairs seems to be the main factor for determining the mycorrhizal dependency of a given plant species or cultivar because it strongly affects the efficiency of the host plant to acquire resources from the soil tawaraya 2003 any environmental factor that may alter the root morphology of host plants could also modify their mycorrhizal dependency in our study despite the interclonal differences between cl 1089 and cl 843 in general terms mycorrhizal inoculation improved yield in plants undergoing adverse conditions drought elevated temperatures or both which reinforces the idea that mycorrhizal symbiosis may be more beneficial for host plants under stressful conditions goicoechea et al 2004 and supports the results indicating that amf can improve the drought heat tolerance of vines schreiner and linderman 2005 valentine et al 2006 schreiner et al 2007 3 2 phenology and physiological characteristics during berry ripening clones of grapevine cv tempranillo tested in this study have significant diversity for some agronomic traits such as length of cycle yield bunch mass and berry mass table s1 with regard to phenology vineyard grown plants of cl 260 and cl 1089 were characterized by a shorter reproductive cycle than cl 843 in our experimental conditions temperature was the main factor influencing time to reach veraison that was shortened by increasing temperature to 28 18 c table s2 such observations show a consistent trend towards earlier veraison commonly observed at warm temperatures petrie and sadras 2008 webb et al 2012 torres et al 2016 however in cl 843 at 24 14 c the ed treatment also contributed to reduce time to reach veraison as showed by significant interaction between both factors t i p 0 05 in the same way several studies provided support for acceleration of the ripening process due to ed water restriction that was shown by the accelerated onset of anthocyanin synthesis castellarin et al 2007 herrera and castellarin 2016 the hormone abscisic acid aba plays a critical role in regulating berry ripening because berry aba concentration increases remarkably at veraison and stimulates anthocyanin synthesis by promoting expression of key biosynthetic genes fortes et al 2015 under water deficit it has been reported that aba pattern accumulation was altered and at veraison peak of aba was significantly higher in ed than fi niculcea et al 2014 possibly such changes could have contributed to reducing time to reach veraison in the ed treatment on the other hand temperature and irrigation were the main factors affecting the time course from veraison to maturity in cl 260 and cl 843 in cl 1089 there was also an additive effect of amf inoculation as indicated by the interaction between temperature amf inoculation and irrigation t m i p 0 05 grapevine water status throughout fruit ripening was significantly different per treatments as indicated by the decrease in predawn ψpd measured in plants subjected ed or ld compared with fi plants fig 3 during the ed treatment ψpd values reached in cl 260 cl 1089 and cl 843 varied between 1 2 and 1 5mpa and were not modified by amf inoculation and or elevated temperature in contrast in the ld treatment amf inoculation and elevated temperature modified plant water status moreover significant interactions among factors were observed at stages el 37 and el 38 in cl 260 t i and m i p 0 001 cl 1089 t m and t i p 0 05 and cl 843 t i p 0 01 m i p 0 05 and t m i p 0 01 thus the lowest values of ψpd were always recorded in the m28 treatment and were reached at stage e l37 ca 1 4mpa in cl 260 and at stage el 38 ca 1 7mpa in cl 1089 and cl 843 fig 3 similarly edwards et al 2011 showed an additive effect of temperature and water stress on plant water status which in our study seemed to be more accentuated in m plants this low ψpd in m28 treatment could be result from elevated water losses due to high leaf area and or high transpiration rates however this was not the case because leaf area was considerably smaller in m28 than in m24 plants 0 80 0 90m2 plant 1 in m24 and 0 25 0 40m2 plant 1 in m28 furthermore m28 plants had the lowest leaf conductance rates data not shown in disagreement with our results nikolaou et al 2003 measured higher ψpd in leaves of mycorrhizal cabernet sauvignon than in those of non mycorrhizal plants under drought conditions and the improved water relations in mycorrhizal grapevines were attributed to their higher cytokinin concentrations however the exposure of plants to high temperatures can cause reductions in the levels of cytokinins todorova et al 2005 yang et al 2016 which may explain the low ψpd measured in the m28 treatment in addition it should be noted that although decreases in the tissue ψpd depend mostly upon leaf dehydration it also depend both on initial osmolarity of the cell sap and on cell wall elasticity previous studies of our group showed that ψpd of mycorrhizal plants involved an increase in the percentage of apoplastic water without a decrease in osmotic ψ goicoechea et al 1997 this mechanism may allow mycorrhizal plants to tolerate drought without investing solutes into osmotic adjustment which may be of special importance when the production of carbohydrates to support several sinks fruits and mycorrhizal fungus is limited especially at the end of berry ripening in m28 plants 3 3 berry characteristics berry size was mainly modulated by both amf inoculation and irrigation in cl 260 and cl 1089 table 1 moreover a significant interaction between irrigation and temperature was highlighted for these clones t i p 0 01 and p 0 05 respectively showing that the ld treatment resulted in small berries when plants grew at 28 18 c our findings are in contrast with those presented by bonada et al 2015 which showed additive effects i e lack of interaction between temperature and water for berry mass in our study ed was the treatment that most reduced berry mass regardless of temperature and clone which agrees with previous studies in tempranillo girona et al 2009 santesteban et al 2011 intrigliolo et al 2012 niculcea et al 2014 torres et al 2017 on the other hand relative skin mass in cl 260 and cl 843 was affected by the three factors applied t m i p 0 001 for cl 260 and p 0 01 for cl 843 table 1 in these clones amf inoculation and or elevated temperature accentuated the ability of the ed treatment to increase relative skin mass table s3 which could be due to a reduction in berry flesh mass roby and matthews 2004 bonada et al 2015 in cl 1089 temperature had no effect on relative skin mass with this parameter being mainly modulated by amf inoculation p 0 05 and irrigation p 0 001 the increase of relative skin mass could be an interesting response under climate change conditions because flavour and colour compounds which determine wine quality are located principally in the berry skin on that basis at 28 18 c berries from 28ed cl 260 and cl 843 and m28 cl 843 treatments will be subject to less dilution of skin compounds during winemaking table 1 3 4 berry quality some studies have observed great phenotypic plasticity in berry composition between grapevine varieties in response to warm temperatures sadras et al 2013 barnuud et al 2014 and to water deficit irrigation basile et al 2011 niculcea et al 2014 our previous research provided evidence for clonal diversity within tempranillo that resulted in different abilities to respond to amf inoculation torres et al 2016 or to the irrigation schedule applied torres et al 2017 under elevated temperatures data from the current study showed that interaction between three factors temperature irrigation and amf inoculation modulated fruit composition to a different extent in each clone zarrouk et al 2016 demonstrated that the interaction between irrigation regime and high temperature controls berry ripening in tempranillo similarly in cl 260 temperature and irrigation were the main factors modulating berry quality parameters table 2 at 28 18 c total soluble solids were increased in the water deficit treatments t i p 0 001 which was explained by the fact that faster accumulation of sugars at warm temperatures may be intensified under water deficit conditions bonada et al 2015 the ed treatment caused the most significant changes in must ph and titratable acidity whereas malic acid was affected by all treatments and growth conditions this pattern was underlined by a significant interaction among factors t m i p 0 01 one of the clearest relationships between temperature and fruit quality occurs with grape berry acidity whereby high temperatures reduce the concentration and or increase the breakdown of malic acid our data coincide previous studies that showed that warm temperatures produced malate losses in shiraz sweetman et al 2014 cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay barnuud et al 2014 this has been related to an increased nad dependent malic enzyme activity and decreased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate kinase activities sweetman et al 2014 furthermore total polyphenol index tpi and anthocyanin content of cl 260 were also significantly modulated by all factors table 2 thus tpi tended to be low in response to elevated temperatures amf inoculation or ed irrigation and total anthocyanins decreased in plants grown at 28 18 c the decline of anthocyanins under water stress and elevated temperature likely results from the repression of anthocyanin biosynthesis at the onset of ripening and by a high degradation rate at later stages of berry ripening bonada et al 2015 zarrouk et al 2016 however this effect was clearly mitigated in m28 ld plants which achieved higher anthocyanins than m28 ld plants table s4 this finding indicates that the beneficial effects produced by amf inoculation on berry phenolic content under warming conditions torres et al 2016 was higher under ld in comparison to ed obtaining wines with improved nutritional and nutraceutical value gabriele et al 2016 similarly baslam and goicoechea 2012 reported that amf colonization improved the accumulation of anthocyanins in leaves of lettuce especially under water deficit conditions which may be due to ability of amf to stimulate the expression of key genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway bruisson et al 2016 in cl 1089 total soluble solids must ph and malic acid were modulated by the three factors and or their interactions but titratable acidity was only affected by elevated temperatures table 3 at 24 14 c total soluble solids were reduced by the ed treatment but such differences disappeared at 28 18 c t i p 0 01 malic acid decreased in response to elevated temperatures and amf inoculation under ed and ld which underlines the interactive effects of all factors on berry quality t m i p 0 05 bonada et al 2015 furthermore tpi was significantly modified by the combination of different factors t m p 0 01 t i p 0 05 and m i p 0 01 table 3 in general tpi diminished in response to amf inoculation or ed irrigation but interestingly the deleterious effect of the m ed treatment did not appear in m ed plants furthermore total anthocyanin content was significantly modulated by the interaction between all factors t m i p 0 05 at 24 14 c amf inoculation and or the ed treatment reduced the content of anthocyanins in berries however such differences were alleviated at warm temperatures table 3 which is in agreement with our previous observations showing that cl 1089 was quite tolerant of elevated temperatures torres et al 2016 interestingly although in the study of torres et al 2016 amf colonization deteriorated some aspects of berry quality of cl 1089 the current study shows that the irrigation schedule may modify this pattern thus the loss of anthocyanins detected in m28 ld plants in comparison with m24 ld plants did not occur in m ld plants when cultivated at 28 18 c instead of 24 14 c this observation highlights the potential benefit of amf inoculation on phenolic content maintenance under ld conditions applied to cl 1089 table s5 in cl 843 the berry quality parameters were significantly modified by warm temperatures and ed irrigation as indicated by increased concentration of total soluble sugars must ph and decreased titratable acidity t i p 0 001 p 0 01 and p 0 01 respectively table 4 in contrast to other clones the content of malic acid was modulated by mycorrhization and irrigation but not by temperature which highlights a clonal diversity within the tempranillo variety in malate metabolism under warm temperatures similarly sadras et al 2013 observed great phenotypic plasticity in the responsiveness for some traits such as titratable acidity and must ph furthermore all factors contributed to changes in tpi and anthocyanins as highlighted by the interaction between them t m i p 0 01 for tpi and p 0 001 for anthocyanins regarding tpi data showed that the m28 ld treatment performed better than the m28 ed treatment table s6 with regard to anthocyanins accumulated in berries of plants grown at 24 14 c both water restriction regimes ed and ld resulted in decreased anthocyanin contents in comparison with levels found in fi plants m24 fi or m24 fi this effect being more pronounced in m than in m plants table s6 in general anthocyanin content was reduced under elevated temperatures but the impact was also lower in m than in m plants in fact in cl 843 the loss of anthocyanins detected in m28 ld plants was not found in m28 ld plants in comparison with m24 ld and m24ld respectively this finding supports the notion that benefits of amf under elevated temperature on berry composition torres et al 2016 could be accentuated in combination with water deficit 3 5 antioxidant capacity fig 4 shows the results obtained from the dpph assay performed in must in order to test its total antioxidant capacity in cl 260 and cl 1089 all factors accounted for modifying total antioxidant capacity of berry extracts t m i p 0 05 in cl 260 there were small changes in total antioxidant capacity and only m28 fi plants exhibited a significant reduction in this parameter under warm temperatures however in cl 1089 amf inoculation exerted a positive effect on antioxidant capacity which was especially accentuated in m28 fi and m28 ed treatments in cl 843 total antioxidant capacity was modulated by the interaction between temperature and mycorrhization t m p 0 001 our data also revealed that elevated temperatures reduced total antioxidant capacity in m28 plants but it was clearly improved in m28 plants regardless irrigation regime applied fig 4 these findings suggest that in this clone the combination of amf inoculation and elevated temperatures exerted an additive effect in improving antioxidant power maya and matsubara 2013 torres et al 2016 3 6 principal component analysis fig 5 a shows the score plot obtained by pca where samples of each clone are grouped in the plot of the first and second principal components pc1 versus pc2 here pc1 accounted for about 27 66 of the total variance while pc2 covered 20 30 different tempranillo clones and amf inoculated or uninoculated plants could not be clearly distinguished fig 5a however a clear distinction between plants subjected to different irrigation treatments was shown across pc1 on the other hand temperature treatments were separated along pc2 these findings reveal that in our experimental model abiotic factors air temperature and water regime were more determinant than biotic factors tempranillo clones and mycorrhization for berry quality however the selection of a given clone of tempranillo and or the application of the mycorrhizal inoculum under specific environmental conditions modulated some concrete aspects related to characteristics table 1 and quality fig 4 tables 2 4 of berries which was demonstrated by the significant interactions between the main factors reflected in the results of anova the loading plot fig 5b highlighted the importance of ψpd e l35 tpi anthocyanin ph and acidity levels in explaining variance across pc1 separation between temperature treatments was related to ψpd at the final stages of berry ripening e l37 and e l38 the days between veraison to berry maturity and total soluble solids this analysis also showed that ld and fi appeared together under both temperature conditions reinforcing the idea that ld irrigation could continue being valid under a projected warming scenario in order to maintain berry quality and antioxidant properties with the aim to understand the different performance of biotic factors clones and mycorrhization in each temperature two more pca were conducted fig 6 fig 6a and b show the score and the loading plots generated at 24 14 c while fig 6c and d correspond to 28 18 c conditions at 24 14 c irrigation treatments were separated along pc1 which explained the 33 36 of the variance whereas pc2 covered 15 95 separation was due to the content of total anthocyanins tpi titratable acidity ψpd e l34 ph and the number of days between veraison and maturity results highlight the similarities between ld and fi at 24 14 c in the quality parameters and phenology data but clones and mycorrhizal treatments were not clearly distinguished fig 6a on the other hand the two first principal components from data of warming conditions covered 27 39 and 14 95 of the total variance respectively ed was distinguished from fi and ld due to pc1 according to their ψpd e l34 ψpd e l35 total anthocyanins titratable acidity and days from veraison to maturity however pc2 allowed establishing a difference between fi and ld treatments fig 6c in relation with ψpd e l37 ψpd e l38 and the brix fig 6d this result is not surprising due to the treatments were similar till berries reached e l37 and this period matched with the sugar accumulation period which has been recently shown to be faster under water deficit and warming bonada et al 2015 additionally the pc2 conducted at 28 18 c showed a slightly separation between m and m within each irrigation treatment fi and ld fig 6d suggesting that the effect of amf is more pronounced at 28 18 c under elevated air temperature and ld irrigation the association of tempranillo grapevine with the mycorrhizal fungus r intraradices favoured the antioxidant capacity of berries fig 4 in cl 843 and induced the accumulation of anthocyanins in berries of cl 260 table s4 and cl 843 table s6 because tempranillo clones responded differently to the inoculation with r intraradices and responses varied according to the environmental conditions we completely agree with sinclair et al 2014 when they concluded that it may be profitable to identify the amf inoculants most suitable for a given cultivar in a given environment 4 conclusions in a scenario of climate change effective water management should accomplish the dual purpose of reducing water supply at certain phenological stages to improve grape quality traits while ensuring plant water status to counteract the deleterious effects of elevated temperature in water stressed plants the findings in this study indicate that amf inoculation may alleviate the negative effects of water restriction and warming conditions in some clones of tempranillo grapevines in general post veraison ld water deficit performed better than pre veraison ed water deficit but such differences were attenuated at elevated temperatures furthermore at 28 18 c the potential benefits of ld can be improved by amf inoculation because the loss of anthocyanins detected in the non mycorrhizal plants did not occur when plants were inoculated with amf this benefit however was dependent on tempranillo intravarietal differences our results suggest that the implementation of measures to promote the association of grapevines with amf could contribute to optimize effects of irrigation strategy on berry properties under future warming conditions this research also offers the first evidence that the combined effect of water and temperature stress varied depending on amf inoculation and the clone studied future assays with different mycorrhizal inoculants may help to select the most adequate fungal species for benefiting yield and or berry quality of each clone of tempranillo cultivated under predicted warming scenarios acknowledgements this

11522,in the mediterranean area changes in crop production and quality are expected in the future due to one or more stress factors associated with climate change among them plant responses to atmospheric co2 concentration increases enhanced temperatures and scarce water availability are a matter that deserves further investigation in this study the effects of the three above mentioned factors acting individually and or in interaction on grapevine reproductive growth and berry quality were investigated in three consecutive growing seasons 2013 2014 and 2015 in the cultivars red and white tempranillo eight different treatments were applied from fruit set to maturity 2 co2 levels 400 versus 700μmolmol 1 2 temperature treatments ambient versus ambient 4 c 2 water availability regimes well irrigated versus cyclic drought in four temperature gradient greenhouses located at the university of navarra pamplona spain yield was significantly reduced by drought and was year dependent eventual heat shocks above 35 c in the first week of july in 2015 induced berry burn browning and loss of 50 of the berries regarding quality simulated climate change scenarios affected to greater extent technological primary metabolism than phenolic secondary metabolism maturity indeed high temperature and drought significantly and consistently increased must ph due to decreases in malic acid on the contrary elevated co2 decreased ph associated with significant increases in tartaric acid differences in the response of red and white tempranillo were found acidity was lower and ph higher in white than in red tempranillo due to lower malic and tartaric acid concentrations also total polyphenol index was lower in the white variety in part due to the absence of anthocyanins fresh bunch weight and berry water content were higher in the white than in the red variety interactions found among variety year water availability temperature and co2 have been highlighted and discussed

cyclic drought tggs temperature gradient greenhouses keywords climate change elevated co2 high temperature drought grapevine quality red and white tempranillo 1 introduction the most important anthropogenic greenhouse effect gas atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 has risen since pre industrial period until nowadays from 280 to more than 400μmolmol 1 air ppm and it is foreseen to reach ca 700ppm at the end of this century due to continuous and intense co2 emissions and its greenhouse effect models projected an average temperature increase of between 1 8 and 4 0 c by the year 2100 moreover plant water availability is predicted to be lower by that time intensifying the arid agricultural areas and impacting crop production collins and bras 2007 the mediterranean area is particularly very vulnerable to a temperature and aridity increase as well as to sustained severe weather tubiello et al 2000 therefore climate related factors such as elevated co2 elevated temperature and altered water availability will affect crops growing in the mediterranean area in the future effects of atmospheric co2 concentration have been investigated in a variety of agricultural crops cure and acock 1986 legumes irigoyen et al 2014 trees ceulemans and mousseau 1984 and other plant species idso and idso 1994 poorter 1993 including grapevine schultz 2000 climate change is exerting an increasingly

affected phenolics by climate change include anthocyanins salazar parra et al 2010 torres et al 2016 and flavonoids pastore et al 2017 torres et al 2017 ultimately these changes affect vinification process jones and davis 2000 mira de orduña 2010 a common response to elevated co2 is an increased grapevine plant growth and yield bowes 1993 only some grape constituents are transiently influenced by elevated co2 during berry development whereas others are not affected in particular i must acids and sugars were positively impacted at different stages of berry growth although effects vanished bindi et al 2001 or not kizildeniz et al 2015 at maturity and ii must total anthocyanins and tannins gonçalves et al 2009 kizildeniz et al 2015 and color intensity and tonality salazar parra et al 2010 were not modified high temperature has a huge impact on enzyme activities in grapevine berries elevated temperature affects anthocyanin accumulation through disturbing several enzymes of the anthocyanin metabolic pathway cohen et al 2008 yamane et al 2006 resulting in lower anthocyanin contents kliewer 1970 mori et al 2007 torres et al 2016 grapevine elevated temperature experiments also indicate that the grape must acidity was decreased affecting especially grape malic acid concentration spayd et al 2002 sweetman et al 2014 for that reason cooler regions are generally producing grape berries with higher malic acid levels than warmer regions blouin and guimberteau 2003 recently torres et al 2016 reported that temperature decreases grape malic acid concentration in some clones but not in others of red tempranillo soil water availability has marked negative impact on grapevine vegetative growth kliewer and weaver 1971 matthews et al 1987 matthews and anderson 1989 williams and matthews 1990 generally decreasing moreover berry yield and quality myburgh 2003 berry size decreases if grapevine faces water stress during early phenological stages due to restrictions in cell division matthews and anderson 1989 mccarthy 1997 ojeda et al 2002 as a consequence water stress may impact positively through a depression in berry size berry quality indirectly via concentration of must phenolics including anthocyanins castellarin et al 2007 matthews et al 1990 petrie et al 2004 however other effects of water stress on berry quality reported in the literature are rather incoherent possibly related to the phenological phase in which water stress occurs or to the intensity and duration of the water deficit thus i increases in malic acid concentration lópez et al 2007 sugar content antolín et al 2006 koundouras et al 2006 matthews et al 1990 ojeda et al 2002 and ph values bahar et al 2011 ii decreases in malic acid concentration de souza et al 2005 intrigliolo and

esteban et al 1999 have been reported in response to water stress with respect to phenolic compounds a recent report shows that anthocyanins and flavonoids were mainly affected by timing of water deficit throughout ripening torres et al 2017 for all the above mentioned reasons performing greenhouse experiments under controlled conditions including a fine control of co2 concentration temperature and water availability and with several repetitions could help to gain information about the effects of foreseen climate change on grapevine yield and berry quality different growth systems such as open top chambers otc free air co2 enrichment face systems temperature gradient greenhouses tggs and others have been used to investigate the effects of elevated co2 on plants morales et al 2014 in the present work tggs were used for their advantages as research oriented greenhouses allowing us to investigate the effects of elevated co2 elevated temperature and water availability separately or in interaction as multiple stress factors although the effects of these climate change related factors as single stress factors have been investigated see above their interactions were rarely studied combination of all these factors caused more severe effects on berry weight mccarthy 1997 and changes in berry quality were more complex schultz 2000 kizildeniz et al 2015 elevated co2 attenuated the negative effects of temperature bindi et al 2001 or drought kizildeniz et al 2015 on grapevine production in the present study we investigated the effects of elevated co2 elevated temperature and water deficit either acting individually or interacting among them on yield and must quality in fruit bearing cuttings of two grapevine vitis vinifera l cultivars red and white tempranillo during 3 years 2013 2014 and 2015 no many works have been reported using the tggs and fruit bearing cuttings of red kizildeniz et al 2015 salazar parra et al 2015 or white kizildeniz et al 2015 tempranillo the salazar parra et al 2015 report did not deal with grape quality in all those cases experiments reported lasted one year in contrast to the multi year approach of this report 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material dormant cuttings of vitis vinifera l cv red accession t43 clone rj 43 and white tempranillo accession ci 101 in la grajera germplasm bank riojás government spain were sampled from an experimental vineyard of the institute of sciences of vine and wine icvv in logroño la rioja spain experiments were conducted using each year new cuttings not imposing treatments on the same plants for 3 consecutive years in this work we used own rooted plants in the past we tried to adapt the technique of fruit bearing grapevine cuttings to grafted varieties it was unsuccessful we do believe that the resources driven to form the graft are high not allowing the proper and normal development of the bunch tempranillo is a local red grape variety widely cultivated in northern and central spain currently expanded to many other viticulture areas in the world a new white berry somatic variant of tempranillo white tempranillo is the result of a spontaneous natural mutation which was discovered in an old red tempranillo vineyard in 1988 in murillo de río leza la rioja spain garcía escudero et al 2011 and vegetatively propagated from one single grapevine plant 2 2 growth conditions fruit bearing cuttings were obtained from dormant cuttings according to mullins 1966 as described by kizildeniz et al 2015 briefly cuttings were treated with indole butyric acid 300mgl 1 in a heated rockwool moist bed 25 27 c kept in a cool chamber 5 c one month later the rooted cuttings were planted in 0 8l plastic pots containing a mixture of sand perlite and vermiculite 1 1 1 in volume and transferred to the greenhouse only a single flowering stem was allowed to develop on each plant in order to get only one berry bunch per plant until fruit set vegetation was controlled and only 4 leaves per plant were allowed to grow at fruit set the cuttings were transplanted to 13l plastic pots containing a peat and perlite 2 1 v v mixture during growing period the greenhouse was set at 26 15 c and 60 80 relative humidity rh day night and photoperiod of 15h with natural daylight supplemented with high pressure metal halide lamps osram augsburg germany providing

conditions were maintained until fruit set from march to may 2013 2014 and 2015 2 3 temperature gradient greenhouses and experimental design treatments application was made in four temperature gradient greenhouses tggs located in the campus of the university of navarra 42 48 n 1 40 w pamplona navarra spain from june to august 2013 2014 and 2015 fruit set to maturity it is evident that the tggs used in this work move plants away from their growing natural conditions quantifying this in scenarios of climate change is difficult because plants in the field face multiple stress factors however we do believe that tggs are a good approach because tggs are a valid way of ascribing to one specific factor co2 temperature or water availability a physiological response enabling for mechanistic researches on the causes of the physiological responses to future climate conditions readers are referred to morales et al 2014 2016 for further discussion about differences between results obtained from vineyards and the fruit bearing cutting technique tggs have a design based on temperature gradient tunnels rawson et al 1995 which allows investigating the effects on plants of environmental changes such as elevated temperature elevated co2 and drought acting separately or in combination tggs contain 3 temperature modules 3 04m long each co2 can be injected inside increasing the air co2 concentration as desired and a gradient of temperature is created along them from module 1 of ambient temperature to module 3 of ambient 4 c morales et al 2014 also plants growing inside the tggs can be subjected to different levels of irrigation thus tggs are used as research greenhouses with high level of environmental control and with plants in pots growing inside morales et al 2014 in the tggs co2 concentration temperature relative humidity and radiation were monitored and or controlled by an informatics system the treatments applied to the two grapevine varieties red and white tempranillo were a combination of two co2 levels ambient ca 400ppm and elevated ca 700ppm two temperature regimes ambient and ambient 4 c and two water availability conditions full irrigation and cyclic drought water treatments were applied and substrate water content recorded according to kizildeniz et al 2015 2 4 measurements and analyses berry fresh weight fw was measured and then oven

sampling some berries from the biological replicates and using their brix values to choose harvest time however the range of values found at maturity in the whole bunch of berries varied slightly table 1 data revealed that the tss brix of white tempranillo was 2 1 higher than that of red table 1 also the concentration of tss increased 2 6 when plants were grown under elevated co2 when the

tempranillo table 1 we further analyzed the phenolic characteristics of red tempranillo because grapes from white tempranillo have lost anthocyanins in our study the only factor that impacted the

under current co2 but increased it in those grown under drought and elevated co2 fig 5 in 9 out of 12 comparisons elevated co2 did not impact the total anthocyanins to tss ratio fig 5 generally water

were not clear enough but the total anthocyanins to tss ratio tended to decrease when drought and elevated co2 were combined irrespective of temperature fig 5 in 2014 drought decreased the ratio always irrespective of temperature and co2 concentration fig 5 finally in 2015 the ratio was decreased when drought was combined with elevated co2 when plants were grown at current temperature fig 5 the only exception was the combination of elevated co2 elevated temperature and drought in 2015 which increased the ratio when compared with the well irrigated plants grown at elevated co2 and elevated temperature fig 5 4 discussion changes in grapevine production and quality are expected in the future in the mediterranean area and in other viticulture areas due to one or more stress factors associated with climate change in this study the effects of elevated co2 elevated temperature and water availability acting individually and or in interaction were investigated in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the grapevine cultivars red and white tempranillo among those factors drought reduced yield in line with previous reports korkutal et al 2011 williams and matthews 1990 and was year dependent being especially low in 2015 due to eventual heat shocks in the first week of july growing under elevated temperature per se had no effect on yield but the high temperatures of the heat weaves with maximum temperatures above 35 c for at least five consecutive days or 40 c for three days induced berry burn browning and finally loss of 50 of the berries grape quality changes can be indirect effects of changes in berry characteristics in particular berry size and skin pulp ratio berry weight and relative skin mass skin dw pulp dw were monitored in 2013 no significant changes were observed in the relative skin mass induced by the treatments or their interactions mekni 2014 with respect to berry fw no changes were recorded in response to temperature whereas decreased when grown under elevated co2 with respect to ambient co2 from 0 89 1 27 to 0 87 1 23g fw 2 3 or increased in drought grown plants compared to the well irrigated from 0 89 1 20 to 0 87 1 27g fw 2 mekni 2014 we consider that these changes although significant impact scarcely in the berry quality berry quality response to climate change was variable and depended on the year some general conclusions however can be reached from the three years of experimentation in the tggs climate change affected in a greater extent the technological than the phenolic maturity grape berries have as major organic acids malic tartaric and to a lower extent citric acid grape acidity depends basically on i the total amount of acids ii the ratio of malic to tartaric acid and iii the concentration of potassium conde et al 2007 acids start to accumulate during the first grape growth period peaking before the onset of ripening veraison then they decrease coincident with grape sugar accumulation this dynamic is highly affected by environmental variables in our experiments high temperature and drought significantly and consistently increased must ph and decreased acidity due to the decrease in malic acid this multi year report confirms a previous single year one for the same red tempranillo variety salazar parra et al 2010 the loss of malic acid lakso and kliewer 1975 shellie 2006 and decreased acidity sadras and moran 2012 due to high temperatures have been attributed in controlled experiments to an increased degradation to glucose during ripening blouin and guimberteau 2003 matthews and anderson 1989 ruffner et al 1976 in water stressed grapevines however increases lópez et al 2007 decreases koundouras et al 2006 matthews and anderson 1989 salon et al 2005 or even no grape malic acid changes esteban et al 1999 have been reported in the literature on the contrary elevated co2 decreased ph associated with significant increases in tartaric acid concentration this seems to be a specific effect of the elevated co2 that would increase the tartaric acid biosynthesis and or would decrease its degradation evolving in opposite direction to the acidic dynamic of the grape during ripening water stress had no impact on grape tartaric acid in line with previous results in red tempranillo salazar parra et al 2010 these changes in the acidic properties of the must affect its quality and potentially that of the resulting wine through changes in the wine stability and tart taste conde et al 2007 the relationship among ph acidity and potassium is rather complex free tartaric acid and its potassium salt constitute an important trait for wine quality and longevity because it impacts must ph and wine stability kliewer 1965b 1966 ribéreau gayon et al 2006 in the grape must potassium binds tartaric acid reducing acidity kliewer 1965a leading to tartrate precipitation during fermentation and wine ageing conde et al 2007 and resulting in low quality wines on the other hand high berry potassium levels may decrease the malate degradation rate etienne et al 2013 in our experiments potassium increased and decreased in musts obtained from grapes grown under drought and elevated co2 respectively changes in potassium concentration may have contributed at least in part to the observed ph changes in those treatments together with sugars and acids phenolic compounds are the most abundant constituents present in grapes that are very important for wine quality downey et al 2006 he et al 2010 kuhn et al 2014 among them anthocyanins synthetized via the flavonoid pathway in the red varieties play an essential role in the grape and wine color grape total anthocyanins decreased by the impact of drought which agrees with previous reports working with red tempranillo kuhn et al 2014 zarrouk et al 2012 the increased tonality hue observed in these experiments in red tempranillo grapes from water stressed plants agrees with previous reports martínez lüscher et al 2014 and suggests a change in anthocyanin composition downey et al 2006 martínez lüscher et al 2014 grape tpi decreased by the impact of elevated temperature and by growing plants in presence of elevated co2 but with no changes in anthocyanin concentration phenolics other than anthocyanins caused obviously these decreases in the case of elevated temperature it could be ascribed to lower flavonols pastore et al 2017 when analyzing tpi no interaction between water availability and temperature was found in line with a previous report bonada et al 2015 grape veraison points out the start of the second growth phase of berries which is characterized by an activation of the encoding genes for sugar import leading to a strong increase of sugars in the grape pulp followed then by anthocyanin accumulation mainly in the skin conde et al 2007 coombe and mccarthy 2000 lecourieux et al 2014 therefore sugar and anthocyanin accumulation appear to be highly related dai et al 2014 it is generally assumed that climate change decouples sugars and anthocyanins in red grapes martínez lüscher et al 2016a 2016b decreasing the anthocyanins to sugars ratio which is widely ascribed to the increased temperature sadras and moran 2012 in our three experiments no consistent decreases in the anthocyanins to sugars ratio were observed in response to elevated temperature but decreases occurred in response to water stress due to decreases in anthocyanins finally varietal differences detected between white and red tempranillo are a key aspect of this report white tempranillo resulted of a spontaneous mutation of red tempranillo that comprised chromosomal deletions and reorganizations loosing hundreds of gens while white grapes lack at least two similar and adjacent regulatory genes due to a multi allelic mutation walker et al 2007 our experiments evidence loss of genes and or changes in their activity or regulation related to primary and secondary metabolisms within the former grape tss increased and acidity decreased and ph increased due to decreased malic and tartaric acid concentrations in white when compared to red tempranillo within the latter tpi was lower in the white variety when compared to the red one which in part at least can be due to the absence of anthocyanins also bunch fw and berry water content were higher in the white than in the red variety these findings may give clues for further research on the genetic differences between red and white tempranillo 5 conclusions the response of tempranillo yield and quality was rather variable probably due to the interactions between variety year water availability temperature and co2 in traits such as bunch fw variety year malic acid temperature co2 and variety year ph temperature co2 color density temperature water availability and total anthocyanins to tss ratio water availability year some general conclusions however can be listed within the three climate change related factors investigated drought and heat shocks in 2015 but not elevated temperature per se decreased grapevine yield of red and white tempranillo changes in berry characteristics berry size and relative skin mass impacted scarcely on grape quality climate change affected in a greater extent the technological than the phenolic maturity elevated temperature and drought consistently increased must ph due to malic acid decreases on the contrary elevated co2 decreased ph associated with consistent tartaric acid concentration increases the changes in the musts acidic properties affect its quality and potentially that of the resulting wine differences in the response of red and white tempranillo are a key aspect in this report due to lower malic and tartaric acid concentrations acidity was lower and ph higher in white than in red tempranillo in part due to the absence of anthocyanins tpi was lower in the white than in the red variety also bunch fw and berry water content were higher in the white than in red

11522,in the mediterranean area changes in crop production and quality are expected in the future due to one or more stress factors associated with climate change among them plant responses to atmospheric co2 concentration increases enhanced temperatures and scarce water availability are a matter that deserves further investigation in this study the effects of the three above mentioned factors acting individually and or in interaction on grapevine reproductive growth and berry quality were investigated in three consecutive growing seasons 2013 2014 and 2015 in the cultivars red and white tempranillo eight different treatments were applied from fruit set to maturity 2 co2 levels 400 versus 700μmolmol 1 2 temperature treatments ambient versus ambient 4 c 2 water availability regimes well irrigated versus cyclic drought in four temperature gradient greenhouses located at the university of navarra pamplona spain yield was significantly reduced by drought and was year dependent eventual heat shocks above 35 c in the first week of july in 2015 induced berry burn browning and loss of 50 of the berries regarding quality simulated climate change scenarios affected to greater extent technological primary metabolism than phenolic secondary metabolism maturity indeed high temperature and drought significantly and consistently increased must ph due to decreases in malic acid on the contrary elevated co2 decreased ph associated with significant increases in tartaric acid differences in the response of red and white tempranillo were found acidity was lower and ph higher in white than in red tempranillo due to lower malic and tartaric acid concentrations also total polyphenol index was lower in the white variety in part due to the absence of anthocyanins fresh

anthropogenic greenhouse effect gas atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 has risen since pre industrial period until nowadays from 280 to more than 400μmolmol 1 air ppm and it is foreseen to reach ca 700ppm at the end of this century due to continuous and intense co2 emissions and its greenhouse effect models projected an average temperature increase of between 1 8 and 4 0 c by the year 2100 moreover plant water availability is predicted to be lower by that time intensifying the arid agricultural areas and impacting crop production collins and bras 2007 the mediterranean area is particularly very vulnerable to a temperature and aridity increase as well as to sustained severe weather tubiello et al 2000 therefore climate related factors such as elevated co2 elevated temperature and altered water availability will affect crops growing in the mediterranean area in the future effects of atmospheric co2 concentration have been investigated in a variety of agricultural crops cure and acock 1986 legumes irigoyen et al 2014 trees ceulemans and mousseau 1984 and other plant species idso and idso 1994 poorter 1993 including grapevine schultz 2000 climate change is exerting an increasingly

process jones and davis 2000 mira de orduña 2010 a common response to elevated co2 is an increased grapevine plant growth and yield bowes 1993 only some grape constituents are transiently influenced by elevated co2 during berry development whereas others are not affected in particular i must acids and sugars were positively impacted at different stages of berry growth although effects vanished bindi et al 2001 or not kizildeniz et al 2015 at maturity and ii must total anthocyanins and tannins gonçalves et al 2009 kizildeniz et al 2015 and color intensity and tonality salazar parra et al 2010 were not modified high temperature has a huge impact on enzyme activities in grapevine berries elevated temperature affects anthocyanin accumulation through disturbing several enzymes of the anthocyanin metabolic pathway cohen et al 2008 yamane et al 2006 resulting in lower anthocyanin contents kliewer 1970 mori et al 2007 torres et al 2016 grapevine elevated temperature experiments also indicate that the grape must acidity was decreased affecting especially grape malic acid concentration spayd et al 2002 sweetman et al 2014 for that reason cooler regions are generally producing grape berries with higher malic acid levels than warmer regions blouin and guimberteau 2003 recently torres et al 2016 reported that temperature decreases grape malic acid concentration in some clones but not in others of red tempranillo soil water availability has marked negative impact on grapevine vegetative growth kliewer and weaver 1971 matthews et al 1987 matthews and anderson 1989 williams and matthews 1990 generally decreasing moreover berry yield and quality myburgh 2003 berry size decreases if grapevine faces water stress during early phenological stages due to restrictions in cell division matthews and anderson 1989 mccarthy 1997 ojeda et al 2002 as a consequence water stress may impact positively through a depression in berry size berry quality indirectly via concentration of must phenolics including anthocyanins castellarin et al 2007 matthews et al 1990 petrie et al 2004 however other effects of water stress on berry quality reported in the literature are rather incoherent possibly related to the phenological phase in which water stress occurs or to the intensity and duration of the water deficit thus i increases in malic acid concentration lópez et al 2007 sugar content antolín et al 2006 koundouras et al 2006 matthews et al 1990 ojeda et al 2002 and ph values bahar et al 2011 ii decreases in malic acid concentration de souza et al 2005 intrigliolo and castel 2009 koundouras et al 2006 salazar parra et al 2010 berry volume total soluble solids potassium and tartaric acid concentration bahar et al 2011 or iii no change on malic acid concentration esteban et al 1999 have been reported in response to water stress with respect to phenolic compounds a recent report shows that anthocyanins and flavonoids were mainly affected by timing of water deficit throughout ripening torres et al 2017 for all the above mentioned reasons performing greenhouse experiments under controlled conditions including a fine control of co2 concentration temperature and water availability and with several repetitions could help to gain information about the effects of foreseen climate change on grapevine yield and berry quality different growth systems such as open top chambers otc free air co2 enrichment face systems temperature gradient greenhouses tggs and others have been used to investigate the effects of elevated co2 on plants morales et al 2014 in the present work tggs were used for their advantages as research oriented greenhouses allowing us to investigate the effects of elevated co2 elevated temperature and water availability separately or in interaction as multiple stress factors although the effects of these climate change related factors as single stress factors have been investigated see above their interactions were rarely studied combination of all these factors caused more severe effects on berry weight mccarthy 1997 and changes in berry quality were more complex schultz 2000 kizildeniz et al 2015 elevated co2 attenuated the negative effects of temperature bindi et al 2001 or drought kizildeniz et al 2015 on grapevine production in the present study we investigated the effects of elevated co2 elevated temperature and water deficit either acting individually or interacting among them on yield and must quality in fruit bearing cuttings of two grapevine vitis vinifera l cultivars red and white tempranillo during 3 years 2013 2014 and 2015 no many works have been reported using the tggs and fruit bearing cuttings of red kizildeniz et al 2015 salazar parra et al 2015 or white kizildeniz et al 2015 tempranillo the salazar parra et al 2015 report did not deal with grape quality in all those cases experiments reported lasted one year in contrast to the multi year approach of this report 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material dormant cuttings of vitis vinifera l cv red accession t43 clone rj 43 and white tempranillo accession ci 101 in la grajera germplasm bank riojás government spain were sampled from an experimental vineyard of the institute of sciences of vine and wine icvv in logroño la rioja spain experiments were conducted using each year new cuttings not imposing treatments on the same plants for 3 consecutive years in this work we used own rooted plants in the past we tried to adapt the technique of fruit bearing grapevine cuttings to grafted varieties it was unsuccessful we do believe that the resources driven to form the graft are high not allowing the proper and normal development of the bunch tempranillo is a local red grape variety widely cultivated in northern and central spain currently expanded to many other viticulture areas in the world a new white berry somatic variant of tempranillo white tempranillo is the result of a spontaneous natural mutation which was discovered in an old red tempranillo vineyard in 1988 in murillo de río leza la rioja spain garcía escudero et al 2011 and vegetatively propagated from one single grapevine plant 2 2 growth conditions fruit bearing cuttings were obtained from dormant cuttings according to mullins 1966 as described by kizildeniz et al 2015 briefly cuttings were treated with indole butyric acid 300mgl 1 in a heated rockwool moist bed 25 27 c kept in a cool chamber 5 c one month later the rooted cuttings were planted in 0 8l plastic pots containing a mixture of sand perlite and vermiculite 1 1 1 in volume and transferred to the greenhouse only a single flowering stem was allowed to develop on each plant in order to get only one berry bunch per plant until fruit set vegetation was controlled and only 4 leaves per plant were allowed to grow at fruit set the cuttings were transplanted to 13l plastic pots containing a peat and perlite 2 1 v v mixture during growing period the greenhouse was set at 26 15 c and 60 80 relative humidity rh day night and photoperiod of 15h with natural daylight supplemented with high pressure metal halide lamps osram augsburg germany providing

conditions were maintained until fruit set from march to may 2013 2014 and 2015 2 3 temperature gradient greenhouses and experimental design treatments application was made in four temperature gradient greenhouses tggs located in the campus of the university of navarra 42 48 n 1 40 w pamplona navarra spain from june to august 2013 2014 and 2015 fruit set to maturity it is evident that the tggs used in this work move plants away from their growing natural conditions quantifying this in scenarios of climate change is difficult because plants in the field face multiple stress factors however we do believe that tggs are a good approach because tggs are a valid way of ascribing to one specific factor co2 temperature or water availability a physiological response enabling for mechanistic researches on the causes of the physiological responses to future climate conditions readers are referred to morales et al 2014 2016 for further discussion about differences between results obtained from vineyards and the fruit bearing cutting technique tggs have a design based on temperature gradient tunnels rawson et al 1995 which allows investigating the effects on plants of environmental changes such as elevated temperature elevated co2 and drought acting separately or in combination tggs contain 3 temperature modules 3 04m long each co2 can be injected inside increasing the air co2 concentration as desired and a gradient of temperature is created along them from module 1 of ambient temperature to module 3 of ambient 4 c morales et al 2014 also plants growing inside the tggs can be subjected to different levels of irrigation thus tggs are used as research greenhouses with high level of environmental control and with plants in pots growing inside morales et al 2014 in the tggs co2 concentration temperature relative humidity and radiation were monitored and or controlled by an informatics system the treatments applied to the two grapevine varieties red and white tempranillo were a combination of two co2 levels ambient ca 400ppm and elevated ca 700ppm two temperature regimes ambient and ambient 4 c and two water availability conditions full irrigation and cyclic drought water treatments were applied and substrate water content recorded according to kizildeniz et al 2015 2 4 measurements and analyses berry fresh weight fw was measured and then oven dried at 80 c for 48h in order to obtain dw or dry mass dm berry water content was calculated as fw dw dw harvested grapevine berries 21 23 brix were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c until

total anthocyanin concentration was the water availability drought increased it p wa 0 05 11 table 2 tonality hue was also affected by water stress musts obtained from grapes grown under drought had 6 higher p wa 0 05 tonality than those grown under full irrigation table 2 with respect to color density drought and elevated co2 increased it p 0 05 in both cases 22 and 15 respectively an interaction between water availability and temperature occurred thus plants that were full irrigated and were grown under elevated temperature had 2 3 lower color density whereas the combined action of cyclic drought and high temperature increased color density 29 p wa t 0 05 table 2 all these phenolic characteristics varied largely among years p year 0 0001 table 2 ratio of total anthocyanins to tss was highly dependent on year p year 0 0001 reaching values of ca 10 20 20 30 and 30 40 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 5 no changes or no consistent effects were observed in response to temperature co2 or water availability fig 5 temperature did not change this ratio in 2013 and 2014 in 2015 when compared to current temperature elevated temperature decreased it in plants well irrigated and grown under current co2 but increased it in those grown under drought and elevated co2 fig 5 in 9 out of 12 comparisons elevated co2 did not impact the total anthocyanins to tss ratio fig 5 generally water stress either did not change or in some cases decreased the ratio fig 5 the only significant interaction we observed was that of water availability with year p wa year 0 0001 fig 5 in 2013 results were not clear enough but the total anthocyanins to tss ratio tended to decrease when drought and elevated co2 were combined irrespective of temperature fig 5 in 2014 drought decreased the ratio always irrespective of temperature and co2 concentration fig 5 finally in 2015 the ratio was decreased when drought was combined with elevated co2 when plants were grown at current temperature fig 5 the only exception was the combination of elevated co2 elevated temperature and drought in 2015 which increased the ratio when compared with the well irrigated plants grown at elevated co2 and elevated temperature fig 5 4 discussion changes in grapevine production and quality are expected in the future in the mediterranean area and in other viticulture areas due to one or more stress factors associated with climate change in this study the effects of elevated co2 elevated temperature and water availability acting individually and or in interaction were investigated in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the grapevine cultivars red and white tempranillo among those factors drought reduced yield in line with previous reports korkutal et al 2011 williams and matthews 1990 and was year dependent being especially low in 2015 due to eventual heat shocks in the first week of july growing under elevated temperature per se had no effect on yield but the high temperatures of the heat weaves with maximum temperatures above 35 c for at least five consecutive days or 40 c for three days induced berry burn browning and finally loss of 50 of the berries grape quality changes can be indirect effects of changes in berry characteristics in particular berry size and skin pulp ratio berry weight and relative skin mass skin dw pulp dw were monitored in 2013 no significant changes were observed in the relative skin mass induced by the treatments or their interactions mekni 2014 with respect to berry fw no changes were recorded in response to temperature whereas decreased when grown under elevated co2 with respect to ambient co2 from 0 89 1 27 to 0 87 1 23g fw 2 3 or increased in drought grown plants compared to the well irrigated from 0 89 1 20 to 0 87 1 27g fw 2 mekni 2014 we consider that these changes although significant impact scarcely in the berry quality berry quality response to climate change was variable and depended on the year some general conclusions however can be reached from the three years of experimentation in the tggs climate change affected in a greater extent the technological than the phenolic maturity grape berries have as major organic acids malic tartaric and to a lower extent citric acid grape acidity depends basically on i the total amount of acids ii the ratio of malic to tartaric acid and iii the concentration of potassium conde et al 2007 acids start to accumulate during the first grape growth period peaking before the onset of ripening veraison then they decrease coincident with grape sugar accumulation this dynamic is highly affected by environmental variables in our experiments high temperature and drought significantly and consistently increased must ph and decreased acidity due to the decrease in malic acid this multi year report confirms a previous single year one for the same red tempranillo variety salazar parra et al 2010 the loss of malic acid lakso and kliewer 1975 shellie 2006 and decreased acidity sadras and moran 2012 due to high temperatures have been attributed in controlled experiments to an increased degradation to glucose during ripening blouin and guimberteau 2003 matthews and anderson 1989 ruffner et al 1976 in water stressed grapevines however increases lópez et al 2007 decreases koundouras et al 2006 matthews and anderson 1989 salon et al 2005 or even no grape malic acid changes esteban et al 1999 have been reported in the literature on the contrary elevated co2 decreased ph associated with significant increases in tartaric acid concentration this seems to be a specific effect of the elevated co2 that would increase the tartaric acid biosynthesis and or would decrease its degradation evolving in opposite direction to the acidic dynamic of the grape during ripening water stress had no impact on grape tartaric acid in line with previous results in red tempranillo salazar parra et al 2010 these changes in the acidic properties of the must affect its quality and potentially that of the resulting wine through changes in the wine stability and tart taste conde et al 2007 the relationship among ph acidity and potassium is rather complex free tartaric acid and its potassium salt constitute an important trait for wine quality and longevity because it impacts must ph and wine stability kliewer 1965b 1966 ribéreau gayon et al 2006 in the grape must potassium binds tartaric acid reducing acidity kliewer 1965a leading to tartrate precipitation during fermentation and wine ageing conde et al 2007 and resulting in low quality wines on the other hand high berry potassium levels may decrease the malate degradation rate etienne et al 2013 in our experiments potassium increased and decreased in musts obtained from grapes grown under drought and elevated co2 respectively changes in potassium concentration may have contributed at least in part to the observed ph changes in those treatments together with sugars and acids phenolic compounds are the most abundant constituents present in grapes that are very important for wine quality downey et al 2006 he et al 2010 kuhn et al 2014 among them anthocyanins synthetized via the flavonoid pathway in the red varieties play an essential role in the grape and wine color grape total anthocyanins decreased by the impact of drought which agrees with previous reports working with red tempranillo kuhn et al 2014 zarrouk et al 2012 the increased tonality hue observed in these experiments in red tempranillo grapes from water stressed plants agrees with previous reports martínez lüscher et al 2014 and suggests a change in anthocyanin composition downey et al 2006 martínez lüscher et al 2014 grape tpi decreased by the impact of elevated temperature and by growing plants in presence of elevated co2 but with no changes in anthocyanin concentration phenolics other than anthocyanins caused obviously these decreases in the case of elevated temperature it could be ascribed to lower flavonols pastore et al 2017 when analyzing tpi no interaction between water availability and temperature was found in line with a previous report bonada et al 2015 grape veraison points out the start of the second growth phase of berries which is characterized by an activation of the encoding genes for sugar import leading to a strong increase of sugars in the grape pulp followed then by anthocyanin accumulation mainly in the skin conde et al 2007 coombe and mccarthy 2000 lecourieux et al 2014 therefore sugar and anthocyanin accumulation appear to be highly related dai et al 2014 it is generally assumed that climate change decouples sugars and anthocyanins in red grapes martínez lüscher et al 2016a 2016b decreasing the anthocyanins to sugars ratio which is widely ascribed to the increased temperature sadras and moran 2012 in our three experiments no consistent decreases in the anthocyanins to sugars ratio were observed in response to elevated temperature but decreases occurred in response to water stress due to decreases in anthocyanins finally varietal differences detected between white and red tempranillo are a key aspect of this report white tempranillo resulted of a spontaneous mutation of red tempranillo that comprised chromosomal deletions and reorganizations loosing hundreds of gens while white grapes lack at least two similar and adjacent regulatory genes due to a multi allelic mutation walker et al 2007 our experiments evidence loss of genes and or changes in their activity or regulation related to primary and secondary metabolisms within the former grape tss increased and acidity decreased and ph increased due to decreased malic and tartaric acid concentrations in white when compared to red tempranillo within the latter tpi was lower in the white variety when compared to the red one which in part at least can be due to the absence of anthocyanins also bunch fw and berry water content were higher in the white than in the red variety these findings may give clues for further research on the genetic differences between red and white tempranillo 5 conclusions the response of tempranillo yield and quality was rather variable probably due to the interactions between variety year water availability temperature and co2 in traits such as bunch fw variety year malic acid temperature co2 and variety year ph temperature co2 color density temperature water availability and total anthocyanins to tss ratio water availability year some general conclusions however can be listed within the three climate change related factors investigated drought and heat shocks in 2015 but not elevated temperature per se decreased grapevine yield of red and white tempranillo changes in berry characteristics berry size and relative skin mass impacted scarcely on grape quality climate change affected in a greater extent the technological than the phenolic maturity elevated temperature and drought consistently increased must ph due to malic acid decreases on the contrary elevated co2 decreased ph associated with consistent tartaric acid concentration increases the changes in the musts acidic properties affect its quality and potentially that of the resulting wine differences in the response of red and white tempranillo are a key aspect in this report due to lower malic and tartaric acid concentrations acidity was lower and ph higher in white than in red tempranillo in part due to the absence of anthocyanins tpi was lower in the white than in the red variety also bunch fw and berry water content were higher in the white than in red

11523,water scarcity in mediterranean climate areas will be progressively aggravated by climate change population increase and urban tourism and industrial activities to protect water resources and their integrity for future use and to improve biodiversity besides following advanced deficit irrigation strategies in fruit cultivation attention could well be directed towards what are at present underused plant materials able to withstand deficit irrigation with minimum impact on yield and fruit quality to this end the state of the art as regards deficit irrigation strategies and the response of some very interesting emerging fruit crops jujube zizyphus jujuba mill loquat eriobotrya japonica lindl pistachio pistacia vera l and pomegranate punica granatum l are reviewed the strengths and weaknesses of deficit irrigation strategies and the mechanisms developed by these emerging fruit crops in the face of water stress are discussed the response of these crops to deficit irrigation with special attention paid to the effect on yield but also on fruit quality and health related chemical compounds was analysed in order to assess their suitability for saving water in mediterranean semiarid agrosystems and to analyze their potential role as alternatives to currently cultivated fruit crops with higher water requirements finally the factors involved in establishing an identity brand hydrosos to protect fruits obtained under specific di conditions are discussed keywords jujube loquat partial root drying pistachio pomegranate regulated deficit irrigation sustained deficit irrigation underutilized crops water stress water relations 1 introduction mediterranean climate countries include not only those that border the mediterranean sea from spain to turkey and cyprus and from morocco to syria but also other regions of the planet including southern california chile south africa and southern australia all are characterized by hot dry summers mostly rainy winters and partially wet spring and autumn in these region to ensure regular crop yields and for to reduce inter annual yield variability the scarce rainfall has to be supplemented by irrigation in order to avoid plant water deficits indeed water scarcity in these sites is destined to gradually become worse because more frequent and severe droughts events driven by climate change collins et al 2009 moreover as the population increases leading to an increasing expansion of urban touristic and industrial activities tension and conflict between water users and pressures on the environment will be intensified consequently and considering that mediterranean agrosystems are very important consumers of fresh water it is of paramount importance to protect water resources and their integrity for future use katerji et al 2008 in this sense to overcome the problems associated to a boost in water prices as the discouragement of farmers and ultimately land abandonment garcía tejero et al 2014 indicated that an alternative could be to provide correct incentives for farmers to adopt changes in their irrigation methods by implementing strategies and tools for sustainable water saving among the strategies that can be applied to attain water saving are the use of improved innovative and precise deficit irrigation di management practices able to minimize the impact on crop yield and quality fernandez and torrecillas 2012 in addition in order to contribute to water saving fruit culture should be directed towards the use of plant materials that are less water demanding or able to withstand deficit irrigation with minimum impact on yield and fruit quality in this last respect it is important to consider that in human history 40 100 000 plant species have been regularly used for food fiber and for industrial cultural and medicinal purposes today at least 7000 cultivated species are in use around the world however in recent centuries agricultural systems have promoted the cultivation of a very limited number of crop species while these have been the focus of attention of commerce and scientific research world wide many crops have been relegated to the status of neglected or underutilized crop species and largely ignored padulosi et al 2001 chivenge et al 2015 in addition this reduction in the number of crop species used for food production throughout the world has a direct effect on biodiversity which is fundamental for ecosystem functioning sustainable agricultural production and the attainment of food and nutritional security toledo and burlingame 2006 chappell and lavalle 2011 therefore to improve not only biodiversity but also to saving water and hence protecting the integrity of water resources for the future it is necessary the diversification of production and consumption habits including the use of a broader range of plant species in particular those currently identified as underutilized and needing a low input of synthetic fertilisers pesticides and water this option has to be compatible with the consolidation of the cultivation of other mediterranean traditional crops such as olive almond or grapevine which are low water demanding and profitable crops in this sense in some countries during recent decades there has been a certain interest in diversifying fruit tree production by cultivating species with under exploited potential among these emerging crops many are characterized by their attractive fruits and health related qualities so that they may attract consumer attention and contribute to producer profitability for these reasons the aim of this review was to present the state of the art of deficit irrigation strategies and the response to them of some very interesting emerging fruit crops jujube zizyphus jujuba mill loquat eriobotrya japonica lindl pistachio pistacia vera l and pomegranate punica granatum l to this end the following aspects were considered i the strengths and weaknesses of deficit irrigation strategies ii the mechanisms developed by these emerging fruit crops to confront water stress and iii the response of these crops to deficit irrigation paying special attention not only to the effect on yield but also to the effect on fruit quality and health related chemical compounds 2 deficit irrigation concepts and strategies to cope with water scarcity mediterranean agrosystems are increasingly looking to more efficient technological innovation and irrigation management approaches in this respect many countries have shifted from irrigating crops in order to satisfy their evapotranspiration requirements etc or full irrigation fi the conventional norm which seeks to maximize crop yield per unit of land to deficit irrigation di strategies which involve reducing the amount of water provided to the crop during the growing season by the soil moisture stock rainfall and irrigation to a level below that needed for maximum plant growth in most of cases di induces a gradual water deficit due depletion of soil water reserves accompanied by a reduction in harvestable yields especially in soils with a significantly low water storage capacity when water scarcity is the consequence of uncontrolled factors and water supply is not guaranteed farmers find it difficult to schedule any reasonable di strategy in contrast if growers have a guaranteed water supply for their crops during the growing season it is possible to improve water productivity wp by drawing up di strategies based on scientific principles attempting to produce near maximum yields even if crops are provided with less water than they would otherwise use maintaining crop consumptive use below its potential rate in other words improving the marketable yield per unit of water used rather than attaining maximum yields kijne et al 2003 zhang 2003 complementary advantages of the same include a reduction of nutrient loss from the root zone and a decrease in excessive vegetative vigour accompanied by a lower risk of crop diseases linked to high humidity goodwin and boland 2002 ünlü et al 2006 table 1 however there is a shortage of research into the risk of soil salinization as a consequence of any decrease in the leaching of salts and the use of low quality irrigation water boland et al 1996 kaman et al 2006 table 2 three main di strategies can be mentioned sustained deficit irrigation sdi in which irrigation water used at any moment during the season is below the crop evapotranspiration etc demand and two others both based on physiological aspects of the response of plants to water deficit regulated deficit irrigation rdi and partial root zone drying prd fig 1 2 1 sustained deficit irrigation sdi at the end of 1970s trials applying irrigation water amounts below the etc demand but at very frequent intervals took place with encouraging results called deficit high frequency irrigation dhfi this strategy proved unsuccessful when little water was stored in the soil it was only possible to use dhfi and obtain maximum yields when etc was reached through the combination of irrigation water applied and soil water depletion fereres et al 1978 in fact the dhfi strategy is very similar to sdi fig 1 which is based on the idea of allotting the water deficit uniformly over the whole fruit season thus avoiding the occurrence of serious plant water deficit at any crop stage that might affect marketable yield or fruit quality or distributing the irrigation water proportionally to irrigation requirements throughout the season 2 2 regulated deficit irrigation rdi rdi works on the premise that transpiration is more sensitive to water deficit than photosynthesis and fruit growth and water deficit induced root sourced chemical signals like aba thus fruit trees cope with a reduced water supply by reducing transpiration stomata regulation or reducing leaf surface area through reducing leaf growth wilkinson and hartung 2009 in this sense fruit tree sensitivity to water deficit is not constant during the whole growing season and a water deficit during particular periods may benefit wp by increasing irrigation water savings minimizing or eliminating negative impacts on yield and crop revenue and even improving harvest quality chalmers et al 1981 mccarthy et al 2002 domingo et al 1996 table 1 therefore when a rdi strategy is applied full irrigation is supplied during the drought sensitive phenological stages critical periods of fruit trees and irrigation is limited or even unnecessary if rainfall provides a minimum supply of water during the drought tolerant phenological stages non critical periods chalmers et al 1981 mitchell and chalmers 1982 geerts and raes 2009 fig 1 stone fruit growth follows a double sigmoidal pattern with two periods of rapid growth separated by a period during which little or no expansive growth occurs the first growth period stage i is due to cell division and cell expansion stage ii is the period in which sclerification of the fruit endocarp takes place and fruit growth is extremely slow or null and stage iii is the second period of fruit growth which is rapid due to the expansion of existing cells and extends from the onset of this second growth period until maturity pome and citrus fruits show only a phase of rapid fruit growth single sigmoidal pattern which takes place after the initial period of cell division and minimal expansion and is due mainly to a cell expansion process even though some cell division may also take place at the beginning rodríguez et al 2017 in stone fruit trees two critical periods have been identified the first one corresponds to the second rapid fruit growth period stage iii when drought stress induces a reduction in yield due to the smaller fruit size at harvest and the second critical period is the early postharvest period when drought stress affects flower bud induction and or the floral differentiation processes that occur at this time this leads to a lower germination potential in the pollen of the next bloom and encourages young fruit to drop in the following season uriu 1964 ruiz sánchez et al 1999 torrecillas et al 2000 in other prunus species such as almond prunus dulcis mill d a webb flowering and rapid vegetative and fruit growth stages stages ii and iii and postharvest stage v have been reported as critical periods because water deficit affects yield goldhamer and smith 1995 goldhamer and viveros 2000 garcía tejero et al 2017 in pome and citrus fruits rapid fruit growth can be considered as a common critical period in an experiment in fino lemon citrus limon l burm fil trees over four seasons domingo et al 1996 showed that the main critical period corresponds to the rapid fruit growth phase when water deficit causes a delay in attaining marketable fruit size whereas moderate water deficit applied during flowering fruit set fruit cell division period is not critical in terms of yield in fact the effect of water deficit applied during this last phenological period on yield is related not only with the water deficit level achieved but also with the plant species in salustiana orange trees citrus sinensis l osbeck on sour orange rootstock citrus aurantium l castel and buj 1990 attained a decrease in yield of only 4 whereas ginestar and castel 1996 observed that clementina de nules citrus clementina hort ex tan on carrizo citrange citrus sinensis osb poncirus trifoliata l raf were extremely sensitive to water restrictions yield decrease during this period in very early maturing fruit trees with a very short period from fruit set to harvest and a very long post harvest phenological period deficit irrigation should be applied only during the post harvest period even though avoiding affect bud induction and floral differentiation processes torrecillas et al 2000 conejero et al 2011 taking into consideration that the effects of water deficit depend not only on the timing but also on the duration and magnitude of the same the plant water status during non critical periods has to be maintained within certain levels of water deficit in order to prevent a moderate potentially beneficial drought stress from becoming too severe and ending in reduced yield table 2 johnson et al 1992 kang and zhang 2004 in this sense problems have been found in maintaining a certain level of plant water deficit because when low amounts of irrigation water are applied adverse situations such as a sudden increase in temperature may result in severe losses of yield and quality table 2 jones 2004 other problems have been found when applying rdi in heavy and deep soils because soil water depletion and refill frequently take too long table 2 girona et al 1993 under this situation the success of rdi depends strongly on the appropriate use of microirrigation techniques and sensors able to provide real time information on soil and plant water status dichio et al 2007 ortuño et al 2009 in recent years the use of plant based water status indicators has become very popular for planning more precise irrigation programmes because it is recognized that the tree itself is the best indicator of its water status table 1 shackel et al 1997 garcía orellana et al 2007 fernandez and cuevas 2010 in this sense sensors like linear variable displacement transducers lvdts are able to measure daily trunk diameter fluctuations tdf with great precision generating sensitive parameters which strongly correlate with established plant water status parameters fernandez and cuevas 2010 ortuño et al 2010 the most common and useful tdf parameters for the irrigation scheduling of woody crops are maximum daily trunk shrinkage mds and trunk growth rate tgr ortuño et al 2010 moriana et al 2013 moreover the operational advantages of tdf measurements in adult trees such as the possibility of connecting remotely operated irrigation automatic devices and the ability to rapidly adjust schedules in response to the daily signal make them very suitable tools for precise rdi scheduling conejero et al 2011 girón et al 2015 2 3 partial root drying prd this di strategy which has also been called partial root zone irrigation can be applied through alternate furrow irrigation grimes et al 1968 and by surface and subsurface drip irrigation table 1 samadi and sepaskhah 1984 and is based on irrigating only one part of the root zone leaving another part to dry to a certain soil water content before rewetting by shifting irrigation to the dry side dry and loveys 1998 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 fig 1 the strategy is based in the idea that in prd roots sense soil drying triggering the synthesis of the plant hormone abscisic acid aba which reduces leaf expansion and stomatal conductance while simultaneously the roots of the watered side of the soil absorb sufficient water to maintain a favourable plant water status table 1 liu et al 2006a zegbe et al 2006 ahmadi et al 2010 in addition other complementary physiological responses to prd can favour stomatal closure such as lower cytokine levels stoll et al 2000 davies et al 2005 and higher xylem ph davies and zhang 1991 stoll et al 2000 other results in grapevine vitis vinifera l indicated that prd may also increase root growth dry et al 2000 currently no definitive solid criteria exist for deciding the optimum timing of irrigation for each side table 2 probably due to the diversity of factors involved such as evaporative demand soil characteristics soil water status at any precise moment crop phenological stage etc any of which may determine the plant response to wetting or drying of each side of roots saeed et al 2008 in this sense the time when soil water extraction from the dry side is negligible has been proposed as the optimum time to switch wetting from the irrigated root side to the non irrigated side kriedmann and goodwin 2003 also the threshold soil water content at which the maximum xylem aba concentration is produced was proposed by liu et al 2008 as a criterion for switching irrigation some authors showed that crops under prd gave better yields than the same crops under di when the same amount of water is applied this resulted in higher wp and even better fruit quality kriedmann and goodwin 2003 kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2006a b however wakrim et al 2005 reported no significant difference in water use efficiencies wue between prd and di but a substantial increase in wue when prd was compared with fi 3 emerging fruit crops response to deficit irrigation 3 1 jujube zizyphus jujuba mill jujube tree family rhamnaceae is native to china where it has been cultivated for more than 5000 years and to neighbouring areas of mongolia and the central asian republics with time its cultivation has spread to other regions of the world including to mediterranean countries jujube fruit is an integral part of the culture and way of life of millions of people and has also become important for many regions of the world following its introduction azam ali et al 2006 indeed it can be considered a so called functional food since it has nutritional as well as medicinal uses choi et al 2011 nevertheless until now jujube has been considered of minor importance and from a research and development point of view it has received little attention from most governments jujube is able to withstand severe drought during the growing season fig 2 a and to tolerate very low winter temperatures during its dormancy dahiya et al 1981 ming and sun 1986 ming and sun 1986 in this sense jujube trees are able to maintain leaf turgor under severe water deficit ψstem 3 0mpa essentially by developing two complementary mechanisms leaf active osmoregulation stress tolerance mechanism and the control of water loss via transpiration stress avoidance mechanism while allowing substantial gas exchange rates and as a consequence good leaf productivity ma et al 2007 cruz et al 2012 galindo et al 2016 the gradual recovery of leaf conductance after re watering previously stressed plants can also be considered as a mechanism for promoting leaf rehydration cruz et al 2012 moreover the high leaf relative apoplastic water content rwca levels and the possibility of increasing the accumulation of water in the apoplasm in response to water stress supports a steeper gradient in the water potential between the leaf and soil cruz et al 2012 galindo et al 2016 showed that in contrast with the axiom that expansive cell growth requires the presence of cell turgor no direct relation between turgor and growth rate exists in jujube fruits this could be due to an enhancement of a cell elasticity mechanism elastic adjustment which would maintain fruit turgor even at severe water stress levels by reducing fruit cell size or to the fact that jujube fruit growth depends on fruit growth effective turgor rather than just on turgor pressure these authors also reported that during most of the fruit ripening stage water can enter the fruits via the phloem rather than via the xylem this could be related with the increase in sensitivity to drought during this phenological period when moderate and severe water deficits induce a significant reduction in total marketable fruit yield number of fruits and or average fruit weight in contrast with this last idea cui et al 2008 2009 concluded that the jujube fruit maturation stage is the optimal stage to implement water deficit strategies and that while water deficit during the fruit growth slightly reduced the growth rate re watering had an over compensatory effect thus reducing the negative influence on fruit size the same authors cui et al 2008 2009 mentioned the relatively low water requirements of around 360mm and showed that jujube fruit maturation can be advanced and the fruit yield and quality enhanced if appropriate rdi is applied at certain growth stages bud burst to leafing and fruit maturation also gao et al 2014 showed that jujube fruit responded positively to irrigation practices the concentration of some taste related e g glucose fructose tss and malic acid and health related e g catechin and epicatechin compounds being generally much higher in drip irrigated fruits in this sense too collado gonzález et al 2013 demonstrated that water deficit did not affect the tendency of procyanidins to self aggregate but increased the content of procyanidins of low molecular mass table 3 improving their potential bioavailability and possible physiological effects on human health the procyanidin content of fruit from well watered trees increased during domestic cold storage whereas the fruits from trees suffering severe water stress lost some of their procyanidin content moreover in a subsequent paper collado gonzález et al 2014 pointed to a certain proportionality in the response of jujube fruits to moderate and severe deficit irrigation during fruit maturation so when plants were exposed to moderate water deficit ψstem from 1 40 to 2 28mpa during this phenological period there was no change in fruit size moisture content firmness or fruit peel and flesh colour compared with fully irrigated trees only when a more severe water stress ψstem from 1 40 to 3 14mpa was reached there were significant increases in the sucrose and arabinose contents measured table 3 in addition the response of fruit amino acids to water deficit was not as sensitive as expected since there was no direct relationship with the magnitude of the water deficit however the decrease in fruit asparagine content as a result of severer water deficit is a positive aspect because this amino acid is the major precursor of acrylamide a potentially toxic compound formed during the heat processing of some plant foods however severe water deficit produced smaller fruit with a lower moisture content and yield accompanied by changes in firmness and peel and flesh colour 3 2 loquat eriobotrya japonica lindl loquat is a subtropical evergreen tree that belongs to the family rosaceae subtribe pyrinae formerly subfamily maloideae potter et al 2007 some of the common names of loquat include japanese plum japanese medlar maltese plum etc it is considered indigenous to southeastern china and possibly southern japan because it is said to have been cultivated there for over 1000 years actually more than 30 countries in subtropical and mild temperate regions of the world are cultivating selections of loquat cultivars performed during the 19th century feng et al 2007 ferreres et al 2009 he et al 2011 it is important to point out that loquat is characterized by an unusual phenology that makes it different of the traditional temperate fruit crops it blooms in autumn on apical panicles formed on current year wood developing fruits during winter and ripening in early spring fig 2b moreover this fruit as other pomes presents a sigmoidal pattern of fruit growth dennis 1988 cuevas et al 2003 and arrives at markets before any other spring fruit cuevas et al 2007a hueso and cuevas 2008 research on mechanisms developed by loquat plant to resist drought is very scarce mainly at plant water relations levels diurnal and seasonal gas exchange values in loquat plants respond to changes in plant water status and to changes in evaporative demand showing minimum values in summer moreover the diurnal trend of photosynthetic rate in loquat at least during autumn and winter was characterized by a double picked curve suggesting the predominance of genotype over the environmental factors on the loquat gas exchange behaviour stellfeldt et al 2011 because this last behaviour diverges from that indicated for woody mediterranean vegetation which is characterized by a maximum value in the morning declining towards midday and remaining more or less constant afterward recently zhang et al 2015 observed some loquat drought stress tolerance mechanisms i the increase in chlorophyll content which can enhances photosynthesis under water deficit ii the increase in the content of soluble sugars and proline of roots which increased the osmotic adjustment and the favourable water potential gradient for water into the roots iii the increase in the aba content of leaves which induced the stomata closing and improved the water use efficiency and iv the increase in the levels of antioxidant enzyme activities mainly at leaf level the ability of loquat plants to develop leaf active osmoregulation was earlier suggested by garcía legaz et al 2005 who studied the effect of salinity on the water relations of loquat plants on two different rootstocks luo et al 2007 studied the response of two different loquat cultivars to water deficit and concluded that changhong no 3 the more water deficit resistant cultivar responds to water deficit with a higher increase in stomatal density and reducing stomatal size than jiefangzhong cultivar in addition in jiefangzhong cultivar leaf photosynthetic pigment concentrations decrease in response to drought stress while in changhong no 3 the concentrations of photosynthetic pigments increased markedly under light drought stress hueso and cuevas 2008 estimated relatively high loquat water needs of around 724mm and demonstrated observing the long term response of this crop to postharvest rdi that this crop can be considered as a model for the continuous application of rdi strategies mainly for the economic benefits of saving water during summer increasing fruit size and grading and fruit value and gross revenue without affecting yield hueso and cuevas 2008 cuevas et al 2009 this positive response of loquat to rdi is based in two main facts the clear separation between vegetative and reproductive growth allowing the application of postharvest rdi without affecting fruit growth and the improving of fruit value when postharvest rdi is applied because important advancing harvest time in the next season can be achieved in this sense the most profitable rdi strategy is the complete suppression of watering from around one month after the end of previous harvest early june up to reach a ψstem value circa 2 2mpa 8 9 weeks because do not alter the formation of the floral organs and increase the advancement of bloom next season cuevas et al 2007a b 2009 2012 while prolonging the water deficit period during one additional month august may impair flower development in loquat rodríguez et al 2007 due to the fact that research on loquat response to rdi has been always focusses on fruit earliness due to its enormous importance in loquat price and commercialization and the high susceptibility of mature loquat fruits to mechanical damage during harvest and postharvest handling to the best of our knowledge do not exist publications on the effect of deficit irrigation on loquat quality since loquat is a non climacteric fruit premature picking is inadvisable because fruits are excessively acid and taste unpalatable to consumers thus research has been focussed to stablish fruit maturity indices in order to optimize harvesting pinillos et al 2011 suggested that at every picking date only those fruits with a skin colour that corresponds to a minimum tss and tss ta values should be harvested especially at the earliest harvests of the season also a tss ta of 0 7 was previously proposed as minimum value for harvest pinillos et al 2007 recently cañete et al 2015 showed the consumers preference for light orange skin fruits rather than fully ripe ones due to their greater firmness fewer skin defects and better balance between sweetness and acidity and proposed harvesting loquat fruits with a minimum value of tss of 10 brix and a tss ta ratio close to 1 0 to guarantee eating quality and consumer satisfaction 3 3 pistachio pistacia vera l pistachio tree is native to western asia and asia minor from syria to the caucasus and afghanistan they are mentioned in the old testament archaeological evidence from turkey indicates that the nuts were being used for food as early as 7000 b c pistachio is a member of the anacardiaceae or cashew family and is the only commercially edible nut among the eleven species in the genus pistacia and by far the most economically important the pistachio was introduced into italy from syria early in the first century a d and subsequently its cultivation spread to other mediterranean countries pistachio trees are considered one of the most drought resistant fruit species because they can survive under extreme drought conditions spiegel roy et al 1977 observed that under desert conditions pistachio trees were able to differentiate sufficient flower buds to provide an appreciable yield and that roots were uniformly spread down to a depth of 2 40 m even if soil moisture in all the horizons was below the permanent wilting point of soil related with this last characteristic some authors e g lin et al 1984 and germana 1997 suggested that pistachio drought resistance mainly depends on extensive root system development because despite it commonly being though a xerophyte it does not present the morphological characteristic of such in the leaves showing instead high values of net photosynthesis pn and leaf conductance gleaf furthermore the leaves can be considered as isolaterals since their upper and lower pages are structurally similar with almost identical stomatal density and conductance also kanber et al 1993 showed that root activity is confined to shallower soil depths in short interval irrigation conditions another singularity of pistachio trees is that both yield and the water stress level regulate the flower bud drop that occurs before the beginning of kernel growth so the following year s pistachio yield can decrease considerably as a consequence of a higher percentage of flower buds dropped i in years of higher yield or ii when a severe water deficit during fruit stage ii takes place pérez lópez et al 2017 pistachio plants exposed to water stress also develop stress avoidance and stress tolerance mechanisms as regard the first sort of mechanism during pistachio fruit stages i and ii fig 2c when the soil water content is quite high and the evaporative demand of the atmosphere is low these plants show higher pn and gleaf values in contrast during fruit stage iii at which the evaporative demand of the atmosphere is higher the pistachio plants show lower pn and gleaf values n et al 2011 b memmi et al 2016a b when plants are under water deficit gleaf values decrease in order to limit water loss through transpiration and at very pronounced levels of water deficit the daily pattern of gleaf is modified showing maximum values in the early morning and decreasing gradually whereas pn values remain fairly constant until sunset because this parameter is less sensitive to water deficit than gleaf d pérez lópez unpublished data in this respect behboudian et al 1986 established that pistachio plants are able to continue their photosynthetic activity even when ψleaf reaches extremely low values of 5 0 to 6 0mpa moreover this crop has an outstanding capability for leaf thermoregulation even at sever water stress levels because pistachio canopies can transpire water at rates far higher than those normally found in mesophytes and are able to rapidly compensate water losses without showing visible stress condition symptoms germana 1997 in addition when previously water stressed plants are re watered the gradual and slow recovery of the plant water status observed can be considered as a mechanism for promoting leaf rehydration memmi et al 2016b as regard the development of stress tolerance mechanisms gijón et al 2011 identified changes in the leaf bulk modulus of elasticity during pit hardening stage ii and active osmotic adjustment at any phenological period similarly behboudian et al 1986 showed that pistachio plants at a ψleaf value of 6 0mpa exhibited very high ψp values 3 0mpa pistachio s water relations are significantly affected by rootstock according to gijón et al 2010 the hybrid from crossbreeding p atlantica desf p vera l may be the best rootstock for adequately irrigated pistachios since it induces the highest leaf conductance and vigour whereas in rainfed or deficit irrigated conditions p terebinthus might be a good choice for its drought tolerance as it is able to maintain a greater leaf area than non stressed plants with lower ψstem and gleaf values however in contrast with these results and the widespread belief memmi et al 2016b suggested that p atlantica could be a suitable rootstock for deficit irrigated plants because of its reputation for being very resistant to water stress pistachio is mainly cultivated worldwide under rain fed conditions despite the good crop performance under these dryland conditions there is a clear tendency to increase the area dedicated to irrigation because the benefits derived from irrigation in this crop are probably higher than in other crops irrigation increases yield nut size and splitting reduces the alternate bearing pattern and incidence of blank nuts but has no effect on the hull to kernel ratio monastra et al 1998 ak and agackesen 2006 sedaghati and alipour 2006 suggested that early hull splitting a process that decreases the quality of the yield because the kernel is exposed to invasion by fungi and insects is related with plant water status from late april to early june however gijón et al 2009 suggested that early splitting incidence is not related to plant water status but to temperatures below 13 c pistachio s irrigation water requirements are quite high varying from 547 to 600mm when calculated according to memmi et al 2016b or kermani and salehi 2006 to 842 1000mm when calculated according to testi et al 2008 or goldhamer 1995 taking into account that water is a scarce resource and in future only the most efficient agricultural systems will receive inputs of irrigation water fereres et al 2003 studies into optimizing pistachio deficit irrigation strategies are in progress for example memmi et al 2014 studied the pistachio response to different levels of water deficit and time of application concluding that irrigation when kernel weight is increasing stage iii results in a higher fruit size than when the same amount of irrigation water is distributed between stages i rapid nut growth and iii moreover these authors showed that shell hardening stage ii starts when the fruit reaches its maximum external diameter and finishes a short time before the kernel reach its final weight both processes being simultaneous at the end of hardening and beginning of kernel growth gijón et al 2009 showed that sdi provided at 50 and 65 of the fully irrigated trees during the growing season reduced total yield and kernel size even though differences in kernel dry weight were unaffected memmi et al 2016b showed that rdi during stage ii or postharvest does not reduce yield even though it may reduce tree vegetative growth these authors also indicated that full irrigation and rdi in pistachio trees growing in shallow soils can be successfully scheduled using ψstem measurements hence rdi using a ψstem threshold value of 1 5mpa during stage ii induced similar yield and production values to full irrigated trees whereas a ψstem threshold value of 2 0mpa resulted in an extensive delay in the recovery of gleaf values with concomitant negative effects on long term pistachio production guerrero et al 2005 studied the recovery of pistachio water relations under rdi and concluded that in order to avoid any adverse effect of water deficit during stage iii irrigation should be increased toward the end of stage ii or be clearly higher than 100 etc from the beginning of stage iii pérez lópez et al 2017 showed that stages i and iii are critical because water deficit reduces the quantity and quality of the yield however the effects of different water stress levels at each stage have not been sufficiently studied in this sense rdi trees receiving 50 of the water received by control trees during stages i and ii and the same amount of water as control trees during stage iii provided a similar total yield and percentage of split nuts as full irrigated trees and did not show an alternate bearing pattern even though they received around 20 less water gijón et al 2009 okay and sevin 2011a b studied the effect of irrigation on some pistachio fruit characteristics and concluded that differences among cultivars were more significant under non irrigated conditions irrigation increased kernel weight but did not have a significant impact on shell and kernel colours guerrero et al 2005 carbonell barrachina et al 2014 showed that the more severe the water stress level achieved during stage ii the harder and crunchier the resulting pistachios the kernel fatty acid content of pistachio is also affected by plant water status okay and sevin 2011a the oleic acid content increasing and the linoleic acid content decreasing in fruits of well irrigated trees in contrast carbonell barrachina et al 2014 indicated that the fatty acid profile of pistachios is dominated by three main compounds oleic acid 50 linoleic acid 33 and palmitic acid 13 and showed table 3 that moderate rdi during stage ii significantly increased the oil content of the nuts whereas more severe rdi reduced the oil content inducing in both cases a significant increase in the content of linoleic acid which is an essential fatty acid for humans these authors also studied the effect of rdi on pistachio volatile compounds and concluded that severe rdi during stage ii increased the contents of aldehydes associated with green and vegetable notes and reduce those of pyrazines nut and toasted notes and terpenes citric notes table 3 a descriptive analysis of pistachios showed that moderate rdi during stage ii leads to an intense green pistachio colour accompanied by higher intensities of nutty and pistachio notes in harder crunchier nuts with a longer aftertaste also an international consumer study about the opinion of european consumers on pistachios grown under rdi indicated that the kernels resulting from moderate rdi applied during stage ii obtained a higher intensities of characteristic sensory attributes and a greater level of satisfaction among international consumers than kernels from fi trees or from those exposed to severe rdi during stage ii carbonell barrachina et al 2014 noguera artiaga et al 2016 3 4 pomegranate punica granatum l pomegranate one of the oldest known edible fruits and one of the seven kinds of fruit mentioned in the bible is mainly grown in semi arid mild temperate to subtropical climates blumenfeld et al 2000 this species and punica protopunica are the two species that make up the punicaceae family p granatum is believed to be a native to the southern caspian belt iran and northern turkey whereas p protopunica is generally accepted as being endemic of the socotra island yemen janick 2007 pomegranate is considered to be a drought resistant crop because it supports heat and thrives in arid and semiarid areas even under desert conditions aseri et al 2008 the mechanisms developed by this crop to confront water stress being mainly stress avoidance and stress tolerance rodríguez et al 2012 more precisely from the beginning of water deficit conditions leaf conductance decreases in order to control water loss via transpiration and to avoid leaf turgor loss stress avoidance mechanism and when sever water stress levels are reached active osmotic adjustment is triggered contributing to the maintenance of leaf turgor stress tolerance mechanism other drought tolerance characteristics commonly seen in xeromorphic plants can be also observed in pomegranate such as a high relative apoplastic water content 42 58 which would contribute to the retention of water at low leaf water potentials rodríguez et al 2012 despite its good resistance to drought pomegranate for commercial production requires regular irrigation throughout the season especially when it is cultivated in arid and semiarid areas to reduce the incidence of fruit physiopathies e g fruit splitting galindo et al 2014b rodríguez et al 2017 and to reach optimal growth yield and fruit quality levin 2006 holland et al 2009 in this sense the period corresponding to the end of pomegranate fruit growth and ripening is clearly critical for the incidence of fruit splitting galindo et al 2014b showed that at very severe water deficit levels despite leaf turgor being maintained fruit turgor is lost inducing a reduction in fruit expansion then when an important rainfall event takes place previously water stressed pomegranate fruits are rehydrated asymmetrically because aril turgor increases to a much greater extent than peel turgor the pressure of the arils on the peel favouring splitting intrigliolo et al 2013 estimated pomegranate evapotranspiration to be around 412 514mm but reports on the effect of irrigation management on pomegranate fruit yield and quality are relatively scarce the first results indicated that it is possible to control the desired ripening time in pomegranates by applying different irrigation regimes sonawane and desai 1989 recently galindo et al 2014a indicated that sdi applied throughout the pomegranate season to achieve pronounced water deficit levels reduces total yield per tree the number of fruits per tree and the size of the fruits however such a strategy can bring forward the availability of fruits resulting from late flowerings which despite their smaller size are of great interest for the pomegranate transformation industry due to their very high content of bioactive compounds in contrast other studies mention ambiguous results concerning the effect of sdi on the chemical characteristics of pomegranate fruit in this sense mellisho et al 2012 concluded that sdi under moderate water stress produced some changes in colour and chemical characteristics which reflected earlier ripening however mena et al 2013 indicated that pomegranate juice from trees submitted to sdi regimes that produce severe water stress levels was of lower quality and less healthy than the juice from fully irrigated trees this reduction in quality was due to the fact that the water stress levels caused a dramatic decrease in bioactive phenolic compounds especially anthocyanins and punicalagin table 3 besides the pomegranates were less attractive for consumers due to their pale red colour on the other hand laribi et al 2013 showed that pomegranates from sdi trees submitted to mild water stress during flowering and fruit set and more severe water stress during the linear stage of fruit growth and ripening had a redder peel and higher level of total soluble solids in the juice intrigliolo et al 2013 and laribi et al 2013 studied the pomegranate response to rdi involving irrigation water restrictions during different fruit stages and concluded that the period comprised by flowering and fruit set could be regarded as non critical from the yield point of view and that irrigation water restriction during pomegranate fruit growth and ripening enhances peel redness and tss in the juice however restricting the irrigation water during the linear fruit growth period increased the concentration of many bioactive compounds in the juice such as anthocyanins that are related to health and taste recently galindo et al 2017 showed that a short period of irrigation restriction at the end of ripening period brings the harvest time forward saves irrigation water enhances the fruit bioactive compounds content anthocyanins phenolic compounds punicalagin and ellagic acid and increases the price of the fruit without affecting marketable yield and fruit size studies on the response of pomegranate trees to prd have been performed by parvizi et al 2014 2016 and parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 these authors compared the following strategies sdi 50 and 75 of etc irrigating only one side of trees north throughout the growing season and keeping the other side south of the tree dry prd 50 and 75 of etc and fi maintaining both sides of the tree wetted the first authors showed that both sdi strategies and prd at 50 etc induced a decrease in pomegranate yield and recommended prd 75 etc because in addition to saving water yield intrinsic water use efficiency wue and transpiration efficiency increased as regard pomegranate fruit quality attributes parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 indicated that both prd strategies increased the pomegranate fruit juice content and maturity index and decreased the titratable acidity values compared with fi fruits while the response of fruits to both sdi strategies was the opposite of that observed in response to prd deficit irrigation can be considered as a tool that significantly improves the postharvest performance of pomegranate several authors reported that the fruits resulting from sdi and rdi treatments showed better postharvest behaviour than those from fi because of retarded chilling injury incidence peña et al 2013 higher sensory and nutritional quality and longer shelf life laribi et al 2013 peña et al 2013 peña estévez et al 2016 moreover in a study of the effect of different irrigation treatments and the efficacy of a vapour treatment 7 10s at 95 c and using naclo as sanitizing agents on the quality and shelf life of fresh cut pomegranate arils peña estévez et al 2015 observed a synergistic effect of the water deficit treatment and the postharvest thermal treatment best results were obtained for arils from pomegranates grown on trees from which irrigation was withheld for 16 or 26days prior to harvest for which a shelf life of 18days at 5 c was established 4 summary conclusions and future research needs bearing in mind the characteristics of the emerging crops considered in this review it is clear that they present different mechanisms to confront water deficit situations and that different levels of resistance are achieved in this sense pistachio trees can be considered the most drought resistant because they can survive under very extreme drought conditions their water stress resistance is based on morphological characteristics such as a very extensive root system and the development of stress avoidance and tolerance mechanisms pomegranate and jujube trees are also able to withstand severe drought during the growing season and the mechanisms developed by these crops to confront drought are also predominantly stress avoidance and stress tolerance mechanisms in contrast an entirely different strategy to confront water deficit is shown by loquat its loquat strategy can be considered as a drought escape mechanism because it is based on an atypical phenology completely different from that of traditional mediterranean temperate fruit crops blooming in autumn developing fruits during winter and ripening in early spring so fruit growth accounts when mediterranean climate is wetter and evaporative demand of the atmosphere reaches minimum values thus avoiding the effects of hot and dry summers the irrigation water requirements of these emerging crops were not related with the resistance to water stress so loquat trees presented the highest seasonal etc which was slightly higher than that observed in pistachio and pomegranate trees and clearly higher than that observed in jujube trees it is clear that loquat can be considered an outstanding crop for its response to the continuous application of rdi but there are good reasons to conclude that the other emerging crops studied are able to cope with water scarcity due to their positive response to di strategies including minimal impact on yields and improved wp taking into consideration the effect of di strategies on fruit quality and the health related compounds they contain it is important to underline that research needs to be directed at some very important aspects including i the effect of deficit irrigation on loquat fruit quality for which to the best of our knowledge no information exists and ii identifying the optimal water deficit level its timing and duration for each crop in order to optimize fruit quality and their health related compounds content this last consideration is based on the fact that the literature in most cases suggests that fruit quality and the health related compounds content can be improved by specific di strategies but fruit response to moderate and severe water deficit is not proportional in many cases it is not possible to establish a linear correlation between water stress and some fruit characteristics especially in the case of some secondary metabolites mattson and haack 1987 gobbo neto and lopes 2007 in an attempt to predict the concentration of phenolic compounds as a function of water status horner 1990 proposed a model based on a quadratic relationship between both variables fig 3 when plants are under mild osmotic stress there is a reduction in plant growth and the concentration of non nitrogenous secondary metabolites increase when plants are under severe water stress strong stomatal regulation takes place and co2 assimilation is much reduced carbon is preferentially allocated to the synthesis of primary metabolites which do not exceed the amount used for fruit growth and to the detriment of the synthesis of carbon based secondary metabolites fig 3 bearing in mind all the previous considerations it is evident that farmers who adopt specific di strategies and cultivate underutilized plant species should be rewarded for i making sustainable use of irrigation water ii improving crop biodiversity iii having to accept a slight reduction in their fruit and vegetable yields and iv producing fruits with higher contents of bioactive compounds fortunately consumers are willing to pay for special foods particularly those associated with environmental friendly farming practices that use no chemicals martínez ruiz and gómez cantó 2016 which is the case of the fruits and vegetables grown under di however consumers need to identify such products which should be clearly labeled and displayed separate from other products of the same type otherwise their potential will be lost in a sea of products very few groups have studied consumer opinion concerning di fruits lopez et al 2016 fernandes silva et al 2013 but noguera artiaga et al 2016 even proposed an identity brand to protect this type of product which might be called hydrosostainable or in abbreviated and easier to remember form hydrosos according to these authors hydrosos products will have a solid identity based on two main factors i water deficit can increase the plant secondary metabolite content and thus the functionality of the edible products ripoll et al 2014 and ii the products are environmentally friendly because of the sustainable use of a very scarce resource water fig 4 noguera artiaga et al 2016 also found that consumers are willing to pay a reasonably higher price for hydrosos pistachios if they are properly labeled and identified however further research is needed to check whether this greater willingness to pay is the similar for all fruits finally it is essential to establish a hydrosos index to certify that the products using the hydrosos logo have been evaluated for their sustainable use of irrigation water and or their contents of bioactive compounds this index is under construction and will be based among other factors on farmers and traders being able to demonstrate i knowledge of the cultural practices involved including water management during the non critical periods ii the timing level and duration of the applied water deficit iii that suitable monitoring and control of the stress applied has taken place by measuring for example the water potential v the precise composition and contents of bioactive compounds e g increased levels of proline an amino acid used as indicator of plant water stress and vi the good sensory quality of the product in question if these rules are followed it should be possible to ensure consumer satisfaction strengthen their willingness to pay a reasonably higher price and guarantee their future fidelity to these products fig 4 if the index can guarantee all the above consumer demand will increase as will the price of hydrosos products and the possible profit for farmers hopefully farmers will become increasingly convinced about the economic benefits of di and dedicate larger areas to the cultivation of even more crops acknowledgments on the occasion of the

11523,water scarcity in mediterranean climate areas will be progressively aggravated by climate change population increase and urban tourism and industrial activities to protect water resources and their integrity for future use and to improve biodiversity besides following advanced deficit irrigation strategies in fruit cultivation attention could well be directed towards what are at present underused plant materials able to withstand deficit irrigation with minimum impact on yield and fruit quality to this end the state of the art as regards deficit irrigation strategies and the response of some very interesting emerging fruit crops jujube zizyphus jujuba mill loquat eriobotrya japonica lindl pistachio pistacia vera l and pomegranate punica granatum l are reviewed the strengths and weaknesses of deficit irrigation strategies and the mechanisms developed by these emerging fruit crops in the face of water stress are discussed the response of these crops to deficit irrigation with special attention paid to the effect on yield but also on fruit quality and health related chemical compounds was analysed in order to assess their suitability for saving water in mediterranean semiarid agrosystems and to analyze their potential role as alternatives to currently cultivated fruit crops with higher water requirements finally the factors involved in establishing an identity brand hydrosos to protect fruits obtained under specific di conditions are discussed keywords jujube loquat partial root drying pistachio pomegranate regulated deficit irrigation sustained deficit irrigation underutilized crops water stress water relations 1 introduction mediterranean climate countries include not only those that border the mediterranean sea from spain to turkey and cyprus and from morocco to syria but also other regions of the planet including southern california chile south africa and southern australia all are characterized by hot dry summers mostly rainy winters and partially wet spring and autumn in these region to ensure regular crop yields and for to reduce inter annual yield variability the scarce rainfall has to be supplemented by irrigation in order to avoid plant water deficits indeed water scarcity in these sites is destined to gradually become worse because more frequent and severe droughts events driven by climate change collins et al 2009 moreover as the population increases leading to an increasing expansion of urban touristic and industrial activities tension and conflict between water users and pressures on the environment will be intensified consequently and considering that mediterranean agrosystems are very important consumers of fresh water it is of paramount importance to protect water resources and their integrity for future use katerji et al 2008 in this sense to overcome the problems associated to a boost in water prices as the discouragement of farmers and ultimately land abandonment garcía tejero et al 2014 indicated that an alternative could be to provide correct incentives for farmers to adopt changes in their irrigation methods by implementing strategies and tools for sustainable water saving among the strategies that can be applied to attain water saving are the use of improved innovative and precise deficit irrigation di management practices able to minimize the impact on crop yield and quality fernandez and torrecillas 2012 in addition in order to contribute to water saving fruit culture should be directed towards the use of plant materials that are less water demanding or able to withstand deficit irrigation with minimum impact on yield and fruit quality in this last respect it is important to consider that in human history 40 100 000 plant species have been regularly used for food fiber and for industrial cultural and medicinal purposes today at least 7000 cultivated species are in use around the world however in recent centuries agricultural systems have promoted the cultivation of a very limited number of crop species while these have been the focus of attention of commerce and scientific research world wide many crops have been relegated to the status of neglected or underutilized crop species and largely ignored padulosi et al 2001 chivenge et al 2015 in addition this reduction in the number of crop species used for food production throughout the world has a direct effect on biodiversity which is fundamental for ecosystem functioning sustainable agricultural production and the attainment of food and nutritional security toledo and burlingame 2006 chappell and lavalle 2011 therefore to improve not only biodiversity but also to saving water and hence protecting the integrity of water resources for the future it is necessary the diversification of production and consumption habits including the use of a broader range of plant species in particular those currently identified as underutilized and needing a low input of synthetic fertilisers pesticides and water this option has to be compatible with the consolidation of the cultivation of other mediterranean traditional crops such as olive almond or grapevine which are low water demanding and profitable crops in this sense in some countries during recent decades there has been a certain interest in diversifying fruit tree production by cultivating species with under exploited potential among these emerging crops many are characterized by their attractive fruits and health related qualities so that they may attract consumer attention and contribute to producer profitability for these reasons the aim of this review was to present the state of the art of deficit irrigation strategies and the response to them of some very interesting emerging fruit crops jujube zizyphus jujuba mill loquat eriobotrya japonica lindl pistachio pistacia vera l and pomegranate punica granatum l to this end the following aspects were considered i the strengths and weaknesses of deficit irrigation strategies ii the mechanisms developed by these emerging fruit crops to confront water stress and iii the response of these crops to deficit irrigation paying special attention not only to the effect on yield but also to the effect on fruit quality and health related chemical compounds 2 deficit irrigation concepts and strategies to cope with water scarcity mediterranean agrosystems are increasingly looking to more efficient technological innovation and irrigation management approaches in this respect many countries have shifted from irrigating crops in order to satisfy their evapotranspiration requirements etc or full irrigation fi the conventional norm which seeks to maximize crop yield per unit of land to deficit irrigation di strategies which involve reducing the amount of water provided to the crop during the growing season by the soil moisture stock rainfall and irrigation to a level below that needed for maximum plant growth in most of cases di induces a gradual water deficit due depletion of soil water reserves accompanied by a reduction in harvestable yields especially in soils with a significantly low water storage capacity when water scarcity is the consequence of uncontrolled factors and water supply is not guaranteed farmers find it difficult to schedule any reasonable di strategy in contrast if growers have a guaranteed water supply for their crops during the growing season it is possible to improve water productivity wp by drawing up di strategies based on scientific principles attempting to produce near maximum yields even if crops are provided with less water than they would otherwise use maintaining crop consumptive use below its potential rate in other words improving the marketable yield per unit of water used rather than attaining maximum yields kijne et al 2003 zhang 2003 complementary advantages of the same include a reduction of nutrient loss from the root zone and a decrease in excessive vegetative vigour accompanied by a lower risk of crop diseases linked to high humidity goodwin and boland 2002 ünlü et al 2006 table 1 however there is a shortage of research into the risk of soil salinization as a consequence of any decrease in the leaching of salts and the use of low quality irrigation water boland et al 1996 kaman et al 2006 table 2 three main di strategies can be mentioned sustained deficit irrigation sdi in which irrigation water used at any moment during the season is below the crop evapotranspiration etc demand and two others both based on physiological aspects of the response of plants to water deficit regulated deficit irrigation rdi and partial root zone drying prd fig 1 2 1 sustained deficit irrigation sdi at the end of 1970s trials applying irrigation water amounts below the etc demand but at very frequent intervals took place with encouraging results called deficit high frequency irrigation dhfi this strategy proved unsuccessful when little water was stored in the soil it was only possible to use dhfi and obtain maximum yields when etc was reached through the combination of irrigation water applied and soil water depletion fereres et al 1978 in fact the dhfi strategy is very similar to sdi fig 1 which is based on the idea of allotting the water deficit uniformly over the whole fruit season thus avoiding the occurrence of serious plant water deficit at any crop stage that might affect marketable yield or fruit quality or distributing the irrigation water proportionally to irrigation requirements throughout the season 2 2 regulated deficit irrigation rdi rdi works on the premise that transpiration is more sensitive to water deficit than photosynthesis and fruit growth and water deficit induced root sourced chemical signals like aba thus fruit trees cope with a reduced water supply by reducing transpiration stomata regulation or reducing leaf surface area through reducing leaf growth wilkinson and hartung 2009 in this sense fruit tree sensitivity to water deficit is not constant during the whole growing season and a water deficit during particular periods may benefit wp by increasing irrigation water savings minimizing or eliminating negative impacts on yield and crop revenue and even improving harvest quality chalmers et al 1981 mccarthy et al 2002 domingo et al 1996 table 1 therefore when a rdi strategy is applied full irrigation is supplied during the drought sensitive phenological stages critical periods of fruit trees and irrigation is limited or even unnecessary if rainfall provides a minimum supply of water during the drought tolerant phenological stages non critical periods chalmers et al 1981 mitchell and chalmers 1982 geerts and raes 2009 fig 1 stone fruit growth follows a double sigmoidal pattern with two periods of rapid growth separated by a period during which little or no expansive growth occurs the first growth period stage i is due to cell division and cell expansion stage ii is the period in which sclerification of the fruit endocarp takes place and fruit growth is extremely slow or null and stage iii is the second period of fruit growth which is rapid due to the expansion of existing cells and extends from the onset of this second growth period until maturity pome and citrus fruits show only a phase of rapid fruit growth single sigmoidal pattern which takes place after the initial period of cell division and minimal expansion and is due mainly to a cell expansion process even though some cell division may also take place at the beginning rodríguez et al 2017 in stone fruit trees two critical periods have been identified the first one corresponds to the second rapid fruit growth period stage iii when drought stress induces a reduction in yield due to the smaller fruit size at harvest and the second critical period is the early postharvest period when drought stress affects flower bud induction and or the floral differentiation processes that occur at this time this leads to a lower germination potential in the pollen of the next bloom and encourages young fruit to drop in the following season uriu 1964 ruiz sánchez et al 1999 torrecillas et al 2000 in other prunus species such as almond prunus dulcis mill d a webb flowering and rapid vegetative and fruit growth stages stages ii and iii and postharvest stage v have been reported as critical periods because water deficit affects yield goldhamer and smith 1995 goldhamer and viveros 2000 garcía tejero et al 2017 in pome and citrus fruits rapid fruit growth can be considered as a common critical period in an experiment in fino lemon citrus limon l burm fil trees over four seasons domingo et al 1996 showed that the main critical period corresponds to the rapid fruit growth phase when water deficit causes a delay in attaining marketable fruit size whereas moderate water deficit applied during flowering fruit set fruit cell division period is not critical in terms of yield in fact the effect of water deficit applied during this last phenological period on yield is related not only with the water deficit level achieved but also with the plant species in salustiana orange trees citrus sinensis l osbeck on sour orange rootstock citrus aurantium l castel and buj 1990 attained a decrease in yield of only 4 whereas ginestar and castel 1996 observed that clementina de nules citrus clementina hort ex tan on carrizo citrange citrus sinensis osb poncirus trifoliata l raf were extremely sensitive to water restrictions yield decrease during this period in very early maturing fruit trees with a very short period from fruit set to harvest and a very long post harvest phenological period deficit irrigation should be applied only during the post harvest period even though avoiding affect bud induction and floral differentiation processes torrecillas et al 2000 conejero et al 2011 taking into consideration that the effects of water deficit depend not only on the timing but also on the duration and magnitude of the same the plant water status during non critical periods has to be maintained within certain levels of water deficit in order to prevent a moderate potentially beneficial drought stress from becoming too severe and ending in reduced yield table 2 johnson et al 1992 kang and zhang 2004 in this sense problems have been found in maintaining a certain level of plant water deficit because when low amounts of irrigation water are applied adverse situations such as a sudden increase in temperature may result in severe losses of yield and quality table 2 jones 2004 other problems have been found when applying rdi in heavy and deep soils because soil water depletion and refill frequently take too long table 2 girona et al 1993 under this situation the success of rdi depends strongly on the appropriate use of microirrigation techniques and sensors able to provide real time information on soil and plant water status dichio et al 2007 ortuño et al 2009 in recent years the use of plant based water status indicators has become very popular for planning more precise irrigation programmes because it is recognized that the tree itself is the best indicator of its water status table 1 shackel et al 1997 garcía orellana et al 2007 fernandez and cuevas 2010 in this sense sensors like linear variable displacement transducers lvdts are able to measure daily trunk diameter fluctuations tdf with great precision generating sensitive parameters which strongly correlate with established plant water status parameters fernandez and cuevas 2010 ortuño et al 2010 the most common and useful tdf parameters for the irrigation scheduling of woody crops are maximum daily trunk shrinkage mds and trunk growth rate tgr ortuño et al 2010 moriana et al 2013 moreover the operational advantages of tdf measurements in adult trees such as the possibility of connecting remotely operated irrigation automatic devices and the ability to rapidly adjust schedules in response to the daily signal make them very suitable tools for precise rdi scheduling conejero et al 2011 girón et al 2015 2 3 partial root drying prd this di strategy which has also been called partial root zone irrigation can be applied through alternate furrow irrigation grimes et al 1968 and by surface and subsurface drip irrigation table 1 samadi and sepaskhah 1984 and is based on irrigating only one part of the root zone leaving another part to dry to a certain soil water content before rewetting by shifting irrigation to the dry side dry and loveys 1998 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 fig 1 the strategy is based in the idea that in prd roots sense soil drying triggering the synthesis of the plant hormone abscisic acid aba which reduces leaf expansion and stomatal conductance while simultaneously the roots of the watered side of the soil absorb sufficient water to maintain a favourable plant water status table 1 liu et al 2006a zegbe et al 2006 ahmadi et al 2010 in addition other complementary physiological responses to prd can favour stomatal closure such as lower cytokine levels stoll et al 2000 davies et al 2005 and higher xylem ph davies and zhang 1991 stoll et al 2000 other results in grapevine vitis vinifera l indicated that prd may also increase root growth dry et al 2000 currently no definitive solid criteria exist for deciding the optimum timing of irrigation for each side table 2 probably due to the diversity of factors involved such as evaporative demand soil characteristics soil water status at any precise moment crop phenological stage etc any of which may determine the plant response to wetting or drying of each side of roots saeed et al 2008 in this sense the time when soil water extraction from the dry side is negligible has been proposed as the optimum time to switch wetting from the irrigated root side to the non irrigated side kriedmann and goodwin 2003 also the threshold soil water content at which the maximum xylem aba concentration is produced was proposed by liu et al 2008 as a criterion for switching irrigation some authors showed that crops under prd gave better yields than the same crops under di when the same amount of water is applied this resulted in higher wp and even better fruit quality kriedmann and goodwin 2003 kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2006a b however wakrim et al 2005 reported no significant difference in water use efficiencies wue between prd and di but a substantial increase in wue when prd was compared with fi 3 emerging fruit crops response to deficit irrigation 3 1 jujube zizyphus jujuba mill jujube tree family rhamnaceae is native to china where it has been cultivated for more than 5000 years and to neighbouring areas of mongolia and the central asian republics with time its cultivation has spread to other regions of the world including to mediterranean countries jujube fruit is an integral part of the culture and way of life of millions of people and has also become important for many regions of the world following its introduction azam ali et al 2006 indeed it can be considered a so called functional food since it has nutritional as well as medicinal uses choi et al 2011 nevertheless until now jujube has been considered of minor importance and from a research and development point of view it has received little attention from most governments jujube is able to withstand severe drought during the growing season fig 2 a and to tolerate very low winter temperatures during its dormancy dahiya et al 1981 ming and sun 1986 ming and sun 1986 in this sense jujube trees are able to maintain leaf turgor under severe water deficit ψstem 3 0mpa essentially by developing two complementary mechanisms leaf active osmoregulation stress tolerance mechanism and the control of water loss via transpiration stress avoidance mechanism while allowing substantial gas exchange rates and as a consequence good leaf productivity ma et al 2007 cruz et al 2012 galindo et al 2016 the gradual recovery of leaf conductance after re watering previously stressed plants can also be considered as a mechanism for promoting leaf rehydration cruz et al 2012 moreover the high leaf relative apoplastic water content rwca levels and the possibility of increasing the accumulation of water in the apoplasm in response to water stress supports a steeper gradient in the water potential between the leaf and soil cruz et al 2012 galindo et al 2016 showed that in contrast with the axiom that expansive cell growth requires the presence of cell turgor no direct relation between turgor and growth rate exists in jujube fruits this could be due to an enhancement of a cell elasticity mechanism elastic adjustment which would maintain fruit turgor even at severe water stress levels by reducing fruit cell size or to the fact that jujube fruit growth depends on fruit growth effective turgor rather than just on turgor pressure these authors also reported that during most of the fruit ripening stage water can enter the fruits via the phloem rather than via the xylem this could be related with the increase in sensitivity to drought during this phenological period when moderate and severe water deficits induce a significant reduction in total marketable fruit yield number of fruits and or average fruit weight in contrast with this last idea cui et al 2008 2009 concluded that the jujube fruit maturation stage is the optimal stage to implement water deficit strategies and that while water deficit during the fruit growth slightly reduced the growth rate re watering had an over compensatory effect thus reducing the negative influence on fruit size the same authors cui et al 2008 2009 mentioned the relatively low water requirements of around 360mm and showed that jujube fruit maturation can be advanced and the fruit yield and quality enhanced if appropriate rdi is applied at certain growth stages bud burst to leafing and fruit maturation also gao et al 2014 showed that jujube fruit responded positively to irrigation practices the concentration of some taste related e g glucose fructose tss and malic acid and health related e g catechin and epicatechin compounds being generally much higher in drip irrigated fruits in this sense too collado gonzález et al 2013 demonstrated that water deficit did not affect the tendency of procyanidins to self aggregate but increased the content of procyanidins of low molecular mass table 3 improving their potential bioavailability and possible physiological effects on human health the procyanidin content of fruit from well watered trees increased during domestic cold storage whereas the fruits from trees suffering severe water stress lost some of their procyanidin content moreover in a subsequent paper collado gonzález et al 2014 pointed to a certain proportionality in the response of jujube fruits to moderate and severe deficit irrigation during fruit maturation so when plants were exposed to moderate water deficit ψstem from 1 40 to 2 28mpa during this phenological period there was no change in fruit size moisture content firmness or fruit peel and flesh colour compared with fully irrigated trees only when a more severe water stress ψstem from 1 40 to 3 14mpa was reached there were significant increases in the sucrose and arabinose contents measured table 3 in addition the response of fruit amino acids to water deficit was not as sensitive as expected since there was no direct relationship with the magnitude of the water deficit however the decrease in fruit asparagine content as a result of severer water deficit is a positive aspect because this amino acid is the major precursor of acrylamide a potentially toxic compound formed during the heat processing of some plant foods however severe water deficit produced smaller fruit with a lower moisture content and yield accompanied by changes in firmness and peel and flesh colour 3 2 loquat eriobotrya japonica lindl loquat is a subtropical evergreen tree that belongs to the family rosaceae subtribe pyrinae formerly subfamily maloideae potter et al 2007 some of the common names of loquat include japanese plum japanese medlar maltese plum etc it is considered indigenous to southeastern china and possibly southern japan because it is said to have been cultivated there for over 1000 years actually more than 30 countries in subtropical and mild temperate regions of the world are cultivating selections of loquat cultivars performed during the 19th century feng et al 2007 ferreres et al 2009 he et al 2011 it is important to point out that loquat is characterized by an unusual phenology that makes it different of the traditional temperate fruit crops it blooms in autumn on apical panicles formed on current year wood developing fruits during winter and ripening in early spring fig 2b moreover this fruit as other pomes presents a sigmoidal pattern of fruit growth dennis 1988 cuevas et al 2003 and arrives at markets before any other spring fruit cuevas et al 2007a hueso and cuevas 2008 research on mechanisms developed by loquat plant to resist drought is very scarce mainly at plant water relations levels diurnal and seasonal gas exchange values in loquat plants respond to changes in plant water status and to changes in evaporative demand showing minimum values in summer moreover the diurnal trend of photosynthetic rate in loquat at least during autumn and winter was characterized by a double picked curve suggesting the predominance of genotype over the environmental factors on the loquat gas exchange behaviour stellfeldt et al 2011 because this last behaviour diverges from that indicated for woody mediterranean vegetation which is characterized by a maximum value in the morning declining towards midday and remaining more or less constant afterward recently zhang et al 2015 observed some loquat drought stress tolerance mechanisms i the increase in chlorophyll content which can enhances photosynthesis under water deficit ii the increase in the content of soluble sugars and proline of roots which increased the osmotic adjustment and the favourable water potential gradient for water into the roots iii the increase in the aba content of leaves which induced the stomata closing and improved the water use efficiency and iv the increase in the levels of antioxidant enzyme activities mainly at leaf level the ability of loquat plants to develop leaf active osmoregulation was earlier suggested by garcía legaz et al 2005 who studied the effect of salinity on the water relations of loquat plants on two different rootstocks luo et al 2007 studied the response of two different loquat cultivars to water deficit and concluded that changhong no 3 the more water deficit resistant cultivar responds to water deficit with a higher increase in stomatal density and reducing stomatal size than jiefangzhong cultivar in addition in jiefangzhong cultivar leaf photosynthetic pigment concentrations decrease in response to drought stress while in changhong no 3 the concentrations of photosynthetic pigments increased markedly under light drought stress hueso and cuevas 2008 estimated relatively high loquat water needs of around 724mm and demonstrated observing the long term response of this crop to postharvest rdi that this crop can be considered as a model for the continuous application of rdi strategies mainly for the economic benefits of saving water during summer increasing fruit size and grading and fruit value and gross revenue without affecting yield hueso and cuevas 2008 cuevas et al 2009 this positive response of loquat to rdi is based in two main facts the clear separation between vegetative and reproductive growth allowing the application of postharvest rdi without affecting fruit growth and the improving of fruit value when postharvest rdi is applied because important advancing harvest time in the next season can be achieved in this sense the most profitable rdi strategy is the complete suppression of watering from around one month after the end of previous harvest early june up to reach a ψstem value circa 2 2mpa 8 9 weeks because do not alter the formation of the floral organs and increase the advancement of bloom next season cuevas et al 2007a b 2009 2012 while prolonging the water deficit period during one additional month august may impair flower development in loquat rodríguez et al 2007 due to the fact that research on loquat response to rdi has been always focusses on fruit earliness due to its enormous importance in loquat price and commercialization and the high susceptibility of mature loquat fruits to mechanical damage during harvest and postharvest handling to the best of our knowledge do not exist publications on the effect of deficit irrigation on loquat quality since loquat is a non climacteric fruit premature picking is inadvisable because fruits are excessively acid and taste unpalatable to consumers thus research has been focussed to stablish fruit maturity indices in order to optimize harvesting pinillos et al 2011 suggested that at every picking date only those fruits with a skin colour that corresponds to a minimum tss and tss ta values should be harvested especially at the earliest harvests of the season also a tss ta of 0 7 was previously proposed as minimum value for harvest pinillos et al 2007 recently cañete et al 2015 showed the consumers preference for light orange skin fruits rather than fully ripe ones due to their greater firmness fewer skin defects and better balance between sweetness and acidity and proposed harvesting loquat fruits with a minimum value of tss of 10 brix and a tss ta ratio close to 1 0 to guarantee eating quality and consumer satisfaction 3 3 pistachio pistacia vera l pistachio tree is native to western asia and asia minor from syria to the caucasus and afghanistan they are mentioned in the old testament archaeological evidence from turkey indicates that the nuts were being used for food as early as 7000 b c pistachio is a member of the anacardiaceae or cashew family and is the only commercially edible nut among the eleven species in the genus pistacia and by far the most economically important the pistachio was introduced into italy from syria early in the first century a d and subsequently its cultivation spread to other mediterranean countries pistachio trees are considered one of the most drought resistant fruit species because they can survive under extreme drought conditions spiegel roy et al 1977 observed that under desert conditions pistachio trees were able to differentiate sufficient flower buds to provide an appreciable yield and that roots were uniformly spread down to a depth of 2 40 m even if soil moisture in all the horizons was below the permanent wilting point of soil related with this last characteristic some authors e g lin et al 1984 and germana 1997 suggested that pistachio drought resistance mainly depends on extensive root system development because despite it commonly being though a xerophyte it does not present the morphological characteristic of such in the leaves showing instead high values of net photosynthesis pn and leaf conductance gleaf furthermore the leaves can be considered as isolaterals since their upper and lower pages are structurally similar with almost identical stomatal density and conductance also kanber et al 1993 showed that root activity is confined to shallower soil depths in short interval irrigation conditions another singularity of pistachio trees is that both yield and the water stress level regulate the flower bud drop that occurs before the beginning of kernel growth so the following year s pistachio yield can decrease considerably as a consequence of a higher percentage of flower buds dropped i in years of higher yield or ii when a severe water deficit during fruit stage ii takes place pérez lópez et al 2017 pistachio plants exposed to water stress also develop stress avoidance and stress tolerance mechanisms as regard the first sort of mechanism during pistachio fruit stages i and ii fig 2c when the soil water content is quite high and the evaporative demand of the atmosphere is low these plants show higher pn and gleaf values in contrast during fruit stage iii at which the evaporative demand of the atmosphere is higher the pistachio plants show lower pn and gleaf values n et al 2011 b memmi et al 2016a b when plants are under water deficit gleaf values decrease in order to limit water loss through transpiration and at very pronounced levels of water deficit the daily pattern of gleaf is modified showing maximum values in the early morning and decreasing gradually whereas pn values remain fairly constant until sunset because this parameter is less sensitive to water deficit than gleaf d pérez lópez unpublished data in this respect behboudian et al 1986 established that pistachio plants are able to continue their photosynthetic activity even when ψleaf reaches extremely low values of 5 0 to 6 0mpa moreover this crop has an outstanding capability for leaf thermoregulation even at sever water stress levels because pistachio canopies can transpire water at rates far higher than those normally found in mesophytes and are able to rapidly compensate water losses without showing visible stress condition symptoms germana 1997 in addition when previously water stressed plants are re watered the gradual and slow recovery of the plant water status observed can be considered as a mechanism for promoting leaf rehydration memmi et al 2016b as regard the development of stress tolerance mechanisms gijón et al 2011 identified changes in the leaf bulk modulus of elasticity during pit hardening stage ii and active osmotic adjustment at any phenological period similarly behboudian et al 1986 showed that pistachio plants at a ψleaf value of 6 0mpa exhibited very high ψp values 3 0mpa pistachio s water relations are significantly affected by rootstock according to gijón et al 2010 the hybrid from crossbreeding p atlantica desf p vera l may be the best rootstock for adequately irrigated pistachios since it induces the highest leaf conductance and vigour whereas in rainfed or deficit irrigated conditions p terebinthus might be a good choice for its drought tolerance as it is able to maintain a greater leaf area than non stressed plants with lower ψstem and gleaf values however in contrast with these results and the widespread belief memmi et al 2016b suggested that p atlantica could be a suitable rootstock for deficit irrigated plants because of its reputation for being very resistant to water stress pistachio is mainly cultivated worldwide under rain fed conditions despite the good crop performance under these dryland conditions there is a clear tendency to increase the area dedicated to irrigation because the benefits derived from irrigation in this crop are probably higher than in other crops irrigation increases yield nut size and splitting reduces the alternate bearing pattern and incidence of blank nuts but has no effect on the hull to kernel ratio monastra et al 1998 ak and agackesen 2006 sedaghati and alipour 2006 suggested that early hull splitting a process that decreases the quality of the yield because the kernel is exposed to invasion by fungi and insects is related with plant water status from late april to early june however gijón et al 2009 suggested that early splitting incidence is not related to plant water status but to temperatures below 13 c pistachio s irrigation water requirements are quite high varying from 547 to 600mm when calculated according to memmi et al 2016b or kermani and salehi 2006 to 842 1000mm when calculated according to testi et al 2008 or goldhamer 1995 taking into account that water is a scarce resource and in future only the most efficient agricultural systems will receive inputs of irrigation water fereres et al 2003 studies into optimizing pistachio deficit irrigation strategies are in progress for example memmi et al 2014 studied the pistachio response to different levels of water deficit and time of application concluding that irrigation when kernel weight is increasing stage iii results in a higher fruit size than when the same amount of irrigation water is distributed between stages i rapid nut growth and iii moreover these authors showed that shell hardening stage ii starts when the fruit reaches its maximum external diameter and finishes a short time before the kernel reach its final weight both processes being simultaneous at the end of hardening and beginning of kernel growth gijón et al 2009 showed that sdi provided at 50 and 65 of the fully irrigated trees during the growing season reduced total yield and kernel size even though differences in kernel dry weight were unaffected memmi et al 2016b showed that rdi during stage ii or postharvest does not reduce yield even though it may reduce tree vegetative growth these authors also indicated that full irrigation and rdi in pistachio trees growing in shallow soils can be successfully scheduled using ψstem measurements hence rdi using a ψstem threshold value of 1 5mpa during stage ii induced similar yield and production values to full irrigated trees whereas a ψstem threshold value of 2 0mpa resulted in an extensive delay in the recovery of gleaf values with concomitant negative effects on long term pistachio production guerrero et al 2005 studied the recovery of pistachio water relations under rdi and concluded that in order to avoid any adverse effect of water deficit during stage iii irrigation should be increased toward the end of stage ii or be clearly higher than 100 etc from the beginning of stage iii pérez lópez et al 2017 showed that stages i and iii are critical because water deficit reduces the quantity and quality of the yield however the effects of different water stress levels at each stage have not been sufficiently studied in this sense rdi trees receiving 50 of the water received by control trees during stages i and ii and the same amount of water as control trees during stage iii provided a similar total yield and percentage of split nuts as full irrigated trees and did not show an alternate bearing pattern even though they received around 20 less water gijón et al 2009 okay and sevin 2011a b studied the effect of irrigation on some pistachio fruit characteristics and concluded that differences among cultivars were more significant under non irrigated conditions irrigation increased kernel weight but did not have a significant impact on shell and kernel colours guerrero et al 2005 carbonell barrachina et al 2014 showed that the more severe the water stress level achieved during stage ii the harder and crunchier the resulting pistachios the kernel fatty acid content of pistachio is also affected by plant water status okay and sevin 2011a the oleic acid content increasing and the linoleic acid content decreasing in fruits of well irrigated trees in contrast carbonell barrachina et al 2014 indicated that the fatty acid profile of pistachios is dominated by three main compounds oleic acid 50 linoleic acid 33 and palmitic acid 13 and showed table 3 that moderate rdi during stage ii significantly increased the oil content of the nuts whereas more severe rdi reduced the oil content inducing in both cases a significant increase in the content of linoleic acid which is an essential fatty acid for humans these authors also studied the effect of rdi on pistachio volatile compounds and concluded that severe rdi during stage ii increased the contents of aldehydes associated with green and vegetable notes and reduce those of pyrazines nut and toasted notes and terpenes citric notes table 3 a descriptive analysis of pistachios showed that moderate rdi during stage ii leads to an intense green pistachio colour accompanied by higher intensities of nutty and pistachio notes in harder crunchier nuts with a longer aftertaste also an international consumer study about the opinion of european consumers on pistachios grown under rdi indicated that the kernels resulting from moderate rdi applied during stage ii obtained a higher intensities of characteristic sensory attributes and a greater level of satisfaction among international consumers than kernels from fi trees or from those exposed to severe rdi during stage ii carbonell barrachina et al 2014 noguera artiaga et al 2016 3 4 pomegranate punica granatum l pomegranate one of the oldest known edible fruits and one of the seven kinds of fruit mentioned in the bible is mainly grown in semi arid mild temperate to subtropical climates blumenfeld et al 2000 this species and punica protopunica are the two species that make up the punicaceae family p granatum is believed to be a native to the southern caspian belt iran and northern turkey whereas p protopunica is generally accepted as being endemic of the socotra island yemen janick 2007 pomegranate is considered to be a drought resistant crop because it supports heat and thrives in arid and semiarid areas even under desert conditions aseri et al 2008 the mechanisms developed by this crop to confront water stress being mainly stress avoidance and stress tolerance rodríguez et al 2012 more precisely from the beginning of water deficit conditions leaf conductance decreases in order to control water loss via transpiration and to avoid leaf turgor loss stress avoidance mechanism and when sever water stress levels are reached active osmotic adjustment is triggered contributing to the maintenance of leaf turgor stress tolerance mechanism other drought tolerance characteristics commonly seen in xeromorphic plants can be also observed in pomegranate such as a high relative apoplastic water content 42 58 which would contribute to the retention of water at low leaf water potentials rodríguez et al 2012 despite its good resistance to drought pomegranate for commercial production requires regular irrigation throughout the season especially when it is cultivated in arid and semiarid areas to reduce the incidence of fruit physiopathies e g fruit splitting galindo et al 2014b rodríguez et al 2017 and to reach optimal growth yield and fruit quality levin 2006 holland et al 2009 in this sense the period corresponding to the end of pomegranate fruit growth and ripening is clearly critical for the incidence of fruit splitting galindo et al 2014b showed that at very severe water deficit levels despite leaf turgor being maintained fruit turgor is lost inducing a reduction in fruit expansion then when an important rainfall event takes place previously water stressed pomegranate fruits are rehydrated asymmetrically because aril turgor increases to a much greater extent than peel turgor the pressure of the arils on the peel favouring splitting intrigliolo et al 2013 estimated pomegranate evapotranspiration to be around 412 514mm but reports on the effect of irrigation management on pomegranate fruit yield and quality are relatively scarce the first results indicated that it is possible to control the desired ripening time in pomegranates by applying different irrigation regimes sonawane and desai 1989 recently galindo et al 2014a indicated that sdi applied throughout the pomegranate season to achieve pronounced water deficit levels reduces total yield per tree the number of fruits per tree and the size of the fruits however such a strategy can bring forward the availability of fruits resulting from late flowerings which despite their smaller size are of great interest for the pomegranate transformation industry due to their very high content of bioactive compounds in contrast other studies mention ambiguous results concerning the effect of sdi on the chemical characteristics of pomegranate fruit in this sense mellisho et al 2012 concluded that sdi under moderate water stress produced some changes in colour and chemical characteristics which reflected earlier ripening however mena et al 2013 indicated that pomegranate juice from trees submitted to sdi regimes that produce severe water stress levels was of lower quality and less healthy than the juice from fully irrigated trees this reduction in quality was due to the fact that the water stress levels caused a dramatic decrease in bioactive phenolic compounds especially anthocyanins and punicalagin table 3 besides the pomegranates were less attractive for consumers due to their pale red colour on the other hand laribi et al 2013 showed that pomegranates from sdi trees submitted to mild water stress during flowering and fruit set and more severe water stress during the linear stage of fruit growth and ripening had a redder peel and higher level of total soluble solids in the juice intrigliolo et al 2013 and laribi et al 2013 studied the pomegranate response to rdi involving irrigation water restrictions during different fruit stages and concluded that the period comprised by flowering and fruit set could be regarded as non critical from the yield point of view and that irrigation water restriction during pomegranate fruit growth and ripening enhances peel redness and tss in the juice however restricting the irrigation water during the linear fruit growth period increased the concentration of many bioactive compounds in the juice such as anthocyanins that are related to health and taste recently galindo et al 2017 showed that a short period of irrigation restriction at the end of ripening period brings the harvest time forward saves irrigation water enhances the fruit bioactive compounds content anthocyanins phenolic compounds punicalagin and ellagic acid and increases the price of the fruit without affecting marketable yield and fruit size studies on the response of pomegranate trees to prd have been performed by parvizi et al 2014 2016 and parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 these authors compared the following strategies sdi 50 and 75 of etc irrigating only one side of trees north throughout the growing season and keeping the other side south of the tree dry prd 50 and 75 of etc and fi maintaining both sides of the tree wetted the first authors showed that both sdi strategies and prd at 50 etc induced a decrease in pomegranate yield and recommended prd 75 etc because in addition to saving water yield intrinsic water use efficiency wue and transpiration efficiency increased as regard pomegranate fruit quality attributes parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 indicated that both prd strategies increased the pomegranate fruit juice content and maturity index and decreased the titratable acidity values compared with fi fruits while the response of fruits to both sdi strategies was the opposite of that observed in response to prd deficit irrigation can be considered as a tool that significantly improves the postharvest performance of pomegranate several authors reported that the fruits resulting from sdi and rdi treatments showed better postharvest behaviour than those from fi because of retarded chilling injury incidence peña et al 2013 higher sensory and nutritional quality and longer shelf life laribi et al 2013 peña et al 2013 peña estévez et al 2016 moreover in a study of the effect of different irrigation treatments and the efficacy of a vapour treatment 7 10s at 95 c and using naclo as sanitizing agents on the quality and shelf life of fresh cut pomegranate arils peña estévez et al 2015 observed a synergistic effect of the water deficit treatment and the postharvest thermal treatment best results were obtained for arils from pomegranates grown on trees from which irrigation was withheld for 16 or 26days prior to harvest for which a shelf life of 18days at 5 c was established 4 summary conclusions and future research needs bearing in mind the characteristics of the emerging crops considered in this review it is clear that they present different mechanisms to confront water deficit situations and that different levels of resistance are achieved in this sense pistachio trees can be considered the most drought resistant because they can survive under very extreme drought conditions their water stress resistance is based on morphological characteristics such as a very extensive root system and the development of stress avoidance and tolerance mechanisms pomegranate and jujube trees are also able to withstand severe drought during the growing season and the mechanisms developed by these crops to confront drought are also predominantly stress avoidance and stress tolerance mechanisms in contrast an entirely different strategy to confront water deficit is shown by loquat its loquat strategy can be considered as a drought escape mechanism because it is based on an atypical phenology completely different from that of traditional mediterranean temperate fruit crops blooming in autumn developing fruits during winter and ripening in early spring so fruit growth accounts when mediterranean climate is wetter and evaporative demand of the atmosphere reaches minimum values thus avoiding the effects of hot and dry summers the irrigation water requirements of these emerging crops were not related with the resistance to water stress so loquat trees presented the highest seasonal etc which was slightly higher than that observed in pistachio and pomegranate trees and clearly higher than that observed in jujube trees it is clear that loquat can be considered an outstanding crop for its response to the continuous application of rdi but there are good reasons to conclude that the other emerging crops studied are able to cope with water scarcity due to their positive response to di strategies including minimal impact on yields and improved wp taking into consideration the effect of di strategies on fruit quality and the health related compounds they contain it is important to underline that research needs to be directed at some very important aspects including i the effect of deficit irrigation on loquat fruit quality for which to the best of our knowledge no information exists and ii identifying the optimal water deficit level its timing and duration for each crop in order to optimize fruit quality and their health related compounds content this last consideration is based on the fact that the literature in most cases suggests that fruit quality and the health related compounds content can be improved by specific di strategies but fruit response to moderate and severe water deficit is not proportional in many cases it is not possible to establish a linear correlation between water stress and some fruit characteristics especially in the case of some secondary metabolites mattson and haack 1987 gobbo neto and lopes 2007 in an attempt to predict the concentration of phenolic compounds as a function of water status horner 1990 proposed a model based on a quadratic relationship between both variables fig 3 when plants are under mild osmotic stress there is a reduction in plant growth and the concentration of non nitrogenous secondary metabolites increase when plants are under severe water stress strong stomatal regulation takes place and co2 assimilation is much reduced carbon is preferentially allocated to the synthesis of primary metabolites which do not exceed the amount used for fruit growth and to the detriment of the synthesis of carbon based secondary metabolites fig 3 bearing in mind all the previous considerations it is evident that farmers who adopt specific di strategies and cultivate underutilized plant species should be rewarded for i making sustainable use of irrigation water ii improving crop biodiversity iii having to accept a slight reduction in their fruit and vegetable yields and iv producing fruits with higher contents of bioactive compounds fortunately consumers are willing to pay for special foods particularly those associated with environmental friendly farming practices that use no chemicals martínez ruiz and gómez cantó 2016 which is the case of the fruits and vegetables grown under di however consumers need to identify such products which should be clearly labeled and displayed separate from other products of the same type otherwise their potential will be lost in a sea of products very few groups have studied consumer opinion concerning di fruits lopez et al 2016 fernandes silva et al 2013 but noguera artiaga et al 2016 even proposed an identity brand to protect this type of product which might be called hydrosostainable or in abbreviated and easier to remember form hydrosos according to these authors hydrosos products will have a solid identity based on two main factors i water deficit can increase the plant secondary metabolite content and thus the functionality of the edible products ripoll et al 2014 and ii the products are environmentally friendly because of the sustainable use of a very scarce resource water fig 4 noguera artiaga et al 2016 also found that consumers are willing to pay a reasonably higher price for hydrosos pistachios if they are properly labeled and identified however further research is needed to check whether this greater willingness to pay is the similar for all fruits finally it is essential to establish a hydrosos index to certify that the products using the hydrosos logo have been evaluated for their sustainable use of irrigation water and or their contents of bioactive compounds this index is under construction and will be based among other factors on farmers and traders being able to demonstrate i knowledge of the cultural practices involved including water management during the non critical periods ii the timing level and duration of the applied water deficit iii that suitable monitoring and control of the stress applied has taken place by measuring for example the water potential v the precise composition and contents of bioactive compounds e g increased levels of proline an amino acid used as indicator of plant water stress and vi the good sensory quality of the product in question if these rules are followed it should be possible to ensure consumer satisfaction strengthen their willingness to pay a reasonably higher price and guarantee their future fidelity to these products fig 4 if the index can guarantee all the above consumer demand will increase as will the price of hydrosos products and the possible profit for farmers hopefully farmers will become increasingly convinced about the economic benefits of di and dedicate larger areas to the cultivation of even more crops acknowledgments on the occasion of the

11524,to evaluate the performances of a controlled drainage system in optimizing water use and reducing nutrient losses from agricultural fields an experimental facility was set up in north eastern italy in 1996 water table management was tested in combination with surface open ditches and subsurface pipe drainage systems data were collected from 2007 to 2013 on water table depth drained volumes nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in groundwater and in drainage water nitrogen in groundwater showed higher concentrations when controlled drainage was combined with open ditches system with a median of 13 43 mg l 1 for no3 n and 18 68 mg l 1 for total n drainage water showed an opposite trend subsurface pipes with free drainage provided highest concentrations due to extensive leaching a median of 20 7 mg l 1 for no3 n and 24 0 mg l 1 for total n phosphorus concentrations showed notable differences in drainage water with higher values in the controlled drainage open ditches system due to surface runoff a median of 0 190 mg l 1 for po4 p and 0 536 mg l 1 for total p in general the most hazardous period for surface water pollution was autumn winter due to rainy weather and fertilizer application on bare soil overall water table management reduced total water discharge by 81 compared to free drainage on average with controlled drainage annual nitrogen losses were lowered by 92 from 29 to 2 kg no3 n ha 1 and annual phosphorus losses by 65 from 0 14 to 0 05 kg po 4p ha 1 free drainage with subsurface pipe was the worst combination from the environmental point of view annual nitrogen and phosphorus losses were 46 kg no3 n ha 1 and 0 10 kg po4 p ha 1 respectively water table management clearly proved to be a reliable tool to improve both water usage and quality keywords controlled drainage pipe drainage surface drainage water saving nitrogen phosphorus 1 introduction saving water is a key issue in modern agriculture in this context managing water outflows may help in optimizing water use and avoiding drought stress in addition there are environmental concerns about nutrient losses via drainage water especially as regards nitrogen and phosphorus pollution and the related eutrophication processes boesch and brinsfield 2000 dodds and smith 2016 skaggs et al 2012 withers and haygarth 2007 controlled drainage is a precipitation harvesting method with the aim of retaining water in the soil according to evans et al 1995 it proved to be capable of both saving water about 30 less outflow volumes than conventional drainage and reducing nutrient losses 30 50 nutrient losses reduction in areas with shallow groundwater controlled drainage allows the water table level to be set at the desired height by retaining an appropriate amount of drainage water in collecting ditches during the coldest and rainiest period when rainfall exceeds evapotranspiration rate autumn and winter in northern italy controlled drainage can be used to avoid complete water outflow and reduce nutrient losses to surface waters however at the same time particular attention must be paid to prevent waterlogging gilliam and skaggs 1986 during the driest period spring and summer especially close to the sowing date of summer crops water table management is crucial to retain as much water as possible in order to avoid drought stress in general to optimize water use proper timing and accuracy are required in regulating water table level ale et al 2009 environmental benefits of controlled drainage have been verified worldwide bonaiti and borin 2010 drury et al 2014 luo et al 2008 sunohara et al 2015 wesström et al 2001 2014 xiao et al 2015 and crop biomass or production can also be improved with results depending on the weather conditions of each year ghane et al 2012 kross et al 2015 madramootoo et al 1993 poole 2015 in addition to minimize uncertainty in water table management simulation models have been applied in many shallow groundwater systems with the aim of predicting the effects of different drainage and water management schemes on water table depth soil moisture and nutrient losses borin et al 2000 fang et al 2012 negm et al 2016 different drainage management strategies and devices are now available to increase water retention and regulate water table level so that controlled drainage is also effectively applied at watershed scale with positive results kröger et al 2015 as reported by skaggs et al 2012 controlled drainage has been widely studied in the united states as well as on glacial derived soils in colder regions canada and sweden however no experiences are reported for the mediterranean area in this context the lower part of the drainage basin of venice lagoon in north eastern italy shows appropriate attributes for the application of controlled drainage as characterized by flat lands and by the presence of a shallow phreatic groundwater at the same time though great fluctuation in water table level during different seasons low organic matter content in these soils and the different climatic conditions may constitute peculiar traits that influence the effects of water table management considered all of this and since venice lagoon is also sensitive to water pollution sfriso 1987 a field experiment was set up in this area in 1996 in order to study the efficacy of controlled drainage in limiting water and nutrient losses from agricultural fields using a combination of two different outflow management strategies free and controlled drainage and two land drainage systems subsurface pipe and open ditches this paper focusing on data collected during the monitoring period 2007 2013 updates the results presented previously on water discharge and n balance borin et al 2002 bonaiti and borin 2010 and adds information on p losses 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field trial was set up in 1996 on the experimental farm of padova university at legnaro 45 20 53 n 11 57 11 e 6 m above sea level in north eastern italy the area is part of the padano veneta plain and belongs to the drainage basin that delivers water to the venice lagoon weather data were collected from the meteorological station of the regional agency for environmental protection arpav located near the experimental fields long term 1995 2014 average rainfall and air temperature were measured and reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated with hargreaves formula calibrated locally berti et al 2014 long term median annual rainfall is 915 mm y 1 ranging from a minimum of 601 mm y 1 to a maximum of 1311 mm y 1 autumn is the rainiest season september october and november have a median of 78 88 and 96 mm of precipitation respectively the median annual et0 is 989 mm y 1 with an interquartile range of 77 mm y 1 the season with the highest median monthly reference evapotranspiration rates is summer 154 mm in june 167 mm in july and 145 mm in august the average annual water balance therefore shows an excess during autumn winter while water shortage occurs in summer fig 1 provides the monthly rainfall and reference evapotranspiration values for the 1995 2014 period annual mean temperature is 13 5 c annual average minimum temperature is 8 7 c and annual average maximum is 18 6 c the month with the lowest average minimum temperature is january 0 15 c while the month with the highest average maximum is july 29 5 c soil in the experimental field is heterogeneous with the following soil texture silt 30 48 sand 15 47 clay 24 45 in general soil of the superficial layers is loam but silt content increases with depth from layer 90 120 cm down soil becomes generally silty loam at 3 m depth an impermeable layer allows the formation of a shallow phreatic groundwater overall there is also a gradient of increasing sand content from west to east our experimental design provides replicates of our theses in different parts of the field thus mitigating eventual effects of soil variability on water fluxes and water quality organic matter content is on average 1 61 in the first layer 0 30 cm and decreases with depth carbonate content is high total limestone is 32 the active fraction 12

is organized in 12 plots 0 3 0 5 ha each with a split plot design consisting of a combination of 2 factors with 3 replicates for each thesis water table management controlled drainage cd or free drainage fd and land drainage system open ditches o or subsurface pipe drainage p fig 2 provides an overall view of the experimental facility controlled drainage plots are located in the northern part of the field separated from free drainage in the southern part by a pvc film buried up to a depth of 1 5 m in order to limit lateral seepage downstream of each plot a 1 2 m delivery ditch collects all the drainage and runoff water in controlled drainage plots a pvc riser is inserted at the end of the ditch to avoid complete outflow the riser is composed of modular pieces which can be assembled in many ways in order to set the maximum level the water in the collecting ditch can reach and consequently influence the water table level inside the plot at the outlet of each delivery ditch a buried pipe takes water into a sump where a turbine flow meter is installed to measure outflow waters composed of a mixture of drainage and runoff water there are 4 sumps in the field each of them collects water from 3 plots and delivers it via a 300 mm diameter pvc buried pipe to the pump of the wetland system the water is then pumped into the constructed flow wetland where it receives further treatment for pollutant removal at the center of each plot a phreatimeter is inserted into the soil up to the depth of 3 m the phreatimeter is made of a perforated pvc pipe so that the water inside the phreatimeter is in equilibrium with the groundwater the 12 phreatimeters are used for water table level measurements and for groundwater samples collection the complete path followed by water from the plots towards the wetland is represented in fig 3 the arpav meteorological station is located in the southern part of the experimental area 2 3 crop management and monitoring all the plots were cultivated with the same techniques and received the same amount of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer sugar beet 2008 winter wheat 2008 09 and maize 2010 2013 were cultivated with conventional tillage techniques and fertilizers were applied in both mineral and organic form with a total average annual input of 254 kg ha 1 of nitrogen and 45 kg ha 1 of phosphorus annual fertilizer inputs and crop growing periods are reported in fig 4 a daily values of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration were measured and calculated from the beginning of the trial in october 2007 until the end in september 2013 monthly cumulative rainfall evapotranspiration and water deficit surplus calculated as the difference between rainfall and et are reported in fig 4b fig 4c shows average water table level of controlled and free drainage fields and riser height in controlled drainage fields from the start of the trial until january 2011 risers were set at 40 cm beneath ground level then raised to 15 cm till the end of the experiment the water table level was monitored at least twice a month and after significant rainfall events it was measured manually with a sonic water sensor mounted on the tip of a tape measure the tape was inserted into the phreatimeter and lowered down until the sensor reached the water and emitted a sound signal and the water table level was wrote down groundwater samples were taken with the help of a portable water pump used to aspire water from the phreatimeter at the outlet of the delivery ditch of each plot where the flow meter is installed outflow volumes were measured and water samples were collected each time discharge occurred all the water samples from both groundwater and outflow water were collected into small pvc containers filtered and refrigerated and then analyzed for nitrate soluble phosphorus total nitrogen and total phosphorus content all these steps were taken following the prescriptions of the italian agency for environmental protection and technical services apat irsa cnr 2003 data collected during the experiment were organized into hydrological years october september to better understand hydrological and nutrient dynamics in relation to annual and seasonal weather trends all the water samples collected during the 2007 13 period were analyzed for no3 n and po4 p concentrations a total of 358 water samples were collected from groundwater and 279 from outflow water starting from october 2009 total n and total p content were assessed too analyses of total p were stopped a bit earlier in 2013 due to the relative high cost and the absence of significant results monitoring periods for outflow volumes water table depth and nutrient concentrations are reported in fig 5 mean monthly flow weighted concentrations of no3 n and po4 p were calculated from the sum of no3 n and po4 p losses of each month divided by the sum of the total flow of the same period baker and johnson 1981 total losses were calculated by multiplying nutrient concentrations with outflow volumes of the same period 2 4 statistical analysis nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations mean flow weighted concentrations and annual losses were checked for anova assumptions normality was checked with shapiro wilk test both raw data and residual were non normally distributed and normalization through data transformation gave inconsistent results homogeneity of variances was tested with levene s test this assumption was violated too overall data collected was uneven and extremely skewed especially for controlled drainage as discharge events happened more rarely than with free drainage a non parametric approach was therefore preferred kruskal wallis test was performed with a post hoc comparison of mean ranks of all pairs of groups with bonferroni correction this appeared to be the most suitable way to analyze our data even if this approach did not permit us to assess the extent of the interaction between the two studied factors water table management and land drainage system in graphs and tables different letters were assigned to theses not coming from identical populations p value 0 05 null hypothesis rejected for monthly concentrations and annual losses statistical tests were carried out separately for each month year all statistical analyses and graphs were made using statistica 8 statsoft inc 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 n and p concentrations fig 6 outlines groundwater no3 n po4 p total n and total p concentrations for the whole trial period significant differences between theses p 0 05 were found only for nitrogen content in particular no3 n concentrations were definitely higher in cd o groundwater with a median of 13 43 mg l 1 second was fd o with a median of 8 77 mg l 1 followed by cd p median of 8 15 mg l 1 lowest values were found in fd p median of 1 65 mg l 1 the same trend was observed for total nitrogen even though less data is available compared to the soluble form we can see that cd o gave higher values median of 18 68 mg l 1 followed by fd o median of 10 14 mg l 1 and cd p median of 8 16 mg l 1 again lowest values were found in fd p a median of 1 88 mg l 1 as regards phosphorus there were no significant differences between theses for either po4 p or total p soluble p median values ranged from 0 008 mg l 1 fd o to 0 013 mg l 1 fd p while total p median values from 0 020 mg l 1 fd o to 0 032 mg l 1 fd p outflow water samples were collected more frequently during late autumn winter and early spring when discharge occurred more often fig 7 plots their nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations considering the trial period 2007 13 as a whole both no3 n and total n gave higher values with fd p a median of 20 7 mg l 1 for nitrate nitrogen and 24 0 mg l 1 for total nitrogen conversely free drainage with open ditches fd o provided significantly lower concentrations of nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen with medians of 6 1 mg l 1 and 7 4 mg l 1 respectively moreover lower concentrations were obtained when water table management was applied especially with cd o for no3 n the median was 0 9 mg l 1 for total n 2 6 mg l 1 in particular significant differences were found between fd p and both open ditches theses for no3 n and total n and for nitrate nitrogen also between cd o and all other treatments just to provide a touchstone if we consider the nitrates threshold used by the world health organization to identify potable water world health organization 2011 which is 50 mg l 1 of nitrates about 11 3 mg l 1 of no3 n we can see that 84 of nitrate nitrogen data from fd p falls above that value whereas only 8 of data from cd o and 33 from cd p exceeds the limit confirming the results obtained in lysimetric studies in the same environment borin et al 2001 in terms of phosphorus content cd o gave highest values for po4 p median of 0 190 mg l 1 and total p median of 0 536 mg l 1 in fact in the open ditches system excess water is usually removed with runoff borin et al 1997 and both soluble and particulate phosphorus generally moves in surface water runoff boesch and brinsfield 2000 considering groundwater and drainage water concentrations together it is possible to highlight the overall behavior of nitrogen and phosphorus as they follow the water path in our case as regards groundwater quality higher nitrogen concentrations were found in the open ditches system because leached nitrogen was not removed by tile drainage at the same time nitrogen concentrations in drainage water were higher with subsurface pipe indicating it as the worst land drainage system in terms of protecting surface water from nitrogen pollution as already pointed out by bonaiti and borin 2010 drury et al 2014 and evans et al 1995 in addition if we compare theses with the same land drainage system but different water table management we can see that there are no significant differences in groundwater n concentrations even though controlled drainage seems to tend towards higher values conversely to what we found some authors reported a decrease in groundwater nitrogen concentrations when controlled drainage was applied kalita and kanwar 1993 wesström et al 2001 indicating denitrification as the main responsible for this trend in our site though the application of controlled drainage did not maintain the water table at a constant level as already reported in the previous study by bonaiti and borin 2010 the effect of controlled drainage in wet periods was to slightly raise the water table level after rainfall events and to lag the drop by a few days without creating persistent anaerobic conditions since continuous wet conditions and high organic matter content are required for denitrification processes to take place gilliam and skaggs 1986 we can assume that in our case the sole installation of the control structure was not sufficient to promote denitrification to such an extent to steadily reduce nitrogen content in groundwater as regards the effect of controlled drainage on drainage water we found an overall decrease in nitrogen concentrations when it was applied similar results were reported by evans et al 1989 1995 and lalonde et al 1996 regarding phosphorus we noticed that the groundwater content showed no clear trend whereas the drainage water concentrations were higher with open ditches indeed as a general rule while tile drainage increases water infiltration into soil open ditches produce greater surface runoff evans et al 1995 as a consequence while nitrogen content in drainage water is higher with tile drainage water coming from open ditches may be richer in sediments and phosphorus konyha et al 1992 on the other hand the application of water table management was not effective in reducing phosphorus content in outflow water these results reflect what was found by many studies on phosphorus transport as pointed out by king et al 2015 3 2 nutrient concentrations over time collection of data on soluble forms of nitrogen and phosphorus in outflow water permitted to outline the seasonal changes in nutrient concentrations considering all the samples collected during the trial period to provide a reliable comparison between the nutrient content found in different outflow volumes mean monthly outflows and mean monthly flow weighted concentrations were considered results averaged over the years are reported in fig 8 no3 n concentrations started to rise in late autumn reaching a peak in winter and decreasing in early spring according to drury et al 1996 highest nitrogen content in drainage water can be found when soil is not covered by the crop especially if fertilizer is applied in this period in our field trial a summer crop was cultivated during 5 out of 6 years soil was not covered by vegetation during autumn and winter and for 2 years liquid manure was applied in autumn so that the observed trend can be easily justified in more detail there was a sudden increase in fd p between november and december when soluble nitrogen reached a concentration of 30 33 mg l 1 this peak was strongly influenced by the high values reported in december 2012 when intensive rainfall events quickly removed nitrogen stored in soil probably accumulated because of a poor maize harvest the previous summer moreover after a decline during march no3 n concentrations rose again in april this result was influenced by the behavior of the 2007 08 hydrological season rainfall in autumn and winter was not enough to generate significant outflows so that nitrogen in soil was still available for leaching during the spring when high concentrations were measured furthermore sugarbeet was cultivated in that year fertilizations started in february increasing the amount of leaching in early spring as reported by billy et al 2013 dry periods increase nitrogen stock in soil causing a rise in water concentrations during the subsequent rainy period the time trend of po4 p was anticipated with respect to nitrogen and there was a more severe decline in late winter indeed as pointed out by king et al 2015 phosphorus content in outflow water is higher if rain falls immediately after a fertilizer application whereas it decreases quickly as time passes unlike nitrogen phosphorus is mostly removed from agricultural fields with the first runoff events of the rainy season 3 3 total water discharge and total nutrient losses total water discharge october 2007 september 2013 varied greatly among treatments overall fd p drained 1296 mm fd o 932 mm cd o 284 mm and cd p 131 mm table 1 if water saving is the main goal free drainage especially with subsurface pipe should be avoided whereas controlled drainage can be used to prevent water being wasted on average controlled drainage reduced water discharge by 81 draining a total of 208 mm of water against 1114 mm of free drainage during the period considered in the previous work on the same site the reduction was lower 72 as reported by bonaiti and borin 2010 however as indicated by skaggs et al 2012 water table management performances in reducing drainage losses may vary some authors as in our case reported water saving rates of more than 80 lalonde et al 1996 wesström and messing 2007 depending mostly on the weather during the trial period water output input ratio i e drainage coefficient was also calculated to quantify the total amount of rainwater drained table 1 during the monitoring periods free drainage with subsurface pipe fd p discharged more than half of the water supplied by rainfall events with a 0 514 ratio fd o drainage coefficient was lower 0 370 and treatments with water table regulation retained most of the rainwater with output input ratio of 0 112 for cd o and 0 052 for cd p cumulative nutrient losses via drainage water were also calculated nitrate nitrogen showed total losses of 229 kg n ha 1 for fd p 57 kg n ha 1 for fd o 16 kg n ha 1 for cd p 7 kg n ha 1 for cd o fig 9 a subsurface pipe with free drainage had both the highest nitrogen content in drainage water and the highest outflow volumes this combination clearly gave the worst performance from an environmental point of view leading to huge losses towards surface water over the entire period cd p reduced nitrogen losses by 93 respect to fd p cd o reduced n losses of 88 respect to fd o the percentage of reduction of n losses is consistent with the percentage of reduction of water outflows as similarly pointed out by skaggs et al 2012 anyway such high rates of reduction in water and nitrogen loads are not common since many previous works report outflow water reduction between 18 and 85 and n loads reduction between 18 and 79 skaggs et al 2012 in our case though greater fluctuation of the water table level during different seasons as well as the installation of control structures at the outlet of the delivery ditches instead of directly in the field may have played an important role in enhancing the effectiveness of controlled drainage in water and nitrate losses reduction as the outflow water rarely reached the top of the control structures phosphorus losses fig 9b were highest with open ditches and free drainage 0 9 po4 p kg ha 1 again controlled drainage even with higher po4 p concentrations as in cd o showed the lowest losses because of reduced total outflows 0 5 po4 p kg ha 1 for cd o and 0 0 po4 p kg ha 1 for cd p gilliam and skaggs 1986 analyzed nutrient behavior in drainage water showing a similar situation generally nitrates and phosphorus have an opposite trend the former mainly increase with subsurface drainage the latter with run off our case confirms open ditches as the land drainage system with the highest phosphorus losses as it provides the highest p concentrations even though the outflow volumes are lower than in tile drainage nevertheless when water table control was applied to open ditches phosphorus losses were reduced by 47 this pattern is consistent with what tan and zhang 2011 observed despite an increase in soluble p concentrations caused by water table management phosphorus losses were reduced as a result of lower discharge since nitrate nitrogen losses were strongly correlated to cumulative outflows it was possible to collect further information fig 10 plots cumulative losses against cumulative outflows for each treatment a linear relationship was found between the two variables the slopes of the regression lines express the nitrogen losses per unit of water discharged as reported in table 1 they were 0 173 0 055 0 105 and 0 024 kg ha 1 per mm of water for fd p fd o cd p and cd o respectively comparing data on nitrogen losses with the previous monitoring period bonaiti and borin 2010 the rate of no3 n losses reduction provided by controlled drainage has increased while the average reduction in this study is 92 in the previous one it was 70 in general terms during the 2007 2013 period both higher water discharge due to the weather trend and greater nitrogen concentrations due to higher fertilization rates were observed the combination of these two elements increased the gap in nitrogen losses between controlled and free drainage with respect to the previous study this clearly suggests that in the same pedological conditions the performance of controlled drainage depends on the weather and on crop and fertilizer management this is consistent with what was observed by drury et al 2009 lastly by introducing the ratio between discharge and rainfall volumes output input the values of nitrate nitrogen concentrations per mm of input water were obtained for a summary of these results see table 1 free drainage combined with subsurface pipe gave the worst performance 0 089 no3 n kg ha 1 per mm of water input the controlled drainage system reduced that value by 94 total nitrogen and phosphorus losses were compared to the losses of their soluble forms with regard to the periods in which both were monitored as shown in table 2 in subsurface pipe treatments no3 n contributes the most to total nitrogen losses by 54 3 on average this indicates an increased nitrates rate when subsurface drainage is applied caused by the leaching of this soluble form on the contrary po4 p rates were higher with open ditches 85 9 of total p on average phosphorus is normally removed with soil particles through runoff but the process is influenced by weather conditions saturation of the soil sorptive matrix and frequency and quantity of fertilizer inputs mcdowell 2012 in our case liquid manure was applied in autumn as assessed by sharpley and moyer 2000 the high rate of soluble phosphorus in manure increases the potential for enrichment of runoff water instead with subsurface drainage the infiltration of enriched water into the soil profile forces phosphorus to interact with the soil buffering capacity decreasing the proportion of the soluble form in drained water to provide an overall synopsis of this work annual no3 n and po4 p losses are reported in table 3 during the trial period free drainage with subsurface pipe removed on average 46 no3 n kg ha 1 per year while free drainage combined with open ditches system gave 12 kg ha 1 no3 n losses per year considering the mean nitrogen input from fertilizers application 254 kg ha 1 per year on average the output input ratio was 18 0 for fd p and 4 6 for fd o controlled drainage losses were only 1 3 kg ha 1 per year with an output input ratio of 0 5 1 3 highlighting a notable decrease with both land drainage systems compared to conventional drainage as regards the period from october 2009 until the end of the trial when total nitrogen losses were calculated we found an average output input ratio of 38 8 for fd p and 12 3 for fd o while the ratio for cd p was 3 2 and for cd o 2 8 it can be noted that while the subsurface drainage was responsible for the loss of nearly 40 of the nitrogen globally introduced into the system controlled drainage brought that percentage to 2 3 po4 p provided the highest mean losses with fd o 0 18 kg ha 1 y 1 second was cd o 0 10 kg ha 1 y 1 then fd p 0 10 kg ha 1 y 1 and last cd p 0 00 kg ha 1 y 1 overall land drainage system affected phosphorus removal more than water table management however the output input ratio was below 0 5 in all cases as regards total phosphorus from october 2009 until the end of the trial the output input ratio remained below 1 with no clear differences between treatments 4 conclusions the experiment studied the effects on hydrology and nutrient behavior of controlled drainage combined with two different land drainage systems open ditches and subsurface pipe overall controlled drainage proved to be a good system for maintaining water at field level since it reduced total water discharge by 81 conventional systems drained between 37 and 51 of total rainfall while systems in which water table was regulated only drained between 5 and 11 considering the environmental concerns related to surface water nitrogen pollution the worst combination was free drainage with subsurface pipe because of greater infiltration rates and higher water discharge it removed leached nitrogen via drainage water much more intensively 229 kg ha 1 of no3 n during the whole period for an average annual value of 46 kg ha 1 on the other hand controlled drainage generally reduced nitrogen losses despite the land drainage system adopted on average by 92 compared to free drainage indeed water table management reduced both nitrate concentrations in drainage water and water discharge on a percentage basis the effect of controlled drainage on n loads was similar to its effect on outflow volumes and cumulative nitrogen losses showed a strong linear correlation with cumulative outflow volumes in general our experiment showed higher reduction rates in both water discharge and nitrogen losses respect to results reported by many other studies this outcome can also be linked to the relative greater depth and greater fluctuation of our water table which resulted in greater reduction of water discharge from the controlled drainage system phosphorus losses were mostly related to runoff water providing highest loads with free drainage and open ditches 0 9 po4 p kg ha 1 during the whole period however on average controlled drainage reduced p loads they were 65 less than with free drainage because of reduced outflows in addition the experiment clearly showed that the most hazardous period for surface water pollution was late autumn winter due to the combination of rainy weather and fertilizer application on bare soil peak concentration in drainage water was reached first by phosphorus carried by runoff water and then by nitrogen leached through the soil profile in conclusion although we must not forget that controlled drainage efficiency is related to local soil properties and weather variability the current study clearly shows that even with different rainfall conditions water table management is definitely effective in saving water and reducing nutrient losses to surface water

11524,to evaluate the performances of a controlled drainage system in optimizing water use and reducing nutrient losses from agricultural fields an experimental facility was set up in north eastern italy in 1996 water table management was tested in combination with surface open ditches and subsurface pipe drainage systems data were collected from 2007 to 2013 on water table depth drained volumes nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in groundwater and in drainage water nitrogen in groundwater showed higher concentrations when controlled drainage was combined with open ditches system with a median of 13 43 mg l 1 for no3 n and 18 68 mg l 1 for total n drainage water showed an opposite trend subsurface pipes with free drainage provided highest concentrations due to extensive leaching a median of 20 7 mg l 1 for no3 n and 24 0 mg l 1 for total n phosphorus concentrations showed notable differences in drainage water with higher values in the controlled drainage open ditches system due to surface runoff a median of 0 190 mg l 1 for po4 p and 0 536 mg l 1 for total p in general the most hazardous period for surface water pollution was autumn winter due to rainy weather and fertilizer application on bare soil overall water table management reduced total water discharge by 81 compared to free drainage on average with controlled drainage annual nitrogen losses were lowered by 92 from 29 to 2 kg no3 n ha 1 and annual phosphorus losses by 65 from 0 14 to 0 05 kg po 4p ha 1 free drainage with subsurface pipe was the worst combination from the environmental point of view annual nitrogen and phosphorus losses were 46 kg no3 n ha 1 and 0 10 kg po4 p ha 1 respectively water table management clearly proved to be a reliable tool to improve both water usage and quality keywords controlled drainage pipe drainage surface drainage water saving nitrogen phosphorus 1 introduction saving water is a key issue in modern agriculture in this context managing water outflows may help in optimizing water use and avoiding drought stress in addition there are environmental concerns about nutrient losses via drainage water especially as regards nitrogen and phosphorus pollution and the related eutrophication processes boesch and brinsfield 2000 dodds and smith 2016 skaggs et al 2012 withers and haygarth 2007 controlled drainage is a precipitation harvesting method with the aim of retaining water in the soil according to evans et al 1995 it proved to be capable of both saving water about 30 less outflow volumes than conventional drainage and reducing nutrient losses 30 50 nutrient losses reduction in areas with shallow groundwater controlled drainage allows the water table level to be set at the desired height by retaining an appropriate amount of drainage water in collecting ditches during the coldest and rainiest period when rainfall exceeds evapotranspiration rate autumn and winter in northern italy controlled drainage can be used to avoid complete water outflow and reduce nutrient losses to surface waters however at the same time particular attention must be paid to prevent waterlogging gilliam and skaggs 1986 during the driest period spring and summer especially close to the sowing date of summer crops water table management is crucial to retain as much water as possible in order to avoid drought stress in general to optimize water use proper timing and accuracy are required in regulating water table level ale et al 2009 environmental benefits of controlled drainage have been verified worldwide bonaiti and borin 2010 drury et al 2014 luo et al 2008 sunohara et al 2015 wesström et al 2001 2014 xiao et al 2015 and crop biomass or production can also be improved with results depending on the weather conditions of each year ghane et al 2012 kross et al 2015 madramootoo et al 1993 poole 2015 in addition to minimize uncertainty in water table management simulation models have been applied in many shallow groundwater systems with the aim of predicting the effects of different drainage and water management schemes on water table depth soil moisture and nutrient losses borin et al 2000 fang et al 2012 negm et al 2016 different drainage management strategies and devices are now available to increase water retention and regulate water table level so that controlled drainage is also effectively applied at watershed scale with positive results kröger et al 2015 as reported by skaggs et al 2012 controlled drainage has been widely studied in the united states as well as on glacial derived soils in colder regions canada and sweden however no experiences are reported for the mediterranean area in this context the lower part of the drainage basin of venice lagoon in north eastern italy shows appropriate attributes for the application of controlled drainage as characterized by flat lands and by the presence of a shallow phreatic groundwater at the same time though great fluctuation in water table level during different seasons low organic matter content in these soils and the different climatic conditions may constitute peculiar traits that influence the effects of water table management considered all of this and since venice lagoon is also sensitive to water pollution sfriso 1987 a field experiment was set up in this area in 1996 in order to study the efficacy of controlled drainage in limiting water and nutrient losses from agricultural fields using a combination of two different outflow management strategies free and controlled drainage and two land drainage systems subsurface pipe and open ditches this paper focusing on data collected during the monitoring period 2007 2013 updates the results presented previously on water discharge and n balance borin et al 2002 bonaiti and borin 2010 and adds

station of the regional agency for environmental protection arpav located near the experimental fields long term 1995 2014 average rainfall and air temperature were measured and reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated with hargreaves formula calibrated locally berti et al 2014 long term median annual rainfall is 915 mm y 1 ranging from a minimum of 601 mm y 1 to a maximum of

of 77 mm y 1 the season with the highest median monthly reference evapotranspiration rates is summer 154 mm in june 167 mm in july and 145 mm in august the average annual water balance therefore shows an excess during autumn winter while water shortage occurs in summer fig 1 provides the monthly rainfall and reference evapotranspiration values for the 1995 2014 period annual mean temperature is 13

maximum is july 29 5 c soil in the experimental field is heterogeneous with the following soil texture silt 30 48 sand 15 47 clay 24 45 in general soil of the superficial layers is loam but silt content increases with depth from layer 90 120 cm down soil becomes generally silty loam at 3 m depth an impermeable layer allows the formation of a shallow phreatic groundwater overall there is also a gradient of increasing sand content from west to east our experimental design provides replicates of our theses in different parts of the field thus mitigating eventual effects of soil variability on water fluxes and water quality organic matter content is on average 1 61 in the first layer 0 30 cm and decreases with depth carbonate content is high total limestone is 32 the active fraction 12

is organized in 12 plots 0 3 0 5 ha each with a split plot design consisting of a combination of 2 factors with 3 replicates for each thesis water table management controlled drainage cd or free drainage fd and land drainage system open ditches o or subsurface pipe drainage p fig 2 provides an overall view of the experimental facility controlled drainage plots are located in the northern part of the field separated from free drainage in the southern part by a pvc film buried up to a depth of 1 5 m in order to limit lateral seepage downstream of each plot a 1 2 m delivery ditch collects all the drainage and runoff water in controlled drainage plots a pvc riser is inserted at the end of the ditch to avoid complete outflow the riser is composed of modular pieces which can be assembled in many ways in order to set the maximum level the water in the collecting ditch can reach and consequently influence the water table level inside the plot at the outlet of each delivery ditch a buried pipe takes water into a sump where a turbine flow meter is installed to measure outflow waters composed of a mixture of drainage and runoff water there are 4 sumps in the field each of them collects water from 3 plots and delivers it via a 300 mm diameter pvc buried pipe to the pump of the wetland system the water is then pumped into the constructed flow wetland where it receives further treatment for pollutant removal at the center of each plot a phreatimeter is inserted into the soil up to the depth of 3 m the phreatimeter is made of a perforated pvc pipe so that the water inside the phreatimeter is in equilibrium with the groundwater the 12 phreatimeters are used for water table level measurements and for groundwater samples collection the complete path followed by water from the plots towards the wetland is represented in fig 3 the arpav meteorological station is located in the southern part of the experimental area 2 3 crop management and monitoring all the plots were cultivated with the same techniques and received the same amount of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer sugar beet 2008 winter wheat 2008 09 and maize 2010 2013 were cultivated with conventional tillage techniques and fertilizers were applied in both mineral and organic form with a total average annual input of 254 kg ha 1 of nitrogen and 45 kg ha 1 of phosphorus annual fertilizer inputs and crop growing periods are reported in fig 4 a daily values of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration were measured and calculated from the beginning of the trial in october 2007 until the end in september 2013 monthly cumulative rainfall evapotranspiration and water deficit surplus calculated as the difference between rainfall and et are reported in fig 4b fig 4c shows average water table level of controlled and free drainage fields and riser height in controlled drainage fields from the start of the trial until january 2011 risers were set at 40 cm beneath ground level then raised to 15 cm till the end of the experiment the water table level was monitored at least twice a month and after significant rainfall events it was measured manually with a sonic water sensor mounted on the tip of a tape measure the tape was inserted into the phreatimeter and lowered down until the sensor reached the water and emitted a sound signal and the water table level was wrote down groundwater samples were taken with the help of a portable water pump used to aspire water from the phreatimeter at the outlet of the delivery ditch of each plot where the flow meter is installed outflow volumes were measured and water samples were collected each time discharge occurred all the water samples from both groundwater and outflow water were collected into small pvc containers filtered and refrigerated and then analyzed for nitrate soluble phosphorus total nitrogen and total phosphorus content all these steps were taken following the prescriptions of the italian agency for environmental protection and technical services apat irsa cnr 2003 data collected during the experiment were organized into hydrological years october september to better understand hydrological and nutrient dynamics in relation to annual and seasonal weather trends all the water samples collected during the 2007 13 period were analyzed for no3 n and po4 p concentrations a total of 358 water samples were collected from groundwater and 279 from outflow water starting from october 2009 total n and total p content were assessed too analyses of total p were stopped a bit earlier in 2013 due to the relative high cost and the absence of significant results monitoring periods for outflow volumes water table depth and nutrient concentrations are reported in fig 5 mean monthly flow weighted concentrations of no3 n and po4 p were calculated from the sum of no3 n and po4 p losses of each month divided by the sum of the total flow of the same period baker and johnson 1981 total losses were calculated by multiplying nutrient concentrations with outflow volumes of the same period 2 4 statistical analysis nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations mean flow weighted concentrations and annual losses were checked for anova assumptions normality was checked with shapiro wilk test both raw data and residual were non normally distributed and normalization through data transformation gave inconsistent results homogeneity of variances was tested with levene s test this assumption was violated too overall data collected was uneven and extremely skewed especially for controlled drainage as discharge events happened more rarely than with free drainage a non parametric approach was therefore preferred kruskal wallis test was performed with a post hoc comparison of mean ranks of all pairs of groups with bonferroni correction this appeared to be the most suitable way to analyze our data even if this approach did not permit us to assess the extent of the interaction between the two studied factors water table management and land drainage system in graphs and tables different letters were assigned to theses not coming from identical populations p value 0 05 null hypothesis rejected for monthly concentrations and annual losses statistical tests were carried out separately for each month year all statistical analyses and graphs were made using statistica 8 statsoft inc 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 n and p concentrations fig 6 outlines groundwater no3 n po4 p total n and total p concentrations for the whole trial period significant differences between theses p 0 05 were found only for nitrogen content in particular no3 n concentrations were definitely higher in cd o groundwater with a median of 13 43 mg l 1 second was fd o with a median of 8 77 mg l 1 followed by cd p median of 8 15 mg l 1 lowest values were found in fd p median of 1 65 mg l 1 the same trend was observed for total nitrogen even though less data is available compared to the soluble form we can see that cd o gave higher values median of 18 68 mg l 1 followed by fd o median of 10 14 mg l 1 and cd p median of 8 16 mg l 1 again lowest values were found in fd p a median of 1 88 mg l 1 as regards phosphorus there were no significant differences between theses for either po4 p or total p soluble p median values ranged from 0 008 mg l 1 fd o to 0 013 mg l 1 fd p while total p median values from 0 020 mg l 1 fd o to 0 032 mg l 1 fd p outflow water samples were collected more frequently during late autumn winter and early spring when discharge occurred more often fig 7 plots their nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations considering the trial period 2007 13 as a whole both no3 n and total n gave higher values with fd p a median of 20 7 mg l 1 for nitrate nitrogen and 24 0 mg l 1 for total nitrogen conversely free drainage with open ditches fd o provided significantly lower concentrations of nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen with medians of 6 1 mg l 1 and 7 4 mg l 1 respectively moreover lower concentrations were obtained when water table management was applied especially with cd o for no3 n the median was 0 9 mg l 1 for total n 2 6 mg l 1 in particular significant differences were found between fd p and both open ditches theses for no3 n and total n and for nitrate nitrogen also between cd o and all other treatments just to provide a touchstone if we consider the nitrates threshold used by the world health organization to identify potable water world health organization 2011 which is 50 mg l 1 of nitrates about 11 3 mg l 1 of no3 n we can see that 84 of nitrate nitrogen data from fd p falls above that value whereas only 8 of data from cd o and 33 from cd p exceeds the limit confirming the results obtained in lysimetric studies in the same environment borin et al 2001 in terms of phosphorus content cd o gave highest values for po4 p median of 0 190 mg l 1 and total p median of 0 536 mg l 1 in fact in the open ditches system excess water is usually removed with runoff borin et al 1997 and both soluble and particulate phosphorus generally moves in surface water runoff boesch and brinsfield 2000 considering groundwater and drainage water concentrations together it is possible to highlight the overall behavior of nitrogen and phosphorus as they follow the water path in our case as regards groundwater quality higher nitrogen concentrations were found in the open ditches system because leached nitrogen was not removed by tile drainage at the same time nitrogen concentrations in drainage water were higher with subsurface pipe indicating it as the worst land drainage system in terms of protecting surface water from nitrogen pollution as already pointed out by bonaiti and borin 2010 drury et al 2014 and evans et al 1995 in addition if we compare theses with the same land drainage system but different water table management we can see that there are no significant differences in groundwater n concentrations even though controlled drainage seems to tend towards higher values conversely to what we found some authors reported a decrease in groundwater nitrogen concentrations when controlled drainage was applied kalita and kanwar 1993 wesström et al 2001 indicating denitrification as the main responsible for this trend in our site though the application of controlled drainage did not maintain the water table at a constant level as already reported in the previous study by bonaiti and borin 2010 the effect of controlled drainage in wet periods was to slightly raise the water table level after rainfall events and to lag the drop by a few days without creating persistent anaerobic conditions since continuous wet conditions and high organic matter content are required for denitrification processes to take place gilliam and skaggs 1986 we can assume that in our case the sole installation of the control structure was not sufficient to promote denitrification to such an extent to steadily reduce nitrogen content in groundwater as regards the effect of controlled drainage on drainage water we found an overall decrease in nitrogen concentrations when it was applied similar results were reported by evans et al 1989 1995 and lalonde et al 1996 regarding phosphorus we noticed that the groundwater content showed no clear trend whereas the drainage water concentrations were higher with open ditches indeed as a general rule while tile drainage increases water infiltration into soil open ditches produce greater surface runoff evans et al 1995 as a consequence while nitrogen content in drainage water is higher with tile drainage water coming from open ditches may be richer in sediments and phosphorus konyha et al 1992 on the other hand the application of water table management was not effective in reducing phosphorus content in outflow water these results reflect what was found by many studies on phosphorus transport as pointed out by king et al 2015 3 2 nutrient concentrations over time collection of data on soluble forms of nitrogen and phosphorus in outflow water permitted to outline the seasonal changes in nutrient concentrations considering all the samples collected during the trial period to provide a reliable comparison between the nutrient content found in different outflow volumes mean monthly outflows and mean monthly flow weighted concentrations were considered results averaged over the years are reported in fig 8 no3 n concentrations started to rise in late autumn reaching a peak in winter and decreasing in early spring according to drury et al 1996 highest nitrogen content in drainage water can be found when soil is not covered by the crop especially if fertilizer is applied in this period in our field trial a summer crop was cultivated during 5 out of 6 years soil was not covered by vegetation during autumn and winter and for 2 years liquid manure was applied in autumn so that the observed trend can be easily justified in more detail there was a sudden increase in fd p between november and december when soluble nitrogen reached a concentration of 30 33 mg l 1 this peak was strongly influenced by the high values reported in december 2012 when intensive rainfall events quickly removed nitrogen stored in soil probably accumulated because of a poor maize harvest the previous summer moreover after a decline during march no3 n concentrations rose again in april this result was influenced by the behavior of the 2007 08 hydrological season rainfall in autumn and winter was not enough to generate significant outflows so that nitrogen in soil was still available for leaching during the spring when high concentrations were measured furthermore sugarbeet was cultivated in that year fertilizations started in february increasing the amount of leaching in early spring as reported by billy et al 2013 dry periods increase nitrogen stock in soil causing a rise in water concentrations during the subsequent rainy period the time trend of po4 p was anticipated with respect to nitrogen and there was a more severe decline in late winter indeed as pointed out by king et al 2015 phosphorus content in outflow water is higher if rain falls immediately after a fertilizer application whereas it decreases quickly as time passes unlike nitrogen phosphorus is mostly removed from agricultural fields with the first runoff events of the rainy season 3 3 total water discharge and total nutrient losses total water discharge october 2007 september 2013 varied greatly among treatments overall fd p drained 1296 mm fd o 932 mm cd o 284 mm and cd p 131 mm table 1 if water saving is the main goal free drainage especially with subsurface pipe should be avoided whereas controlled drainage can be used to prevent water being wasted on average controlled drainage reduced water discharge by 81 draining a total of 208 mm of water against 1114 mm of free drainage during the period considered in the previous work on the same site the reduction was lower 72 as reported by bonaiti and borin 2010 however as indicated by skaggs et al 2012 water table management performances in reducing drainage losses may vary some authors as in our case reported water saving rates of more than 80 lalonde et al 1996 wesström and messing 2007 depending mostly on the weather during the trial period water output input ratio i e drainage coefficient was also calculated to quantify the total amount of rainwater drained table 1 during the monitoring periods free drainage with subsurface pipe fd p discharged more than half of the water supplied by rainfall events with a 0 514 ratio fd o drainage coefficient was lower 0 370 and treatments with water table regulation retained most of the rainwater with output input ratio of 0 112 for cd o and 0 052 for cd p cumulative nutrient losses via drainage water were also calculated nitrate nitrogen showed total losses of 229 kg n ha 1 for fd p 57 kg n ha 1 for fd o 16 kg n ha 1 for cd p 7 kg n ha 1 for cd o fig 9 a subsurface pipe with free drainage had both the highest nitrogen content in drainage water and the highest outflow volumes this combination clearly gave the worst performance from an environmental point of view leading to huge losses towards surface water over the entire period cd p reduced nitrogen losses by 93 respect to fd p cd o reduced n losses of 88 respect to fd o the percentage of reduction of n losses is consistent with the percentage of reduction of water outflows as similarly pointed out by skaggs et al 2012 anyway such high rates of reduction in water and nitrogen loads are not common since many previous works report outflow water reduction between 18 and 85 and n loads reduction between 18 and 79 skaggs et al 2012 in our case though greater fluctuation of the water table level during different seasons as well as the installation of control structures at the outlet of the delivery ditches instead of directly in the field may have played an important role in enhancing the effectiveness of controlled drainage in water and nitrate losses reduction as the outflow water rarely reached the top of the control structures phosphorus losses fig 9b were highest with open ditches and free drainage 0 9 po4 p kg ha 1 again controlled drainage even with higher po4 p concentrations as in cd o showed the lowest losses because of reduced total outflows 0 5 po4 p kg ha 1 for cd o and 0 0 po4 p kg ha 1 for cd p gilliam and skaggs 1986 analyzed nutrient behavior in drainage water showing a similar situation generally nitrates and phosphorus have an opposite trend the former mainly increase with subsurface drainage the latter with run off our case confirms open ditches as the land drainage system with the highest phosphorus losses as it provides the highest p concentrations even though the outflow volumes are lower than in tile drainage nevertheless when water table control was applied to open ditches phosphorus losses were reduced by 47 this pattern is consistent with what tan and zhang 2011 observed despite an increase in soluble p concentrations caused by water table management phosphorus losses were reduced as a result of lower discharge since nitrate nitrogen losses were strongly correlated to cumulative outflows it was possible to collect further information fig 10 plots cumulative losses against cumulative outflows for each treatment a linear relationship was found between the two variables the slopes of the regression lines express the nitrogen losses per unit of water discharged as reported in table 1 they were 0 173 0 055 0 105 and 0 024 kg ha 1 per mm of water for fd p fd o cd p and cd o respectively comparing data on nitrogen losses with the previous monitoring period bonaiti and borin 2010 the rate of no3 n losses reduction provided by controlled drainage has increased while the average reduction in this study is 92 in the previous one it was 70 in general terms during the 2007 2013 period both higher water discharge due to the weather trend and greater nitrogen concentrations due to higher fertilization rates were observed the combination of these two elements increased the gap in nitrogen losses between controlled and free drainage with respect to the previous study this clearly suggests that in the same pedological conditions the performance of controlled drainage depends on the weather and on crop and fertilizer management this is consistent with what was observed by drury et al 2009 lastly by introducing the ratio between discharge and rainfall volumes output input the values of nitrate nitrogen concentrations per mm of input water were obtained for a summary of these results see table 1 free drainage combined with subsurface pipe gave the worst performance 0 089 no3 n kg ha 1 per mm of water input the controlled drainage system reduced that value by 94 total nitrogen and phosphorus losses were compared to the losses of their soluble forms with regard to the periods in which both were monitored as shown in table 2 in subsurface pipe treatments no3 n contributes the most to total nitrogen losses by 54 3 on average this indicates an increased nitrates rate when subsurface drainage is applied caused by the leaching of this soluble form on the contrary po4 p rates were higher with open ditches 85 9 of total p on average phosphorus is normally removed with soil particles through runoff but the process is influenced by weather conditions saturation of the soil sorptive matrix and frequency and quantity of fertilizer inputs mcdowell 2012 in our case liquid manure was applied in autumn as assessed by sharpley and moyer 2000 the high rate of soluble phosphorus in manure increases the potential for enrichment of runoff water instead with subsurface drainage the infiltration of enriched water into the soil profile forces phosphorus to interact with the soil buffering capacity decreasing the proportion of the soluble form in drained water to provide an overall synopsis of this work annual no3 n and po4 p losses are reported in table 3 during the trial period free drainage with subsurface pipe removed on average 46 no3 n kg ha 1 per year while free drainage combined with open ditches system gave 12 kg ha 1 no3 n losses per year considering the mean nitrogen input from fertilizers application 254 kg ha 1 per year on average the output input ratio was 18 0 for fd p and 4 6 for fd o controlled drainage losses were only 1 3 kg ha 1 per year with an output input ratio of 0 5 1 3 highlighting a notable decrease with both land drainage systems compared to conventional drainage as regards the period from october 2009 until the end of the trial when total nitrogen losses were calculated we found an average output input ratio of 38 8 for fd p and 12 3 for fd o while the ratio for cd p was 3 2 and for cd o 2 8 it can be noted that while the subsurface drainage was responsible for the loss of nearly 40 of the nitrogen globally introduced into the system controlled drainage brought that percentage to 2 3 po4 p provided the highest mean losses with fd o 0 18 kg ha 1 y 1 second was cd o 0 10 kg ha 1 y 1 then fd p 0 10 kg ha 1 y 1 and last cd p 0 00 kg ha 1 y 1 overall land drainage system affected phosphorus removal more than water table management however the output input ratio was below 0 5 in all cases as regards total phosphorus from october 2009 until the end of the trial the output input ratio remained below 1 with no clear differences between treatments 4 conclusions the experiment studied the effects on hydrology and nutrient behavior of controlled drainage combined with two different land drainage systems open ditches and subsurface pipe overall controlled drainage proved to be a good system for maintaining water at field level since it reduced total water discharge by 81 conventional systems drained between 37 and 51 of total rainfall while systems in which water table was regulated only drained between 5 and 11 considering the environmental concerns related to surface water nitrogen pollution the worst combination was free drainage with subsurface pipe because of greater infiltration rates and higher water discharge it removed leached nitrogen via drainage water much more intensively 229 kg ha 1 of no3 n during the whole period for an average annual value of 46 kg ha 1 on the other hand controlled drainage generally reduced nitrogen losses despite the land drainage system adopted on average by 92 compared to free drainage indeed water table management reduced both nitrate concentrations in drainage water and water discharge on a percentage basis the effect of controlled drainage on n loads was similar to its effect on outflow volumes and cumulative nitrogen losses showed a strong linear correlation with cumulative outflow volumes in general our experiment showed higher reduction rates in both water discharge and nitrogen losses respect to results reported by many other studies this outcome can also be linked to the relative greater depth and greater fluctuation of our water table which resulted in greater reduction of water discharge from the controlled drainage system phosphorus losses were mostly related to runoff water providing highest loads with free drainage and open ditches 0 9 po4 p kg ha 1 during the whole period however on average controlled drainage reduced p loads they were 65 less than with free drainage because of reduced outflows in addition the experiment clearly showed that the most hazardous period for surface water pollution was late autumn winter due to the combination of rainy weather and fertilizer application on bare soil peak concentration in drainage water was reached first by phosphorus carried by runoff water and then by nitrogen leached through the soil profile in conclusion although we must not forget that controlled drainage efficiency is related to local soil properties and weather variability the current study clearly shows that even with different rainfall conditions water table management is definitely effective in saving water and reducing nutrient losses to surface water
