21840,in addition to other studies focused on the wrf performance of rainfall temperature and precipitation the present study provides practical suggestions for ship operators on choosing grid point value gpv datasets and wrf modeling approaches to help make better decisions on weather routing by estimating strong wind with a higher accuracy two different gpv datasets the ncep fnl and era interim are used for wrf modeling various modeling approaches which include applying different physics options and choosing whether to adopt the four dimensional data assimilation are employed for numerical simulation then on board measurements of a bulk carrier has been used to validate the calculated wind of eight rough sea navigational cases this occurs over a wide spatial range covering ocean regions such as the northwest pacific ocean south of australia tasman sea southeast of africa and southeast of america as well as a wide temporal range of four years results of 64 wrf simulations show that era interim is suitable for longer periods while ncep fnl can analyze extremely high winds additionally grid nudging can also reduce the wind strength due to its smoothing effect finally selections of these different gpv datasets and modeling approaches for ship weather routing are discussed particularly for rough sea navigations keywords wrf regional model physics parametrization schemes gpv datasets gridded nudging rough sea navigation ship weather routing 1 introduction the weather research and forecasting wrf model has been widely used with terrain following mass coordinates and the 3rd order runge kutta integration scheme skamarock and klemp 2008 as a next generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction model for operational forecasting and atmospheric research jianfeng g u et al 2005 davis et al 2008 cha and wang 2013 this demonstrates the high capability and flexibility of the wrf model to elucidate various atmospheric phenomena in different regions however due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere and sensitivities of wrf attention should also be paid to selecting the most appropriate initial and or boundary conditions and combination of physical parametrizations doing so will yield more accurate model results for various application purposes or regions of interest to evaluate the wrf performance for wind simulation and wind energy in portugal carvalho et al 2014 compared an older reanalysis ncep r2 with three recently released reanalysis datasets era interim nasa merra and ncep cfsr as well as ncep gfs and ncep fnl analysis distributed from the ncep national centers for environmental prediction kalnay et al 1996 they found that among the initial and boundary conditions of the datasets tested here era interim reanalysis which is distributed from the ecmwf european center for medium range weather forecasts dee et al 2011 likely provides the most realistic initial and boundary data because it offers the best estimates of local wind regimes and potential wind energy production they also showed that the ncep gfs and ncep fnl analyses seem to be the best alternatives to era interim particularly in cases where reliable forcing data are needed quickly for real time applications and according to carvalho et al carvalho et al 2012 error minimization in wind simulation can be achieved by testing and choosing a suitable numerical and physical configuration for the region of interest as well as using high resolution terrain data therefore in addition to the different effects from gpv datasets the selections of combinations of physics parametrizations are also of great importance for generating results with more accuracy though there are many possibilities provided by the wrf model numerous previous studies have investigated the effects of wrf physics schemes on model performance most previous studies on wrf and gpv datasets focused on operational applications such as surface temperature mooney et al 2011 relative humidity reflectivity rainfall evans et al 2012 politi et al 2018 zeyaeyan et al 2017 and wrf chem aliabadi et al 2015 marelle et al 2016 roiger et al 2016 for a certain period in a particular geographical region mostly land areas and validated the model results using land based or coast based observations as pointed out by gunwani gunwani et al 2017 the performance evaluation using the wrf model may agree better in terms of temperature and relative humidity compared to wind speed for different climatic zones over india however only a few of those previous studies attempted to apply wrf in the generation of high resolution wind fields for ship weather routing even though an accurate forecast of wind velocity on the ocean surface is of great importance for the safety economic and environmental aspects of ship weather routing originally proposed by james 1957 optimum ship routing has been increasingly recognized as vital to making shipping safer more economical and environmentally friendly to construct a numerical ship navigation system chen et al 2013 2015 simulated the weather and ocean in the osaka bay of japan and the east china sea using wrf with ncep fnl input for wind generation validations with jma observations showed that high resolution wrf calculations provided wind distributions to enable ship navigation with acceptable accuracy the previous studies only confirmed wind simulations using land based observations neglecting the wind validation on the ocean surface where ships stay most of the other related studies also focused on the north pacific ocean hagiwara and spaans 1987 takashima et al 2009 lin et al 2013 the mediterranean sea delitala et al 2010 the north indian ocean sen and padhy 2015 and the north atlantic ocean chen 1978 hinnenthal and clauss 2010 shao et al 2012 with increasing imports of resources and renewables each year from countries in the southern hemisphere including brazil africa australia and asian countries like china and japan the number of ships on the south north route including bulk carriers tankers and liquefied natural gas lng carriers is likely to increase therefore the construction of an optimum ship routing system covering the southern hemisphere is of great importance however according to vettor and guedes soares vettor and guedes soares 2016 the number of observations is still insufficient for constructing ship routing systems from wind and wave analyses in the southern hemisphere as ocean state observation methods such as remote sensing by satellite and buoy data are limited in spatial temporal resolution and location high resolution numerical weather and ocean simulations as well as validation with on board observations could emerge as an efficient route way generating relatively accurate ocean surface wind and sea states especially for rough sea navigation a six year on board observation study of weather ocean and ship motion was conducted from 2010 using a 20 000 dwt class bulk carrier covering both the southern and the northern hemispheres sasa et al 2015 have studied two rough sea navigation cases showing the reliability of our observation system by validating ocean waves with simulations as a next step study lu et al 2017 focused on three rough sea navigations in the southern hemisphere in an attempt to clarify proper weather and ocean generation methods for ship routing however the limited number and areas of rough seas studied lower the strength of the evidence in this study to further investigate the uncertainty of gpv datasets and wrf modeling approaches for ocean surface high wind generation as well as develop an optimal ship routing with encountered weather data for merchant vessels hind cast simulations of the high resolution wrf model were conducted for eight rough sea cases using both the era interim and ncep fnl for wrf input covering a larger area including both the southern and the northern hemispheres with more sufficient temporal and spatial variability including all seasons as well as modeling approaches such as wrf fdda additionally two groups of physics combinations were set according to evans et al 2012 to clarify the performances of the wrf parameterizations in terms of wind generation across both the southern and northern hemispheres results of wrf simulations were evaluated with on board observations and suggestions for ship weather routing are provided the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the on board observation system and data collection details are provided the model configuration is provided in section 3 validations of model results with on board observations are shown in section 4 finally in section 5 conclusions of this study and suggestions for future research are summarized 2 on board observations and case studies 2 1 observation vessel a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier transporting cargo as a tramper was used for on board observations the onboard measurement has been conducted since june 2010 for 6 years however there were mechanical failures around pcs from 2011 to 2012 and power supplies from 2014 to 2015 measured data does not exist in most of these periods and there were few rough sea conditions between 2015 and 2016 thus extracted rough sea voyages are analyzed in 2010 2011 2013 2016 the carrier s routes mainly cover oceans between asian countries and areas of the southern hemisphere such as the oceania and south america where ocean states are generally rougher than in the northern hemisphere due to smaller landmasses 2 2 observation cases to ensure that the research conclusion is more convincing as well as enhance our understanding of rough sea navigation we selected eight observation cases from all experimental periods for analysis across both the northern cases 1 and 2 and southern hemispheres cases 3 8 and a fully seasonal variability spring cases 3 and 4 summer case 2 autumn cases 1 5 and 6 and winter cases 7 and 8 the blue stars in fig 1 show all geographical locations where the ship experienced high wind and the wrf model domains considered for these eight cases detailed weather and ship conditions for each observation case are shown in table 1 weather data including wind speed and wind direction on the ocean surface are created using the averaged values for a 10 min time series obtained every second the measurement system consists of the inertial measurement unit nav440 and other censors which are originally installed for the ship there are two data sources there one is from the nav440 another is from the vdr voyage data recorder and engine data logger connected with all the sensors inside the ship these data are recorded into two laptops through lan cables the reliability of nav440 and other sensors is already shown for real ships sasa et al 2015 sasa et al 2019 and all the measured data can be reliable the wind anemometer is installed on the top of the ship structure and used in daily operation of the bulk carrier which can observe the relative wind speed and direction with little influence of air flow induced by ship structure as measurement facilities are a height of about 30 m over sea surface the smith method smith 1981 was used to interpolate the measured wind to the 10 m wind velocity then ship speed and course data obtained by the vdr were used to calculate the real wind velocity over ground 3 model configuration 3 1 model boundary conditions to generate ocean surface wind fields for all eight rough sea cases version 3 8 1 of the advanced research wrf arw is utilized in this study it has been developed by the national center for atmospheric research ncar skamarock w c 2008 the alternating pbl schemes surface layers cumulus schemes radiation schemes and microphysics schemes in the ensemble are described in section 3 2 all experiments use the noah land surface model chen and dudhia 2001 gpv datasets including both the national centers for the environmental prediction final ncep fnl operation model global tropospheric analyses ncep nws noaa u s department of commerce 2000 and the european center for medium range weather forecasts interim reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 have been utilized as the initial and boundary conditions for wrf model ncep fnl analyses offer 1 1 grids covering the global region while era interim offers a spatial resolution of approximately 80 km 0 75 both these boundary conditions are updated every 6 h for all these eight cases the wrf model was run with a horizontal resolution of 0 1 and an output time interval of 3 h the vertical resolution of the model was 30 eta levels spaced closely together in the pbl for each case we chose a day window around one week that centered on the peak of the low pressures for model evaluations in accordance with the on board observations 3 2 modeling approaches and experimental design at first according to lo et al 2008 the traditional continuous integration approach used by lu 2017 could poorly simulate the forcing variables such as pressure temperature wind and moisture due to the model drifting from the forcing reanalysis during long integrations he also noted that downscaling simulations using three dimensional 3 d analysis nudging could constrain the error growth in large scale circulation during the long simulation generating realistic regional scale patterns that are not resolved by the coarse resolution fnl used to nudge the model this holds especially true for meteorological fields near the surface in the present wrf calculations to further understand the uncertainties of the wrf results as illustrated by lu 2017 the grid nudging method stauffer and seaman 1990 referred to as fdda four dimensional data assimilation was used to measure winds u and v and temperature for all vertical layers but the pbl with a time interval between analysis times of 360 min a ramping time period of 60 min and nudging coefficient of 0 0003 the grid nudging method is a specific 3 d analysis whereby the atmospheric model is nudged toward time and space interpolated analyses using a point by point relaxation term secondly according to carvalho carvalho et al 2012 the wrf model can be significantly affected by the choice of boundary layer parameterizations for near surface wind simulations it offers different options for the representations of microphysics radiative processes convective processes turbulent transports as well as evolution of surface temperature and soil moisture this study examines the performance of two combinations of physical parameterizations for real data applications in the wrf model with regards to all eight cases considering both the model accuracy and computational efficiency these include cloud microphysics wrf single moment 3 class and eta ferrier scheme following hong hong et al 2006 and ferrier ferrier et al 2002 the cumulus parameterization kain fritsch and bets miller janjic following kain and fritsch kain and fritsch 1990 and betts and miller betts and miller 1986 janjic 1994 the pbl schemes yonsei university and the mellor yamada janjic following hong hong and pan 1996 and janjic janjic 2002 the surface layer physics using revised the mm5 scheme and eta similarity scheme following jimenez jimenez pedro a 2012 and janjic janjic z i 1996 2002 and the short and long wave radiation schemes rapid radiative transfer model and rrtmg scheme following mlawer mlawer et al 1997 and iacono iacono et al 2008 respectively in the present study for calculating various wrf physics schemes such as cloud microphysics cumulus physics shortwave longwave radiation pbl and surface layer physics a combination of wsm 3 class kf dudhia rrtm ysu and monin obukhov has been utilized for param 1 while another combination of eta ferrier bmj rrtmg rrtmg myj and janjic eta has been utilized for param 2 using a single nest approach a total of 64 wrf simulations wrf arw version 3 8 were conducted for all eight cases to determine the influence of the utilization of fdda and different physics combinations on model results with particular emphasis on the ocean surface wind distributions flowchart of the model simulation and mmodel settings of wrf for wind generations in these 64 numerical experiments are shown in fig 2 4 model results as mentioned in the end of section 1 the observed wind speed following the moving vessel for all cases was averaged for a 1 h time series obtained every second for validation with wrf results fig 3 more detailed results analysis as well as discussions are provided in section 5 5 model evaluation 5 1 evaluation statistics to further determine the uncertainties of different gpv datasets and modeling approaches in wind simulation the bias and root mean squared error rmse of the wind speed and pitch motions over observations were calculated according to eq 1 and eq 2 1 b i a s c i o i n 2 r m s e c i o i 2 n where c and o represent the model calculations and on board observations of a certain time period n for all rough sea navigation cases respectively bias indicates systematic errors while the rmse provides the total errors 5 2 divisions of model results for validations wind strength wind duration wind location according to the final objective of the present study being selecting the best gpv dataset and wrf modeling approach for ship routing we divide the final objective into three ones as selection of the better gpv dataset ncep fnl era interim better nudging method fdda no fdda as well as better physics parametrizations param 1 param 2 as shown in table 2 table 3 shows the three group division categories established after dividing by all cases the study defines clearly the differences between parameterizations param 1 param 2 wrf modeling approaches w o fdda and gpv datasets ncep fnl era interim for wind reanalysis over the ocean surface at first depending on the maximum wind speed wind strength all eight simulated cases are divided into four ranges as a v m a x 12 m s cases 2 and 6 b 12 v m a x 15 m s cases 4 5 and 8 c 15 m s v m a x 20 m s cases 1 and 3 d v m a x 20 m s case 7 secondly considering the risk of period the ship has taken two ranges of simulation periods wind duration were considered a total period including the time period for the wind simulations for approximately one week b peak period only for the time period corresponding to the highest wind speed for approximately one day including both 12 h before and after the highest wind finally in addition to the above two factors wind strength and duration affecting the generation and propagation of ocean surface waves the performances of different gpv datasets and modeling approaches among all eight cases were compared for different locations wind location divided along the northern and southern hemispheres 5 2 1 wind strength referring to the beaufort scale and considering the on board observations four ranges of wind strength were established as shown in table 2 to determine the effects of various modeling approaches using different gpv datasets on wind simulation the rmse and bias of the simulated and on board observed wind speeds and wind directions of these four ranges were calculated and then compared depending on 8 wrf modeling approaches for example consider param 1 param 2 fdda no fdda fnl and era in fig 4 a here param 1 and param 2 signify the no 1 and no 2 groups of physics options for the cloud microphysics scheme cumulus scheme long wave and short wave radiation schemes and pbl scheme shown in fig 2 respectively fdda and no fdda signify the utilization and non utilization of the grid nudging method respectively and fnl and era signify the utilization of the gpv datasets of ncep fnl and era interim respectively fig 4 shows the rmse and bias values of wind speed by wind strength fig 4 a and fig 4 c show all rmse and bias values for these four ranges of wind strength by all kinds of wrf simulations fig 4 b and fig 4 d show the averaged rmse and bias values of wind speed for them respectively at first it can be clearly seen in fig 4 a and fig 4 b that compared with weak and strong winds such as v m a x 12 m s and v m a x 20 m s all wrf simulations tend to perform better for intermediate wind conditions including 12 m s v m a x 15 m s and 15 m s v m a x 20 m s this result coincides with conclusions made by d carvalho 2014 then in fig 4 c and fig 4 d wrf simulations tend to underestimate more of the extremely high wind such as for case 7 where v m a x 20 m s a better performance by param 2 for generating weak wind can be found in fig 4 c a relatively large difference in absolute bias i e v m a x 12 m s and 12 m s v m a x 15 m s while param 1 has an opposite tendency to generate better results for high wind i e 15 m s v m a x 20 m s and v m a x 20 m s besides the no fdda modeling approach seems to perform better than fdda the reason could be that the grid nudging method used here tends to underestimate wind strength because of its smoothing effects as shown in fig 4 a and fig 4 c which was also pointed out by vincent c l vincent and hahmann 2015 and nakano 2010 regardless of the gpv datasets the era interim dataset has relatively smaller rmse values compared to ncep fnl but it should be noticed here that era interim tends to underestimate more of relatively higher wind conditions as shown in fig 4 c 12 m s v m a x 15 m s 15 m s v m a x 20 m s v m a x 20 m s fig 5 shows the rmse and bias values of wind direction by wind strength fig 5 a and fig 5 b show that rmse for intermediate wind speeds is between those for lower and higher wind speeds respectively then fig 5 c shows that the wrf tends to generate relatively clockwise wind for most cases except for the highest wind in case 7 where wrf did not accurately simulate the wind direction for a long time period approximately two days of weak wind wind speed less than 5 m s compared with on board observations this may be due to the wrf generating wind direction with a relatively low accuracy when the wind speed is low the param 2 tends to generate better wind direction for low wind while the param 1 performs better for high wind with smaller rmse values in fig 5 a generally the era interim performs better for wind direction shown in fig 5 a while the ncep fnl has a smaller underestimation in the highest wind case shown in fig 5 c 5 2 2 wind duration to determine the different performances of the various wrf simulations on wind generation for ship routing especially in dangerous situations with rough seas and strong ocean surface wind two groups termed total period and peak period were compared for all eight rough sea cases where the former refers to the entire period of wrf simulation for each case and the latter refers to the period around the maximum wind speed with time lengths of approximately one week and one day respectively the rmse and bias of the simulated and on board observed wind speed and wind direction of these two groups were calculated and then compared for all utilized wrf modeling approaches as illustrated in section 5 2 1 fig 6 shows the rmse and bias values of wind speed by wind duration fig 6 a and fig 6 c show all rmse and bias values for the two groups total period and peak period of wind duration using all wrf simulations while fig 6 b and fig 6 d show the averaged rmse and bias values of wind speed for these two groups it is clear in fig 6 a and fig 6 b that compared with total period group the peak period group has smaller rmse and absolute bias values which implies that the wrf tends to perform better for relatively high wind peak period which only includes the high wind period as opposed to weak wind total period which includes both high and weak wind for the gpv dataset fig 6 a shows a better performance of era interim than ncep fnl for the total period including both weak wind and high wind periods but an opposite tendency for the peak period only for high wind this shows that ncep fnl tends to perform better for high wind while era interim provides a better result for relatively weaker wind it can also be found from fig 6 c that the utilization of fdda tends to increase the underestimation of wind speed owning to its smoothing effects regarding to the physical parameterizations the param 1 performs better than param 2 especially for the peak period as shown in fig 6 c which also agrees with the finding in fig 4 that param 1 performs better than param 2 in case of generation high wind speed the reason why absolute averaged value of bias for the total period is lower than that of the peak period is the underestimation of extremely high wind for the peak period as shown for cases 3 5 and 8 in fig 3 fig 7 shows the rmse and bias values of wind direction by wind duration all panels in fig 7 show that wrf can generate better wind direction for high wind peak period than for weak wind total period agreeing with d carvalho 2014 fig 7 a shows that param 1 provides a more accurate result than param 2 for peak wind this also agrees with the above analysis from rmse values of wind speed by wind strength in fig 4 fdda when utilized with a smoothing effect tends to improve the performance of wind direction generation with a greater effect on high wind than weak wind fig 7 a for the gpv dataset all three figures in fig 7 show that era interim performs better than ncep fnl for the generation of wind direction then in fig 7 c the positive bias values indicate that wrf tends to generate relatively clockwise wind for most cases fig 7 c also shows a relatively larger negative effect of fdda on generating the wind direction for weak wind total period than high wind peak period 5 2 3 wind location finally the present study tries to focus on the different effects of the 8 above mentioned wrf modeling approaches on the generation of ocean surface wind for the southern and northern hemispheres fig 8 shows the rmse and bias values of wind speed by wind duration fig 8 a and fig 8 c show all rmse and bias values for the two groups northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere of wind location using all wrf simulations fig 8 b and fig 8 d show the averaged rmse and bias values of wind speed for these two groups using all wrf modeling approaches all these four panels in fig 8 clearly show that compared with the southern hemisphere group the northern hemisphere group has relatively smaller rmse and absolute bias values which implies that these wrf modeling approaches tend to perform better for the northern hemisphere fig 8 a further shows that param 1 provides a better result than param 2 owing to its better performance for high wind which also agrees with the above analysis for the rmse values of wind speed by wind strength fig 8 c again shows that fdda with a smoothing effect tends to underestimate wind more significantly agreeing with the results obtained for bias values of wind speed by wind strength in fig 4 c regarding to gpv datasets era interim performs slightly worse than ncep fnl in southern hemisphere possibly due to its poorer performance in generating high wind such case 7 the highest wind as shown in fig 3 fig 9 shows the rmse and bias values of wind direction by wind location fig 9 a and fig 9 b show that wrf has a tendency to generate better wind direction for the northern hemisphere group than the southern hemisphere also fig 9 c shows that param 2 provides better results than param 1 owing to the poorer performance of param 1 for the northern hemisphere group moreover the use of fdda with a smoothing effect tends to further delay the accurate estimation of wind direction especially for extreme high wind periods as shown in fig 4 furthermore for the gpv dataset all figures indicate a better performance of era interim than ncep fnl for the generation of wind direction then in fig 9 c the positive bias values indicate that wrf tends to generate relatively clockwise wind for most cases although it appears that the bias values of the northern hemisphere group are higher than those of the southern hemisphere group from fig 9 c it should be noted that the bias values are a combination of several cases that also include the high negative values of the latter group leading to lower bias values for the latter group as shown in fig 9 c 5 2 4 evaluation wrf performance for all cases to have an overall division of wrf performance for all cases fig 10 is given where fig 10 a and fig 10 b are the averaged rmse and bias values of wind speed of all wrf simulations in all eight cases while fig 10 c and fig 10 d are those values of wind direction in terms of the physical parametrizations the smaller rmse value in fig 10 a and a larger one in fig 10 c show that the param 1 performs better for wind speed same as other studies xm hu et al 2010 and meb frediani et al 2016 but worse for wind direction when compared with param 2 the reason why the bias value of param 1 is smaller than param 2 is that the param 1 performs better for high wind while the param 2 has an opposite tendency which can be illustrated in fig 4 c and fig 5 c compared with the era interim the ncep fnl tends to overestimate more of wind speed as shown in fig 10 a and it can be shown in fig 10 c and fig 10 d that the ear interim has a better performance on wind direction than the ncep fnl which agrees with another study by carvalho d 2014 that wrf simulation driven with era interim presents the lowest errors for the wind direction owning to its smoothing effects as pointed out by vincent c l vincent and hahmann 2015 and nakano 2010 the utilization of fdda can increase the underestimation of wind speed as shown in fig 10 b and the smaller rmse value of fdda in fig 10 a results from the relatively large underestimation of low wind cases as shown in fig 4 a regarding to the wind direction the fdda also has a larger effect on low wind generation than high wind as shown in fig 7 c and fig 8 c 6 discussions on uncertainties of wrf modeling approaches and gpv datasets 6 1 influences of fdda approach on model results generally regional climate models rcms like the wrf connect global driving fields only through the lateral boundaries meanwhile if model domains of rcm are set in zones where global circulation mechanisms and upper air large scale patterns exist these patterns are possibly not very well reproduced by the rcm because it may develop unrealistic circulation patterns and generate inaccuracy of important large scale features the fdda can help constrain the rcm by choosing 3 d variables from the gpv analysis as lo et al 2008 pointed out compared with the traditional continuous integration approach that poorly simulates the forcing wind during long integrations as the model drifts away from the forcing reanalysis 3 d analysis nudging can constrain the error growth in large scale circulation during long downscale simulations thus it generates realistic regional scale patterns that are not resolved by the coarse resolution fnl that is used to nudge the model especially for meteorological fields near the surface miguez macho et al 2004 also noted that dynamic downscaling models can develop unrealistic circulation patterns if only the lateral boundaries are considered for global input whereas applying a nudging term can preserve important large scale features within the dynamic downscaling process however the analyses in section 5 2 identified a smoothing effect from the grid nudging method in the generation of wind speed by wrf simulations for extremely high wind shown in fig 4 a and fig 5 a leading to greater underestimation therefore the utilization of the grid nudging method should not be recommended for generating ocean surface winds to be used in ship weather routing especially in rough sea navigation 6 2 sensitivity to physical parametrizations according to the rmse and bias analyses provided in section 5 2 param 1 seems to perform better for generating relatively higher wind than param 2 fig 4 a and fig 5 a param 1 generates more accurate results for higher wind v m a x 20 m s 15 m s v m a x 20 m s while param 2 performs better for weaker wind v m a x 12 m s and 12 m s v m a x 15 m s to elucidate the cloud microphysics mechanism by which moisture is removed from the air based on other thermodynamic and kinematic fields represented within the wrf model wsm 3 class which represents the wrf single moment 3 class microphysics scheme and eta ferrier were used for param 1 and param 2 respectively comparing some observed features track maximum sustained wind and sea level pressure with simulations in his study on the impact of microphysics schemes in the simulation of the cyclone phailin using the wrf model bk mahala mahala et al 2015 found that simulations with the wrf single moment 3 wsm3 class microphysics scheme compare well with observations in another study on the tropical cyclone mora over the bay of bengal chutia chutia lakhima et al 2018 showed that the convergence of surface winds which pick up heat and moisture from the ocean were also well simulated using the wsm3 showing better performance with the least rmse compared to all other schemes despite the fact that all schemes overestimated the observed msw and mslp during the storm period in our present study the param 1 group has a better performance which also uses the wsm3 as the microphysics scheme with the cumulus physics scheme the mass flux type kain fritsch kf and the adjustment type bets miller janjic bmj were used for param 1 and param 2 respectively fersch fersch and kunstmann 2014 found that for hot and dry regions like the sahara the bmj scheme outperformed the kf scheme for precipitation generation in their study on water budgets however the kf in param 1 may perform better than the bmj in param 2 owing to the present study focusing on relatively wet regions of the ocean surface it is known that near surface momentum depends on vertical diffusion schemes in the unstable regime and the shapes of the vertical profiles are determined by pbl mixing algorithms here first order closure schemes i e yonsei university scheme ysu and the turbulent kinetic energy tke closure scheme denoted the mellor yamada janjic myj scheme were utilized for param 1 and param 2 respectively according to hu xm hu et al 2010 due predominantly to differences in the vertical mixing strength and entrainment of air from above the pbl the wrf simulations with the ysu and acm2 schemes provide much less bias than with the myj scheme he also showed that simulations with the myj scheme produced the coldest and moistest biases in the pbl moreover frediani meb frediani et al 2016 pointed out that the ysu scheme accounts for counter gradients and entrainment at the pbl top which translates into stronger vertical mixing while the known weak vertical mixing in the myj scheme is reflected in the increasing bias during pbl diurnal evolution agreeing with their findings the present study finds that the combination of param 1 with the ysu performs better than that of param 2 with myj for simulating strong winds the surface layer parametrizations contribute to near surface variability in both convective and stable regimes determined by the pbl schemes selected above two kinds of surface layer physics including mm5 similarity and eta similarity were used for the param 1 and param 2 respectively based on monin obukhov janjic eta includes parameterizations of a viscous sub layer and computes the surface fluxes by an iterative method in a study comparing the performance of two surface layer parameterizations mm5 similarity eta similarity schemes over a tropical site in southeast india k hari prasad k hari prasad et al 2016 found that although both schemes depict a systematic bias in various surface layer parameters the predicted values with the mm5 similarity scheme are in better agreement with observational estimates as indicated by the qualitative and quantitative comparisons of results they also argued that the differences in the results of the two schemes can be attributed to the variation in the empirical stability correction functions and the stability regimes used in the two schemes in a study of wrf surface wind temperature and water vapour mixing ratio for the portuguese territory ferreira et al 2008 found that the variation of the sl and pbl schemes have a significant influence on the wind prediction especially for cold seasons and also that the sl pbl parameterization set mm5 ysu is the one that presents better results in the wind simulation similarly in the present study the mm5 similarity scheme used for param 1 also contributes to the better performance of param 1 in simulating high wind 6 3 uncertainty of gpv datasets finally to consider the uncertainty of the boundary conditions for the dynamical downscaling two global atmospheric reanalysis products with different models observations and data assimilation for the dataset making process were employed for the regional simulations for instance era interim uses four dimensional variational analysis assimilation while ncep fnl uses a 3 d variational analysis in almost all figures shown in section 5 2 comparisons of the rmse indicate that era interim performs better than ncep fnl for weak wind v m a x 12 m s and 12 m s v m a x 15 m s and long periods total period while ncep fnl generates a smaller error than era interim for other situations such as high wind v m a x 20 m s and a short peak period peak period this further illustrates that era interim tends to be better for longer period wind analysis such as studies on practical applications for offshore wind energy while ncep fnl should be recommended for shorter period but higher wind analysis thereby enabling navigational safety in ship weather routing 7 conclusions in this study the performance of the rcm wrf was studied as well as validated against on board observations for eight rough sea cases considering approaches that include two different boundary conditions two groups of physics parametrizations and the optional grid nudging method eight cases with durations of few days each were selected for the study owing to their geographic positions the cases represent open ocean conditions through these wrf simulations of ocean surface wind and the validations against on board observations we can draw the following conclusions for wrf simulations in open and rough seas 1 for wind strength wrf simulations provide more accurate results for intermediate wind speeds cases 1 3 4 5 and 8 between 12 and 20 m s than for low and high wind speeds cases 2 and 6 less than 12 m s and case 7 higher than 20 m s this may be due to the downscaling effects of the rcm in calculating physical phenomena the present study also illustrates that wrf can generate a better wind direction for high winds than for low winds 2 for locations the model simulations provide more accurate results for the northern hemisphere than for the southern hemisphere which may result from the fact that more land based observation stations are available in the northern hemisphere providing relatively sufficient data for both high spatial and temporal resolution for three ncep fnl or four dimensional era interim variational assimilation analysis 3 for gpv datasets we find from the present study that although wrf simulations do not properly generate the peak wind speed timing of maximum wind speed compared to on board observations ncep fnl tends to simulate more accurate results for higher winds compared to era interim era interim is suitable for longer periods while ncep fnl has additional capabilities to analyze the extremes therefore ncep fnl is recommended for ship routing because of its improved representation of strong winds during rough sea conditions which is of great importance for ship safety and optimal routing additionally the era interim dataset performs better than ncep fnl at generating wind direction 4 for the grid nudging method fdda the present study finds that wind strength was more greatly underestimated through simulation due to the smoothing effect in generating extremely high winds therefore the grid nudging method should not be recommended to generate ocean surface wind for ship weather routing especially in the rough seas 5 owing to the fact that regional models cannot resolve smaller spatial and temporal scales physically based parameterization schemes have been proposed for solving these physical processes the parameterizations used for param 1 seem to better estimate strong ocean surface wind for open and rough seas than those for param 2 although most of the parameterizations used for param 2 are more complex schemes there are two main reasons why more complex schemes may not necessarily lead to consistently better results even though they can improve physical realism and are able to simulate physical processes more realistically one is that the more realistic physics used in more complex schemes may expose other model deficiencies such as model resolution and initialization additionally other physical parameterizations have often been developed and tuned to function with simpler schemes therefore the relatively simple parameterizations used for param 1 are recommended for ship weather routing especially after considering the efficiency and usage of computerization and the better performance of param 1 in generating high wind 6 finally from the viewpoint of optimum ship routing a combination of the ncep fnl dataset with high resolution wrf modeling using param 1 and no fdda is recommended due to its higher accuracy when estimating relatively high wind speeds over the ocean surface while the possible underestimation by era interim param 2 and fdda will bring the ship to a high risk and thus should be avoided it should also be noticed here that the era5 data with a higher spatial and temporal resolution than era interim data should be used for future studies besides the observed cases are still limited at present and further analysis of newly observed data by another vessel will be conducted in the future study credit authorship contribution statement chen chen conceptualization methodology visualization investigation kenji sasa supervision validation

21840,in addition to other studies focused on the wrf performance of rainfall temperature and precipitation the present study provides practical suggestions for ship operators on choosing grid point value gpv datasets and wrf modeling approaches to help make better decisions on weather routing by estimating strong wind with a higher accuracy two different gpv datasets the ncep fnl and era interim are used for wrf modeling various modeling approaches which include applying different physics options and choosing whether to adopt the four dimensional data assimilation are employed for numerical simulation then on board measurements of a bulk carrier has been used to validate the calculated wind of eight rough sea navigational cases this occurs over a wide spatial range covering ocean regions such as the northwest pacific ocean south of australia tasman sea southeast of africa and southeast of america as well as a wide temporal range of four years results of 64 wrf simulations show that era interim is suitable for longer periods while ncep fnl can analyze extremely high winds additionally grid nudging can also reduce the wind strength due to its smoothing effect finally selections of these different gpv datasets and modeling approaches for ship weather routing are discussed particularly for rough sea navigations keywords wrf regional model physics parametrization schemes gpv datasets gridded nudging rough sea navigation ship weather routing 1 introduction the weather research and forecasting wrf model has been widely used with terrain following mass coordinates and the 3rd order runge kutta integration scheme skamarock and klemp 2008 as a next generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction model for operational forecasting and atmospheric research jianfeng g u et al 2005 davis et al 2008 cha and wang 2013 this demonstrates the high capability and flexibility of the wrf model to elucidate various atmospheric phenomena in different regions however due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere and sensitivities of wrf attention should also be paid to selecting the most appropriate initial and or boundary conditions and combination of physical parametrizations doing so will yield more accurate model results for various application purposes or regions of interest to evaluate the wrf performance for wind simulation and wind energy in portugal carvalho et al 2014 compared an older reanalysis ncep r2 with three recently released reanalysis datasets era interim nasa merra and ncep cfsr as well as ncep gfs and ncep fnl analysis distributed from the ncep national centers for environmental prediction kalnay et al 1996 they found that among the initial and boundary conditions of the datasets tested here era interim reanalysis which is distributed from the ecmwf european center for medium range weather forecasts dee et al 2011 likely provides the most realistic initial and boundary data because it offers the best estimates of local wind regimes and potential wind energy production they also showed that the ncep gfs and ncep fnl analyses seem to be the best alternatives to era interim particularly in cases where reliable forcing data are needed quickly for real time applications and according to carvalho et al carvalho et al 2012 error minimization in wind simulation can be achieved by testing and choosing a suitable numerical and physical configuration for the region of interest as well as using high resolution terrain data therefore in addition to the different effects from gpv datasets the selections of combinations of physics parametrizations are also of great importance for generating results with more accuracy though there are many possibilities provided by the wrf model numerous previous studies have investigated the effects of wrf physics schemes on model performance most previous studies on wrf and gpv datasets focused on operational applications such as surface temperature mooney et al 2011 relative humidity reflectivity rainfall evans et al 2012 politi et al 2018 zeyaeyan et al 2017 and wrf chem aliabadi et al 2015 marelle et al 2016 roiger et al 2016 for a certain period in a particular geographical region mostly land areas and validated the model results using land based or coast based observations as pointed out by gunwani gunwani et al 2017 the performance evaluation using the wrf model may agree better in terms of temperature and relative humidity compared to wind speed for different climatic zones over india however only a few of those previous studies attempted to apply wrf in the generation of high resolution wind fields for ship weather routing even though an accurate forecast of wind velocity on the ocean surface is of great importance for the safety economic and environmental aspects of ship weather routing originally proposed by james 1957 optimum ship routing has been increasingly recognized as vital to making shipping safer more economical and environmentally friendly to construct a numerical ship navigation system chen et al 2013 2015 simulated the weather and ocean in the osaka bay of japan and the east china sea using wrf with ncep fnl input for wind generation validations with jma observations showed that high resolution wrf calculations provided wind distributions to enable ship navigation with acceptable accuracy the previous studies only confirmed wind simulations using land based observations neglecting the wind validation on the ocean surface where ships stay most of the other related studies also focused on the north pacific ocean hagiwara and spaans 1987 takashima et al 2009 lin et al 2013 the mediterranean sea delitala et al 2010 the north indian ocean sen and padhy 2015 and the north atlantic ocean chen 1978 hinnenthal and clauss 2010 shao et al 2012 with increasing imports of resources and renewables each year from countries in the southern hemisphere including brazil africa australia and asian countries like china and japan the number of ships on the south north route including bulk carriers tankers and liquefied natural gas lng carriers is likely to increase therefore the construction of an optimum ship routing system covering the southern hemisphere is of great importance however according to vettor and guedes soares vettor and guedes soares 2016 the number of observations is still insufficient for constructing ship routing systems from wind and wave analyses in the southern hemisphere as ocean state observation methods such as remote sensing by satellite and buoy data are limited in spatial temporal resolution and location high resolution numerical weather and ocean simulations as well as validation with on board observations could emerge as an efficient route way generating relatively accurate ocean surface wind and sea states especially for rough sea navigation a six year on board observation study of weather ocean and ship motion was conducted from 2010 using a 20 000 dwt class bulk carrier covering both the southern and the northern hemispheres sasa et al 2015 have studied two rough sea navigation cases showing the reliability of our observation system by validating ocean waves with simulations as a next step study lu et al 2017 focused on three rough sea navigations in the southern hemisphere in an attempt to clarify proper weather and ocean generation methods for ship routing however the limited number and areas of rough seas studied lower the strength of the evidence in this study to further investigate the uncertainty of gpv datasets and wrf modeling approaches for ocean surface high wind generation as well as develop an optimal ship routing with encountered weather data for merchant vessels hind cast simulations of the high resolution wrf model were conducted for eight rough sea cases using both the era interim and ncep fnl for wrf input covering a larger area including both the southern and the northern hemispheres with more sufficient temporal and spatial variability including all seasons as well as modeling approaches such as wrf fdda additionally two groups of physics combinations were set according to evans et al 2012 to clarify the performances of the wrf parameterizations in terms of wind generation across both the southern and northern hemispheres results of wrf simulations were evaluated with on board observations and suggestions for ship weather routing are provided the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the on board observation system and data collection details are provided the model configuration is provided in section 3 validations of model results with on board observations are shown in section 4 finally in section 5 conclusions of this study and suggestions for future research are summarized 2 on board observations and case studies 2 1 observation vessel a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier transporting cargo as a tramper was used for on board observations the onboard measurement has been conducted since june 2010 for 6 years however there were mechanical failures around pcs from 2011 to 2012 and power supplies from 2014 to 2015 measured data does not exist in most of these periods and there were few rough sea conditions between 2015 and 2016 thus extracted rough sea voyages are analyzed in 2010 2011 2013 2016 the carrier s routes mainly cover oceans between asian countries and areas of the southern hemisphere such as the oceania and south america where ocean states are generally rougher than in the northern hemisphere due to smaller landmasses 2 2 observation cases to ensure that the research conclusion is more convincing as well as enhance our understanding of rough sea navigation we selected eight observation cases from all experimental periods for analysis across both the northern cases 1 and 2 and southern hemispheres cases 3 8 and a fully seasonal variability spring cases 3 and 4 summer case 2 autumn cases 1 5 and 6 and winter cases 7 and 8 the blue stars in fig 1 show all geographical locations where the ship experienced high wind and the wrf model domains considered for these eight cases detailed weather and ship conditions for each observation case are shown in table 1 weather data including wind speed and wind direction on the ocean surface are created using the averaged values for a 10 min time series obtained every second the measurement system consists of the inertial measurement unit nav440 and other censors which are originally installed for the ship there are two data sources there one is from the nav440 another is from the vdr voyage data recorder and engine data logger connected with all the sensors inside the ship these data are recorded into two laptops through lan cables the reliability of nav440 and other sensors is already shown for real ships sasa et al 2015 sasa et al 2019 and all the measured data can be reliable the wind anemometer is installed on the top of the ship structure and used in daily operation of the bulk carrier which can observe the relative wind speed and direction with little influence of air flow induced by ship structure as measurement facilities are a height of about 30 m over sea surface the smith method smith 1981 was used to interpolate the measured wind to the 10 m wind velocity then ship speed and course data obtained by the vdr were used to calculate the real wind velocity over ground 3 model configuration 3 1 model boundary conditions to generate ocean surface wind fields for all eight rough sea cases version 3 8 1 of the advanced research wrf arw is utilized in this study it has been developed by the national center for atmospheric research ncar skamarock w c 2008 the alternating pbl schemes surface layers cumulus schemes radiation schemes and microphysics schemes in the ensemble are described in section 3 2 all experiments use the noah land surface model chen and dudhia 2001 gpv datasets including both the national centers for the environmental prediction final ncep fnl operation model global tropospheric analyses ncep nws noaa u s department of commerce 2000 and the european center for medium range weather forecasts interim reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 have been utilized as the initial and boundary conditions for wrf model ncep fnl analyses offer 1 1 grids covering the global region while era interim offers a spatial resolution of approximately 80 km 0 75 both these boundary conditions are updated every 6 h for all these eight cases the wrf model was run with a horizontal resolution of 0 1 and an output time interval of 3 h the vertical resolution of the model was 30 eta levels spaced closely together in the pbl for each case we chose a day window around one week that centered on the peak of the low pressures for model evaluations in accordance with the on board observations 3 2 modeling approaches and experimental design at first according to lo et al 2008 the traditional continuous integration approach used by lu 2017 could poorly simulate the forcing variables such as pressure temperature wind and moisture due to the model drifting from the forcing reanalysis during long integrations he also noted that downscaling simulations using three dimensional 3 d analysis nudging could constrain the error growth in large scale circulation during the long simulation generating realistic regional scale patterns that are not resolved by the coarse resolution fnl used to nudge the model this holds especially true for meteorological fields near the surface in the present wrf calculations to further understand the uncertainties of the wrf results as illustrated by lu 2017 the grid nudging method stauffer and seaman 1990 referred to as fdda four dimensional data assimilation was used to measure winds u and v and temperature for all vertical layers but the pbl with a time interval between analysis times of 360 min a ramping time period of 60 min and nudging coefficient of 0 0003 the grid nudging method is a specific 3 d analysis whereby the atmospheric model is nudged toward time and space interpolated analyses using a point by point relaxation term secondly according to carvalho carvalho et al 2012 the wrf model can be significantly affected by the choice of boundary layer parameterizations for near surface wind simulations it offers different options for the representations of microphysics radiative processes convective processes turbulent transports as well as evolution of surface temperature and soil moisture this study examines the performance of two combinations of physical parameterizations for real data applications in the wrf model with regards to all eight cases considering both the model accuracy and computational efficiency these include cloud microphysics wrf single moment 3 class and eta ferrier scheme following hong hong et al 2006 and ferrier ferrier et al 2002 the cumulus parameterization kain fritsch and bets miller janjic following kain and fritsch kain and fritsch 1990 and betts and miller betts and miller 1986 janjic 1994 the pbl schemes yonsei university and the mellor yamada janjic following hong hong and pan 1996 and janjic janjic 2002 the surface layer physics using revised the mm5 scheme and eta similarity scheme following jimenez jimenez pedro a 2012 and janjic janjic z i 1996 2002 and the short and long wave radiation schemes rapid radiative transfer model and rrtmg scheme following mlawer mlawer et al 1997 and iacono iacono et al 2008 respectively in the present study for calculating various wrf physics schemes such as cloud microphysics cumulus physics shortwave longwave radiation pbl and surface layer physics a combination of wsm 3 class kf dudhia rrtm ysu and monin obukhov has been utilized for param 1 while another combination of eta ferrier bmj rrtmg rrtmg myj and janjic eta has been utilized for param 2 using a single nest approach a total of 64 wrf simulations wrf arw version 3 8 were conducted for all eight cases to determine the influence of the utilization of fdda and different physics combinations on model results with particular emphasis on the ocean surface wind distributions flowchart of the model simulation and mmodel settings of wrf for wind generations in these 64 numerical experiments are shown in fig 2 4 model results as mentioned in the end of section 1 the observed wind speed following the moving vessel for all cases was averaged for a 1 h time series obtained every second for validation with wrf results fig 3 more detailed results analysis as well as discussions are provided in section 5 5 model evaluation 5 1 evaluation statistics to further determine the uncertainties of different gpv datasets and modeling approaches in wind simulation the bias and root mean squared error rmse of the wind speed and pitch motions over observations were calculated according to eq 1 and eq 2 1 b i a s c i o i n 2 r m s e c i o i 2 n where c and o represent the model calculations and on board observations of a certain time period n for all rough sea navigation cases respectively bias indicates systematic errors while the rmse provides the total errors 5 2 divisions of model results for validations wind strength wind duration wind location according to the final objective of the present study being selecting the best gpv dataset and wrf modeling approach for ship routing we divide the final objective into three ones as selection of the better gpv dataset ncep fnl era interim better nudging method fdda no fdda as well as better physics parametrizations param 1 param 2 as shown in table 2 table 3 shows the three group division categories established after dividing by all cases the study defines clearly the differences between parameterizations param 1 param 2 wrf modeling approaches w o fdda and gpv datasets ncep fnl era interim for wind reanalysis over the ocean surface at first depending on the maximum wind speed wind strength all eight simulated cases are divided into four ranges as a v m a x 12 m s cases 2 and 6 b 12 v m a x 15 m s cases 4 5 and 8 c 15 m s v m a x 20 m s cases 1 and 3 d v m a x 20 m s case 7 secondly considering the risk of period the ship has taken two ranges of simulation periods wind duration were considered a total period including the time period for the wind simulations for approximately one week b peak period only for the time period corresponding to the highest wind speed for approximately one day including both 12 h before and after the highest wind finally in addition to the above two factors wind strength and duration affecting the generation and propagation of ocean surface waves the performances of different gpv datasets and modeling approaches among all eight cases were compared for different locations wind location divided along the northern and southern hemispheres 5 2 1 wind strength referring to the beaufort scale and considering the on board observations four ranges of wind strength were established as shown in table 2 to determine the effects of various modeling approaches using different gpv datasets on wind simulation the rmse and bias of the simulated and on board observed wind speeds and wind directions of these four ranges were calculated and then compared depending on 8 wrf modeling approaches for example consider param 1 param 2 fdda no fdda fnl and era in fig 4 a here param 1 and param 2 signify the no 1 and no 2 groups of physics options for the cloud microphysics scheme cumulus scheme long wave and short wave radiation schemes and pbl scheme shown in fig 2 respectively fdda and no fdda signify the utilization and non utilization of the grid nudging method respectively and fnl and era signify the utilization of the gpv datasets of ncep fnl and era interim respectively fig 4 shows the rmse and bias values of wind speed by wind strength fig 4 a and fig 4 c show all rmse and bias values for these four ranges of wind strength by all kinds of wrf simulations fig 4 b and fig 4 d show the averaged rmse and bias values of wind speed for them respectively at first it can be clearly seen in fig 4 a and fig 4 b that compared with weak and strong winds such as v m a x 12 m s and v m a x 20 m s all wrf simulations tend to perform better for intermediate wind conditions including 12 m s v m a x 15 m s and 15 m s v m a x 20 m s this result coincides with conclusions made by d carvalho 2014 then in fig 4 c and fig 4 d wrf simulations tend to underestimate more of the extremely high wind such as for case 7 where v m a x 20 m s a better performance by param 2 for generating weak wind can be found in fig 4 c a relatively large difference in absolute bias i e v m a x 12 m s and 12 m s v m a x 15 m s while param 1 has an opposite tendency to generate better results for high wind i e 15 m s v m a x 20 m s and v m a x 20 m s besides the no fdda modeling approach seems to perform better than fdda the reason could be that the grid nudging method used here tends to underestimate wind strength because of its smoothing effects as shown in fig 4 a and fig 4 c which was also pointed out by vincent c l vincent and hahmann 2015 and nakano 2010 regardless of the gpv datasets the era interim dataset has relatively smaller rmse values compared to ncep fnl but it should be noticed here that era interim tends to underestimate more of relatively higher wind conditions as shown in fig 4 c 12 m s v m a x 15 m s 15 m s v m a x 20 m s v m a x 20 m s fig 5 shows the rmse and bias values of wind direction by wind strength fig 5 a and fig 5 b show that rmse for intermediate wind speeds is between those for lower and higher wind speeds respectively then fig 5 c shows that the wrf tends to generate relatively clockwise wind for most cases except for the highest wind in case 7 where wrf did not accurately simulate the wind direction for a long time period approximately two days of weak wind wind speed less than 5 m s compared with on board observations this may be due to the wrf generating wind direction with a relatively low accuracy when the wind speed is low the param 2 tends to generate better wind direction for low wind while the param 1 performs better for high wind with smaller rmse values in fig 5 a generally the era interim performs better for wind direction shown in fig 5 a while the ncep fnl has a smaller underestimation in the highest wind case shown in fig 5 c 5 2 2 wind duration to determine the different performances of the various wrf simulations on wind generation for ship routing especially in dangerous situations with rough seas and strong ocean surface wind two groups termed total period and peak period were compared for all eight rough sea cases where the former refers to the entire period of wrf simulation for each case and the latter refers to the period around the maximum wind speed with time lengths of approximately one week and one day respectively the rmse and bias of the simulated and on board observed wind speed and wind direction of these two groups were calculated and then compared for all utilized wrf modeling approaches as illustrated in section 5 2 1 fig 6 shows the rmse and bias values of wind speed by wind duration fig 6 a and fig 6 c show all rmse and bias values for the two groups total period and peak period of wind duration using all wrf simulations while fig 6 b and fig 6 d show the averaged rmse and bias values of wind speed for these two groups it is clear in fig 6 a and fig 6 b that compared with total period group the peak period group has smaller rmse and absolute bias values which implies that the wrf tends to perform better for relatively high wind peak period which only includes the high wind period as opposed to weak wind total period which includes both high and weak wind for the gpv dataset fig 6 a shows a better performance of era interim than ncep fnl for the total period including both weak wind and high wind periods but an opposite tendency for the peak period only for high wind this shows that ncep fnl tends to perform better for high wind while era interim provides a better result for relatively weaker wind it can also be found from fig 6 c that the utilization of fdda tends to increase the underestimation of wind speed owning to its smoothing effects regarding to the physical parameterizations the param 1 performs better than param 2 especially for the peak period as shown in fig 6 c which also agrees with the finding in fig 4 that param 1 performs better than param 2 in case of generation high wind speed the reason why absolute averaged value of bias for the total period is lower than that of the peak period is the underestimation of extremely high wind for the peak period as shown for cases 3 5 and 8 in fig 3 fig 7 shows the rmse and bias values of wind direction by wind duration all panels in fig 7 show that wrf can generate better wind direction for high wind peak period than for weak wind total period agreeing with d carvalho 2014 fig 7 a shows that param 1 provides a more accurate result than param 2 for peak wind this also agrees with the above analysis from rmse values of wind speed by wind strength in fig 4 fdda when utilized with a smoothing effect tends to improve the performance of wind direction generation with a greater effect on high wind than weak wind fig 7 a for the gpv dataset all three figures in fig 7 show that era interim performs better than ncep fnl for the generation of wind direction then in fig 7 c the positive bias values indicate that wrf tends to generate relatively clockwise wind for most cases fig 7 c also shows a relatively larger negative effect of fdda on generating the wind direction for weak wind total period than high wind peak period 5 2 3 wind location finally the present study tries to focus on the different effects of the 8 above mentioned wrf modeling approaches on the generation of ocean surface wind for the southern and northern hemispheres fig 8 shows the rmse and bias values of wind speed by wind duration fig 8 a and fig 8 c show all rmse and bias values for the two groups northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere of wind location using all wrf simulations fig 8 b and fig 8 d show the averaged rmse and bias values of wind speed for these two groups using all wrf modeling approaches all these four panels in fig 8 clearly show that compared with the southern hemisphere group the northern hemisphere group has relatively smaller rmse and absolute bias values which implies that these wrf modeling approaches tend to perform better for the northern hemisphere fig 8 a further shows that param 1 provides a better result than param 2 owing to its better performance for high wind which also agrees with the above analysis for the rmse values of wind speed by wind strength fig 8 c again shows that fdda with a smoothing effect tends to underestimate wind more significantly agreeing with the results obtained for bias values of wind speed by wind strength in fig 4 c regarding to gpv datasets era interim performs slightly worse than ncep fnl in southern hemisphere possibly due to its poorer performance in generating high wind such case 7 the highest wind as shown in fig 3 fig 9 shows the rmse and bias values of wind direction by wind location fig 9 a and fig 9 b show that wrf has a tendency to generate better wind direction for the northern hemisphere group than the southern hemisphere also fig 9 c shows that param 2 provides better results than param 1 owing to the poorer performance of param 1 for the northern hemisphere group moreover the use of fdda with a smoothing effect tends to further delay the accurate estimation of wind direction especially for extreme high wind periods as shown in fig 4 furthermore for the gpv dataset all figures indicate a better performance of era interim than ncep fnl for the generation of wind direction then in fig 9 c the positive bias values indicate that wrf tends to generate relatively clockwise wind for most cases although it appears that the bias values of the northern hemisphere group are higher than those of the southern hemisphere group from fig 9 c it should be noted that the bias values are a combination of several cases that also include the high negative values of the latter group leading to lower bias values for the latter group as shown in fig 9 c 5 2 4 evaluation wrf performance for all cases to have an overall division of wrf performance for all cases fig 10 is given where fig 10 a and fig 10 b are the averaged rmse and bias values of wind speed of all wrf simulations in all eight cases while fig 10 c and fig 10 d are those values of wind direction in terms of the physical parametrizations the smaller rmse value in fig 10 a and a larger one in fig 10 c show that the param 1 performs better for wind speed same as other studies xm hu et al 2010 and meb frediani et al 2016 but worse for wind direction when compared with param 2 the reason why the bias value of param 1 is smaller than param 2 is that the param 1 performs better for high wind while the param 2 has an opposite tendency which can be illustrated in fig 4 c and fig 5 c compared with the era interim the ncep fnl tends to overestimate more of wind speed as shown in fig 10 a and it can be shown in fig 10 c and fig 10 d that the ear interim has a better performance on wind direction than the ncep fnl which agrees with another study by carvalho d 2014 that wrf simulation driven with era interim presents the lowest errors for the wind direction owning to its smoothing effects as pointed out by vincent c l vincent and hahmann 2015 and nakano 2010 the utilization of fdda can increase the underestimation of wind speed as shown in fig 10 b and the smaller rmse value of fdda in fig 10 a results from the relatively large underestimation of low wind cases as shown in fig 4 a regarding to the wind direction the fdda also has a larger effect on low wind generation than high wind as shown in fig 7 c and fig 8 c 6 discussions on uncertainties of wrf modeling approaches and gpv datasets 6 1 influences of fdda approach on model results generally regional climate models rcms like the wrf connect global driving fields only through the lateral boundaries meanwhile if model domains of rcm are set in zones where global circulation mechanisms and upper air large scale patterns exist these patterns are possibly not very well reproduced by the rcm because it may develop unrealistic circulation patterns and generate inaccuracy of important large scale features the fdda can help constrain the rcm by choosing 3 d variables from the gpv analysis as lo et al 2008 pointed out compared with the traditional continuous integration approach that poorly simulates the forcing wind during long integrations as the model drifts away from the forcing reanalysis 3 d analysis nudging can constrain the error growth in large scale circulation during long downscale simulations thus it generates realistic regional scale patterns that are not resolved by the coarse resolution fnl that is used to nudge the model especially for meteorological fields near the surface miguez macho et al 2004 also noted that dynamic downscaling models can develop unrealistic circulation patterns if only the lateral boundaries are considered for global input whereas applying a nudging term can preserve important large scale features within the dynamic downscaling process however the analyses in section 5 2 identified a smoothing effect from the grid nudging method in the generation of wind speed by wrf simulations for extremely high wind shown in fig 4 a and fig 5 a leading to greater underestimation therefore the utilization of the grid nudging method should not be recommended for generating ocean surface winds to be used in ship weather routing especially in rough sea navigation 6 2 sensitivity to physical parametrizations according to the rmse and bias analyses provided in section 5 2 param 1 seems to perform better for generating relatively higher wind than param 2 fig 4 a and fig 5 a param 1 generates more accurate results for higher wind v m a x 20 m s 15 m s v m a x 20 m s while param 2 performs better for weaker wind v m a x 12 m s and 12 m s v m a x 15 m s to elucidate the cloud microphysics mechanism by which moisture is removed from the air based on other thermodynamic and kinematic fields represented within the wrf model wsm 3 class which represents the wrf single moment 3 class microphysics scheme and eta ferrier were used for param 1 and param 2 respectively comparing some observed features track maximum sustained wind and sea level pressure with simulations in his study on the impact of microphysics schemes in the simulation of the cyclone phailin using the wrf model bk mahala mahala et al 2015 found that simulations with the wrf single moment 3 wsm3 class microphysics scheme compare well with observations in another study on the tropical cyclone mora over the bay of bengal chutia chutia lakhima et al 2018 showed that the convergence of surface winds which pick up heat and moisture from the ocean were also well simulated using the wsm3 showing better performance with the least rmse compared to all other schemes despite the fact that all schemes overestimated the observed msw and mslp during the storm period in our present study the param 1 group has a better performance which also uses the wsm3 as the microphysics scheme with the cumulus physics scheme the mass flux type kain fritsch kf and the adjustment type bets miller janjic bmj were used for param 1 and param 2 respectively fersch fersch and kunstmann 2014 found that for hot and dry regions like the sahara the bmj scheme outperformed the kf scheme for precipitation generation in their study on water budgets however the kf in param 1 may perform better than the bmj in param 2 owing to the present study focusing on relatively wet regions of the ocean surface it is known that near surface momentum depends on vertical diffusion schemes in the unstable regime and the shapes of the vertical profiles are determined by pbl mixing algorithms here first order closure schemes i e yonsei university scheme ysu and the turbulent kinetic energy tke closure scheme denoted the mellor yamada janjic myj scheme were utilized for param 1 and param 2 respectively according to hu xm hu et al 2010 due predominantly to differences in the vertical mixing strength and entrainment of air from above the pbl the wrf simulations with the ysu and acm2 schemes provide much less bias than with the myj scheme he also showed that simulations with the myj scheme produced the coldest and moistest biases in the pbl moreover frediani meb frediani et al 2016 pointed out that the ysu scheme accounts for counter gradients and entrainment at the pbl top which translates into stronger vertical mixing while the known weak vertical mixing in the myj scheme is reflected in the increasing bias during pbl diurnal evolution agreeing with their findings the present study finds that the combination of param 1 with the ysu performs better than that of param 2 with myj for simulating strong winds the surface layer parametrizations contribute to near surface variability in both convective and stable regimes determined by the pbl schemes selected above two kinds of surface layer physics including mm5 similarity and eta similarity were used for the param 1 and param 2 respectively based on monin obukhov janjic eta includes parameterizations of a viscous sub layer and computes the surface fluxes by an iterative method in a study comparing the performance of two surface layer parameterizations mm5 similarity eta similarity schemes over a tropical site in southeast india k hari prasad k hari prasad et al 2016 found that although both schemes depict a systematic bias in various surface layer parameters the predicted values with the mm5 similarity scheme are in better agreement with observational estimates as indicated by the qualitative and quantitative comparisons of results they also argued that the differences in the results of the two schemes can be attributed to the variation in the empirical stability correction functions and the stability regimes used in the two schemes in a study of wrf surface wind temperature and water vapour mixing ratio for the portuguese territory ferreira et al 2008 found that the variation of the sl and pbl schemes have a significant influence on the wind prediction especially for cold seasons and also that the sl pbl parameterization set mm5 ysu is the one that presents better results in the wind simulation similarly in the present study the mm5 similarity scheme used for param 1 also contributes to the better performance of param 1 in simulating high wind 6 3 uncertainty of gpv datasets finally to consider the uncertainty of the boundary conditions for the dynamical downscaling two global atmospheric reanalysis products with different models observations and data assimilation for the dataset making process were employed for the regional simulations for instance era interim uses four dimensional variational analysis assimilation while ncep fnl uses a 3 d variational analysis in almost all figures shown in section 5 2 comparisons of the rmse indicate that era interim performs better than ncep fnl for weak wind v m a x 12 m s and 12 m s v m a x 15 m s and long periods total period while ncep fnl generates a smaller error than era interim for other situations such as high wind v m a x 20 m s and a short peak period peak period this further illustrates that era interim tends to be better for longer period wind analysis such as studies on practical applications for offshore wind energy while ncep fnl should be recommended for shorter period but higher wind analysis thereby enabling navigational safety in ship weather routing 7 conclusions in this study the performance of the rcm wrf was studied as well as validated against on board observations for eight rough sea cases considering approaches that include two different boundary conditions two groups of physics parametrizations and the optional grid nudging method eight cases with durations of few days each were selected for the study owing to their geographic positions the cases represent open ocean conditions through these wrf simulations of ocean surface wind and the validations against on board observations we can draw the following conclusions for wrf simulations in open and rough seas 1 for wind strength wrf simulations provide more accurate results for intermediate wind speeds cases 1 3 4 5 and 8 between 12 and 20 m s than for low and high wind speeds cases 2 and 6 less than 12 m s and case 7 higher than 20 m s this may be due to the downscaling effects of the rcm in calculating physical phenomena the present study also illustrates that wrf can generate a better wind direction for high winds than for low winds 2 for locations the model simulations provide more accurate results for the northern hemisphere than for the southern hemisphere which may result from the fact that more land based observation stations are available in the northern hemisphere providing relatively sufficient data for both high spatial and temporal resolution for three ncep fnl or four dimensional era interim variational assimilation analysis 3 for gpv datasets we find from the present study that although wrf simulations do not properly generate the peak wind speed timing of maximum wind speed compared to on board observations ncep fnl tends to simulate more accurate results for higher winds compared to era interim era interim is suitable for longer periods while ncep fnl has additional capabilities to analyze the extremes therefore ncep fnl is recommended for ship routing because of its improved representation of strong winds during rough sea conditions which is of great importance for ship safety and optimal routing additionally the era interim dataset performs better than ncep fnl at generating wind direction 4 for the grid nudging method fdda the present study finds that wind strength was more greatly underestimated through simulation due to the smoothing effect in generating extremely high winds therefore the grid nudging method should not be recommended to generate ocean surface wind for ship weather routing especially in the rough seas 5 owing to the fact that regional models cannot resolve smaller spatial and temporal scales physically based parameterization schemes have been proposed for solving these physical processes the parameterizations used for param 1 seem to better estimate strong ocean surface wind for open and rough seas than those for param 2 although most of the parameterizations used for param 2 are more complex schemes there are two main reasons why more complex schemes may not necessarily lead to consistently better results even though they can improve physical realism and are able to simulate physical processes more realistically one is that the more realistic physics used in more complex schemes may expose other model deficiencies such as model resolution and initialization additionally other physical parameterizations have often been developed and tuned to function with simpler schemes therefore the relatively simple parameterizations used for param 1 are recommended for ship weather routing especially after considering the efficiency and usage of computerization and the better performance of param 1 in generating high wind 6 finally from the viewpoint of optimum ship routing a combination of the ncep fnl dataset with high resolution wrf modeling using param 1 and no fdda is recommended due to its higher accuracy when estimating relatively high wind speeds over the ocean surface while the possible underestimation by era interim param 2 and fdda will bring the ship to a high risk and thus should be avoided it should also be noticed here that the era5 data with a higher spatial and temporal resolution than era interim data should be used for future studies besides the observed cases are still limited at present and further analysis of newly observed data by another vessel will be conducted in the future study credit authorship contribution statement chen chen conceptualization methodology visualization investigation kenji sasa supervision validation

21841,the coastal areas of the red sea are characterized by shallow banks of fringing and barrier reefs that provide protection against coastal hazards and erosion by dissipating wave energy this study investigates the wave climate and extremes of a reef protected coastal zone in the red sea using a high resolution coupled wave and circulation model adcirc swan configured on an unstructured grid forced with the meteorological fields from high resolution regional atmospheric model our simulations suggest that the relatively narrow offshore reefs with steep fore reef slopes dissipate 40 50 of the wave energy propagating towards the shoreline and this is more pronounced during extremes the impact of the coupling on determining the wave climate is negligible but is significant for storms with 10 cm higher significant wave height hs during the observed period the back reef wave climatology computed from 30 year model simulations shows that the mean hs distribution is uniform throughout the year and extremes occur more often from february to may different return levels of hs in the sheltered areas are estimated using extreme value analysis our results emphasize that preserving the complex offshore reefs is crucial for mitigating the coastal hazards of high energy waves which are projected to increase with climate change keywords red sea waves swan adcirc coral reef extremes wave sheltering 1 introduction coastal zones are highly complex dynamical systems that support important marine lives and accommodate most of the heavily populated and developed terrestrial zones worldwide coastal areas have high physical and environmental diversity owing to the heterogeneity of the morphology of the coast and its hydrodynamic components such as waves tides currents and sea level changes and the complexity of the nearshore bathymetry among the various hydrodynamic forces waves transfer great energy to the shore cause important stress to coastal structures and operations oumeraci 1994 increase the speed of sediment transport and coastal erosion masselink et al 2016 postacchini et al 2017 and affect dune breaching roelvink et al 2009 and inundation bertin et al 2012 waves also often act as a central component of coastal hazards contributing to extreme water levels and runup stockdon et al 2006 vousdoukas et al 2012 thus knowledge of the ocean wave climate of a region is vital for a wide range of applications including coastal oceanographic studies coastal management activities and ocean engineering waves propagating towards a coastline undergo a variety of transformation processes including wave refraction diffraction and shoaling and superimpose locally generated wind waves chen et al 2005 londhe and deo 2004 along the shore the characteristics of waves near the coastal environment can be easily modified by the presence of an island or reef owing to their complex bathymetry as they dissipate wave energy away from the shoreline ferrario et al 2014 when waves shoal on reefs they are amplified by the shoaling process and reduced by the frictional dissipation after propagating over the rough reef topography symonds et al 1995 if the depth is sufficiently shallow the energy of waves dissipates as they break along the relatively steep fore reef young 1989 monismith et al 2013 in short the towering structures of reefs act as a natural breakwater providing protection to coastal areas against hazards such as wave runup overtopping flooding and erosion the littoral areas on both sides of the red sea are characterized by complex systems of fringing and barrier reefs these coral reefs effectively dissipate wave energy and protect the shoreline and backreef lagoons despite the abundance of studies conducted on the red sea reef hydrodynamics monismith et al 2013 reidenbach et al 2006 and ecosystems raitsos et al 2017 the wave climates of reef protected environments are yet to be studied understanding the wave climate of such an environment is important as it governs the processes behind the morphological changes of coastal reefs and the shore especially under high energy wave conditions in this study we investigate the evolution and propagation of waves in a partially reef protected coastal environment in the red sea see section 2 for details we focus on the mean and extreme wave conditions and aim to better understand the significance of coral reefs in protecting the shoreline this is important as several recent studies have reported that the coastal protection offered by reefs is under threat due to coral degradation and sea level rise which will increase the submergence depths and therefore expose reef protected coastlines to larger waves grady et al 2013 quataert et al 2015 in order to achieve this objective a high resolution coupled wave and circulation model configured on an unstructured grid forced with the meteorological fields from a high resolution regional atmospheric model is used in this study the coupled model is used to account for any changes in the wave heights resulting from the variations in water levels and currents based on 30 year high resolution hindcast data the characteristics of the wave climate and the estimated return periods of wave heights from extreme value analyses are presented the back reef climatology and the results of an extreme value analysis suggest that the wave dissipation by relatively narrow offshore reefs and by the steep fore reef slopes is instrumental in determining the wave characteristics of the studied area and is more pronounced during storm extreme events the remainder of this paper is organized as follows we begin with a detailed description of the study region in section 2 the materials and methods are presented in section 3 section 4 presents our modeling approaches and validations of the simulated fields the mean wave climate is described in section 5 and section 6 presents the extreme value analysis finally a summary and conclusion of this study are provided in section 7 2 study area the red sea is a meridionally elongated basin that lies in a deep rift valley between africa and asia with an average depth of 490 m and maximum depth of 2300 m it has a narrow and shallow connection to the indian ocean through the bab el mandeb strait in the south the coastal areas of the red sea are characterized by shallow banks from its genesis that provide suitable habitats over wide areas for the development of coral reefs accommodating one of the world s largest coral reef complexes persga 2010 the high mountain ridges bordering both sides of the red sea have a significant impact on the local wind regimes of the basin which are characterized by strong seasonal winter and summer variability in summer northwest nw winds dominate the basin during winter between october and april both nw and southeast se winds are present in the northern and southern parts of the basin respectively valleys cut across the bordering mountain ridges that generate the typical winds characterizing the local wind regimes the characteristics of the red sea including circulation wind and wave conditions and seasonal changes have been extensively investigated in recent studies langodan et al 2014 2016 p r shanas et al 2017a b yao et al 2014 zhan et al 2014 as they are wind driven wind waves follow accordingly the ocean wave characteristics along most of the coastal red sea are regulated by the coral reefs and the dissipation of wave energy by offshore waves breaking over reefs has significant implications on shoreline stability in this study the wave evolution and propagation in the north central coastal areas of the red sea are analyzed covering the coastline of king abdullah economic city kaec located in the western kingdom of saudi arabia ksa approximately 150 km north of the city of jeddah see fig 1 kaec is a new city under development along the saudi coast with an area of 181 square kilometers comprising king abdullah port the largest port on the red sea the coastal communities residential districts the haramain railway district and the industrial valley the study area is surrounded by numerous coral reef systems with both fringing and offshore reefs on the ocean side and a shallow lagoon on the southern side that extends nearly 9 km from the entrance to its innermost point approximately 15 km offshore the marginal shelf of the study area consists of shallow platforms occupied by scattered coral systems rising from inter reef sandy bottoms the ocean facing side of these platforms has near vertical cliffs that mark the edge of the red sea trough beyond which the topography rapidly drops to depths of approximately 400 800 m montaggioni et al 1986 our study focuses on the wave climate and extremes of the area between the offshore reefs and shoreline where the offshore waves are partially blocked by the chain of towering reefs 3 materials and methods 3 1 available observations as part of a kaec study to understand the physical characteristics along the coastline different met ocean instruments were deployed at the locations shown in fig 1 between december 19 2006 and february 21 2007 the upward looking workhorse with waves acoustic doppler current profiler whw adcp was deployed to measure the waves and currents at hourly intervals at two locations with water depths of 18 2 m buoyn and 11 2 m buoym at 500 m and 350 m distances from the coast for buoyn and buoym respectively these instruments sample at a rate of 2hz with an accuracy of 1 of the observed signals one aanderaa meteorological station marked as met in fig 1 with sensors 8 6 m above ground was configured on land to record the meteorological parameters at 10 min intervals the sensors measure the wind speeds within the range of 0 5 50 m s 1 with an accuracy of 2 and directions with an accuracy of 5 valeport 740 radio tide gauges and aanderaa water level recorder were also used to measure water levels every 10 m at locations 1 to 5 shown in fig 1 3 2 atmospheric forcing the advanced research weather research and forecasting model wrf see skamarock et al 2008 was implemented with two two way nested domains with horizontal resolutions of 30 and 10 km and 51 vertical levels the large domain extends between 5 s and 39 n and 15 63 e and the nested domain covers the red sea between 7 and 30 n and 31 47 e the employed physics in the study were described by langodan et al 2016 and yesubabu et al 2016 the initial and boundary conditions for the wrf model were obtained from the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the model was further assimilated available observations in the region in six hourly cycles using a three dimensional variational 3dvar approach yesubabu et al 2016 the model was initialized at 1200 utc daily and integrated for 36 h using boundary conditions that were updated every 6 h the outputs are made available at 1 h intervals corresponding to the 12 36 forecast interval i e 01 and 00 1 d utc of each day the resulting reanalysis for the red sea was validated against buoy and scatterometer data langodan et al 2016 reported model measured data best fit slopes of 1 01 root mean square error rmse of 1 03 m s 1 and scatter index of 0 31 to generate long term wave model data for the study area 30 years january 1 1985 december 31 2014 of hourly wind data with a resolution of 10 km were used 3 3 coupled wave circulation model the wave conditions of the red sea were simulated using a coupled wave and circulation model configured on an unstructured grid the model couples the advanced circulation adcirc version 50 99 13 luettich et al 1992 luettich and westerink 2004 and simulating waves nearshore swan version 40 91 booij et al 1999 models utilizing a common unstructured triangular grid zijlema 2010 dietrich et al 2011 the model domain extends into the arabian sea see fig 1 to specify open ocean tides the unstructured grid permits the creation of a grid with variable resolution over the domain and the common model grid for both the circulation and wave models facilitates the sharing of boundary conditions and direct exchange of variables between the models without interpolation the grid resolution varied from a maximum vertex spacing of approximately 60 km near the open boundary to 5 km in the red sea and a high resolution grid spacing of 60 80 m near the study area along the kaec coastline the resulting unstructured triangular mesh has a total 92 215 nodes 180 695 triangular elements the high resolution bathymetry for the coastal waters up to 30 m depth near kaec was obtained by conducting a lidar light detection and ranging survey between february 10 and 21 2007 the survey covers a bathymetric area of approximately 118 km2 providing depth values at a resolution of 0 5 m with an accuracy of 10 cm the bathymetry and coral reef information obtained from saudi hydrographic charts and the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco available at 30 arc second resolution were used to create the remainder topography of the domain for the swan model the wave direction is discretized into 36 regular bins and the frequency is logarithmically distributed over 40 bins ranging from 0 031384 to 1 42 hz the wave growth mechanisms due to wind formulation is based on cavaleri and rizzoli 1981 and janssen 1989 1991 whitecapping uses the komen et al 1984 formulation in the shallow water the wave breaking due to depth is determined spectrally according to the model of battjes and janssen 1978 with a breaking parameter of γ 0 73 the bottom friction is based on the jonswap formulation hasselmann et al 1973 with a friction coefficient cb 0 067 m2 s 3 and the triad nonlinear interactions are computed with the lumped triad approximation of eldeberky 1996 both the spectral and directional speeds are limited by a courant friedrichs lewy condition of 0 25 to limit spurious refractions dietrich et al 2013 the coupled adcirc swan is forced with wind and pressure fields at the surface from the high resolution regional reanalysis described in section 3 1 and by the tidal elevation at the open boundary obtained from the global model fes 2012 finite element solution model carrère et al 2013 the major tidal constituents i e m2 s2 k2 n2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 were used to force the tidal elevation at the open boundary we used a quadratic bottom stress formulation with a dimensionless friction coefficient of 0 0025 horizontal eddy viscosity of 5 m2 s 1 and time step of 10 s for the simulations the time step for the wave model and coupling interval were set to 600 s the boundary conditions for the waves were not specified at the open boundary as these do not affect the basin 3 4 extreme value computations extreme value analysis eva aims at estimating the occurrence of extreme values based on the statistical analysis of the observed modeled data coles 2001 the generalized extreme value gev and generalized pareto distribution gpd are the two most commonly used distributions for determining extreme ocean waves gumbel 1958 pickands 1975 coles 2001 caires 2011 the selection of the data used for analysis is one of the important factors determining the reliability of the estimated extremes a detailed description of the selection of data for a particular distribution was reported by caires 2011 and davison and smith 1990 gev estimates the wave height with certain return periods based on block maxima which are typically the annual maxima leadbetter et al 1983 and gpd follows a peak over threshold pot approach in which it includes all the local maxima or storm peaks above a certain threshold as the annual maxima do not provide a suitable sample for estimating the extremes we adopted the r largest method smith 1986 for our gev analysis which considers a number of the largest observations from a block period block period refers to dividing the total length of data into non overlapping periods of equal size and then focusing on the maximum value within each period the block size is flexible can be chosen according to the study in extreme value analysis the length of the block period is often chosen as a block of a month monthly block block of year yearly block etc the details of the threshold selection for pot are discussed in section 6 1 the distribution fitting and parameter estimation are conducted using the wafo toolbox brodtkorb et al 2000 with the maximum likelihood estimate ml and the probability weighted moments pwm methods prescot and walden 1980 hosking et al 1985 the gev distribution for the random variable h s has the following cumulative distribution function cdf hosking et al 1985 coles 2001 g e v h s μ σ δ exp 1 δ h s μ σ 1 δ f o r δ 0 exp exp h s μ σ f o r δ 0 where μ σ and δ respectively represent the location scale and shape parameters of the distribution varying within the ranges of μ σ 0 and δ by setting the shape parameter δ the most common distributions such as gumbel δ 0 fréchet δ 0 and weibull δ 0 can be obtained the return period h p can then be estimated based on the gev distribution model as follows h p μ σ δ 1 l o g 1 1 t δ f o r δ 0 μ σ ln l o g 1 1 t f o r δ 0 the cdf of gpd is given by g p d h s μ σ δ 1 1 δ h s μ σ 1 δ f o r δ 0 1 exp h s μ σ f o r δ 0 the return period can be estimated based on the gpd distribution as follows r p μ σ δ 1 λ t δ f o r δ 0 μ σ ln λ t f o r δ 0 where λ n u n n u is the value exceeding the selected threshold μ 0 and n is the number of years in the record 4 modeling wave conditions over the study area 4 1 model validation as it is the primary driver for wave models the quality of the wind plays a critical role in determining the accuracy of wave predictions simulating robust wind fields in enclosed basins and coastal areas is challenging as they are substantially influenced by the surrounding orography see cavaleri et al 2018 for a review and discussion on state of the art wave modeling in coastal and inner seas langodan et al 2014 investigated the quality of wind and wave model outputs in the red sea using standard meteorological products and local wind and wave models and concluded that high resolution local wind fields are required to accurately simulate the wave fields in the basin langodan et al 2016 investigated the overall quality of the high resolution reanalysis wind fields over the whole red sea basin here we further perform the model validations over the study area over the period with available observations between december 2006 and february 2007 the upper panel of fig 2 compares the observed and modeled wind speeds in the study region see fig 1 for the location and the corresponding rose plots are displayed in upper panel of fig 3 where the wind direction is displayed in meteorological convention the computed rmse and correlation coefficient cc values between the observed and modeled wind speeds are labeled on the scatter plot the results show that the wrf model provides a reasonable agreement with observations the spread of wind speed is substantial but typical for a coastal environment cavaleri et al 2018 the asymmetry of the distributions in the scatter plot suggests a tendency towards the overestimation of high wind speeds due to the enhanced westward mountain gap winds as observed in the rose plots the middle and lower panels of fig 2 compare the observed and simulated significant wave heights hs for 49 days at buoyn and buoym respectively see fig 1 for their locations the rose plots of the observed and modeled wave heights at buoym are shown in the lower panel of fig 3 where the wave direction is in oceanographic convention the wave model performs reasonably well in comparison to the measured wave heights at the observed locations a few events are not predicted very well which is common in an environment where the wave heights rapidly change in general the errors are sufficiently small to generate long term wave data for the region using the 10 km reanalyzed winds and the current wave model configuration table 1 outline the validation results of tidal constituents derived using a harmonic analysis on one month of data at five locations in fig 1 the amplitudes and phases of observed and modeled constituents along with their difference for five major constituents are presented the performance of the model in reproducing the tidal constituents is satisfactory as indicated by the differences the average absolute differences aads of amplitudes of individual tidal constituents ranged 0 4 1 5 cm in terms of percentage aads account 5 15 of the average of the observed amplitudes with highest percentage errors in m2 and s2 the aads in phases of the constituents from model and observation ranged between 1 and 12 which is only about 1 8 of the observations 4 2 wave attenuation by coral reefs this section qualitatively assesses the dampening of offshore waves propagating towards the shoreline by the coral reefs located in the vicinity of the study area fig 4 a shows the spatial distribution of waves for an observed high wave event that occurred on january 5 2007 generated by the southward propagation of waves driven by sustained northerly winds along the axis of the red sea the strong winds created an offshore wave heights of 4 5 m that are observed to break on the fore reefs of the study area this decreased the wave height between the offshore reefs and shoreline to 1 2 m with the maximum hs reaching 1 8 m as shown in the time series plotted in fig 2d to further quantify the dampening of waves by the coral reefs we removed the offshore reefs from the model the water depths around the reefs were set to 40 m to remove any dampening effects on the waves propagating from the north fig 4b shows the spatial distribution of waves for the simulations of the same event shown in fig 4a and shows that the wave height without reefs could have reached 4 m near the shoreline the relative difference between the simulated wave height resulting from the model with and without coral reefs is estimated by normalizing the difference with respect to the waves with coral reefs 100 x hs without reef hs with reef hs with reef the percentage of the change in the mean wave climate average of significant wave height for the two month simulation shown in fig 4c increased by 40 50 in the region without offshore coral reefs this shows that the offshore reefs play a significant role in the study area protecting the shoreline from the impacts of high waves by damping almost half of their wave heights 4 3 coupling effects the wave and circulation models used in this study are fully coupled swan used the water levels and currents computed by adcirc to calculate the wave evolution and adcirc used the radiation stress gradients from swan in the momentum equation we analyzed the dependence of the wave model outputs on the coupling with the circulation model by comparing the coupled and uncoupled model simulations fig 5 a shows the mean difference between the coupled and uncoupled model outputs over the observations period over much of the studied area weak currents and deep bathymetry see the supplementary fig s1 limit the impact of currents on wave propagation increases in wave heights are most noticeable in the shallow regions of the study area our results show that the uncoupled model outputs were not significantly different from the fully coupled model with maximum variations in the mean wave climate of less than 5 the difference in the wave height resulted from the wave current interactions were more pronounced in the vicinity of the reefs which is likely due to the interactions with shallow bathymetry the importance of coupling for accurately predicting the waves and water levels during extreme weather events has been already reported by many previous studies staneva et al 2016 samiksha et al 2017 here we assess the impact of the coupled system on wave characteristics considering an event with particularly high wind speed the difference between the coupled and uncoupled model simulations for the high wave event at 16 utc january 05 2007 is presented in fig 5b in the open sea where the water depth is large there are no significant differences between the coupled and uncoupled hs however along the coastal areas and near the reefs where the total water depth and current changes are highest the impact of coupling seems to be significant with changes in hs reaching about 15 cm fig 5b the variations in the wave heights at a selected location on a reef flat see fig 5a for location during jan 2007 including the storm event as they result from the coupled and uncoupled model simulations are shown in fig 5c the reef is 2 m below the sea level and the water level increase due to tide wind and wave setup adds another 0 35m to the water depth a clear tidal signal can be seen in the hs in the coupled model simulations with a maximum difference reaching about 15 cm in comparison to the uncoupled model the tidal amplitude in the vicinity of kaec is about 15 cm during spring tide with the weather effects significantly contributing to the water level 40 cm the wave setup is significant only in the regions with strong gradients in bathymetry and reaches a maximum of about 10 cm the combined maximum water levels in the deep waters reach about 50 cm and high values up to 70 cm inside the lagoon during the simulation period this higher water levels expected to allow more waves to overtop the reefs affecting the wave conditions in the partly sheltered areas the hourly time series of significant wave heights at the buoy location supplementary fig s2 suggests that the wave fields are affected by the coupling with improved performance from the coupled system in particular the slight increase in wave height about 10 cm during the storm events provides better agreement of simulated wave heights from the coupled model with the observations in comparison to uncoupled model this increased skill of the coupled model demonstrates the relevance of the coupled modeling system to accurately simulate the high waves over a reef sheltered area the effect of hydrodynamics on waves in the long term simulations does not appear to significantly contribute to the mean wave climate of the study area however the increased skill of the coupled model in predicting the storms events provided improved estimates of the extreme values with changes reaching few centimeters 5 wave climate of the study area the climatology of the studied region was determined using the 30 year wave hindcast data fig 6 shows the mean standard deviation and maximum values obtained for wind speed significant wave height and mean wave period the mean wind speed over the studied area ranged between 3 and 4 m s 1 with slightly higher variability near the shoreline the maximum wind speeds in the study area which reached 20 m s 1 are associated with the westward transversal jets blowing through the valleys of the bordering mountain ridges however these transversal jets have limited influence on the local wave climate in the immediate vicinity of the shorelines and their effects are further diminished by the limited fetch between the sheltering reef and the shoreline as discussed in section 4 2 the offshore reef systems break or dissipate the energetic waves as they approach the shoreline and create high and low wave height regimes before and after the reef systems respectively the high waves on the forereef are typically remotely generated by the northerly winds blowing along the axis of the red sea langodan et al 2017a b the monthly mean hs values shown in fig 7 show a wave height lower than 1 m between the reef systems and shoreline for all months our analysis shows a similar spatial distribution of waves throughout the year with increased wave heights during summer the seasonal variability of winds in the northern red sea is very minimal with northerly winds predominant over the studied area throughout the year the waves generated in the north propagate towards the studied area during all seasons the higher concentration of reefs and shallow bathymetry in the southern part of the studied area result in lower wave heights than those of the northern shorelines the wave height regimes in the studied region during october and november were relatively lower while the mean hs climate exhibited an almost uniform distribution of waves in all months as shown in fig 8 this is not the case for the 99th percentile of hs specifically the estimates of the 99th percentile of hs show significant differences in the distribution with high waves occurring more often between february and june than other months in an area such as the northern red sea which is strongly affected by the mediterranean weather sporadic intense wind events in the form of storm impulses from the mediterranean generate high waves langodan et al 2018 as indicated by the mean wave climate fig 7 low waves are observed in october and november the changes in the distribution of high waves in the forereef are not proportionally transferred to the area between the reef and shoreline due to the waves damping by the reefs the accuracy of the representation of the reef system has thus an important influence on the simulations of the extreme values 6 extreme waves characteristics 6 1 threshold selection for gpd the threshold value and minimum duration between two storms are the key parameters that significantly affect the frequency and exceedance estimates in the pot approach méndez et al 2006 in this study the minimum duration between two events is set to five days which is sufficient for considering independent storms in the study area furthermore the threshold value should be chosen as low as possible so long as the extreme value model fits reasonably well the exceedances of this threshold the dispersion index and mean residual life are two commonly used methods for threshold selection davison and smith 1990 ribatet 2011 the former uses the poisson characteristics of the extreme distribution such that the dispersion index which is the ratio between the variance and the mean is equal to one an acceptable threshold value for a given data point would return a dispersion index with a value close to one brodtkorb et al 2000 for the latter we followed the approach of davison and smith 1990 which involves plotting a range of thresholds against their corresponding mean excess values and identifying the threshold value above which the curve becomes linear fig 9 a plots the dispersion index for different hs thresholds at a representative location in the study area see fig 1 a threshold value corresponding to a dispersion index close to one is acceptable for selecting a sizeable sample of peaks and was found to be 2 66 m for the selected location as shown in the figure the residual plot fig 9b between the mean excess gpd and threshold also returns a comparable threshold for that particular location we conducted the pot analysis using the dispersion index for all the locations of the study area to estimate the extreme values with gpd method 6 2 return periods for waves the return periods of the waves are computed following the gev and gpd methods table 2 shows the estimated parameters and rmse as obtained from the ml and pwm methods for both gev and gpd at a certain location in the study area see fig 1 the corresponding cdf and q q plots are presented in fig 10 the fitting of the distribution models to the sampled data is validated by computing rmse the residual between the empirical cumulative distribution obtained from the data and the theoretical cumulative distribution of the gev model the ml method yields a slightly lower rmse for both the gev and gpd distributions and better fits the gpd distribution model to the sampled data the estimated return level for 10 25 50 and 100 years at the considered location is also presented in table 2 the gev estimated return levels are significantly lower than the gpd levels although the statistics indicate reasonably good approximations the 100 yr return level of the gev model 3 58 m is even lower than the maximum simulated hs 3 950 m however the estimates of both gev and gpd found to be equally acceptable near the shorelines 3 km with lower rmse for both distributions the limitation of the gev method is that it does not fully utilize all of the information contained in the dataset thereby introducing unnecessary uncertainty in the estimated extremes moreover the seasonality and interactions of multiple wave systems play a significant role in the estimation of extremes when waves with different directions co exist the resulting distribution is referred to as mixed distribution such a mixed distribution and non linearity cause further uncertainties in the estimates upon modeling using a block maxima method or annual extremes mathiesen et al 1994 caires 2011 waves with mixed distribution occurs due to the co existence of different wave systems although the seasonal variability of waves in the red sea is associated with the monsoonal wind reversal the occasional localized jets through the mountain valleys bordering the red sea have prominent influence on the significant wave heights in the basin ralston et al 2013 langodan et al 2014 the convergence of the nnw and sse winds at the centre of the red sea also contributes to the overall variability of waves in the red sea the winds and waves zones are typically occurred around 19 20 n but the location varies between 15 to 21 5 n langodan et al 2015 as these features are consistent during the winter and summer every year the influence of these on the waves variability would be clearly reflected in the monthly max wave height being a reef sheltered coastal zone the study area is weekly influenced by the convergence zone and or mountain gap jets which reduces the uncertainties in the estimated hs with certain return periods we extended our analysis to the study area and confirmed that the ml method with gpd provides a lower rmse than all of the other methods results not shown the spatial analysis was thus conducted using the ml method with the gpd model fig 11 plots the resulting spatial distribution of the return levels of hs for 10 25 50 and 100 years the spatial distribution clearly shows the dominant wave events that occur in the offshore region with substantial damping near the kaec coastline the lowest values are found along the central coastal regions and the highest along the northwestern side within the region approximately 5 km from the coast the distribution of extreme values is higher in the northern coast 22 4 22 6 n than in the southern coast 22 2 22 4 n this is partly explained by the bathymetry and depth variations in the study area the presence of the reefs significantly affects the waves in particular the patches of shallow reef areas in the central part of the domain resulting in a significantly different wave height for a certain return period than that of the offshore region this protects the coast from the events of high waves as they get damped by the reefs 7 summary and conclusion both sides of the red sea are characterized by complex systems of fringing and barrier reefs that act as a natural breakwater to dissipate wave energy and provide significant protection to the shoreline and backreef lagoons this study investigated the wave climate and extremes of such a reef protected environment in the red sea covering the coastline of king abdullah economic city kaec located in the east of the kingdom of saudi arabia approximately 150 km north of jeddah a coupled wave circulation model adcirc swan was successfully implemented for this purpose the coupled model was forced with long term high resolution meteorological fields generated using an assimilative wrf model by downscaling ecmwf reanalysis the comparison of the model simulations with wave observations demonstrated the relevance the coupled modeling system to accurately simulate the high wave events over a reef sheltered region the coupling of waves and currents suggests a small impact on the mean wave climate but seems to be important for improving the model s skill during storm events a comparison of models with and without coupling against the buoy observations suggests an increased skill from the coupled model during stormy events fig s2 we used the coupled modeling system for long term simulations to account for the impact of coupling over the study area and found a change in wave height of about 15 cm in particular during extreme conditions fig 4c and fig s2 the distributions of simulated waves in the study area considering or not the offshore reefs were substantially different the results fig 4 showed that the wave height of about 1 m in simulation with cora reefs in the back reef increases to up to 2 m without reefs suggesting significant reduction of the wave heights at reefs by up to 40 50 compared to those of offshore waves the wave climate over the study area was further studied based on 30 year coupled model simulations as northerly winds with minimum variability prevail over the northern red sea during all seasons the wave climate exhibits a uniform distribution of waves over the studied area however the differences in the distribution of the 99th percentile suggested increased occurrences of high waves from february to may in accordance with the weather patterns of the mediterranean region the hs with certain return periods were also estimated using the gev and gpd methods the comparison of the estimated parameters and return periods from these two distribution models for different locations of the study area suggests that gpd using the peak over threshold method performed better than the gev as it exhibited a lower rmse and more reasonable extreme values after acquiring the best fitting model for the study area the spatial distributions of the return levels were estimated for 10 25 50 and 100 years the results show that the presence of reefs significantly affects the extreme waves by dampening their energy and are instrumental in protecting the coast against high waves the quantitative spatial analyses presented here highlight the reduction in wave energy by coral reefs which provide natural protection against storms and the high energy waves the results may also guide decision makers to implement strategies to maximize the protection of ecosystem associated with the coral reef structures the factors that affect the damping of waves such as the role of the reef s complexity in terms of its structural orientation or the increased water depth over shallow reefs due to the sea level rise associated with climate change still require further investigation credit authorship contribution statement

21841,the coastal areas of the red sea are characterized by shallow banks of fringing and barrier reefs that provide protection against coastal hazards and erosion by dissipating wave energy this study investigates the wave climate and extremes of a reef protected coastal zone in the red sea using a high resolution coupled wave and circulation model adcirc swan configured on an unstructured grid forced with the meteorological fields from high resolution regional atmospheric model our simulations suggest that the relatively narrow offshore reefs with steep fore reef slopes dissipate 40 50 of the wave energy propagating towards the shoreline and this is more pronounced during extremes the impact of the coupling on determining the wave climate is negligible but is significant for storms with 10 cm higher significant wave height hs during the observed period the back reef wave climatology computed from 30 year model simulations shows that the mean hs distribution is uniform throughout the year and extremes occur more often from february to may different return levels of hs in the sheltered areas are estimated using extreme value analysis our results emphasize that preserving the complex offshore reefs is crucial for mitigating the coastal hazards of high energy waves which are projected to increase with climate change keywords red sea waves swan adcirc coral reef extremes wave sheltering 1 introduction coastal zones are highly complex dynamical systems that support important marine lives and accommodate most of the heavily populated and developed terrestrial zones worldwide coastal areas have high physical and environmental diversity owing to the heterogeneity of the morphology of the coast and its hydrodynamic components such as waves tides currents and sea level changes and the complexity of the nearshore bathymetry among the various hydrodynamic forces waves transfer great energy to the shore cause important stress to coastal structures and operations oumeraci 1994 increase the speed of sediment transport and coastal erosion masselink et al 2016 postacchini et al 2017 and affect dune breaching roelvink et al 2009 and inundation bertin et al 2012 waves also often act as a central component of coastal hazards contributing to extreme water levels and runup stockdon et al 2006 vousdoukas et al 2012 thus knowledge of the ocean wave climate of a region is vital for a wide range of applications including coastal oceanographic studies coastal management activities and ocean engineering waves propagating towards a coastline undergo a variety of transformation processes including wave refraction diffraction and shoaling and superimpose locally generated wind waves chen et al 2005 londhe and deo 2004 along the shore the characteristics of waves near the coastal environment can be easily modified by the presence of an island or reef owing to their complex bathymetry as they dissipate wave energy away from the shoreline ferrario et al 2014 when waves shoal on reefs they are amplified by the shoaling process and reduced by the frictional dissipation after propagating over the rough reef topography symonds et al 1995 if the depth is sufficiently shallow the energy of waves dissipates as they break along the relatively steep fore reef young 1989 monismith et al 2013 in short the towering structures of reefs act as a natural breakwater providing protection to coastal areas against hazards such as wave runup overtopping flooding and erosion the littoral areas on both sides of the red sea are characterized by complex systems of fringing and barrier reefs these coral reefs effectively dissipate wave energy and protect the shoreline and backreef lagoons despite the abundance of studies conducted on the red sea reef hydrodynamics monismith et al 2013 reidenbach et al 2006 and ecosystems raitsos et al 2017 the wave climates of reef protected environments are yet to be studied understanding the wave climate of such an environment is important as it governs the processes behind the morphological changes of coastal reefs and the shore especially under high energy wave conditions in this study we investigate the evolution and propagation of waves in a partially reef protected coastal environment in the red sea see section 2 for details we focus on the mean and extreme wave conditions and aim to better understand the significance of coral reefs in protecting the shoreline this is important as several recent studies have reported that the coastal protection offered by reefs is under threat due to coral degradation and sea level rise which will increase the submergence depths and therefore expose reef protected coastlines to larger waves grady et al 2013 quataert et al 2015 in order to achieve this objective a high resolution coupled wave and circulation model configured on an unstructured grid forced with the meteorological fields from a high resolution regional atmospheric model is used in this study the coupled model is used to account for any changes in the wave heights resulting from the variations in water levels and currents based on 30 year high resolution hindcast data the characteristics of the wave climate and the estimated return periods of wave heights from extreme value analyses are presented the back reef climatology and the results of an extreme value analysis suggest that the wave dissipation by relatively narrow offshore reefs and by the steep fore reef slopes is instrumental in determining the wave characteristics of the studied area and is more pronounced during storm extreme events the remainder of this paper is organized as follows we begin with a detailed description of the study region in section 2 the materials and methods are presented in section 3 section 4 presents our modeling approaches and validations of the simulated fields the mean wave climate is described in section 5 and section 6 presents the extreme value analysis finally a summary and conclusion of this study are provided in section 7 2 study area the red sea is a meridionally elongated basin that lies in a deep rift valley between africa and asia with an average depth of 490 m and maximum depth of 2300 m it has a narrow and shallow connection to the indian ocean through the bab el mandeb strait in the south the coastal areas of the red sea are characterized by shallow banks from its genesis that provide suitable habitats over wide areas for the development of coral reefs accommodating one of the world s largest coral reef complexes persga 2010 the high mountain ridges bordering both sides of the red sea have a significant impact on the local wind regimes of the basin which are characterized by strong seasonal winter and summer variability in summer northwest nw winds dominate the basin during winter between october and april both nw and southeast se winds are present in the northern and southern parts of the basin respectively valleys cut across the bordering mountain ridges that generate the typical winds characterizing the local wind regimes the characteristics of the red sea including circulation wind and wave conditions and seasonal changes have been extensively investigated in recent studies langodan et al 2014 2016 p r shanas et al 2017a b yao et al 2014 zhan et al 2014 as they are wind driven wind waves follow accordingly the ocean wave characteristics along most of the coastal red sea are regulated by the coral reefs and the dissipation of wave energy by offshore waves breaking over reefs has significant implications on shoreline stability in this study the wave evolution and propagation in the north central coastal areas of the red sea are analyzed covering the coastline of king abdullah economic city kaec located in the western kingdom of saudi arabia ksa approximately 150 km north of the city of jeddah see fig 1 kaec is a new city under development along the saudi coast with an area of 181 square kilometers comprising king abdullah port the largest port on the red sea the coastal communities residential districts the haramain railway district and the industrial valley the study area is surrounded by numerous coral reef systems with both fringing and offshore reefs on the ocean side and a shallow lagoon on the southern side that extends nearly 9 km from the entrance to its innermost point approximately 15 km offshore the marginal shelf of the study area consists of shallow platforms occupied by scattered coral systems rising from inter reef sandy bottoms the ocean facing side of these platforms has near vertical cliffs that mark the edge of the red sea trough beyond which the topography rapidly drops to depths of approximately 400 800 m montaggioni et al 1986 our study focuses on the wave climate and extremes of the area between the offshore reefs and shoreline where the offshore waves are partially blocked by the chain of towering reefs 3 materials and methods 3 1 available observations as part of a kaec study to understand the physical characteristics along the coastline different met ocean instruments were deployed at the locations shown in fig 1 between december 19 2006 and february 21 2007 the upward looking workhorse with waves acoustic doppler current profiler whw adcp was deployed to measure the waves and currents at hourly intervals at two locations with water depths of 18 2 m buoyn and 11 2 m buoym at 500 m and 350 m distances from the coast for buoyn and buoym respectively these instruments sample at a rate of 2hz with an accuracy of 1 of the observed signals one aanderaa meteorological station marked as met in fig 1 with sensors 8 6 m above ground was configured on land to record the meteorological parameters at 10 min intervals the sensors measure the wind speeds within the range of 0 5 50 m s 1 with an accuracy of 2 and directions with an accuracy of 5 valeport 740 radio tide gauges and aanderaa water level recorder were also used to measure water levels every 10 m at locations 1 to 5 shown in fig 1 3 2 atmospheric forcing the advanced research weather research and forecasting model wrf see skamarock et al 2008 was implemented with two two way nested domains with horizontal resolutions of 30 and 10 km and 51 vertical levels the large domain extends between 5 s and 39 n and 15 63 e and the nested domain covers the red sea between 7 and 30 n and 31 47 e the employed physics in the study were described by langodan et al 2016 and yesubabu et al 2016 the initial and boundary conditions for the wrf model were obtained from the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the model was further assimilated available observations in the region in six hourly cycles using a three dimensional variational 3dvar approach yesubabu et al 2016 the model was initialized at 1200 utc daily and integrated for 36 h using boundary conditions that were updated every 6 h the outputs are made available at 1 h intervals corresponding to the 12 36 forecast interval i e 01 and 00 1 d utc of each day the resulting reanalysis for the red sea was validated against buoy and scatterometer data langodan et al 2016 reported model measured data best fit slopes of 1 01 root mean square error rmse of 1 03 m s 1 and scatter index of 0 31 to generate long term wave model data for the study area 30 years january 1 1985 december 31 2014 of hourly wind data with a resolution of 10 km were used 3 3 coupled wave circulation model the wave conditions of the red sea were simulated using a coupled wave and circulation model configured on an unstructured grid the model couples the advanced circulation adcirc version 50 99 13 luettich et al 1992 luettich and westerink 2004 and simulating waves nearshore swan version 40 91 booij et al 1999 models utilizing a common unstructured triangular grid zijlema 2010 dietrich et al 2011 the model domain extends into the arabian sea see fig 1 to specify open ocean tides the unstructured grid permits the creation of a grid with variable resolution over the domain and the common model grid for both the circulation and wave models facilitates the sharing of boundary conditions and direct exchange of variables between the models without interpolation the grid resolution varied from a maximum vertex spacing of approximately 60 km near the open boundary to 5 km in the red sea and a high resolution grid spacing of 60 80 m near the study area along the kaec coastline the resulting unstructured triangular mesh has a total 92 215 nodes 180 695 triangular elements the high resolution bathymetry for the coastal waters up to 30 m depth near kaec was obtained by conducting a lidar light detection and ranging survey between february 10 and 21 2007 the survey covers a bathymetric area of approximately 118 km2 providing depth values at a resolution of 0 5 m with an accuracy of 10 cm the bathymetry and coral reef information obtained from saudi hydrographic charts and the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco available at 30 arc second resolution were used to create the remainder topography of the domain for the swan model the wave direction is discretized into 36 regular bins and the frequency is logarithmically distributed over 40 bins ranging from 0 031384 to 1 42 hz the wave growth mechanisms due to wind formulation is based on cavaleri and rizzoli 1981 and janssen 1989 1991 whitecapping uses the komen et al 1984 formulation in the shallow water the wave breaking due to depth is determined spectrally according to the model of battjes and janssen 1978 with a breaking parameter of γ 0 73 the bottom friction is based on the jonswap formulation hasselmann et al 1973 with a friction coefficient cb 0 067 m2 s 3 and the triad nonlinear interactions are computed with the lumped triad approximation of eldeberky 1996 both the spectral and directional speeds are limited by a courant friedrichs lewy condition of 0 25 to limit spurious refractions dietrich et al 2013 the coupled adcirc swan is forced with wind and pressure fields at the surface from the high resolution regional reanalysis described in section 3 1 and by the tidal elevation at the open boundary obtained from the global model fes 2012 finite element solution model carrère et al 2013 the major tidal constituents i e m2 s2 k2 n2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 were used to force the tidal elevation at the open boundary we used a quadratic bottom stress formulation with a dimensionless friction coefficient of 0 0025 horizontal eddy viscosity of 5 m2 s 1 and time step of 10 s for the simulations the time step for the wave model and coupling interval were set to 600 s the boundary conditions for the waves were not specified at the open boundary as these do not affect the basin 3 4 extreme value computations extreme value analysis eva aims at estimating the occurrence of extreme values based on the statistical analysis of the observed modeled data coles 2001 the generalized extreme value gev and generalized pareto distribution gpd are the two most commonly used distributions for determining extreme ocean waves gumbel 1958 pickands 1975 coles 2001 caires 2011 the selection of the data used for analysis is one of the important factors determining the reliability of the estimated extremes a detailed description of the selection of data for a particular distribution was reported by caires 2011 and davison and smith 1990 gev estimates the wave height with certain return periods based on block maxima which are typically the annual maxima leadbetter et al 1983 and gpd follows a peak over threshold pot approach in which it includes all the local maxima or storm peaks above a certain threshold as the annual maxima do not provide a suitable sample for estimating the extremes we adopted the r largest method smith 1986 for our gev analysis which considers a number of the largest observations from a block period block period refers to dividing the total length of data into non overlapping periods of equal size and then focusing on the maximum value within each period the block size is flexible can be chosen according to the study in extreme value analysis the length of the block period is often chosen as a block of a month monthly block block of year yearly block etc the details of the threshold selection for pot are discussed in section 6 1 the distribution fitting and parameter estimation are conducted using the wafo toolbox brodtkorb et al 2000 with the maximum likelihood estimate ml and the probability weighted moments pwm methods prescot and walden 1980 hosking et al 1985 the gev distribution for the random variable h s has the following cumulative distribution function cdf hosking et al 1985 coles 2001 g e v h s μ σ δ exp 1 δ h s μ σ 1 δ f o r δ 0 exp exp h s μ σ f o r δ 0 where μ σ and δ respectively represent the location scale and shape parameters of the distribution varying within the ranges of μ σ 0 and δ by setting the shape parameter δ the most common distributions such as gumbel δ 0 fréchet δ 0 and weibull δ 0 can be obtained the return period h p can then be estimated based on the gev distribution model as follows h p μ σ δ 1 l o g 1 1 t δ f o r δ 0 μ σ ln l o g 1 1 t f o r δ 0 the cdf of gpd is given by g p d h s μ σ δ 1 1 δ h s μ σ 1 δ f o r δ 0 1 exp h s μ σ f o r δ 0 the return period can be estimated based on the gpd distribution as follows r p μ σ δ 1 λ t δ f o r δ 0 μ σ ln λ t f o r δ 0 where λ n u n n u is the value exceeding the selected threshold μ 0 and n is the number of years in the record 4 modeling wave conditions over the study area 4 1 model validation as it is the primary driver for wave models the quality of the wind plays a critical role in determining the accuracy of wave predictions simulating robust wind fields in enclosed basins and coastal areas is challenging as they are substantially influenced by the surrounding orography see cavaleri et al 2018 for a review and discussion on state of the art wave modeling in coastal and inner seas langodan et al 2014 investigated the quality of wind and wave model outputs in the red sea using standard meteorological products and local wind and wave models and concluded that high resolution local wind fields are required to accurately simulate the wave fields in the basin langodan et al 2016 investigated the overall quality of the high resolution reanalysis wind fields over the whole red sea basin here we further perform the model validations over the study area over the period with available observations between december 2006 and february 2007 the upper panel of fig 2 compares the observed and modeled wind speeds in the study region see fig 1 for the location and the corresponding rose plots are displayed in upper panel of fig 3 where the wind direction is displayed in meteorological convention the computed rmse and correlation coefficient cc values between the observed and modeled wind speeds are labeled on the scatter plot the results show that the wrf model provides a reasonable agreement with observations the spread of wind speed is substantial but typical for a coastal environment cavaleri et al 2018 the asymmetry of the distributions in the scatter plot suggests a tendency towards the overestimation of high wind speeds due to the enhanced westward mountain gap winds as observed in the rose plots the middle and lower panels of fig 2 compare the observed and simulated significant wave heights hs for 49 days at buoyn and buoym respectively see fig 1 for their locations the rose plots of the observed and modeled wave heights at buoym are shown in the lower panel of fig 3 where the wave direction is in oceanographic convention the wave model performs reasonably well in comparison to the measured wave heights at the observed locations a few events are not predicted very well which is common in an environment where the wave heights rapidly change in general the errors are sufficiently small to generate long term wave data for the region using the 10 km reanalyzed winds and the current wave model configuration table 1 outline the validation results of tidal constituents derived using a harmonic analysis on one month of data at five locations in fig 1 the amplitudes and phases of observed and modeled constituents along with their difference for five major constituents are presented the performance of the model in reproducing the tidal constituents is satisfactory as indicated by the differences the average absolute differences aads of amplitudes of individual tidal constituents ranged 0 4 1 5 cm in terms of percentage aads account 5 15 of the average of the observed amplitudes with highest percentage errors in m2 and s2 the aads in phases of the constituents from model and observation ranged between 1 and 12 which is only about 1 8 of the observations 4 2 wave attenuation by coral reefs this section qualitatively assesses the dampening of offshore waves propagating towards the shoreline by the coral reefs located in the vicinity of the study area fig 4 a shows the spatial distribution of waves for an observed high wave event that occurred on january 5 2007 generated by the southward propagation of waves driven by sustained northerly winds along the axis of the red sea the strong winds created an offshore wave heights of 4 5 m that are observed to break on the fore reefs of the study area this decreased the wave height between the offshore reefs and shoreline to 1 2 m with the maximum hs reaching 1 8 m as shown in the time series plotted in fig 2d to further quantify the dampening of waves by the coral reefs we removed the offshore reefs from the model the water depths around the reefs were set to 40 m to remove any dampening effects on the waves propagating from the north fig 4b shows the spatial distribution of waves for the simulations of the same event shown in fig 4a and shows that the wave height without reefs could have reached 4 m near the shoreline the relative difference between the simulated wave height resulting from the model with and without coral reefs is estimated by normalizing the difference with respect to the waves with coral reefs 100 x hs without reef hs with reef hs with reef the percentage of the change in the mean wave climate average of significant wave height for the two month simulation shown in fig 4c increased by 40 50 in the region without offshore coral reefs this shows that the offshore reefs play a significant role in the study area protecting the shoreline from the impacts of high waves by damping almost half of their wave heights 4 3 coupling effects the wave and circulation models used in this study are fully coupled swan used the water levels and currents computed by adcirc to calculate the wave evolution and adcirc used the radiation stress gradients from swan in the momentum equation we analyzed the dependence of the wave model outputs on the coupling with the circulation model by comparing the coupled and uncoupled model simulations fig 5 a shows the mean difference between the coupled and uncoupled model outputs over the observations period over much of the studied area weak currents and deep bathymetry see the supplementary fig s1 limit the impact of currents on wave propagation increases in wave heights are most noticeable in the shallow regions of the study area our results show that the uncoupled model outputs were not significantly different from the fully coupled model with maximum variations in the mean wave climate of less than 5 the difference in the wave height resulted from the wave current interactions were more pronounced in the vicinity of the reefs which is likely due to the interactions with shallow bathymetry the importance of coupling for accurately predicting the waves and water levels during extreme weather events has been already reported by many previous studies staneva et al 2016 samiksha et al 2017 here we assess the impact of the coupled system on wave characteristics considering an event with particularly high wind speed the difference between the coupled and uncoupled model simulations for the high wave event at 16 utc january 05 2007 is presented in fig 5b in the open sea where the water depth is large there are no significant differences between the coupled and uncoupled hs however along the coastal areas and near the reefs where the total water depth and current changes are highest the impact of coupling seems to be significant with changes in hs reaching about 15 cm fig 5b the variations in the wave heights at a selected location on a reef flat see fig 5a for location during jan 2007 including the storm event as they result from the coupled and uncoupled model simulations are shown in fig 5c the reef is 2 m below the sea level and the water level increase due to tide wind and wave setup adds another 0 35m to the water depth a clear tidal signal can be seen in the hs in the coupled model simulations with a maximum difference reaching about 15 cm in comparison to the uncoupled model the tidal amplitude in the vicinity of kaec is about 15 cm during spring tide with the weather effects significantly contributing to the water level 40 cm the wave setup is significant only in the regions with strong gradients in bathymetry and reaches a maximum of about 10 cm the combined maximum water levels in the deep waters reach about 50 cm and high values up to 70 cm inside the lagoon during the simulation period this higher water levels expected to allow more waves to overtop the reefs affecting the wave conditions in the partly sheltered areas the hourly time series of significant wave heights at the buoy location supplementary fig s2 suggests that the wave fields are affected by the coupling with improved performance from the coupled system in particular the slight increase in wave height about 10 cm during the storm events provides better agreement of simulated wave heights from the coupled model with the observations in comparison to uncoupled model this increased skill of the coupled model demonstrates the relevance of the coupled modeling system to accurately simulate the high waves over a reef sheltered area the effect of hydrodynamics on waves in the long term simulations does not appear to significantly contribute to the mean wave climate of the study area however the increased skill of the coupled model in predicting the storms events provided improved estimates of the extreme values with changes reaching few centimeters 5 wave climate of the study area the climatology of the studied region was determined using the 30 year wave hindcast data fig 6 shows the mean standard deviation and maximum values obtained for wind speed significant wave height and mean wave period the mean wind speed over the studied area ranged between 3 and 4 m s 1 with slightly higher variability near the shoreline the maximum wind speeds in the study area which reached 20 m s 1 are associated with the westward transversal jets blowing through the valleys of the bordering mountain ridges however these transversal jets have limited influence on the local wave climate in the immediate vicinity of the shorelines and their effects are further diminished by the limited fetch between the sheltering reef and the shoreline as discussed in section 4 2 the offshore reef systems break or dissipate the energetic waves as they approach the shoreline and create high and low wave height regimes before and after the reef systems respectively the high waves on the forereef are typically remotely generated by the northerly winds blowing along the axis of the red sea langodan et al 2017a b the monthly mean hs values shown in fig 7 show a wave height lower than 1 m between the reef systems and shoreline for all months our analysis shows a similar spatial distribution of waves throughout the year with increased wave heights during summer the seasonal variability of winds in the northern red sea is very minimal with northerly winds predominant over the studied area throughout the year the waves generated in the north propagate towards the studied area during all seasons the higher concentration of reefs and shallow bathymetry in the southern part of the studied area result in lower wave heights than those of the northern shorelines the wave height regimes in the studied region during october and november were relatively lower while the mean hs climate exhibited an almost uniform distribution of waves in all months as shown in fig 8 this is not the case for the 99th percentile of hs specifically the estimates of the 99th percentile of hs show significant differences in the distribution with high waves occurring more often between february and june than other months in an area such as the northern red sea which is strongly affected by the mediterranean weather sporadic intense wind events in the form of storm impulses from the mediterranean generate high waves langodan et al 2018 as indicated by the mean wave climate fig 7 low waves are observed in october and november the changes in the distribution of high waves in the forereef are not proportionally transferred to the area between the reef and shoreline due to the waves damping by the reefs the accuracy of the representation of the reef system has thus an important influence on the simulations of the extreme values 6 extreme waves characteristics 6 1 threshold selection for gpd the threshold value and minimum duration between two storms are the key parameters that significantly affect the frequency and exceedance estimates in the pot approach méndez et al 2006 in this study the minimum duration between two events is set to five days which is sufficient for considering independent storms in the study area furthermore the threshold value should be chosen as low as possible so long as the extreme value model fits reasonably well the exceedances of this threshold the dispersion index and mean residual life are two commonly used methods for threshold selection davison and smith 1990 ribatet 2011 the former uses the poisson characteristics of the extreme distribution such that the dispersion index which is the ratio between the variance and the mean is equal to one an acceptable threshold value for a given data point would return a dispersion index with a value close to one brodtkorb et al 2000 for the latter we followed the approach of davison and smith 1990 which involves plotting a range of thresholds against their corresponding mean excess values and identifying the threshold value above which the curve becomes linear fig 9 a plots the dispersion index for different hs thresholds at a representative location in the study area see fig 1 a threshold value corresponding to a dispersion index close to one is acceptable for selecting a sizeable sample of peaks and was found to be 2 66 m for the selected location as shown in the figure the residual plot fig 9b between the mean excess gpd and threshold also returns a comparable threshold for that particular location we conducted the pot analysis using the dispersion index for all the locations of the study area to estimate the extreme values with gpd method 6 2 return periods for waves the return periods of the waves are computed following the gev and gpd methods table 2 shows the estimated parameters and rmse as obtained from the ml and pwm methods for both gev and gpd at a certain location in the study area see fig 1 the corresponding cdf and q q plots are presented in fig 10 the fitting of the distribution models to the sampled data is validated by computing rmse the residual between the empirical cumulative distribution obtained from the data and the theoretical cumulative distribution of the gev model the ml method yields a slightly lower rmse for both the gev and gpd distributions and better fits the gpd distribution model to the sampled data the estimated return level for 10 25 50 and 100 years at the considered location is also presented in table 2 the gev estimated return levels are significantly lower than the gpd levels although the statistics indicate reasonably good approximations the 100 yr return level of the gev model 3 58 m is even lower than the maximum simulated hs 3 950 m however the estimates of both gev and gpd found to be equally acceptable near the shorelines 3 km with lower rmse for both distributions the limitation of the gev method is that it does not fully utilize all of the information contained in the dataset thereby introducing unnecessary uncertainty in the estimated extremes moreover the seasonality and interactions of multiple wave systems play a significant role in the estimation of extremes when waves with different directions co exist the resulting distribution is referred to as mixed distribution such a mixed distribution and non linearity cause further uncertainties in the estimates upon modeling using a block maxima method or annual extremes mathiesen et al 1994 caires 2011 waves with mixed distribution occurs due to the co existence of different wave systems although the seasonal variability of waves in the red sea is associated with the monsoonal wind reversal the occasional localized jets through the mountain valleys bordering the red sea have prominent influence on the significant wave heights in the basin ralston et al 2013 langodan et al 2014 the convergence of the nnw and sse winds at the centre of the red sea also contributes to the overall variability of waves in the red sea the winds and waves zones are typically occurred around 19 20 n but the location varies between 15 to 21 5 n langodan et al 2015 as these features are consistent during the winter and summer every year the influence of these on the waves variability would be clearly reflected in the monthly max wave height being a reef sheltered coastal zone the study area is weekly influenced by the convergence zone and or mountain gap jets which reduces the uncertainties in the estimated hs with certain return periods we extended our analysis to the study area and confirmed that the ml method with gpd provides a lower rmse than all of the other methods results not shown the spatial analysis was thus conducted using the ml method with the gpd model fig 11 plots the resulting spatial distribution of the return levels of hs for 10 25 50 and 100 years the spatial distribution clearly shows the dominant wave events that occur in the offshore region with substantial damping near the kaec coastline the lowest values are found along the central coastal regions and the highest along the northwestern side within the region approximately 5 km from the coast the distribution of extreme values is higher in the northern coast 22 4 22 6 n than in the southern coast 22 2 22 4 n this is partly explained by the bathymetry and depth variations in the study area the presence of the reefs significantly affects the waves in particular the patches of shallow reef areas in the central part of the domain resulting in a significantly different wave height for a certain return period than that of the offshore region this protects the coast from the events of high waves as they get damped by the reefs 7 summary and conclusion both sides of the red sea are characterized by complex systems of fringing and barrier reefs that act as a natural breakwater to dissipate wave energy and provide significant protection to the shoreline and backreef lagoons this study investigated the wave climate and extremes of such a reef protected environment in the red sea covering the coastline of king abdullah economic city kaec located in the east of the kingdom of saudi arabia approximately 150 km north of jeddah a coupled wave circulation model adcirc swan was successfully implemented for this purpose the coupled model was forced with long term high resolution meteorological fields generated using an assimilative wrf model by downscaling ecmwf reanalysis the comparison of the model simulations with wave observations demonstrated the relevance the coupled modeling system to accurately simulate the high wave events over a reef sheltered region the coupling of waves and currents suggests a small impact on the mean wave climate but seems to be important for improving the model s skill during storm events a comparison of models with and without coupling against the buoy observations suggests an increased skill from the coupled model during stormy events fig s2 we used the coupled modeling system for long term simulations to account for the impact of coupling over the study area and found a change in wave height of about 15 cm in particular during extreme conditions fig 4c and fig s2 the distributions of simulated waves in the study area considering or not the offshore reefs were substantially different the results fig 4 showed that the wave height of about 1 m in simulation with cora reefs in the back reef increases to up to 2 m without reefs suggesting significant reduction of the wave heights at reefs by up to 40 50 compared to those of offshore waves the wave climate over the study area was further studied based on 30 year coupled model simulations as northerly winds with minimum variability prevail over the northern red sea during all seasons the wave climate exhibits a uniform distribution of waves over the studied area however the differences in the distribution of the 99th percentile suggested increased occurrences of high waves from february to may in accordance with the weather patterns of the mediterranean region the hs with certain return periods were also estimated using the gev and gpd methods the comparison of the estimated parameters and return periods from these two distribution models for different locations of the study area suggests that gpd using the peak over threshold method performed better than the gev as it exhibited a lower rmse and more reasonable extreme values after acquiring the best fitting model for the study area the spatial distributions of the return levels were estimated for 10 25 50 and 100 years the results show that the presence of reefs significantly affects the extreme waves by dampening their energy and are instrumental in protecting the coast against high waves the quantitative spatial analyses presented here highlight the reduction in wave energy by coral reefs which provide natural protection against storms and the high energy waves the results may also guide decision makers to implement strategies to maximize the protection of ecosystem associated with the coral reef structures the factors that affect the damping of waves such as the role of the reef s complexity in terms of its structural orientation or the increased water depth over shallow reefs due to the sea level rise associated with climate change still require further investigation credit authorship contribution statement

21842,the substructure of the deep water bridge is ordinarily composed of pile group pile cap and bridge pier the calculation method of the hydrodynamic force on pile group under earthquakes receives few concerns it s difficult to deduce the analytical calculation method of hydrodynamic force directly because the flow field induced by synchronously vibrating piles is considerably complicated two assumptions i e the change of influence of column c j j i on column c i caused by the existence of other columns is ignorable and the influences on hydrodynamic force of a column caused by other columns could be superposed approximately are put forward then numerical software ansys fluent is employed to validate the assumptions based on the hydrodynamic force calculation method of twin columns the hydrodynamic force calculation method of pile group is proposed results show for those pile groups composed of dozens of piles the added mass modified coefficients are smaller and can be ignored application study shows the calculation method proposed in this study not only precise enough but also convenient and efficient for real practice also the characteristics and generation mechanism of hydrodynamic force on columns of three column group are analyzed elaborately keywords hydrodynamic force pile group deep water bridge earthquake calculation method added mass modified coefficient 1 introduction lots of deep water bridges have been built in the southeastern coasts and the western reservoir areas in china in recent years both of these districts are at high risk of earthquake i e the former are located in the circum pacific seismic belt and the latter are located in the mediterranean himalayan seismic zone the hydrodynamic forces acting on the substructure components can significantly change the dynamic characteristics and seismic responses of the deep water bridge under earthquakes which would aggravate the destruction caused by earthquakes the interactions between fluids and structures under earthquake have drawn wide attentions of many experts and researchers westergaard 1933 proposed the added mass method firstly based on the assumptions that the structure is rigid and the water is incompressible as a result the hydrodynamic pressure generated by water on dam surface was solved by substituting seismic excitation with a series of harmonic waves penzien and kaul 1972 proposed a stochastic analysis method for the interaction between offshore structures and fluids under strong earthquakes liaw and chopra 1974 presented the expression of the hydrodynamic pressure for a cylindrical cantilever structure under simple harmonic excitation and pointed out that the compressibility of the water could be ignored mcconnell and park 1982 shook a cylinder sinusoidally in still water and the resulting in line force lift force and dynamic response of the cylinder were measured and analyzed lindgren 1984 applied morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure of a cylinder under seismic excitation williamson 1985 experimentally studied the correlation between drag coefficient c d and kc number and the correlation between lift coefficient c l and kc number in which kc 0 35 tanaka and hudspeth 1988 worked out the eigen function solutions of the hydrodynamic pressure acting on a cylinder with finite depth in compressible fluid under seismic excitation and further discussed the relationship between the dynamic characteristics of rigid or flexible structures and fluids compressibility dütsch et al 1998 used experimental and numerical methods to investigate the drag force lift force and flow field of the vibrating circular cylinder three cases with different reynolds number re u m a x d ν in which u m a x ν and d represent respectively the maximum velocity of cylinder kinematic viscosity of water and cylinder diameter and different keulegan carpenter number kc 2 π a d in which a is the amplitude of vibration i e the cases of re 100 kc 5 re 200 kc 10 re 210 and kc 6 sun and nogami 1991 proposed a semi analytical and semi numerical method based on complete and non singular trefftz function set which can accurately describe the hydrodynamic pressure of axisymmetric structures under horizontal seismic excitation han and xu 1996 presented the theoretical model of the added mass generated by a cylinder vibrating in a kind of fluid medium zheng and dalton 1999 used numerical method to study drag force coefficient and lift force coefficient on a square cylinder with kc 1 5 in oscillating fluid avilés and li 2001 discussed the influence of seabed absorption conditions on the hydrodynamic force of axisymmetric structures under earthquake ghozlani et al 2012 analyzed the flow field of vibrating circular cylinder and square prism with re 100 and kc 5 based on the relation between fundamental frequency reduction rate and the ratio of added mass to structural mass per unit length a new added mass method is presented to calculate hydrodynamic pressure of piers with arbitrary cross sections under earthquake by yang and li 2013a as to the hollow piers vibrating in water under earthquake yang and li 2013b proposed the expanded morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic force on the hollow piers in the expand morison equation the hydrodynamic force of inner water is expressed in the form of inertial force caused by the inner water added mass which is considered to be equal to the mass of inner water based on the radiation wave theory and fluid element in software ansys mechanical li and yang 2013 presented the expressions of added mass of circular and square piers by curve fitting du et al 2014 proposed a more accurate simplified formula for hydrodynamic pressure based on radiation wave theory by introducing dimensionless parameters such as frequency ratio width depth ratio and relative height etc wei et al 2015 respectively proposed a simplified method for seismic design and analysis of underwater axisymmetric structures jiang et al 2017 put forward a simplified formula for the hydrodynamic force on a circular cylinder by elaborate data fitting where the main parameters are radius of the cylinder and water height yang et al 2017 studied the calculation method of hydrodynamic force acting on bridge pier under earthquakes results show that no obvious vortex generates around the pier and the inertial force dominates the hydrodynamic force and the flow field is similar as that introduced by a cylinder vibrating in an ideal fluid in addition a simplified method for calculating the hydrodynamic force on the elliptical hollow cylinder was studied by wang et al 2018 and on the round ended and rectangular cylinder by wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b proposed a general formulation of the hydrodynamic added mass for a column with general cross section under horizontal earthquake zhang et al 2019a established an additional mass model of three dimensional numerical fluid structure interaction based on a typical non uniform hollow pier and the accuracy of the model was verified in the linear and nonlinear regions above studies basically all focus on hydrodynamic force on an isolated single column however the twin column structure is also widely used in bridge engineering or ocean engineering and the hydrodynamic force on one of the twin column is affected by another column because the twin column structure vibrates as a whole in water under earthquake yang et al 2020 studied the calculation method of the hydrodynamic force on one column of the twin columns under earthquake in which the added mass modified coefficients h x and h y were proposed to consider the influence of the neighboring column on the hydrodynamic forces respectively along and perpendicular to the earthquake wave propagation direction further the investigation indicates indicated that h x and h y are influenced by the relative center distance c and the angle θ 0 between the earthquake wave propagation direction and the line through the cross section centers but not influenced by re number and kc number multi column structures are also extensively used in bridge engineering or ocean engineering for example the substructure of deep water long span bridge is mainly composed of pile group pile cape and pier as shown in fig 1 the piles in the pile group vibrate synchronously under earthquake the hydrodynamic force on each single pile is different from that acting on the isolated single pile and also is different from that acting on the one of the twin columns because the flow fields surrounding them are different in detail when earthquake happens the flow field at the location of any pile of the pile group is influenced by the combined actions of each pile of the pile group the flow field at the location of the isolated single pile is influenced only by itself i e the isolated single pile and the flow field at the location of one of twin column is influenced by the combined action of the twin columns the components of substructure are always large in dimensions such as the diameter of cap is tens of meters the pier is decade meters and the pile is several meters but the vibration amplitude of the substructure components under earthquake i e tens of centimeters is much small compared with the dimension of these components in other words the vibration of these components in still water is characterized as large reynolds number and small kc number i e re 10 6 kc 0 8 to the best of our knowledge there are few studies concerning the hydrodynamic force on multiple columns vibrating synchronously under earthquake the calculation method of the hydrodynamic force on these multiple columns or pile group is not only critical to the seismic design of the deep water bridges but also critical to the seismic design of other ocean engineering structures with similar multi column foundations such as offshore wind turbines jacket offshore platforms etc therefore it is extremely necessary to work out a calculation method to estimate the hydrodynamic forces on the multiple columns or pile group when earthquake happens the substructure of deep water bridge vibrates in water as a whole not only the pile group but also the pile cap and the pier suffering hydrodynamic forces ordinarily the substructure of deep water bridge can be categorized into two types high rise pile cap and low pile cap for the first type the cap locates around the still water level and the pile group is submerged deeply in water the hydrodynamic force on pile group would be influenced relatively slightly by the pile cap the pier the free surface and the river bed or seabed for the second type the most of the pile group is embedded into the river bed or seabed and only a small part is exposed to water therefore the pile cap is much close to the river bed or seabed i e the pile cap and the pier are submerged deeply in water under this situation the hydrodynamic force on pile group is not only influenced by the river bed or seabed but also influenced by the pile cap the pier and the free surface the deduction of the analytical calculation method of hydrodynamic force on pile group would become more complicated if the second type is involved this study aims to explore the calculation method of the hydrodynamic force on the pile group of the substructure with high rise pile cap in which the influences of the pile cap the pier the free surface and the bottom boundary are not taken into consideration the analytical calculation methods of hydrodynamic force on the isolated single column and on one column of the twin columns are briefly reviewed first then the cfd method is employed to simulate the vibration of pile group based on which the characteristics of the hydrodynamic force and its generation mechanism are analyzed and the hydrodynamic force calculation method for pile group is proposed at last application of the proposed method to the real practice is conducted which indicates the proposed method is accurate and efficient for real practice 2 review on hydrodynamic force calculation methods for isolated single column and one column of the twin columns the submerged depth of the pile group of the substructure with high rise pile cap is ordinarily considerably large for example 30 m for the hangzhou bay bridge at high tide wu 2015 and 40 m for the nanjing third yangtze river bridge song et al 2010 which is much larger than the dimension of piles in pile group and also is extremely larger than the wave height generated by the vibrating column under earthquake therefore it is reasonable to simplify the three dimensional column water interaction system in real practice as a two dimension system study by yang et al 2017 shows that the complex seismic waves can be decomposed into a series of monochromatic simple harmonic waves to analyze the hydrodynamic pressure on bridge piers in addition water is assumed to be irrotational inviscid and incompressible the analytical calculation methods of hydrodynamic force on isolated single column and one column of the twin columns have been deduced by yang et al 2020 so only a brief introduction to these methods is presented here 2 1 calculation method for isolated single column under the excitation of a harmonic wave with the amplitude a the angular frequency ω the displacement s and the velocity u of the column can be expressed as 1 s a cos ω t 2 u a ω sin ω t accordingly the velocity potential φ 1 generated by the motion of column is 3 φ 1 φ 1 x y cos ω t φ 1 r θ cos ω t φ 1 satisfies the laplace equation and can be written in the polar coordinate system as 4 1 r r r φ 1 r 1 r 2 2 φ 1 θ 2 0 in which r and θ are the radial distance and the polar angle respectively considering the boundary conditions the periodic condition the sommerfeld radiation condition etc eq 4 can be solved and the hydrodynamic force can be obtained as 5 f x m u f y 0 in which f x and f y are the hydrodynamic force components in the x and y directions respectively m ρ π r 1 2 is the mass of water with the volume same as that displaced by the column r 1 and u are the radius and the acceleration of the column respectively 2 2 calculation method for one column of the twin columns the sketch of the twin columns c1 and c2 with both the cartesian coordinate and the polar coordinate is shown in fig 2 note that the origin of the cartesian coordinate system coincides with the origin of the polar coordinate system the radii of the columns c1 and c2 are r 1 and r 2 respectively and the center distance is l φ 1 is set as the velocity potential caused by the vibration of c1 without considering the influence of c2 and φ 2 is set as the velocity potential caused by c2 without considering the influence of c1 then assuming c1 to keep stationary and c2 to vibrate the radiation velocity potential at the position of c1 generated by the vibration of c2 is φ 21 all the velocity potentials φ 1 φ 2 and φ 21 satisfy the laplace equation and the according boundary conditions and they can be solved by the similar way as that for the isolated single column then the total velocity potential is 6 φ φ 1 φ 2 φ 21 r 1 2 a ω cos θ r cos ω t r 2 2 a ω r cos θ l cos θ 0 r 2 l 2 2 r l cos θ θ 0 cos ω t m 1 e m 1 r m cos m θ f m 1 r m sin m θ cos ω t the definitions of e m and f m can be found in the study by yang et al 2020 accordingly the hydrodynamic forces on one of the twin columns are 7 f x m u 1 h x f y m u h y in which 8 h x 2 cos 2 θ 0 c 2 h y 2 sin 2 θ 0 c 2 where c is the relative center distance defined as l r and θ 0 is the angle of the line connecting the centers of c1 to c2 the two columns are assumed to have the same radius i e r r 1 r 2 3 characteristics and calculation method of hydrodynamic force on pile group as discussed in section 2 the hydrodynamic forces on isolated single pile and on one of the twin columns can be calculated analytically by eqs 5 and 7 respectively and there is no analytical way to estimate hydrodynamic force on pile of pile group however the cfd method is an alternate therefore the cfd method i e ansys fluent will be employed to simulate the vibration of pile group under earthquake based on which the hydrodynamic force will be discussed and the flow field will be analyzed to explain the generation mechanism of the hydrodynamic force the thorough understanding of the hydrodynamic force enlightens the exploring of the calculation method for the pile group the three pile group is chosen as the object in this section as it is the simplest pile group the diameter of the piles is set as 3 m and the relative center distance l r is set as 4 because these dimensions are frequently used in real practice for example the pile group of the main pier of the nanjing yangtze second river bridge in china is composed of 21 piles with diameter 3 m and l r 4 the pile group of the main pier of the zhanjiang bayi bridge in china is composed of 31 piles with diameter 2 5 m and l r 4 8 the pile group of the main pier of the ningbo daxie island bridge in china is composed of 16 piles with diameter 2 8 m and l r 2 9 3 1 cfd basic equations and the numerical model validation in this study software ansys fluent is employed to solve the navier stokes rans equations the conservation equations of mass and momentum are 9 u i x i 0 10 u i t u j u j x j 1 ρ p x i μ ρ 2 u i x j x j 1 ρ ρ u i u j x j where i and j represent the directions of the cartesian coordinate axes u i denotes the time averaged velocity which is defined as u i 1 δ t t 0 t 0 δ t u i d t u i stands for the pulsating velocity as the definition of u i u i u i and p denotes the time averaged pressure ρ is the density of water and μ is the kinematic viscosity of water in the simulation the dynamic mesh technique is used to reconstruct the mesh due to the relatively smaller amplitude of the columns the mesh reconstruction in the computational domain does not have a great influence on the quality of the mesh and the accuracy of the calculation can be ensured ansys icem cfd is used to build geometric model and generate mesh in order to reduce the influence of the boundaries of fluid domain on the forces exerted on the structure the length along the direction of column motion and width perpendicular to the direction of column motion of the rectangular computational domain respectively are set as 40 times and 20 times of the diameter of the column as shown in fig 3 a considering the great velocity gradient and pressure gradient near the column a core area around the column is set to generate extremely fine meshes as shown in fig 3 b the boundary conditions of the column surface and the front back left and right boundaries of computational domain are set as wall and the scalable wall functions are used to simulate the boundary layer effect the k ε rng turbulence model suitable for high reynolds number cases is chosen because the reynolds number in this study is extremely large i e in the range 10 6 10 7 the physical experimental data of the isolated single column vibrating in still water by yang et al 2018 are used to confirm the correctness of modeling method and the related parameters the numerical model has the same dimensions and suffers the same external excitation as the physical experimental model the comparison of the time histories of hydrodynamic forces between the physical experimental model and the numerical model is shown in fig 4 it can be observed that numerical calculation is stable after t 4 s and the two curves coincide well indicating the solution of the present numerical model is trustable 3 2 characteristics and generation mechanism of hydrodynamic force the analytical solutions of the hydrodynamic forces for the isolated column and twin columns expressed by eqs 5 and 7 respectively have been proven to match well with the numerical results by cfd method ansys fluent in the study by yang et al 2020 therefore the analytical solutions of the isolated pile and the twin columns are used to compare with the numerical solutions of piles in pile group by cfd method the harmonic wave with amplitude a 0 3 m frequency f 1 hz will be used as the excitation in the following cases for convenience f x ana s f y ana s are defined as the x and y components of the hydrodynamic force on the isolated single column obtained by the analytical method namely eq 5 f x ana c j b i f y ana c j b i are defined as the x and y components of the hydrodynamic force on the column c j of the twin columns obtained by the analytical method namely eq 7 in which j 1 2 f x cfd c j t r i f y cfd c j t r i are defined as the x and y components of the hydrodynamic force on the column c j of the three columns obtained by the cfd method in which j 1 2 3 3 2 1 three columns arranged in tandem the sketch of the three columns standing in tandem is shown in fig 5 because of the symmetry f x ana c 1 b i f x ana c 2 b i for the twin columns and f x cfd c 1 t r i f x cfd c 3 t r i for the three columns therefore the hydrodynamic forces on the isolated single column c1 column of the twin columns c1 and c2 columns of the three columns are compared in fig 6 the velocity vector distributions at t 7 s and t 7 25 s are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively it shows no vortex generated around the columns when t 7 s the velocity of the columns is zero and the acceleration arrives at the peak the hydrodynamic force at this time arrives at the peak too as shown in fig 6 when t 7 25 s the velocity of the columns arrives at the maximum but the acceleration is zero the hydrodynamic force at this time is almost zero it indicates that the inertia force dominates the hydrodynamic force the drag force and viscous force less than 1 n according to the numerical results by ansys fluent are so small that can be ignored this conclusion agrees well with the implication of eqs 5 and 7 in which the hydrodynamic force is expressed in the form of acceleration and mass namely inertia force it could be observed in fig 6 that f x ana s f x ana c 1 b i f x cfd c 1 t r i f x cfd c 2 t r i showing that in the three column system the coexistence of columns c 2 and c 3 decreases the hydrodynamic force on c 1 the coexistence of c 1 and c 3 decreases the hydrodynamic force on c2 just like the existence of c 2 of the twin columns decreases the hydrodynamic force on c 1 showing in eqs 7 and 8 further the additional influence of c 3 makes the hydrodynamic force on c1 in the three column system a little smaller than that on c1 in the twin column system because c3 is twice far away from c1 than c2 from c1 but the additional influce of c3 makes the hydrodynamic force on c2 decrease obviously in the three column system compared with that on c2 only influenced by c1 in the twin column system because the center distance between c3 and c2 is the same as that between c1 and c2 in other words the decrease of the hydrodynamic force on c2 doubles in the three column system compared with that in the twin column system the above analysis implies the influences on the hydrodynamic force of a column caused by other columns could be superposed approximately in the three column system assuming that the change of influence of c 2 on c 1 caused by the existence of c 3 is ignorable and also the change of the influence of c 3 on c 1 caused by the existence of c 2 is ignorable then the coexistence of the c 1 c 2 and c 3 could be treated as the two separate twin column systems one is c 1 and c 2 another is c 1 and c 3 therefore the influence of the coexistence of c 2 and c 3 on c 1 could be treated as the superpostion of the influences of c 2 on c 1 and c 3 on c 1 based on eqs 7 and 8 the superposition of the influences can be described as h x 1 h x 12 h x 13 in which h x 12 2 cos 2 θ 12 c 12 2 h x 13 2 cos 2 θ 13 c 13 2 similarly the influence of the coexistence of c 1 and c 3 on c 2 could be treated as the superpostion of the influencens of c 1 on c 2 and c 3 on c 2 generally for column c i in three column system the influence of the other two columns on added mass can be expressed as 11 h x i j 1 3 h x i j j i 12 h y i j 1 3 h y i j j i in which h x i j 2 cos 2 θ i j c i j 2 h y i j 2 sin 2 θ i j c i j 2 and h x i j h y i j represent the added mass modified coefficients respectively in the x and y directions of column c i generated by column c j θ i j and c i j are respectively the center connecting line angle and the relative center distance between the columns c i and c j according to eq 11 the analytical values of the added mass modified coefficients can be calculated as h x 1 h x 12 h x 13 0 125 0 03125 0 15625 h x 2 h x 13 h x 23 0 125 0 125 0 25 based on the hydrodynamic forces calculated by the cfd method h x 1 and h x 2 can also be figured out as 0 147 and 0 232 respectively which agree well with their analytical values in addition the numerical results of hydrodynamic forces in y direction are as small as 10 7 matching well with their analytical values namely zero because θ i j is π 2 or π 2 when the three columns standing in tandem 3 2 2 three columns arranged side by side the sketch of three columns standing side by side is shown in fig 8 the comparison of the x components of hydrodynamic forces on the isolated single column on c1 column of the twin columns standing side by side and on c1 and c2 columns in the three columns standing side by side is shown in fig 9 note that the hydrodynamic forces on c2 of the twin columns and on c3 of the three columns are omitted because of symmetry it can be observed that f x cfd c 2 t r i f x cfd c 1 t r i f x ana c 1 b i f x ana s which shows intensively the superposition of the influence between the columns in detail the hydrodynamic force on the columns standing side by side increases compared with that on the isolated single column by the additional influence of c3 the increment of hydrodynamic force on c2 is more obvious than that on c1 because c3 is nearer to c2 than to c1 in the three column system and the increment of the hydrodynamic force on c2 in the three column system almost doubles than that on c2 in the twin columns because of the influence of c3 under the same assumption in subsection 3 2 1 i e the change of influence of c j j i on c i caused by the existence of other columns is ignorable the added mass modified coefficient h x can be analytically calculated by eq 11 namely h x 1 h x 12 h x 13 0 125 0 03125 0 15625 h x 2 h x 21 h x 23 0 125 0 125 0 25 h x 1 and h x 2 can also be numerically calculated based on the cfd results i e h x 1 0 18 and h x 2 0 28 which are respectively quite close to their analytical values the y components of the hydrodynamic forces lift forces on the three columns standing side by side are compared in fig 10 it can be observed that the lift force on c2 is zero and the lift force curves of c1 and c3 are basically sinusoidal and symmetric about time axis i e they have opposite directions but with the same frequency 2 hz and the same amplitudes 0 75 n approximately fig 11 shows the generation mechanism of the lift force on the three columns when the three columns vibrate the gap flow the flow through the gap between the neighboring columns has relatively larger velocity than the flow outside as shown in fig 11 a which generates lower pressure at the inner sides of c1 or c3 as shown in fig 11 b the pressure difference between the inner and outer sides of c1 or c3 generates the lift force on c1 or c3 however because of symmetry the velocity and the resulted lower pressure at the two sides of c2 are same generating no lift force on c2 in one period the velocity of gap flow changes from zero to the maximum positive or negative twice therefore the frequency of lift force is 2 hz which is twice of the frequency of the x component of the hydrodynamic force however the peak values of the lift force on c1 and c3 are around 1 5 kn which are extremely small compared with that of the x component of the hydrodynamic force i e 100 kn approximately and can be ignored in real practice according to eq 12 the lift forces on c1 c2 and c3 are all zero which implies that eq 12 can predict the lift force pretty well 3 2 3 three columns arranged in staggered form θ 0 π 4 the sketch of three columns arranged in staggered form is shown in fig 12 the comparison of the x components of the hydrodynamic forces on the isolated single column on c1 column of the twin columns arranged in staggered form and on c1 and c2 columns in the three columns arranged in staggered form is shown in fig 13 because of symmetry the x components of the hydrodynamic forces on c2 of the twin columns on c3 of the three columns are not shown it can be observed that the four curves almost coincide with each other implying when the columns standing in staggered form the x component of hydrodynamic force on each column will not be influenced by other columns analytically θ 0 π 4 makes h x i j 2 cos 2 θ i j c i j 2 0 which ultimately makes h x i 0 according to eq 11 that is the x components of the hydrodynamic forces on the three columns in staggered form can be well calculated by eq 11 the comparison of the y components of the hydrodynamic forces on c1 of the twin columns in staggered form on c1 and c2 columns of the three columns arranged in staggered form is shown in fig 14 the y components of hydrodynamic forces on c2 of the twin columns is same as that on c1 therefore it is not shown in fig 14 as well as c3 of the three columns it can be observed that f y ana c 1 b i f y cfd c 1 t r i f y cfd c 2 t r i and the peak value of f y cfd c 2 t r i is about 22 kn is almost 1 4 of the x component of the hydrodynamic force which cannot be ignored also it can be observed that the frequency of the y component is 1 hz which is the same as that of the x component of the hydrodynamic force fig 15 shows at t 7 s the velocity of the columns is zero as shown in fig 15 a and the acceleration of column accordingly should be the maximum in other words the gap flow has the maximum relative acceleration at t 7 s however the center connecting line through the three centers incline to x axis which makes the gap flow acceleration incline to the x axis too then the pressure distributions at the front of and at the back of the column surfaces are not symmetry with their own horizontal centerlines anymore in detail the centers of negative pressure at the back of columns deviate to left and the positive pressure at the front of the columns deviate to right which generate the hydrodynamic force f on each column inclined to x axis the angle between f and the negative direction of x axis is defined as β as shown in fig 15 b fundamentally both of the x and y components of hydrodynamic force on each column are components of the inertia force i e f x f c o s β f y f s i n β that is the reason why the lift force in fig 10 has the same frequency with the x component of the hydrodynamic force in fig 13 recall eq 7 if the inertia force is defined as v m u and the inclined angle β t a n 1 h y 1 h x then eq 7 can be transformed as 13 f x m u 1 h x f c o s α f y m u h y f s i n α which shows the analytical solution well support the fact that the lift force is the component of the inertia force when the three columns arranged in staggered form according to eq 12 the added mass modified coefficients for the y direction on c1 and c2 columns are h y 1 h y 12 h y 13 0 125 0 03125 0 15625 h y 2 h y 21 h y 23 0 125 0 125 0 25 which agree well with the numerical values based on cfd results namely 0 16 and 0 26 respectively generally eqs 11 and 12 can calculate the x and y components of hydrodynamic forces on the three columns arranged in staggered form 3 2 4 more arrangements of three columns in addition to above three basic arrangements another two i e equilateral triangle and isosceles right triangle forms are discussed as shown in fig 16 they can be treated as the combination of any two of the three basic arrangements i e tandem side by side and staggered for example fig 16 a can be treated as combination of the tandem c1 c3 and the staggered c1 c2 arrangements fig 16 b can be treated as combination of the tandem c1 c3 and the side by side c1 and c2 arrangements only the comparison of the added mass modified coefficients between the analytical method i e eqs 11 and 12 and the cfd method i e by ansys fluent is listed in table 1 to confirm that whether eqs 11 and 12 are validate for the combination of the three basic arrangements of the three columns however the detailed analysis to the hydrodynamic force and the flow field is omitted for brevity table 1 shows no matter for equilateral triangle or isosceles right triangle forms the analytical and cfd method results match well which indicates that eqs 11 and 12 are also viable for the complicated arrangements i e combination of the three basic arrangements 3 3 calculation method of hydrodynamic force on pile group fundamentally the cfd method has proven the assumptions the change of influence of c j j i on c i caused by the existence of other columns is ignorable and the influences on hydrodynamic force of a column caused by other columns could be superposed approximately in section 3 2 in other words the calculation method of hydrodynamic force on one column of the three columns with various arrangements i e eqs 11 and 12 has been validated as to the pile group composed of n columns the added mass modified coefficients can be obtained by the extension of the column number in eqs 11 and 12 14 h x i j 1 n h x i j j i 15 h y i j 1 n h y i j j i then the hydrodynamic force on one column of the pile group is 16 f x c i m u 1 h x i f y c i m u h y i four columns in various arrangements are sketched in fig 17 to further validate eqs 14 16 pile groups with more columns are not studied here for brevity but a pile group from a real bridge will be studied under earthquake wave not harmonic wave to validate eqs 14 16 in the next section the comparison of the added mass modified coefficients for the four columns between the analytical method and the cfd method is listed in table 2 results show that the analytical values agree well with the cfd values indicating the hydrodynamic force calculation method proposed in this study i e eqs 14 16 is correct 4 application in order to simplify deduction process of the analytical solution in section 2 a monochromatic simple harmonic wave was used to replace earthquake wave and only 4 columns at most are used to validate the correctness of the proposed calculation method in the previous sections therefore it s necessary to use a pile group of real bridge excited by true earthquake to validate both the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method a pile group of the main pier of the nanjing yangtze second river bridge in china composed of 21 columns is chosen as object as shown in fig 18 the diameter of the columns is 3 m and the relative center distance l r 4 and the bridge is assumed to be attacked by kocaeli wave as shown in fig 19 because of symmetry only the added mass modified coefficients of columns c1 c8 are compared in table 3 it can be observed that the analytical values match the cfd values relatively well in addition the added mass modified coefficients are ordinarily smaller than those of fewer columns system i e the maximum of h x by the analytical method in table 3 is 0 057 compared with the maxima 0 2813 in table 2 for the 4 columns system and 0 25 for the 3 columns system in subsection 3 2 1 the more columns the more arrangement styles between the aimed column and other columns different arrangement style between the aimed column and one of the other columns makes the added mass modified coefficient on the aimed column negative or positive varying with the polar angle of the center connecting line through the two circular centers the diversity of arrangement style makes the superposition of these negative or positive values cancel out each other ultimately makes the coefficients to be smaller as representative comparisons of the hydrodynamic force on column c1 between the analytical and cfd methods are shown in fig 20 in which the x components comparison is shown in fig 20 a and the y components comparison is shown in fig 20 b it can be observed that the two curves coincide with each other considerably well comparisons of the hydrodynamic forces for other columns also indicate the analytical and cfd methods match well omitted here for brevity further the calculation method of the total hydrodynamic force i e f t x and f t y on the pile group are deduced as 17 f t x m t u 1 h x t f t y m t u h y t in which m t is the total added mass of the pile group h x t and h y t are the total added mass modified coefficients of the pile group in x and y directions respectively they are detailed as 18 m t j 1 n m j n m 19 h x t 1 n i 1 n h x i 20 h y t 1 n i 1 n h y i note that n is the number of the columns and n 21 in this case ordinarily the piles have the same diameter in pile group so eq 8 is viable based on eqs 19 and 20 h x t and h y t can be calculated analytically and based on eqs 17 and 18 numerical h x t and h y t can be calculated according to respectively f t x and f t x obtained by the cfd method and the analytical and numerical values of h x t as well as h y t are compared in the last line in table 3 as we expected the analytical and numerical cfd methods agree with each other well in addition the x and y components of the total hydrodynamic force i e f t x and f t y on pile group are shown in fig 21 a and fig 21 b respectively which demonstrate that f t y is almost zero because the pile group is symmetry with respect to the x axis through its center as shown in fig 18 and also demonstrate that the analytical method proposed in this study can predict the hydrodynamic force on the pile group very well basically h x t and h y t themselves are extremely small this is because for different column h x i h y i may be negative or positive shown in table 3 summation of the values makes h x t h y t even smaller i e h x t 0 02 and h y t 0 01 it can be expected that with the increase of column number in the pile group the added mass modified coefficients on any column of the pile group decrease and the total added mass modified coefficients decrease more intensively namely h x t and h y t tend to zero in other words for the pile groups composed of dozens of columns for example more than 30 columns ignoring the added mass modified coefficients may not introduce obvious errors when estimating hydrodynamic force on columns or pile groups under earthquakes however for the pile groups composed of several columns ignoring the added mass modified coefficients will introduce considerable errors for example at most 33 error for the 4 columns listed in table 2 in addition the analytical method only took 20 min to finish calculation work in microsoft excel however the cfd method took more than 100 h to finish computation on a desktop computer with intel core i7 processor and 16 g memory it s clear that the analytical method proposed in this study is not only precise but also convenient and efficient for real practice 5 conclusions in real practice the substructure of the deep water bridge is ordinarily composed of pile group pile cap and bridge pier it s challenging to deduce analytical calculation method of the hydrodynamic force directly because of the complexity of the flow field generated by a group of synchronously vibrating piles the influence of the hydrodynamic force on a cylinder caused by another cylinder in the twin column system has been investigated by yang et al 2020 and the calculation method of the hydrodynamic force on one column of the twin columns has also been proposed based on which for pile group the influence of the hydrodynamic force on one column c i induced by the existence of other columns c j j i is supposed to be the superposition of influences of column c j j i on c i then the numerical software ansys fluent is employed to validate the hypothesis and the calculation method of the hydrodynamic force on the pile group is studied the main conclusions are 1 the assumptions the change of influence of c j j i on c i caused by the existence of other columns is ignorable and the influences on the hydrodynamic force of a column caused by other columns could be superposed approximately is verified by the cfd method 2 the calculation formulae of the hydrodynamic force on one column of the pile group and on the whole of the pile group are proposed i e eq 16 and eq 17 respectively 3 when the quantity of pile is larger the added mass modified coefficients are smaller for the pile group with dozens of piles the added mass modified coefficients can be ignored 4 calculation method proposed in this study is not only precise enough but also convenient and efficient for real practice in addition the influence of the pile cap and bridge pier on the hydrodynamic force of the pile group still needs further investigation which is our next focus in the near future and also the physical experiments are expected to be conducted to test and verify the calculation method proposed in this study credit authorship contribution statement wanli

21842,the substructure of the deep water bridge is ordinarily composed of pile group pile cap and bridge pier the calculation method of the hydrodynamic force on pile group under earthquakes receives few concerns it s difficult to deduce the analytical calculation method of hydrodynamic force directly because the flow field induced by synchronously vibrating piles is considerably complicated two assumptions i e the change of influence of column c j j i on column c i caused by the existence of other columns is ignorable and the influences on hydrodynamic force of a column caused by other columns could be superposed approximately are put forward then numerical software ansys fluent is employed to validate the assumptions based on the hydrodynamic force calculation method of twin columns the hydrodynamic force calculation method of pile group is proposed results show for those pile groups composed of dozens of piles the added mass modified coefficients are smaller and can be ignored application study shows the calculation method proposed in this study not only precise enough but also convenient and efficient for real practice also the characteristics and generation mechanism of hydrodynamic force on columns of three column group are analyzed elaborately keywords hydrodynamic force pile group deep water bridge earthquake calculation method added mass modified coefficient 1 introduction lots of deep water bridges have been built in the southeastern coasts and the western reservoir areas in china in recent years both of these districts are at high risk of earthquake i e the former are located in the circum pacific seismic belt and the latter are located in the mediterranean himalayan seismic zone the hydrodynamic forces acting on the substructure components can significantly change the dynamic characteristics and seismic responses of the deep water bridge under earthquakes which would aggravate the destruction caused by earthquakes the interactions between fluids and structures under earthquake have drawn wide attentions of many experts and researchers westergaard 1933 proposed the added mass method firstly based on the assumptions that the structure is rigid and the water is incompressible as a result the hydrodynamic pressure generated by water on dam surface was solved by substituting seismic excitation with a series of harmonic waves penzien and kaul 1972 proposed a stochastic analysis method for the interaction between offshore structures and fluids under strong earthquakes liaw and chopra 1974 presented the expression of the hydrodynamic pressure for a cylindrical cantilever structure under simple harmonic excitation and pointed out that the compressibility of the water could be ignored mcconnell and park 1982 shook a cylinder sinusoidally in still water and the resulting in line force lift force and dynamic response of the cylinder were measured and analyzed lindgren 1984 applied morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure of a cylinder under seismic excitation williamson 1985 experimentally studied the correlation between drag coefficient c d and kc number and the correlation between lift coefficient c l and kc number in which kc 0 35 tanaka and hudspeth 1988 worked out the eigen function solutions of the hydrodynamic pressure acting on a cylinder with finite depth in compressible fluid under seismic excitation and further discussed the relationship between the dynamic characteristics of rigid or flexible structures and fluids compressibility dütsch et al 1998 used experimental and numerical methods to investigate the drag force lift force and flow field of the vibrating circular cylinder three cases with different reynolds number re u m a x d ν in which u m a x ν and d represent respectively the maximum velocity of cylinder kinematic viscosity of water and cylinder diameter and different keulegan carpenter number kc 2 π a d in which a is the amplitude of vibration i e the cases of re 100 kc 5 re 200 kc 10 re 210 and kc 6 sun and nogami 1991 proposed a semi analytical and semi numerical method based on complete and non singular trefftz function set which can accurately describe the hydrodynamic pressure of axisymmetric structures under horizontal seismic excitation han and xu 1996 presented the theoretical model of the added mass generated by a cylinder vibrating in a kind of fluid medium zheng and dalton 1999 used numerical method to study drag force coefficient and lift force coefficient on a square cylinder with kc 1 5 in oscillating fluid avilés and li 2001 discussed the influence of seabed absorption conditions on the hydrodynamic force of axisymmetric structures under earthquake ghozlani et al 2012 analyzed the flow field of vibrating circular cylinder and square prism with re 100 and kc 5 based on the relation between fundamental frequency reduction rate and the ratio of added mass to structural mass per unit length a new added mass method is presented to calculate hydrodynamic pressure of piers with arbitrary cross sections under earthquake by yang and li 2013a as to the hollow piers vibrating in water under earthquake yang and li 2013b proposed the expanded morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic force on the hollow piers in the expand morison equation the hydrodynamic force of inner water is expressed in the form of inertial force caused by the inner water added mass which is considered to be equal to the mass of inner water based on the radiation wave theory and fluid element in software ansys mechanical li and yang 2013 presented the expressions of added mass of circular and square piers by curve fitting du et al 2014 proposed a more accurate simplified formula for hydrodynamic pressure based on radiation wave theory by introducing dimensionless parameters such as frequency ratio width depth ratio and relative height etc wei et al 2015 respectively proposed a simplified method for seismic design and analysis of underwater axisymmetric structures jiang et al 2017 put forward a simplified formula for the hydrodynamic force on a circular cylinder by elaborate data fitting where the main parameters are radius of the cylinder and water height yang et al 2017 studied the calculation method of hydrodynamic force acting on bridge pier under earthquakes results show that no obvious vortex generates around the pier and the inertial force dominates the hydrodynamic force and the flow field is similar as that introduced by a cylinder vibrating in an ideal fluid in addition a simplified method for calculating the hydrodynamic force on the elliptical hollow cylinder was studied by wang et al 2018 and on the round ended and rectangular cylinder by wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b proposed a general formulation of the hydrodynamic added mass for a column with general cross section under horizontal earthquake zhang et al 2019a established an additional mass model of three dimensional numerical fluid structure interaction based on a typical non uniform hollow pier and the accuracy of the model was verified in the linear and nonlinear regions above studies basically all focus on hydrodynamic force on an isolated single column however the twin column structure is also widely used in bridge engineering or ocean engineering and the hydrodynamic force on one of the twin column is affected by another column because the twin column structure vibrates as a whole in water under earthquake yang et al 2020 studied the calculation method of the hydrodynamic force on one column of the twin columns under earthquake in which the added mass modified coefficients h x and h y were proposed to consider the influence of the neighboring column on the hydrodynamic forces respectively along and perpendicular to the earthquake wave propagation direction further the investigation indicates indicated that h x and h y are influenced by the relative center distance c and the angle θ 0 between the earthquake wave propagation direction and the line through the cross section centers but not influenced by re number and kc number multi column structures are also extensively used in bridge engineering or ocean engineering for example the substructure of deep water long span bridge is mainly composed of pile group pile cape and pier as shown in fig 1 the piles in the pile group vibrate synchronously under earthquake the hydrodynamic force on each single pile is different from that acting on the isolated single pile and also is different from that acting on the one of the twin columns because the flow fields surrounding them are different in detail when earthquake happens the flow field at the location of any pile of the pile group is influenced by the combined actions of each pile of the pile group the flow field at the location of the isolated single pile is influenced only by itself i e the isolated single pile and the flow field at the location of one of twin column is influenced by the combined action of the twin columns the components of substructure are always large in dimensions such as the diameter of cap is tens of meters the pier is decade meters and the pile is several meters but the vibration amplitude of the substructure components under earthquake i e tens of centimeters is much small compared with the dimension of these components in other words the vibration of these components in still water is characterized as large reynolds number and small kc number i e re 10 6 kc 0 8 to the best of our knowledge there are few studies concerning the hydrodynamic force on multiple columns vibrating synchronously under earthquake the calculation method of the hydrodynamic force on these multiple columns or pile group is not only critical to the seismic design of the deep water bridges but also critical to the seismic design of other ocean engineering structures with similar multi column foundations such as offshore wind turbines jacket offshore platforms etc therefore it is extremely necessary to work out a calculation method to estimate the hydrodynamic forces on the multiple columns or pile group when earthquake happens the substructure of deep water bridge vibrates in water as a whole not only the pile group but also the pile cap and the pier suffering hydrodynamic forces ordinarily the substructure of deep water bridge can be categorized into two types high rise pile cap and low pile cap for the first type the cap locates around the still water level and the pile group is submerged deeply in water the hydrodynamic force on pile group would be influenced relatively slightly by the pile cap the pier the free surface and the river bed or seabed for the second type the most of the pile group is embedded into the river bed or seabed and only a small part is exposed to water therefore the pile cap is much close to the river bed or seabed i e the pile cap and the pier are submerged deeply in water under this situation the hydrodynamic force on pile group is not only influenced by the river bed or seabed but also influenced by the pile cap the pier and the free surface the deduction of the analytical calculation method of hydrodynamic force on pile group would become more complicated if the second type is involved this study aims to explore the calculation method of the hydrodynamic force on the pile group of the substructure with high rise pile cap in which the influences of the pile cap the pier the free surface and the bottom boundary are not taken into consideration the analytical calculation methods of hydrodynamic force on the isolated single column and on one column of the twin columns are briefly reviewed first then the cfd method is employed to simulate the vibration of pile group based on which the characteristics of the hydrodynamic force and its generation mechanism are analyzed and the hydrodynamic force calculation method for pile group is proposed at last application of the proposed method to the real practice is conducted which indicates the proposed method is accurate and efficient for real practice 2 review on hydrodynamic force calculation methods for isolated single column and one column of the twin columns the submerged depth of the pile group of the substructure with high rise pile cap is ordinarily considerably large for example 30 m for the hangzhou bay bridge at high tide wu 2015 and 40 m for the nanjing third yangtze river bridge song et al 2010 which is much larger than the dimension of piles in pile group and also is extremely larger than the wave height generated by the vibrating column under earthquake therefore it is reasonable to simplify the three dimensional column water interaction system in real practice as a two dimension system study by yang et al 2017 shows that the complex seismic waves can be decomposed into a series of monochromatic simple harmonic waves to analyze the hydrodynamic pressure on bridge piers in addition water is assumed to be irrotational inviscid and incompressible the analytical calculation methods of hydrodynamic force on isolated single column and one column of the twin columns have been deduced by yang et al 2020 so only a brief introduction to these methods is presented here 2 1 calculation method for isolated single column under the excitation of a harmonic wave with the amplitude a the angular frequency ω the displacement s and the velocity u of the column can be expressed as 1 s a cos ω t 2 u a ω sin ω t accordingly the velocity potential φ 1 generated by the motion of column is 3 φ 1 φ 1 x y cos ω t φ 1 r θ cos ω t φ 1 satisfies the laplace equation and can be written in the polar coordinate system as 4 1 r r r φ 1 r 1 r 2 2 φ 1 θ 2 0 in which r and θ are the radial distance and the polar angle respectively considering the boundary conditions the periodic condition the sommerfeld radiation condition etc eq 4 can be solved and the hydrodynamic force can be obtained as 5 f x m u f y 0 in which f x and f y are the hydrodynamic force components in the x and y directions respectively m ρ π r 1 2 is the mass of water with the volume same as that displaced by the column r 1 and u are the radius and the acceleration of the column respectively 2 2 calculation method for one column of the twin columns the sketch of the twin columns c1 and c2 with both the cartesian coordinate and the polar coordinate is shown in fig 2 note that the origin of the cartesian coordinate system coincides with the origin of the polar coordinate system the radii of the columns c1 and c2 are r 1 and r 2 respectively and the center distance is l φ 1 is set as the velocity potential caused by the vibration of c1 without considering the influence of c2 and φ 2 is set as the velocity potential caused by c2 without considering the influence of c1 then assuming c1 to keep stationary and c2 to vibrate the radiation velocity potential at the position of c1 generated by the vibration of c2 is φ 21 all the velocity potentials φ 1 φ 2 and φ 21 satisfy the laplace equation and the according boundary conditions and they can be solved by the similar way as that for the isolated single column then the total velocity potential is 6 φ φ 1 φ 2 φ 21 r 1 2 a ω cos θ r cos ω t r 2 2 a ω r cos θ l cos θ 0 r 2 l 2 2 r l cos θ θ 0 cos ω t m 1 e m 1 r m cos m θ f m 1 r m sin m θ cos ω t the definitions of e m and f m can be found in the study by yang et al 2020 accordingly the hydrodynamic forces on one of the twin columns are 7 f x m u 1 h x f y m u h y in which 8 h x 2 cos 2 θ 0 c 2 h y 2 sin 2 θ 0 c 2 where c is the relative center distance defined as l r and θ 0 is the angle of the line connecting the centers of c1 to c2 the two columns are assumed to have the same radius i e r r 1 r 2 3 characteristics and calculation method of hydrodynamic force on pile group as discussed in section 2 the hydrodynamic forces on isolated single pile and on one of the twin columns can be calculated analytically by eqs 5 and 7 respectively and there is no analytical way to estimate hydrodynamic force on pile of pile group however the cfd method is an alternate therefore the cfd method i e ansys fluent will be employed to simulate the vibration of pile group under earthquake based on which the hydrodynamic force will be discussed and the flow field will be analyzed to explain the generation mechanism of the hydrodynamic force the thorough understanding of the hydrodynamic force enlightens the exploring of the calculation method for the pile group the three pile group is chosen as the object in this section as it is the simplest pile group the diameter of the piles is set as 3 m and the relative center distance l r is set as 4 because these dimensions are frequently used in real practice for example the pile group of the main pier of the nanjing yangtze second river bridge in china is composed of 21 piles with diameter 3 m and l r 4 the pile group of the main pier of the zhanjiang bayi bridge in china is composed of 31 piles with diameter 2 5 m and l r 4 8 the pile group of the main pier of the ningbo daxie island bridge in china is composed of 16 piles with diameter 2 8 m and l r 2 9 3 1 cfd basic equations and the numerical model validation in this study software ansys fluent is employed to solve the navier stokes rans

averaged pressure ρ is the density of water and μ is the kinematic viscosity of water in the simulation the dynamic mesh technique is used to reconstruct the mesh due to the relatively smaller amplitude of the columns the mesh reconstruction in the computational domain does not have a great influence on the quality of the mesh and the accuracy of the calculation can be ensured ansys icem cfd is used to build geometric model and generate mesh in order to reduce the influence of the boundaries of fluid domain on the forces exerted on the structure the length along the direction of column motion and width perpendicular to the direction of column motion of the rectangular computational domain respectively are set as 40 times and 20 times of the diameter of the column as shown in fig 3 a considering the great velocity gradient and pressure gradient near the column a core area around the column is set to generate extremely fine meshes as shown in fig 3 b the boundary conditions of the column surface and the front back left and right boundaries of computational domain are set as wall and the scalable wall functions are used to simulate the boundary layer effect the k ε rng turbulence model suitable for high reynolds number cases is chosen because the reynolds number in this study is extremely large i e in the range 10 6 10 7 the physical experimental data of the isolated single column vibrating in still water by yang et al 2018 are used to confirm the correctness of modeling method and the related parameters the numerical model has the same dimensions and suffers the same external excitation as the physical experimental model the comparison of the time histories of hydrodynamic forces between the physical experimental model and the numerical model is shown in fig 4 it can be observed that numerical calculation is stable after t 4 s and the two curves coincide well indicating the solution of the present numerical model is trustable 3 2 characteristics and generation mechanism of hydrodynamic force the analytical solutions of the hydrodynamic forces for the isolated column and twin columns expressed by eqs 5 and 7 respectively have been proven to match well with the numerical results by cfd method ansys fluent in the study by yang et al 2020 therefore the analytical solutions of the isolated pile and the twin columns are used to compare with the numerical solutions of piles in pile group by cfd method the harmonic wave with amplitude a 0 3 m frequency f 1 hz will be used as the excitation in the following cases for convenience f x ana s f y ana s are defined as the x and y components of the hydrodynamic force on the isolated single column obtained by the analytical method namely eq 5 f x ana c j b i f y ana c j b i are defined as the x and y components of the hydrodynamic force on the column c j of the twin columns obtained by the analytical method namely eq 7 in which j 1 2 f x cfd c j t r i f y cfd c j t r i are defined as the x and y components of the hydrodynamic force on the column c j of the three columns obtained by the cfd method in which j 1 2 3 3 2 1 three columns arranged in tandem the sketch of the three columns standing in tandem is shown in fig 5 because of the symmetry f x ana c 1 b i f x ana c 2 b i for the twin columns and f x cfd c 1 t r i f x cfd c 3 t r i for the three columns therefore the hydrodynamic forces on the isolated single column c1 column of the twin columns c1 and c2 columns of the three columns are compared in fig 6 the velocity vector distributions at t 7 s and t 7 25 s are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively it shows no vortex generated around the columns when t 7 s the velocity of the columns is zero and the acceleration arrives at the peak the hydrodynamic force at this time arrives at the peak too as shown in fig 6 when t 7 25 s the velocity of the columns arrives at the maximum but the acceleration is zero the hydrodynamic force at this time is almost zero it indicates that the inertia force dominates the hydrodynamic force the drag force and viscous force less than 1 n according to the numerical results by ansys fluent are so small that can be ignored this conclusion agrees well with the implication of eqs 5 and 7 in which the hydrodynamic force is expressed in the form of acceleration and mass namely inertia force it could be observed in fig 6 that f x ana s f x ana c 1 b i f x cfd c 1 t r i f x cfd c 2 t r i showing that in the three column system the coexistence of columns c 2 and c 3 decreases the hydrodynamic force on c 1 the coexistence of c 1 and c 3 decreases the hydrodynamic force on c2 just like the existence of c 2 of the twin columns decreases the hydrodynamic force on c 1 showing in eqs 7 and 8 further the additional influence of c 3 makes the hydrodynamic force on c1 in the three column system a little smaller than that on c1 in the twin column system because c3 is twice far away from c1 than c2 from c1 but the additional influce of c3 makes the hydrodynamic force on c2 decrease obviously in the three column system compared with that on c2 only influenced by c1 in the twin column system because the center distance between c3 and c2 is the same as that between c1 and c2 in other words the decrease of the hydrodynamic force on c2 doubles in the three column system compared with that in the twin column system the above analysis implies the influences on the hydrodynamic force of a column caused by other columns could be superposed approximately in the three column system assuming that the change of influence of c 2 on c 1 caused by the existence of c 3 is ignorable and also the change of the influence of c 3 on c 1 caused by the existence of c 2 is ignorable then the coexistence of the c 1 c 2 and c 3 could be treated as the two separate twin column systems one is c 1 and c 2 another is c 1 and c 3 therefore the influence of the coexistence of c 2 and c 3 on c 1 could be treated as the superpostion of the influences of c 2 on c 1 and c 3 on c 1 based on eqs 7 and 8 the superposition of the influences can be described as h x 1 h x 12 h x 13 in which h x 12 2 cos 2 θ 12 c 12 2 h x 13 2 cos 2 θ 13 c 13 2 similarly the influence of the coexistence of c 1 and c 3 on c 2 could be treated as the superpostion of the influencens of c 1 on c 2 and c 3 on c 2 generally for column c i in three column system the influence of the other two columns on added mass can be expressed as 11 h x i j 1 3 h x i j j i 12 h y i j 1 3 h y i j j i in which h x i j 2 cos 2 θ i j c i j 2 h y i j 2 sin 2 θ i j c i j 2 and h x i j h y i j represent the added mass modified coefficients respectively in the x and y directions of column c i generated by column c j θ i j and c i j are respectively the center connecting line angle and the relative center distance between the columns c i and c j according to eq 11 the analytical values of the added mass modified coefficients can be calculated as h x 1 h x 12 h x 13 0 125 0 03125 0 15625 h x 2 h x 13 h x 23 0 125 0 125 0 25 based on the hydrodynamic forces calculated by the cfd method h x 1 and h x 2 can also be figured out as 0 147 and 0 232 respectively which agree well with their analytical values in addition the numerical results of hydrodynamic forces in y direction are as small as 10 7 matching well with their analytical values namely zero because θ i j is π 2 or π 2 when the three columns standing in tandem 3 2 2 three columns arranged side by side the sketch of three columns standing side by side is shown in fig 8 the comparison of the x components of hydrodynamic forces on the isolated single column on c1 column of the twin columns standing side by side and on c1 and c2 columns in the three columns standing side by side is shown in fig 9 note that the hydrodynamic forces on c2 of the twin columns and on c3 of the three columns are omitted because of symmetry it can be observed that f x cfd c 2 t r i f x cfd c 1 t r i f x ana c 1 b i f x ana s which shows intensively the superposition of the influence between the columns in detail the hydrodynamic force on the columns standing side by side increases compared with that on the isolated single column by the additional influence of c3 the increment of hydrodynamic force on c2 is more obvious than that on c1 because c3 is nearer to c2 than to c1 in the three column system and the increment of the hydrodynamic force on c2 in the three column system almost doubles than that on c2 in the twin columns because of the influence of c3 under the same assumption in subsection 3 2 1 i e the change of influence of c j j i on c i caused by the existence of other columns is ignorable the added mass modified coefficient h x can be analytically calculated by eq 11 namely h x 1 h x 12 h x 13 0 125 0 03125 0 15625 h x 2 h x 21 h x 23 0 125 0 125 0 25 h x 1 and h x 2 can also be numerically calculated based on the cfd results i e h x 1 0 18 and h x 2 0 28 which are respectively quite close to their analytical values the y components of the hydrodynamic forces lift forces on the three columns standing side by side are compared in fig 10 it can be observed that the lift force on c2 is zero and the lift force curves of c1 and c3 are basically sinusoidal and symmetric about time axis i e they have opposite directions but with the same frequency 2 hz and the same amplitudes 0 75 n approximately fig 11 shows the generation mechanism of the lift force on the three columns when the three columns vibrate the gap flow the flow through the gap between the neighboring columns has relatively larger velocity than the flow outside as shown in fig 11 a which generates lower pressure at the inner sides of c1 or c3 as shown in fig 11 b the pressure difference between the inner and outer sides of c1 or c3 generates the lift force on c1 or c3 however because of symmetry the velocity and the resulted lower pressure at the two sides of c2 are same generating no lift force on c2 in one period the velocity of gap flow changes from zero to the maximum positive or negative twice therefore the frequency of lift force is 2 hz which is twice of the frequency of the x component of the hydrodynamic force however the peak values of the lift force on c1 and c3 are around 1 5 kn which are extremely small compared with that of the x component of the hydrodynamic force i e 100 kn approximately and can be ignored in real practice according to eq 12 the lift forces on c1 c2 and c3 are all zero which implies that eq 12 can predict the lift force pretty well 3 2 3 three columns arranged in staggered form θ 0 π 4 the sketch of three columns arranged in staggered form is shown in fig 12 the comparison of the x components of the hydrodynamic forces on the isolated single column on c1 column of the twin columns arranged in staggered form and on c1 and c2 columns in the three columns arranged in staggered form is shown in fig 13 because of symmetry the x components of the hydrodynamic forces on c2 of the twin columns on c3 of the three columns are not shown it can be observed that the four curves almost coincide with each other implying when the columns standing in staggered form the x component of hydrodynamic force on each column will not be influenced by other columns analytically θ 0 π 4 makes h x i j 2 cos 2 θ i j c i j 2 0 which ultimately makes h x i 0 according to eq 11 that is the x components of the hydrodynamic forces on the three columns in staggered form can be well calculated by eq 11 the comparison of the y components of the hydrodynamic forces on c1 of the twin columns in staggered form on c1 and c2 columns of the three columns arranged in staggered form is shown in fig 14 the y components of hydrodynamic forces on c2 of the twin columns is same as that on c1 therefore it is not shown in fig 14 as well as c3 of the three columns it can be observed that f y ana c 1 b i f y cfd c 1 t r i f y cfd c 2 t r i and the peak value of f y cfd c 2 t r i is about 22 kn is almost 1 4 of the x component of the hydrodynamic force which cannot be ignored also it can be observed that the frequency of the y component is 1 hz which is the same as that of the x component of the hydrodynamic force fig 15 shows at t 7 s the velocity of the columns is zero as shown in fig 15 a and the acceleration of column accordingly should be the maximum in other words the gap flow has the maximum relative acceleration at t 7 s however the center connecting line through the three centers incline to x axis which makes the gap flow acceleration incline to the x axis too then the pressure distributions at the front of and at the back of the column surfaces are not symmetry with their own horizontal centerlines anymore in detail the centers of negative pressure at the back of columns deviate to left and the positive pressure at the front of the columns deviate to right which generate the hydrodynamic force f on each column inclined to x axis the angle between f and the negative direction of x axis is defined as β as shown in fig 15 b fundamentally both of the x and y components of hydrodynamic force on each column are components of the inertia force i e f x f c o s β f y f s i n β that is the reason why the lift force in fig 10 has the same frequency with the x component of the hydrodynamic force in fig 13 recall eq 7 if the inertia force is defined as v m u and the inclined angle β t a n 1 h y 1 h x then eq 7 can be transformed as 13 f x m u 1 h x f c o s α f y m u h y f s i n α which shows the analytical solution well support the fact that the lift force is the component of the inertia force when the three columns arranged in staggered form according to eq 12 the added mass modified coefficients for the y direction on c1 and c2 columns are h y 1 h y 12 h y 13 0 125 0 03125 0 15625 h y 2 h y 21 h y 23 0 125 0 125 0 25 which agree well with the numerical values based on cfd results namely 0 16 and 0 26 respectively generally eqs 11 and 12 can calculate the x and y components of hydrodynamic forces on the three columns arranged in staggered form 3 2 4 more arrangements of three columns in addition to above three basic arrangements another two i e equilateral triangle and isosceles right triangle forms are discussed as shown in fig 16 they can be treated as the combination of any two of the three basic arrangements i e tandem side by side and staggered for example fig 16 a can be treated as combination of the tandem c1 c3 and the staggered c1 c2 arrangements fig 16 b can be treated as combination of the tandem c1 c3 and the side by side c1 and c2 arrangements only the comparison of the added mass modified coefficients between the analytical method i e eqs 11 and 12 and the cfd method i e by ansys fluent is listed in table 1 to confirm that whether eqs 11 and 12 are validate for the combination of the three basic arrangements of the three columns however the detailed analysis to the hydrodynamic force and the flow field is omitted for brevity table 1 shows no matter for equilateral triangle or isosceles right triangle forms the analytical and cfd method results match well which indicates that eqs 11 and 12 are also viable for the complicated arrangements i e combination of the three basic arrangements 3 3 calculation method of hydrodynamic force on pile group fundamentally the cfd method has proven the assumptions the change of influence of c j j i on c i caused by the existence of other columns is ignorable and the influences on hydrodynamic force of a column caused by other columns could be superposed approximately in section 3 2 in other words the calculation method of hydrodynamic force on one column of the three columns with various arrangements i e eqs 11 and 12 has been validated as to the pile group composed of n columns the added mass modified coefficients can be obtained by the extension of the column number in eqs 11 and 12 14 h x i j 1 n h x i j j i 15 h y i j 1 n h y i j j i then the hydrodynamic force on one column of the pile group is 16 f x c i m u 1 h x i f y c i m u h y i four columns in various arrangements are sketched in fig 17 to further validate eqs 14 16 pile groups with more columns are not studied here for brevity but a pile group from a real bridge will be studied under earthquake wave not harmonic wave to validate eqs 14 16 in the next section the comparison of the added mass modified coefficients for the four columns between the analytical method and the cfd method is listed in table 2 results show that the analytical values agree well with the cfd values indicating the hydrodynamic force calculation method proposed in this study i e eqs 14 16 is correct 4 application in order to simplify deduction process of the analytical solution in section 2 a monochromatic simple harmonic wave was used to replace earthquake wave and only 4 columns at most are used to validate the correctness of the proposed calculation method in the previous sections therefore it s necessary to use a pile group of real bridge excited by true earthquake to validate both the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method a pile group of the main pier of the nanjing yangtze second river bridge in china composed of 21 columns is chosen as object as shown in fig 18 the diameter of the columns is 3 m and the relative center distance l r 4 and the bridge is assumed to be attacked by kocaeli wave as shown in fig 19 because of symmetry only the added mass modified coefficients of columns c1 c8 are compared in table 3 it can be observed that the analytical values match the cfd values relatively well in addition the added mass modified coefficients are ordinarily smaller than those of fewer columns system i e the maximum of h x by the analytical method in table 3 is 0 057 compared with the maxima 0 2813 in table 2 for the 4 columns system and 0 25 for the 3 columns system in subsection 3 2 1 the more columns the more arrangement styles between the aimed column and other columns different arrangement style between the aimed column and one of the other columns makes the added mass modified coefficient on the aimed column negative or positive varying with the polar angle of the center connecting line through the two circular centers the diversity of arrangement style makes the superposition of these negative or positive values cancel out each other ultimately makes the coefficients to be smaller as representative comparisons of the hydrodynamic force on column c1 between the analytical and cfd methods are shown in fig 20 in which the x components comparison is shown in fig 20 a and the y components comparison is shown in fig 20 b it can be observed that the two curves coincide with each other considerably well comparisons of the hydrodynamic forces for other columns also indicate the analytical and cfd methods match well omitted here for brevity further the calculation method of the total hydrodynamic force i e f t x and f t y on the pile group are deduced as 17 f t x m t u 1 h x t f t y m t u h y t in which m t is the total added mass of the pile group h x t and h y t are the total added mass modified coefficients of the pile group in x and y directions respectively they are detailed as 18 m t j 1 n m j n m 19 h x t 1 n i 1 n h x i 20 h y t 1 n i 1 n h y i note that n is the number of the columns and n 21 in this case ordinarily the piles have the same diameter in pile group so eq 8 is viable based on eqs 19 and 20 h x t and h y t can be calculated analytically and based on eqs 17 and 18 numerical h x t and h y t can be calculated according to respectively f t x and f t x obtained by the cfd method and the analytical and numerical values of h x t as well as h y t are compared in the last line in table 3 as we expected the analytical and numerical cfd methods agree with each other well in addition the x and y components of the total hydrodynamic force i e f t x and f t y on pile group are shown in fig 21 a and fig 21 b respectively which demonstrate that f t y is almost zero because the pile group is symmetry with respect to the x axis through its center as shown in fig 18 and also demonstrate that the analytical method proposed in this study can predict the hydrodynamic force on the pile group very well basically h x t and h y t themselves are extremely small this is because for different column h x i h y i may be negative or positive shown in table 3 summation of the values makes h x t h y t even smaller i e h x t 0 02 and h y t 0 01 it can be expected that with the increase of column number in the pile group the added mass modified coefficients on any column of the pile group decrease and the total added mass modified coefficients decrease more intensively namely h x t and h y t tend to zero in other words for the pile groups composed of dozens of columns for example more than 30 columns ignoring the added mass modified coefficients may not introduce obvious errors when estimating hydrodynamic force on columns or pile groups under earthquakes however for the pile groups composed of several columns ignoring the added mass modified coefficients will introduce considerable errors for example at most 33 error for the 4 columns listed in table 2 in addition the analytical method only took 20 min to finish calculation work in microsoft excel however the cfd method took more than 100 h to finish computation on a desktop computer with intel core i7 processor and 16 g memory it s clear that the analytical method proposed in this study is not only precise but also convenient and efficient for real practice 5 conclusions in real practice the substructure of the deep water bridge is ordinarily composed of pile group pile cap and bridge pier it s challenging to deduce analytical calculation method of the hydrodynamic force directly because of the complexity of the flow field generated by a group of synchronously vibrating piles the influence of the hydrodynamic force on a cylinder caused by another cylinder in the twin column system has been investigated by yang et al 2020 and the calculation method of the hydrodynamic force on one column of the twin columns has also been proposed based on which for pile group the influence of the hydrodynamic force on one column c i induced by the existence of other columns c j j i is supposed to be the superposition of influences of column c j j i on c i then the numerical software ansys fluent is employed to validate the hypothesis and the calculation method of the hydrodynamic force on the pile group is studied the main conclusions are 1 the assumptions the change of influence of c j j i on c i caused by the existence of other columns is ignorable and the influences on the hydrodynamic force of a column caused by other columns could be superposed approximately is verified by the cfd method 2 the calculation formulae of the hydrodynamic force on one column of the pile group and on the whole of the pile group are proposed i e eq 16 and eq 17 respectively 3 when the quantity of pile is larger the added mass modified coefficients are smaller for the pile group with dozens of piles the added mass modified coefficients can be ignored 4 calculation method proposed in this study is not only precise enough but also convenient and efficient for real practice in addition the influence of the pile cap and bridge pier on the hydrodynamic force of the pile group still needs further investigation which is our next focus in the near future and also the physical experiments are expected to be conducted to test and verify the calculation method proposed in this study credit authorship contribution statement wanli

21843,the tip leakage vortex cavitating flow generated by a straight hydrofoil is computed using large eddy simulation combined with zwart gerber belamri cavitation model comparisons between the numerical and experimental results show a good agreement in velocity field and complicated vortical structures including tip leakage vortex tip separation vortex the induced secondary vortices and wake vortices shedding off the foil spatial evolution of tip vortices is studied with three generations of vortex identification methods including vorticity q criterion hunt et al 1988 the ω method liu et al 2016 and the liutex method liu et al 2018a performances of different methods are compared and explained which indicate the advantages of liutex method in the investigation of this flow regime the evolution of tip vortices is observed to be affected by the free shear layer around tlv dramatically which means that it may play an important role in tlv cavitating flow keywords cavitating flow vortex cavitation tip leakage flow les vortex identification 1 introduction tip leakage vortex tlv cavitation is a common albeit complicated problem in various practical engineering applications such as hydraulic turbines and waterjet pumps miorini et al 2011 roussopoulos and monkewitz 2000 zhang et al 2015 nowadays more and more interests are attracted to tip leakage vortex cavitating flow with respect to its deleterious effects the generation of noise for instant which significantly impede the development of warships and submarines chen et al 2017 kolahan et al 2019 lee et al 2017 peng et al 2017 the modeling of confined tip vortex cavitation is known to be difficult due to the incomplete understanding of influences exerted by the clearance size angle of attack and dissolved gas content arndt et al 2006 a large body of work has been done on the understanding of tlv cavitation both experimentally and numerically which can be divided into cases of complex hydro turbines and simplified single hydrofoils roughly by the research objects investigations of tlv in linear compressor cascades and hydro turbines that take both the moving casing and the interaction between the tlv and the neighboring blades into consideration have been broadly conducted liu et al 2018b inoue and kuroumaru 1989 studied the tip leakage flow in axial compressor rotors using hot wire having the evolutions of tlv along the flow passage and interaction with the adjacent blade measured roussopoulos and monkewitz 2000 investigated the tlv intensity in kaplan type turbine with different types of casings and proved the ineffectiveness of anti cavitation lip using particle image velocimetry piv a more sophisticated and detailed experiment was conducted by miorini et al 2011 data obtained by piv were analyzed to get several important parameters in the field and it was found that the opposite sign vortex which is called the induced vortex gets to generate in the casing boundary layer and then rotates around the tlv numerical simulations are also applied to look into tip leakage flow in turbo machines you et al 2007 investigated the tip clearance flow in axial turbomachines using large eddy simulation les in which mean streamlines and λ 2 contours were utilized to visualize the evolution of tlv with direct relevance to vibration and noise in axial flow pumps suction side perpendicular cavitating vortices sspcv were studied by zhang et al 2015 with simulation result which agreed with the high speed photography results qualitatively the inception of sspcv was found to be attributed to the shedding cavitation cloud originally attached on the suction side of the blade tlv cavitation is affected by multiple factors in turbo machines to simplify the problem investigations of tlv generated by individual foils have been conducted experimentally and numerically tip vortex cavitation on an elliptical hydrofoil was found to be altered drastically by a confinement wall at a specific range of distance to the tip of the foil by boulon et al 1999 as most of the turbomachinery that involving tip leakage flow have fairly small tip gaps which is 1 10 of the blade chord the effect of the relative motion between the blade and casing seems important nevertheless it is found experimentally that other than distorting the tlv structure little fundamental alternation is made to the dominant mechanisms of its development in the presence of relative motion according to wang and devenport 2004 therefore in order to specify dynamic mechanisms of distinct influential factors such as clearance size mainstream velocity and angle of attack simplified cases of tip leakage flow generated by single hydrofoils were investigated with relative motion between the foil and end wall neglected in the meanwhile dreyer et al 2014 conducted a series of experiments on naca0009 hydrofoil to investigate the influences of flow conditions on the structure of the tlv more systematically using stereo particle image velocimetry spiv by analyzing changes in the vortex intensity axial flow in the core vortex center position and wandering motion amplitude it was concluded that the clearance size can significantly influence both the vortex trajectory and intensity considering the difficulties in measuring velocity distributions within cavities a number of precise numerical simulations of the tip leakage vortex cavitating flow have been conducted in recent years to reveal the mechanisms underlying the tlv cavitation phenomena especially for the simplified single hydrofoil cases reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method and les were employed by decaix et al 2015 to simulate the tlv cavitating flow induced by a naca0009 hydrofoil which has gain reasonable agreement in velocity distributions downstream the foil comparing with the experimental results yet the structure of tlv cavity seems still unsatisfactory therefore several modifications to the commonly used cavitation model have been done to improve consistency between the computed results and experimental observations modified cavitation models proposed by zhao et al 2016 and guo et al 2018 that are intended to simulate tlv cavitation by taking into account the pressure reducing effect of the strongly rotating tip vortex have apparently extent the length of the simulated tlv in streamwise direction comparing with the original zwart s model recently cheng et al 2020 reproduced the tip leakage cavitating flow generated by a straight naca0009 hydrofoil successfully with adaptive mesh refinement method and found that cavitation can significantly influence the transport of vorticity and turbulence kinetic energy in the tip vortices varieties of factors are found to be associated with the development of cavities in cavitating flows involving non condensable air content the re entrant jet the rigid wall and the evolution of vortex structures li et al 2019 pendar and roohi 2016 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2017 moreover since vortex structures play a critical role in the generation and evolution of turbulent cavitating flow several published works have emphasized the significant interaction between vortices and cavitation huang et al 2019 ji et al 2014 long et al 2018 it is indicated that strength of the cavitating vortex varies intensely with time and space which is dominated by the stretching term the dilatation term and the baroclinic torque in the vorticity transport equation the stretching term was found to be smaller before the merging of tlv and tsv than after for the reason that strength of tlv increases as the merging happens bai et al 2018 cheng et al 2020 in tlv cavitating flow in addition the interaction between different vortices is found to play a significant role in the development of tip leakage cavitating flow as well due to the instability of vortex pairs bai et al 2018 being related to vortices closely cavitating flows are broadly studied with a focus on cavitation vortex interaction qualitatively and quantitatively from the qualitative aspect vortical structures are visualized via a variety of methods of all three generations kubota et al 1992 and coutier delgosha et al 2007 investigated dynamics of cloud cavitation with vorticity which is categorized as the first generation of vortex identification method with velocity vector fields helping to distinguish vortices from shear layer latter researches concentrate on identifying different types of vortices including hairpin vortices u type structures and streamers to understand their effects in detail mostly with the second generation of methods budich et al 2018 chen et al 2019 long et al 2018 huang et al 2014 and ji et al 2015 showed delicate vortical structures in cloud cavitating flow utilizing the iso surfaces of q criterion with constant values q criterion and λ 2 criterion were both applied by budich et al 2018 to illustrate the existence of complex vortices such as streamers which are characteristic features of the cavitating flow recently liu et al 2016 and liu et al 2018a have proposed new criterions called the third generation of vortex identification methods namely ω method and liutex method which have been justified through several classical cases therefore with so many vortex identification methods adoptable in the investigation of fluid dynamics to screen out a relatively suitable method for the vortex visualization in tip leakage cavitating flow is of vital importance for further study inspired by previous investigations the objective of this paper is to screen out a relatively suitable criterion of vortex visualization for tlv cavitating flow investigated here the flow regime is generated by a straight naca0009 hydrofoil whose computational domain closely follows the experimental setup dreyer et al 2014 except that the pressure side of the foil tip is not rounded in the current simulation large eddy simulation les combined with zwart gerber belamri zgb model are employed validation of computational results are conducted first then the spatial evolution of tip vortices is analyzed through their characteristic motions and features finally variations of vortex topologies at different cross sections along tlv and iso surfaces of its global feature are visualized and accounted for in detail with all three generations of vortex identification methods including vorticity q criterion ω method and liutex method to illustrate the applicability of different vortex identification methods 2 vortex identification methods with no objective and unambiguous definition of vortex available until recently numbers of vortex identification methods have been brought up to reveal the important structure in the flow which can be generally categorized into three generations liu et al 2019 to find out the most suitable method for understanding tip leakage cavitating flow vorticity q criterion the ω method and the liutex method are used in the present investigation which are briefly introduced as follows 2 1 vorticity method vorticity tensor has been widely used to present vortices which is defined as the curl of velocity 1 ω v ω ω whose streamwise component can be written as 2 ω x w y v z 2 2 q criterion the q criterion is proposed by hunt et al 1988 which defines a vortex as the region where vorticity magnitude dominates over shear strain rate also known as the region with positive second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor 3 q 1 2 b f 2 a f 2 0 where b and a are the antisymmetric part and symmetric part of velocity gradient tensor respectively and f denotes the frobenius norm when q 0 the flow field is dominated by strain according to its definition 2 3 ω method considering the physical meaning for q criterion is not so clear the ω method is brought up by liu et al 2016 which is presented as the ratio of vorticity square over the sum of vorticity square and deformation square as 4 ω b f 2 a f 2 b f 2 ε 5 ε 0 001 b f 2 a f 2 max a reference range for vortex visualization that is about 0 51 0 6 is provided to insure a local dominance of the vorticity and ε is a small positive number to avoid division by zero and to filter out noise vortices that are of both small vorticity and deformation 2 4 liutex method a new vector quantity named liutex r is proposed by liu et al 2018a to describe the local fluid rotation motion which is computed as 6 r r r 7 r 2 β α if α 2 β 2 0 β 0 2 β α if α 2 β 2 0 β 0 0 if α 2 β 2 0 8 α 1 2 v y u x 2 v x u y 2 9 β 1 2 v x u y in a new xyz frame where the z axis is parallel to the local fluid rotational axis vector r and r represents the rigid rotation strength of local fluid 3 mathematical formulations and numerical method 3 1 governing equations and turbulence model although direct numerical simulation dns can resolve the whole spectrum of turbulent scales its application in high reynolds number flows is limited due to the huge cost of computing resources and time therefore to get a relatively high proportion of resolved eddies with acceptable cpus requirement large eddy simulation les is adopted in the present paper to simulate the tip leakage cavitating flow based on the assumption of homogeneous multiphase flow the fluid components are assumed to share the same velocity field the favre filtered governing equations of continuity and momentum in the cartesian coordinates are as follows 10 ρ m t ρ m u j x j 0 11 ρ m u i t ρ m u i u j x j p x i x j μ m u i x j τ i j x j where overbars denote filtered variables ρ m and μ m are the mixture density and the molecular viscosity which are defined as 12 ρ m 1 α v ρ l α v ρ v 13 μ m 1 α v μ l α v μ v α v is the volume fraction of vapor and τ ij is the subgrid scale sgs stress defined by 14 τ i j ρ m u i u j u i u j the sgs stresses are unknown and require modeling therefore the boussinesq hypothesis is employed to compute sgs stresses with 15 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j in which τ kk is the isotropic part of the sgs stresses and s i j is the strain rate tensor for the resolved scale written as 16 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i the sgs turbulent viscosity μ t is modeled by the wall adapting local eddy viscosity wale model nicoud and ducros 1999 as 17 μ t ρ m l s 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s i j 5 2 s i j d s i j d 5 4 18 l s min κ d c w v 1 3 19 s i j d 1 2 g i j 2 g j i 2 1 3 δ i j g k k 2 g i j u i x j where l s is the mixing length for subgrid scales κ is the von kármán constant d is the distance to the closest wall v is the local cell volume and c w is the wale constant whose default value is 0 325 3 2 cavitation model the vaporization and condensation process of cavitation is governed by the vapor transport equation which is written as 20 ρ v α v t ρ v α v u i x i r e r c where the mass transfer source and sink terms r e and r c related to the growth and collapse of vapor bubbles respectively are modeled by the simplified rayleigh plesset equation the zwart gerber belamri zgb model zwart et al 2004 is used in this study to predict the interphase mass transfer due to cavitation a simplified expression of the rayleigh plesset equation can be obtained by neglecting the second order terms and the surface tension as follows 21 3 2 d r b d t 2 p v p ρ l where r b is the bubble radius p v is the saturation vapor pressure and p represents the local far field pressure the vapor volume fraction can be expressed as 22 α v n 4 3 π r b 3 where n is the bubble number per unit volume therefore the interphase mass transfer rate per unit volume can be written as 23 r 3 α v ρ v r b d r b d t considering the nucleation site density must decrease as the vapor volume fraction increases in the vaporization process the final formulations of the mass transfer terms in the zgb model can be generalized as follows 24 r e f vap 3 α nuc 1 α v ρ v r b 2 3 max p v p 0 ρ l 25 r c f cond 3 α v ρ v r b 2 3 max p p v 0 ρ l where the nucleation site volume fraction α nuc is set to be 5 10 4 the default bubble radius r b is 10 6 m and empirical calibration coefficients named vaporization coefficient f vap is 50 and condensation coefficient f cond is 0 01 respectively as recommended by zwart et al 2004 which have been validated by different kinds of cavitating flows 3 3 numerical schemes in the present investigation simplec is utilized as the pressure velocity coupling method all differential equations are discretized by finite volume method fvm and are solved implicitly a bounded central differencing scheme is chosen for the convection term of the momentum equation which is recognized as an ideal choice for large eddy simulation with fairly low numerical diffusion for the unsteady simulation the time dependent computations are solved by a bounded second order implicit scheme a least squares cell based method is used to compute the gradients and derivatives in the equations first order upwind scheme is used for the volume fraction transport equation 40 iterations per time step are used to balance the accuracy and efficiency the convergence criteria are the absolute residual type with a residual target of 5 10 5 which is sufficient for unsteady flows with cavitation the time step size is 1 10 5s 3 4 numerical setup computational domain and boundary conditions of the simulated tip leakage cavitating flow is depicted in fig 1 which is introduced by a naca0009 hydrofoil with a chord c 100 mm the gap size between the gap wall and the foil tip is 0 1c the simulation is performed at an attack angle α of 10 in which the inlet total pressure is fixed to 153000 pa and the outlet velocity v 10 m s in accordance with the experiment the detailed information of the foil can be found in the reference dreyer et al 2014 and it should be noted that the foil tip is not rounded in the current simulation les coupled with zgb model is employed in the simulation to capture more delicate vortical structures in the cavitating flow it is reported by cheng et al 2020 that the reproducing of tlv cavitation demands sufficiently high resolution in the core of tlv therefore to gain a relatively satisfying computational result a cartesian cut cell grid method that is of good orthogonality high quality and flexibility in local refinement is used and special mesh refinement around tlv is conducted in the present paper three meshes namely mesh 1 3 consisting of about 7 36 million 11 69 million and 15 59 million cells respectively are generated in the present study the three meshes have all been deliberately refined around tip leakage vortex cavitation tlvc and the foil surface with different fineness of resolution as shown in fig 2 a with the refined region around tlvc marked by a white dashed frame inflation layers are generated with 20 nodes in the viscous sublayer outside the hydrofoil and gap wall resolutions on the foil surface and around cavitation regions are all refined as displayed in fig 2 b the refined mesh resolutions around the tlv as well as streamwise and spanwise resolutions on the foil surface are set to be 6 10 4m 5 10 4m and 4 10 4m for mesh 1 3 respectively according to the work of cheng et al 2020 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the numerical results to insure the accuracy of simulation computational results of all meshes are compared in the following context fig 3 shows distributions of dimensionless distance y from the foil surface with mesh 1 mesh 3 which is defined as follows 26 y y p u τ ν where y p is the distance from a certain point p to the nearest wall and u τ is the friction velocity to resolve the boundary layer appropriately it is required that y 1 for les however it is hard to strictly meet this requirement for tip leakage cavitating flow fig 3 gives an indication that all three resolutions can basically meet the requirement in which the maximum of y is below 5 for all three meshes and the value is mostly between 0 1 fig 4 shows the tip vortices captured with mesh 1 3 in non cavitating conditions vortices on the suction side of the foil are omitted so that tip vortices can be easily observed it indicates that mesh 2 and mesh 3 provide more delicate vortical structures with finer grid resolutions as compared to mesh 1 for cavitating results fig 5 further compares instantaneous iso surface of vapor volume fraction α v 0 1 predicted on mesh 1 3 with experimental pictures provided by laboratory for hydraulic machines of epfl the cavitation is reproduced with a reasonable accuracy by all three meshes including tip leakage vortex tlv and tip separation vortex tsv cavities apparently more details in the profile of both tlv and tsv cavities and the merging of them as they develop downstream are captured by finer resolutions the maximum length of tlv cavitation which possesses great relevance with the prediction ability of tlv is better by mesh 2 and 3 however further refinement is unable to improve its length as shown by the results of mesh 2 and 3 considering the major concern of the current paper is characteristics of tip vortices and there will be a sharp rise in the requirement of computational resources for further refinement following discussions will hence be conducted on result of mesh 2 to evaluate the resolution accuracy of large eddy simulation conducted on mesh 2 a parameter qc defined as the ratio between modeled and total turbulent kinetic energy is applied as shown in fig 6 the criterion is proposed by benard et al 2016 which can be written as 27 q c e s g s e s g s e r 0 2 where e r and e sgs are the resolved and the sgs turbulent kinetic energy respectively it is found that distributions of qc around tlv cavitation at different positions are generally below 0 2 which indicates that more than 80 of the total turbulent flow are resolved and that a well resolved les at least in the tlv cavitation region is obtained the kinetic energy spectrum of numerical result of non cavitating case with mesh 2 is shown in fig 7 the one dimensional energy spectrum is computed by integrating the three dimensional energy spectrum in the spherical shell κ κ 1 2 κ 2 2 κ 3 2 in spectral space li and li 2016 a decaying slope is obtained in the energy spectra which is close to the kolmogorov spectral slope 5 3 in the inertial subrange indicating well resolved scales in inertial subrange in the current flow field further comparisons between the experimental result and numerical data obtained with mesh 2 are conducted qualitatively and quantitatively to show how they relate to each other through time averaged flow field fig 8 compares the experimental and numerical time averaged cavitating tlv the predicted results match that of experiments in shape and spatial development for both cloud and tlv cavities the fusing points of tlv and tsv are around x c 0 25 both numerically and experimentally moreover dimensionless pitchwise positions of the tlv core at several positions in the main stream direction ranging in x c from 0 1 to 0 9 are compared in table 1 whose errors are less than 2 5 before x c 0 25 and after x c 0 25 the fusing point table 2 compares the dimensionless diameters of cavitating tlv downstream the fusing point x c 0 25 errors of which are no more than 1 it is indicated that a reasonable accuracy is obtained between the measured and computed tlv for mesh 2 in the present simulation which assures the reliability of following discussions 4 2 spatial evolution of tip vortices fig 9 shows instantaneous vortical structures at a typical instant with the iso surface of ω method ω 0 57 ε 0 001 b a max in two different perspectives colored by streamwise vorticity ω x the ω method illustrates the existence of complicated vortices including tlv tsv and secondary vortices in the gap region as well as wake vortices downstream the foil scale and appearance of tip vortices vary dramatically in the streamwise direction whose evolution can be divided into three stages at different spatial locations in stage i tlv and tsv originate from suction side and tip of the hydrofoil respectively and develop independently to the downstream of leading edge the formation of tlv and tsv is mainly driven by the pressure gradient between suction side and pressure side of the hydrofoil across the gap region there is a strong flow separation at the foil tip to form tsv and the tsv continues to develop to the suction side of the foil under pressure gradients in stage ii tlv and tsv move closer and start to twist together with increasing radius as they merge with each other as a consequence vorticity of opposite sign generates in the boundary layer of the gapwall and together with wake vortices attracted by the merging tlv and tsv to roll up around them in stage iii the vortices interact with each other while developing continuing to expand their radiuses and dissipate due to instability of vortex pairs as they go downstream generally speaking our numerical results show a reasonable prediction on the complex vortex structure evolution 4 3 comparison of vortex identification methods on tip vortices in this section to compare the applicability of different vortex identification methods in the tip leakage cavitating flow spatial evolution of tip vortices are discussed in detail with vorticity q criterion the ω method and the liutex method respectively in order to characterize the three dimensional tip vortices evolution in the space fig 11 13 present four representative locations along tlv as shown in fig 10 which are abstracted to show detail topological features of the vortices in the tip leakage cavitating flow with streamwise vorticity q criterion ω method and liutex method separately the locations x c 0 3 x c 0 9 x c 1 7 and x c 2 3 are in stage i stage ii forepart and rear of stage iii respectively which can generally illustrate the spatial evolution of vortices fig 11 compares topologies of tlv tsv and vortices around the sheet cavities in stage i which have all been basically captured by the aforementioned methods it can be found in fig 11 a that the rotating direction of tlv and tsv is opposite to the mainstream direction the distribution areas of tlv and tsv displayed by streamwise vorticity in fig 11 a are slightly bigger than that of the other methods in fig 11 b d resulting in an obvious connection area between tlv and tsv the connection is evidenced to be a shear flow rather than vortex rotation characterized by negative value of q criterion in fig 11 b moreover boundary layer over the gap wall is also taken for vortex by streamwise vorticity vortices in stage i identified by the ω method and the liutex method are similar to each other in fig 11 c d for the reason that difference between the strengths of the vortices in the inception period is small tlv and tsv move closer and eventually fuse together in stage ii as illustrated by fig 12 showing a single negative sign vortex in fig 12 a by streamwise vorticity the shear layer revealed by q criterion which exists around the tlv due to its induced velocity field grows larger as the strength and size of tlv increase as a consequence the induced secondary vortices originated from the gap wall of positive vorticity x component and wake vortices shedding off the foil are transported and entrained by the induced velocity field on one hand and strongly interact with each other as they develop downstream due to instability of vortex pairs on the other hand it is worth mentioning that because a proper threshold value of q criterion is difficult to determine and of little physical meaning the strength of tlv core in fig 12 b seems to be overestimated while the topology captured by ω method and liutex method is more accurate this phenomenon has been described by cheng et al 2020 that there exists a reduction of strength in the core of tlv which can be explained with the effect of dilatation term in vorticity transport equation different to the situation in stage i distinction between vortical structures identified by the ω method and the liutex method are observed in fig 12 c d as ω is a dimensionless parameter both strong and weak vortices are visualized to have the same value however wake vortices and the secondary vortices are found to be weaker than tlv by the liutex method which can show the absolute strength of vortices the evolution features of tip vortices in stage iii are shown in fig 13 with sections of x c 1 7 and x c 2 3 located at its forepart and rear respectively the visualization in fig 13 exhibits a strong tendency of decline of tlv characterized by reduction in the scale and strength of it as well as a shrinkage of the free shear layer induced by tlv in the meanwhile as tlv the induced secondary vortices and wake vortices interact and fuse with each other it becomes hard to distinguish them from each other at x c 2 3 with similar topologies of vortices shown by all four methods in fig 13 a d in addition it is found that distribution of the vortex cluster expands to the whole section gradually which can be attributed to the vorticity diffusion and cancellation by viscous effect therefore given that the large scale free shear layer exists until tlv is greatly weakened at the rear of stage iii it is supposed that the free shear layer around tlv plays a more important role in the evolution of tlv cavitation as compared with cloud cavitation global features of tip vortices over the whole length of tlv at a typical instant are identified by iso surfaces of vorticity q criterion the ω method and the liutex method as shown in fig 14 generally characteristic vortices and three stages evolution process of them in the current flow regime can be identified by the iso surfaces of all four methods however discrepancies exist in the ability of filtering out the shear layer over solid boundaries where there is great velocity gradient due to viscous effect as shown by the iso surface of vorticity ω 1500 in fig 14 a tip vortices as well as vortices on the foil suction side are contaminated by a large distinct region as compared to the other methods which corresponds to boundary layers around gap wall and the foil however the boundary layers are not supposed to be displayed as vortices moreover borders of tlv and the induced secondary vortices are vague connecting with the visible boundary layers which are clearer visualized by ω method and liutex method noise structures introduced by the geometry model and shearing motion of the fluid are also found in fig 14 b by q criterion it is observed that although q criterion can filter out a large proportion of shear layer there are still some unexpected structures close to the foil and gap wall which are marked boundary layer in fig 14 b these structures are mainly introduced by shearing flow over the wall and around the hydrofoil surface tlv in the middle of rotating vortex clusters characterized by negative vorticity x component is identified better with ω method and liutex method in fig 14 c d with its extent longer and structures of wake vortices are more complete for the ω method and the liutex method in general all vortex identification methods are able to capture tlv tsv the induced secondary vortices and wake vortices shedding off the foil discrepancies firstly exist in the ability of avoiding unexpected boundary layers over solid walls between three generations of vortex identification methods among which the first and the second generations are the worst i e vorticity method and q criterion secondly the determination of a proper threshold for q criterion is subjective and arbitrary liu et al 2018a which may bring fake breakdown of vortices with an excessively big value and appearing of boundary layers with too small one the suggested threshold ω 0 52 for the ω method is reliable to present vortex for different cases liu et al 2019 and the case investigated in the present paper as well which indicates robustness of the ω method in threshold change liutex is a mathematical definition of the rigid rotational part of fluid motion which means the magnitude selected to show vortical structures represents the absolute strength of tlv it is observed that ω method and liutex method both show good performance in visualizing all types of vortices in figs 11 14 demonstrating the superiority of them in the investigation of tip leakage cavitating flow thirdly the ω method as a dimensionless parameter may visualize vortices of different strengths with the same magnitude of ω which makes it unable to identify the variations in the tlv strength during its evolution however liutex method can tell the strength of vortices by the magnitude of r which is the pure rigid body rotation of fluid element so that all vortical structures of distinct intensity are captured by contours with suitable range which fulfills the goals of filtering shear layers and identifying variations in tlv strength during its evolution therefore liutex method appeared to be a more adaptable criterion for the tip leakage cavitating flow among all four methods studied here which can largely improve the precision of vortex identification and further facilitate the investigation of tlv cavitating flow 5 conclusions in good agreement with the referenced experiment provided by laboratory for hydraulic machines of epfl the tip leakage flow introduced by a straight naca0009 hydrofoil is simulated successfully by les and zgb cavitation model the obtained results have been validated carefully and proved to be well resolved by les furthermore we have illustrated the evolution process of tip vortices in the space and investigated detail vortical topologies in different developing stages with three generations of vortex visualization methods respectively the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the simulation conducted in the present paper reproduces the tlv cavitation successfully as compared with experimental data the eddies of different scales in the inertial subrange are well resolved by les method indicated by the classical 5 3 scaling law 2 characteristic vortices in tip leakage vortex cavitating flow are captured and visualized including tlv tsv the induced secondary vortices and wake vortices shedding off the foil the spatial evolution of vortical structures can be divided into three stages including origination and development of tlv and tsv separately in stage i merging of tlv and tsv together with entrainment of the induced secondary vortices and wake vortices in stage ii diffusion and dissipation of the vortices in stage iii the evolution of vortex structures are captured quite well 3 discussion of detail vortical topologies in different stages through vortex identification methods of three generations including vorticity method q criterion ω method and liutex method are conducted an intense free shear layer is revealed around tlv by q criterion which continues weakening itself until its intensity is largely reduced the vorticity method is found to possess a poor ability in filtering boundary layer followed by q criterion while ω method and liutex method can identify all kinds of vortices in the current flow regime without shear layer advantages are found in ω method and liutex method however ω method may identify both weak and strong vortices under the same value while the magnitude of liutex method can tell the rotating strength of a vortex therefore liutex method appeared to be a more adaptable criterion for tlv cavitating flow which can largely improve the precision of vortex identification and further facilitate the investigation of tlv cavitating flow credit authorship contribution statement xiaorui bai software validation

21843,the tip leakage vortex cavitating flow generated by a straight hydrofoil is computed using large eddy simulation combined with zwart gerber belamri cavitation model comparisons between the numerical and experimental results show a good agreement in velocity field and complicated vortical structures including tip leakage vortex tip separation vortex the induced secondary vortices and wake vortices shedding off the foil spatial evolution of tip vortices is studied with three generations of vortex identification methods including vorticity q criterion hunt et al 1988 the ω method liu et al 2016 and the liutex method liu et al 2018a performances of different methods are compared and explained which indicate the advantages of liutex method in the investigation of this flow regime the evolution of tip vortices is observed to be affected by the free shear layer around tlv dramatically which means that it may play an important role in tlv cavitating flow keywords cavitating flow vortex cavitation tip leakage flow les vortex identification 1 introduction tip leakage vortex tlv cavitation is a common albeit complicated problem in various practical engineering applications such as hydraulic turbines and waterjet pumps miorini et al 2011 roussopoulos and monkewitz 2000 zhang et al 2015 nowadays more and more interests are attracted to tip leakage vortex cavitating flow with respect to its deleterious effects the generation of noise for instant which significantly impede the development of warships and submarines chen et al 2017 kolahan et al 2019 lee et al 2017 peng et al 2017 the modeling of confined tip vortex cavitation is known to be difficult due to the incomplete understanding of influences exerted by the clearance size angle of attack and dissolved gas content arndt et al 2006 a large body of work has been done on the understanding of tlv cavitation both experimentally and numerically which can be divided into cases of complex hydro turbines and simplified single hydrofoils roughly by the research objects investigations of tlv in linear compressor cascades and hydro turbines that take both the moving casing and the interaction between the tlv and the neighboring blades into consideration have been broadly conducted liu et al 2018b inoue and kuroumaru 1989 studied the tip leakage flow in axial compressor rotors using hot wire having the evolutions of tlv along the flow passage and interaction with the adjacent blade measured roussopoulos and monkewitz 2000 investigated the tlv intensity in kaplan type turbine with different types of casings and proved the ineffectiveness of anti cavitation lip using particle image velocimetry piv a more sophisticated and detailed experiment was conducted by miorini et al 2011 data obtained by piv were analyzed to get several important parameters in the field and it was found that the opposite sign vortex which is called the induced vortex gets to generate in the casing boundary layer and then rotates around the tlv numerical simulations are also applied to look into tip leakage flow in turbo machines you et al 2007 investigated the tip clearance flow in axial turbomachines using large eddy simulation les in which mean streamlines and λ 2 contours were utilized to visualize the evolution of tlv with direct relevance to vibration and noise in axial flow pumps suction side perpendicular cavitating vortices sspcv were studied by zhang et al 2015 with simulation result which agreed with the high speed photography results qualitatively the inception of sspcv was found to be attributed to the shedding cavitation cloud originally attached on the suction side of the blade tlv cavitation is affected by multiple factors in turbo machines to simplify the problem investigations of tlv generated by individual foils have been conducted experimentally and numerically tip vortex cavitation on an elliptical hydrofoil was found to be altered drastically by a confinement wall at a specific range of distance to the tip of the foil by boulon et al 1999 as most of the turbomachinery that involving tip leakage flow have fairly small tip gaps which is 1 10 of the blade chord the effect of the relative motion between the blade and casing seems important nevertheless it is found experimentally that other than distorting the tlv structure little fundamental alternation is made to the dominant mechanisms of its development in the presence of relative motion according to wang and devenport 2004 therefore in order to specify dynamic mechanisms of distinct influential factors such as clearance size mainstream velocity and angle of attack simplified cases of tip leakage flow generated by single hydrofoils were investigated with relative motion between the foil and end wall neglected in the meanwhile dreyer et al 2014 conducted a series of experiments on naca0009 hydrofoil to investigate the influences of flow conditions on the structure of the tlv more systematically using stereo particle image velocimetry spiv by analyzing changes in the vortex intensity axial flow in the core vortex center position and wandering motion amplitude it was concluded that the clearance size can significantly influence both the vortex trajectory and intensity considering the difficulties in measuring velocity distributions within cavities a number of precise numerical simulations of the tip leakage vortex cavitating flow have been conducted in recent years to reveal the mechanisms underlying the tlv cavitation phenomena especially for the simplified single hydrofoil cases reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method and les were employed by decaix et al 2015 to simulate the tlv cavitating flow induced by a naca0009 hydrofoil which has gain reasonable agreement in velocity distributions downstream the foil comparing with the experimental results yet the structure of tlv cavity seems still unsatisfactory therefore several modifications to the commonly used cavitation model have been done to improve consistency between the computed results and experimental observations modified cavitation models proposed by zhao et al 2016 and guo et al 2018 that are intended to simulate tlv cavitation by taking into account the pressure reducing effect of the strongly rotating tip vortex have apparently extent the length of the simulated tlv in streamwise direction comparing with the original zwart s model recently cheng et al 2020 reproduced the tip leakage cavitating flow generated by a straight naca0009 hydrofoil successfully with adaptive mesh refinement method and found that cavitation can significantly influence the transport of vorticity and turbulence kinetic energy in the tip vortices varieties of factors are found to be associated with the development of cavities in cavitating flows involving non condensable air content the re entrant jet the rigid wall and the evolution of vortex structures li et al 2019 pendar and roohi 2016 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2017 moreover since vortex structures play a critical role in the generation and evolution of turbulent cavitating flow several published works have emphasized the significant interaction between vortices and cavitation huang et al 2019 ji et al 2014 long et al 2018 it is indicated that strength of the cavitating vortex varies intensely with time and space which is dominated by the stretching term the dilatation term and the baroclinic torque in the vorticity transport equation the stretching term was found to be smaller before the merging of tlv and tsv than after for the reason that strength of tlv increases as the merging happens bai et al 2018 cheng et al 2020 in tlv cavitating flow in addition the interaction between different vortices is found to play a significant role in the development of tip leakage cavitating flow as well due to the instability of vortex pairs bai et al 2018 being related to vortices closely cavitating flows are broadly studied with a focus on cavitation vortex interaction qualitatively and quantitatively from the qualitative aspect vortical structures are visualized via a variety of methods of all three generations kubota et al 1992 and coutier delgosha et al 2007 investigated dynamics of cloud cavitation with vorticity which is categorized as the first generation of vortex identification method with velocity vector fields helping to distinguish vortices from shear layer latter researches concentrate on identifying different types of vortices including hairpin vortices u type structures and streamers to understand their effects in detail mostly with the second generation of methods budich et al 2018 chen et al 2019 long et al 2018 huang et al 2014 and ji et al 2015 showed delicate vortical structures in cloud cavitating flow utilizing the iso surfaces of q criterion with constant values q criterion and λ 2 criterion were both applied by budich et al 2018 to illustrate the existence of complex vortices such as streamers which are characteristic features of the cavitating flow recently liu et al 2016 and liu et al 2018a have proposed new criterions called the third generation of vortex identification methods namely ω method and liutex method which have been justified through several classical cases therefore with so many vortex identification methods adoptable in the investigation of fluid dynamics to screen out a relatively suitable method for the vortex visualization in tip leakage cavitating flow is of vital importance for further study inspired by previous investigations the objective of this paper is to screen out a relatively suitable criterion of vortex visualization for tlv cavitating flow investigated here the flow regime is generated by a straight naca0009 hydrofoil whose computational domain closely follows the experimental setup dreyer et al 2014 except that the pressure side of the foil tip is not rounded in the current simulation large eddy simulation les combined with zwart gerber belamri zgb model are employed validation of computational results are conducted first then the spatial evolution of tip vortices is analyzed through their characteristic motions and features finally variations of vortex topologies at different cross sections along tlv and iso surfaces of its global feature are visualized and accounted for in detail with all three generations of vortex identification methods including vorticity q criterion ω method and liutex method to illustrate the applicability of different vortex identification methods 2 vortex identification methods with no objective and unambiguous definition of vortex available until recently numbers of vortex identification methods have been brought up to reveal the important structure in the flow which can be generally categorized into three generations liu et al 2019 to find out the most suitable method for understanding tip leakage cavitating flow vorticity q criterion the ω method and the liutex method are used in the present investigation which are briefly introduced as follows 2 1 vorticity method vorticity tensor has been widely used to present vortices which is defined as the curl of velocity 1 ω v ω ω whose streamwise component can be written as 2 ω x w y v z 2 2 q criterion the q criterion is proposed by hunt et al 1988 which defines a vortex as the region where vorticity magnitude dominates over shear strain rate also known as the region with positive second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor 3 q 1 2 b f 2 a f 2 0 where b and a are the antisymmetric part and symmetric part of velocity gradient tensor respectively and f denotes the frobenius norm when q 0 the flow field is dominated by strain according to its definition 2 3 ω method considering the physical meaning for q criterion is not so clear the ω method is brought up by liu et al 2016 which is presented as the ratio of vorticity square over the sum of vorticity square and deformation square as 4 ω b f 2 a f 2 b f 2 ε 5 ε 0 001 b f 2 a f 2 max a reference range for vortex visualization that is about 0 51 0 6 is provided to insure a local dominance of the vorticity and ε is a small positive number to avoid division by zero and to filter out noise vortices that are of both small vorticity and deformation 2 4 liutex method a new vector quantity named liutex r is proposed by liu et al 2018a to describe the local fluid rotation motion which is computed as 6 r r r 7 r 2 β α if α 2 β 2 0 β 0 2 β α if α 2 β 2 0 β 0 0 if α 2 β 2 0 8 α 1 2 v y u x 2 v x u y 2 9 β 1 2 v x u y in a new xyz frame where the z axis is parallel to the local fluid rotational axis vector r and r represents the rigid rotation strength of local fluid 3 mathematical formulations and numerical method 3 1 governing equations and turbulence model although direct numerical simulation dns can resolve the whole spectrum of turbulent scales its application in high reynolds number flows is limited due to the huge cost of computing resources and time therefore to get a relatively high proportion of resolved eddies with acceptable cpus requirement large eddy simulation les is adopted in the present paper to simulate the tip leakage cavitating flow based on the assumption of homogeneous multiphase flow the fluid components are assumed to share the same velocity field the favre filtered governing equations of continuity and momentum in the cartesian coordinates are as follows 10 ρ m t ρ m u j x j 0 11 ρ m u i t ρ m u i u j x j p x i x j μ m u i x j τ i j x j where overbars denote filtered variables ρ m and μ m are the mixture density and the molecular viscosity which are defined as 12 ρ m 1 α v ρ l α v ρ v 13 μ m 1 α v μ l α v μ v α v is the volume fraction of vapor and τ ij is the subgrid scale sgs stress defined by 14 τ i j ρ m u i u j u i u j the sgs stresses are unknown and require modeling therefore the boussinesq hypothesis is employed to compute sgs stresses with 15 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j in which τ kk is the isotropic part of the sgs stresses and s i j is the strain rate tensor for the resolved scale written as 16 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i the sgs turbulent viscosity μ t is modeled by the wall adapting local eddy viscosity wale model nicoud and ducros 1999 as 17 μ t ρ m l s 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s i j 5 2 s i j d s i j d 5 4 18 l s min κ d c w v 1 3 19 s i j d 1 2 g i j 2 g j i 2 1 3 δ i j g k k 2 g i j u i x j where l s is the mixing length for subgrid scales κ is the von kármán constant d is the distance to the closest wall v is the local cell volume and c w is the wale constant whose default value is 0 325 3 2 cavitation model the vaporization and condensation process of cavitation is governed by the vapor transport equation which is written as 20 ρ v α v t ρ v α v u i x i r e r c where the mass transfer source and sink terms r e and r c related to the growth and collapse of vapor bubbles respectively are modeled by the simplified rayleigh plesset equation the zwart gerber belamri zgb model zwart et al 2004 is used in this study to predict the interphase mass transfer due to cavitation a simplified expression of the rayleigh plesset equation can be obtained by neglecting the second order terms and the surface tension as follows 21 3 2 d r b d t 2 p v p ρ l where r b is the bubble radius p v is the saturation vapor pressure and p represents the local far field pressure the vapor volume fraction can be expressed as 22 α v n 4 3 π r b 3 where n is the bubble number per unit volume therefore the interphase mass transfer rate per unit volume can be written as 23 r 3 α v ρ v r b d r b d t considering the nucleation site density must decrease as the vapor volume fraction increases in the vaporization process the final formulations of the mass transfer terms in the zgb model can be generalized as follows 24 r e f vap 3 α nuc 1 α v ρ v r b 2 3 max p v p 0 ρ l 25 r c f cond 3 α v ρ v r b 2 3 max p p v 0 ρ l where the nucleation site volume fraction α nuc is set to be 5 10 4 the default bubble radius r b is 10 6 m and empirical calibration coefficients named vaporization coefficient f vap is 50 and condensation coefficient f cond is 0 01 respectively as recommended by zwart et al 2004 which have been validated by different kinds of cavitating flows 3 3 numerical schemes in the present investigation simplec is utilized as the pressure velocity coupling method all differential equations are discretized by finite volume method fvm and are solved implicitly a bounded central differencing scheme is chosen for the convection term of the momentum equation which is recognized as an ideal choice for large eddy simulation with fairly low numerical diffusion for the unsteady simulation the time dependent computations are solved by a bounded second order implicit scheme a least squares cell based method is used to compute the gradients and derivatives in the equations first order upwind scheme is used for the volume fraction transport equation 40 iterations per time step are used to balance the accuracy and efficiency the convergence criteria are the absolute residual type with a residual target of 5 10 5 which is sufficient for unsteady flows with cavitation the time step size is 1 10 5s 3 4 numerical setup computational domain and boundary conditions of the simulated tip leakage cavitating flow is depicted in fig 1 which is introduced by a naca0009 hydrofoil with a chord c 100 mm the gap size between the gap wall and the foil tip is 0 1c the simulation is performed at an attack angle α of 10 in which the inlet total pressure is fixed to 153000 pa and the outlet velocity v 10 m s in accordance with the experiment the detailed information of the foil can be found in the reference dreyer et al 2014 and it should be noted that the foil tip is not rounded in the current simulation les coupled with zgb model is employed in the simulation to capture more delicate vortical structures in the cavitating flow it is reported by cheng et al 2020 that the reproducing of tlv cavitation demands sufficiently high resolution in the core of tlv therefore to gain a relatively satisfying computational result a cartesian cut cell grid method that is of good orthogonality high quality and flexibility in local refinement is used and special mesh refinement around tlv is conducted in the present paper three meshes namely mesh 1 3 consisting of about 7 36 million 11 69 million and 15 59 million cells respectively are generated in the present study the three meshes have all been deliberately refined around tip leakage vortex cavitation tlvc and the foil surface with different fineness of resolution as shown in fig 2 a with the refined region around tlvc marked by a white dashed frame inflation layers are generated with 20 nodes in the viscous sublayer outside the hydrofoil and gap wall resolutions on the foil surface and around cavitation regions are all refined as displayed in fig 2 b the refined mesh resolutions around the tlv as well as streamwise and spanwise resolutions on the foil surface are set to be 6 10 4m 5 10 4m and 4 10 4m for mesh 1 3 respectively according to the work of cheng et al 2020 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the numerical results to insure the accuracy of simulation computational results of all meshes are compared in the following context fig 3 shows distributions of dimensionless distance y from the foil surface with mesh 1 mesh 3 which is defined as follows 26 y y p u τ ν where y p is the distance from a certain point p to the nearest wall and u τ is the friction velocity to resolve the boundary layer appropriately it is required that y 1 for les however it is hard to strictly meet this requirement for tip leakage cavitating flow fig 3 gives an indication that all three resolutions can basically meet the requirement in which the maximum of y is below 5 for all three meshes and the value is mostly between 0 1 fig 4 shows the tip vortices captured with mesh 1 3 in non cavitating conditions vortices on the suction side of the foil are omitted so that tip vortices can be easily observed it indicates that mesh 2 and mesh 3 provide more delicate vortical structures with finer grid resolutions as compared to mesh 1 for cavitating results fig 5 further compares instantaneous iso surface of vapor volume fraction α v 0 1 predicted on mesh 1 3 with experimental pictures provided by laboratory for hydraulic machines of epfl the cavitation is reproduced with a reasonable accuracy by all three meshes including tip leakage vortex tlv and tip separation vortex tsv cavities apparently more details in the profile of both tlv and tsv cavities and the merging of them as they develop downstream are captured by finer resolutions the maximum length of tlv cavitation which possesses great relevance with the prediction ability of tlv is better by mesh 2 and 3 however further refinement is unable to improve its length as shown by the results of mesh 2 and 3 considering the major concern of the current paper is characteristics of tip vortices and there will be a sharp rise in the requirement of computational resources for further refinement following discussions will hence be conducted on result of mesh 2 to evaluate the resolution accuracy of large eddy simulation conducted on mesh 2 a parameter qc defined as the ratio between modeled and total turbulent kinetic energy is applied as shown in fig 6 the criterion is proposed by benard et al 2016 which can be written as 27 q c e s g s e s g s e r 0 2 where e r and e sgs are the resolved and the sgs turbulent kinetic energy respectively it is found that distributions of qc around tlv cavitation at different positions are generally below 0 2 which indicates that more than 80 of the total turbulent flow are resolved and that a well resolved les at least in the tlv cavitation region is obtained the kinetic energy spectrum of numerical result of non cavitating case with mesh 2 is shown in fig 7 the one dimensional energy spectrum is computed by integrating the three dimensional energy spectrum in the spherical shell κ κ 1 2 κ 2 2 κ 3 2 in spectral space li and li 2016 a decaying slope is obtained in the energy spectra which is close to the kolmogorov spectral slope 5 3 in the inertial subrange indicating well resolved scales in inertial subrange in the current flow field further comparisons between the experimental result and numerical data obtained with mesh 2 are conducted qualitatively and quantitatively to show how they relate to each other through time averaged flow field fig 8 compares the experimental and numerical time averaged cavitating tlv the predicted results match that of experiments in shape and spatial development for both cloud and tlv cavities the fusing points of tlv and tsv are around x c 0 25 both numerically and experimentally moreover dimensionless pitchwise positions of the tlv core at several positions in the main stream direction ranging in x c from 0 1 to 0 9 are compared in table 1 whose errors are less than 2 5 before x c 0 25 and after x c 0 25 the fusing point table 2 compares the dimensionless diameters of cavitating tlv downstream the fusing point x c 0 25 errors of which are no more than 1 it is indicated that a reasonable accuracy is obtained between the measured and computed tlv for mesh 2 in the present simulation which assures the reliability of following discussions 4 2 spatial evolution of tip vortices fig 9 shows instantaneous vortical structures at a typical instant with the iso surface of ω method ω 0 57 ε 0 001 b a max in two different perspectives colored by streamwise vorticity ω x the ω method illustrates the existence of complicated vortices including tlv tsv and secondary vortices in the gap region as well as wake vortices downstream the foil scale and appearance of tip vortices vary dramatically in the streamwise direction whose evolution can be divided into three stages at different spatial locations in stage i tlv and tsv originate from suction side and tip of the hydrofoil respectively and develop independently to the downstream of leading edge the formation of tlv and tsv is mainly driven by the pressure gradient between suction side and pressure side of the hydrofoil across the gap region there is a strong flow separation at the foil tip to form tsv and the tsv continues to develop to the suction side of the foil under pressure gradients in stage ii tlv and tsv move closer and start to twist together with increasing radius as they merge with each other as a consequence vorticity of opposite sign generates in the boundary layer of the gapwall and together with wake vortices attracted by the merging tlv and tsv to roll up around them in stage iii the vortices interact with each other while developing continuing to expand their radiuses and dissipate due to instability of vortex pairs as they go downstream generally speaking our numerical results show a reasonable prediction on the complex vortex structure evolution 4 3 comparison of vortex identification methods on tip vortices in this section to compare the applicability of different vortex identification methods in the tip leakage cavitating flow spatial evolution of tip vortices are discussed in detail with vorticity q criterion the ω method and the liutex method respectively in order to characterize the three dimensional tip vortices evolution in the space fig 11 13 present four representative locations along tlv as shown in fig 10 which are abstracted to show detail topological features of the vortices in the tip leakage cavitating flow with streamwise vorticity q criterion ω method and liutex method separately the locations x c 0 3 x c 0 9 x c 1 7 and x c 2 3 are in stage i stage ii forepart and rear of stage iii respectively which can generally illustrate the spatial evolution of vortices fig 11 compares topologies of tlv tsv and vortices around the sheet cavities in stage i which have all been basically captured by the aforementioned methods it can be found in fig 11 a that the rotating direction of tlv and tsv is opposite to the mainstream direction the distribution areas of tlv and tsv displayed by streamwise vorticity in fig 11 a are slightly bigger than that of the other methods in fig 11 b d resulting in an obvious connection area between tlv and tsv the connection is evidenced to be a shear flow rather than vortex rotation characterized by negative value of q criterion in fig 11 b moreover boundary layer over the gap wall is also taken for vortex by streamwise vorticity vortices in stage i identified by the ω method and the liutex method are similar to each other in fig 11 c d for the reason that difference between the strengths of the vortices in the inception period is small tlv and tsv move closer and eventually fuse together in stage ii as illustrated by fig 12 showing a single negative sign vortex in fig 12 a by streamwise vorticity the shear layer revealed by q criterion which exists around the tlv due to its induced velocity field grows larger as the strength and size of tlv increase as a consequence the induced secondary vortices originated from the gap wall of positive vorticity x component and wake vortices shedding off the foil are transported and entrained by the induced velocity field on one hand and strongly interact with each other as they develop downstream due to instability of vortex pairs on the other hand it is worth mentioning that because a proper threshold value of q criterion is difficult to determine and of little physical meaning the strength of tlv core in fig 12 b seems to be overestimated while the topology captured by ω method and liutex method is more accurate this phenomenon has been described by cheng et al 2020 that there exists a reduction of strength in the core of tlv which can be explained with the effect of dilatation term in vorticity transport equation different to the situation in stage i distinction between vortical structures identified by the ω method and the liutex method are observed in fig 12 c d as ω is a dimensionless parameter both strong and weak vortices are visualized to have the same value however wake vortices and the secondary vortices are found to be weaker than tlv by the liutex method which can show the absolute strength of vortices the evolution features of tip vortices in stage iii are shown in fig 13 with sections of x c 1 7 and x c 2 3 located at its forepart and rear respectively the visualization in fig 13 exhibits a strong tendency of decline of tlv characterized by reduction in the scale and strength of it as well as a shrinkage of the free shear layer induced by tlv in the meanwhile as tlv the induced secondary vortices and wake vortices interact and fuse with each other it becomes hard to distinguish them from each other at x c 2 3 with similar topologies of vortices shown by all four methods in fig 13 a d in addition it is found that distribution of the vortex cluster expands to the whole section gradually which can be attributed to the vorticity diffusion and cancellation by viscous effect therefore given that the large scale free shear layer exists until tlv is greatly weakened at the rear of stage iii it is supposed that the free shear layer around tlv plays a more important role in the evolution of tlv cavitation as compared with cloud cavitation global features of tip vortices over the whole length of tlv at a typical instant are identified by iso surfaces of vorticity q criterion the ω method and the liutex method as shown in fig 14 generally characteristic vortices and three stages evolution process of them in the current flow regime can be identified by the iso surfaces of all four methods however discrepancies exist in the ability of filtering out the shear layer over solid boundaries where there is great velocity gradient due to viscous effect as shown by the iso surface of vorticity ω 1500 in fig 14 a tip vortices as well as vortices on the foil suction side are contaminated by a large distinct region as compared to the other methods which corresponds to boundary layers around gap wall and the foil however the boundary layers are not supposed to be displayed as vortices moreover borders of tlv and the induced secondary vortices are vague connecting with the visible boundary layers which are clearer visualized by ω method and liutex method noise structures introduced by the geometry model and shearing motion of the fluid are also found in fig 14 b by q criterion it is observed that although q criterion can filter out a large proportion of shear layer there are still some unexpected structures close to the foil and gap wall which are marked boundary layer in fig 14 b these structures are mainly introduced by shearing flow over the wall and around the hydrofoil surface tlv in the middle of rotating vortex clusters characterized by negative vorticity x component is identified better with ω method and liutex method in fig 14 c d with its extent longer and structures of wake vortices are more complete for the ω method and the liutex method in general all vortex identification methods are able to capture tlv tsv the induced secondary vortices and wake vortices shedding off the foil discrepancies firstly exist in the ability of avoiding unexpected boundary layers over solid walls between three generations of vortex identification methods among which the first and the second generations are the worst i e vorticity method and q criterion secondly the determination of a proper threshold for q criterion is subjective and arbitrary liu et al 2018a which may bring fake breakdown of vortices with an excessively big value and appearing of boundary layers with too small one the suggested threshold ω 0 52 for the ω method is reliable to present vortex for different cases liu et al 2019 and the case investigated in the present paper as well which indicates robustness of the ω method in threshold change liutex is a mathematical definition of the rigid rotational part of fluid motion which means the magnitude selected to show vortical structures represents the absolute strength of tlv it is observed that ω method and liutex method both show good performance in visualizing all types of vortices in figs 11 14 demonstrating the superiority of them in the investigation of tip leakage cavitating flow thirdly the ω method as a dimensionless parameter may visualize vortices of different strengths with the same magnitude of ω which makes it unable to identify the variations in the tlv strength during its evolution however liutex method can tell the strength of vortices by the magnitude of r which is the pure rigid body rotation of fluid element so that all vortical structures of distinct intensity are captured by contours with suitable range which fulfills the goals of filtering shear layers and identifying variations in tlv strength during its evolution therefore liutex method appeared to be a more adaptable criterion for the tip leakage cavitating flow among all four methods studied here which can largely improve the precision of vortex identification and further facilitate the investigation of tlv cavitating flow 5 conclusions in good agreement with the referenced experiment provided by laboratory for hydraulic machines of epfl the tip leakage flow introduced by a straight naca0009 hydrofoil is simulated successfully by les and zgb cavitation model the obtained results have been validated carefully and proved to be well resolved by les furthermore we have illustrated the evolution process of tip vortices in the space and investigated detail vortical topologies in different developing stages with three generations of vortex visualization methods respectively the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the simulation conducted in the present paper reproduces the tlv cavitation successfully as compared with experimental data the eddies of different scales in the inertial subrange are well resolved by les method indicated by the classical 5 3 scaling law 2 characteristic vortices in tip leakage vortex cavitating flow are captured and visualized including tlv tsv the induced secondary vortices and wake vortices shedding off the foil the spatial evolution of vortical structures can be divided into three stages including origination and development of tlv and tsv separately in stage i merging of tlv and tsv together with entrainment of the induced secondary vortices and wake vortices in stage ii diffusion and dissipation of the vortices in stage iii the evolution of vortex structures are captured quite well 3 discussion of detail vortical topologies in different stages through vortex identification methods of three generations including vorticity method q criterion ω method and liutex method are conducted an intense free shear layer is revealed around tlv by q criterion which continues weakening itself until its intensity is largely reduced the vorticity method is found to possess a poor ability in filtering boundary layer followed by q criterion while ω method and liutex method can identify all kinds of vortices in the current flow regime without shear layer advantages are found in ω method and liutex method however ω method may identify both weak and strong vortices under the same value while the magnitude of liutex method can tell the rotating strength of a vortex therefore liutex method appeared to be a more adaptable criterion for tlv cavitating flow which can largely improve the precision of vortex identification and further facilitate the investigation of tlv cavitating flow credit authorship contribution statement xiaorui bai software validation

21844,the growth of offshore marine aquaculture requires improvements in the engineering and materials used for cage netting in order to better withstand wave forces to clarify the hydrodynamic characteristics of knotless polyethylene pe and chain link wire netting panels in non uniform currents we measured the wave forces acting on netting panels with varying solidity ratios and other parameters under regular wave conditions in a wave tank the drag and added mass coefficients c d c m were obtained using the morison equation and the behavioral trends in c d and c m for the netting panels were determined based on the reynolds number r e and the keulegan carpenter kc number the experimentally derived coefficients were then incorporated into numerical simulations with the same conditions and then were used to model the dynamic behavior of the netting panels the normal c d of pe netting was similar to that in a uniform current and was positively associated with the solidity ratio decreasing as r e increased when the kc number was 30 the normal c m of both the pe and chain link wire netting remained unchanged averaging 4 3 and 2 8 respectively large differences in displacement were observed for varying values of c d suggesting that the effects of marine fouling should be considered during the design stage overall these results provide a basis for further research toward a comprehensive hydrodynamic model for netting panels that can inform improved engineering for modern aquaculture keywords wave force knotless polyethylene netting panel chain link wire netting panels drag coefficients added mass coefficients 1 introduction net cages are an important infrastructure component in the marine aquaculture industry their ability to withstand the combined effects of currents waves and other hydrologic factors at sea is closely related to their productive efficiency and safety performance the development of optimum designs for open sea net cages that can withstand harsh ocean conditions is increasingly important as offshore cage based aquaculture continues to expand due to rising near shore water pollution as netting panels are a major component of these cages investigating their hydrodynamic characteristics provides an essential basis for improving net cage designs the most widely used netting panels are made of highly flexible fiber materials and can be greatly deformed under marine conditions meanwhile copper alloy and wire netting are increasingly used to reduce deformation tsukrov et al 2011a b drach et al 2016 cha and lee 2018 qu et al 2019 abundant modeling experiments and numerical simulations have assessed the hydrodynamic characteristics of different flexible fabric netting panels under uniform currents matsuda 2001 takagi et al 2002 tsukrov et al 2003 balash et al 2009 dong et al 2016 tang et al 2017 in general the hydrodynamic characteristics of netting panels are affected by current speed solidity ratio netting material knot type mesh shape and mesh structure tsukrov et al 2011a b o neill and summerbell 2017 several studies have analyzed the characteristics of flexible fiber netting under non uniform current conditions miyazaki 1964 measured the netting vibration period by exposing knotted polyvinyl netting to oscillating motions in still water proposing that as the reynolds number increased the added mass became considerably large song et al 2006 examined horizontal wave forces on flexible netting panels and proposed an empirical formula lader et al 2007 carried out extensive wave tank experiments on wave forces acting on netting panels with three different solidities and concluded that the mass force had a conspicuous effect on the total force and should be included in wave force models zhao et al 2008 performed experimental and numerical research on drag and mass forces acting on two knotted polyethylene netting panels showing that their mass force was very small under wave conditions of 0 714 hz and that inertial forces could be ignored in numerical simulations liu et al 2012 investigated the hydrodynamic loads on a nylon netting panel oscillating in a water tank and constructed a dynamic model concluding that varying values for the drag and inertial coefficients can cause significant differences in the results chen and christensen 2016 proposed a new numerical approach to simulate flow through and around netting panels and examined its accuracy in steady flow and wave conditions showing that the numerical model could accurately reproduce the experiments to our knowledge only a few studies have assessed the hydrodynamic characteristics of copper alloy netting panels for example tsukrov et al 2011a b and cha et al 2013 investigated the drag coefficients of copper alloy nets under a steady current showing that copper nets exhibited lower drag forces than nylon nets in addition dong et al 2019 conducted an experimental study of nylon and steel netting panels in a wave flume and developed a wave force model to predict the forces acting on the panels however there are relatively few studies on the hydrodynamic characteristics of knotless polyethylene and chain link wire netting especially under wave conditions therefore in this study we carried out a series of wave tank experiments to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients for knotless polyethylene and chain link wire netting panels with different solidities when subjected to varied regular wave conditions we then performed numerical simulations using the experimental data in order to predict the dynamic behavior of biofouled netting panels with differing assumed drag coefficients in waves 2 materials and methods all laboratory experiments were carried out in a wave tank at the national research institute of fisheries engineering japan fisheries research and education agency ibaraki japan 2 1 experiments 2 1 1 setup the wave tank was 143 0 m long and 6 0 m wide with a water depth h of 3 0 m fig 1 to improve measurement accuracy the same streamlined frame as was used in the uniform current flow test was chosen the square frame was assembled with four streamlined struts dong et al 2016 after the four sides of the netting 50 50 cm were fixed to the streamlined frame it was attached to a six component force measuring device fm 6h50s izumisokki co ltd japan and set perpendicular to incoming waves fully submerged beneath the surface to avoid the influence of the wave gauge on incoming waves as much as possible a non contact type wave gauge nws630 denshikogyo co ltd japan was located 1 32 m in the front left of the netting panel to record and measure the wave height at the same time the wave forces acting on the netting panels were measured by a six component force measuring device fig 2 shows a photograph taken during the experiment the wave force and height data were collected at a sampling frequency of 20 hz over a measuring time of 120 200 s the measured analog signals of the wave force and height were transformed to digital signals using an a d converter then transferred to a personal computer after each test run a waiting time of 30 min allowed the wave fluctuations from the experiment to disperse all data were analyzed using time series data the water temperature was kept at 15 18 c during the experiment the wave force acting on the streamlined frame was measured before the hydrodynamic force acting on the netting panel so the wave force of the netting panel could be obtained by subtracting the wave force of the streamline frame from the previously measured total wave force 2 1 2 netting panels we tested five knotless polyethylene netting panels hereafter referred to as pe netting and two zinc plated chain link woven wire netting panels jis g 3552 hereafter referred to as chain link wire netting all with different twine diameters bar lengths and solidity ratios table 1 in japan both types fig 3 have been used in aquaculture net cages for japanese amberjack seriola quinqueradiata red sea bream pagrus major and pacific bluefin tuna thunnus orientalis the bar diameter d and length l were the mean values of 10 random locations measured using an abs digimatic indicator standard type 547 301 mitutoyo co japan and digital calipers super caliper 500 774 mitutoyo co japan under wet conditions after the netting panels had been fixed to the frame 2 1 3 wave conditions the netting panels were exposed to three different wave case groups table 2 each of which used the same wave period range t but different length l and height h ranges the wave length was obtained using the linear wave theory nakamura 1979 the wave steepness was determined using the ratio of wave height to length h l 2 1 4 data analysis before data processing we conducted a linearity test of the steepest wave h l of 2 40 the linearity was very obvious fig 4 providing clear support for directly using all measured wave elevation time series in the post processing of our measurement results data collection began at the same time as the wave maker started after continuous acquisition for 60s 70s the data collection ended and the wave maker was stopped in the experiments we observed that some of the vertical wave force results showed visible variations in calm water which we believe caused the instability of the voltage transmission signal path in the vertical direction in contrast the voltage signal in the horizontal direction was quite stable further we considered the horizontal force on the netting panel as the major force from the two directions first the horizontal velocity of the water particles was always normal to the netting panel and the velocity in the vertical direction was tangential to the netting panel second the vertical alignment of the netting twines affected the change in vertical flow velocity dong et al 2019 lader et al 2007 also reported that the vertical force is much smaller as compared to the horizontal force therefore only the latter was considered further an example of the horizontal wave force measured is represented in fig 5 the noise could be eliminated by a band pass filter in addition we have selected the data from the relative stability period 50 60 s for analysis considering the measured wave force had a certain variation the horizontal wave force df acting per unit area of the netting panel is given by the morison equation 1 d f d f d d f i 1 2 c d ρ α u u d y d z c m 1 ρ l d α d u d t d y d z where f d is the drag force f i is the mass force c d is the drag coefficient c m is the added mass coefficient ρ is the density of the fluid dydz is the unit area of netting panel u is the velocity of water particles and l d is the thickness of the netting panel the parameters v l d and α in eq 1 can be obtained by 2 v s α d π d 2 4 s π α d 4 3 l d v s α 4 α d 2 l d l 2 s i n 2 β where v is the netting panel volume d is the twine diameter l is the bar length s is the outline area of the netting panel α is the solidity ratio defined as the ratio of projected area to the outline area of the netting panel and the half mesh angle β in eq 4 was 45 for the diamond mesh shape used in this study due to wave to force nonlinearities the least squares method refer to appendix a was used to obtain the drag coefficient c d and the added mass coefficient c m from the time series data of the wave force on the netting panels zhao et al 2008 fu et al 2013 2 2 numerical simulation we used a mass spring model lee et al 2008 to model the netting panel the finite element and lumped mass methods were combined and applied to the netting panel structure tsukrov et al 2003 the standard dynamic equilibrium equation was thus written as 5 m d k d r f w where d is the vector of nodal displacements m is the time independent diagonal mass matrix k is the global stiffness matrix r is the equivalent nodal force vector due to gravity and buoyancy forces and f w is the equivalent nodal force vector due to relative fluid motion here f w is the wave force acting on each element which can be written as follows 6 f w 1 2 c d ρ d u d u d l c m 1 ρ π d 2 4 u d l where d is the twine diameter l is the bar length d and d refer to the velocity and acceleration of the element and u and u are the velocity and acceleration of water particles respectively the

house program code was written using the matlab software which was then used for finite element modeling and simulation 3 results 3 1 drag coefficient cd for netting panel the flow through the netting panels can be considered comparable to flow through channels in which the reynolds number re takes the hydraulic mean depth he s 1 α 4l as the characteristic length miyazaki and takahashi 1964 9 r e u m h e v where u m is the maximum velocity of water particles and υ ιs the dynamic viscosity of water in the context of netting studies twine diameter can be used as the characteristic length the drag coefficient c d for both pe and chain link wire netting generally decreased when r e increased fig 6 for example the c d of the pe netting panel with the lowest solidity declined to a stable value between 1 3 and 1 5 at larger r e numbers in addition netting panels with higher solidity ratios had higher drag coefficients 3 2 added mass coefficient cm for netting panel the key non dimensional keulegan carpenter kc number used to describe the variation in the added mass coefficient of objects in non uniform currents sarpkaya and isaacsson 1981 okajima et al 1997 fu et al 1989 is given by 10 k c u m t h e the added mass coefficient c m of the pe netting increased as the kc number increased when the latter was 30 remained steady at a kc number of 30 40 and reached 4 3 at the largest kc number 130 fig 7 a c m was not observably dependent on the solidity ratio the c m for the chain link wire netting followed a similar trend with a c m of 2 7 at a kc number 30 fig 7b 3 3 numerical simulation results the experimentally derived c d and c m were incorporated into numerical simulations under the same wave conditions and select horizontal wave force time histories fig 8 the horizontal wave force amplitude for both the pe and chain link wire netting increased with increasing netting solidity similar to results reported by lader et al 2007 and dong et al 2019 in addition wave height had a positive effect on the wave force acting on the netting panels 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of cd for netting panels in wave and uniform current conditions in a previous study dong et al 2016 we performed a series of experiments under uniform current conditions using the same netting panels and proposed empirical formulas for predicting the effects of solidity ratio attack angle and reynolds number on hydrodynamic coefficients for comparative purposes we plotted those results along with the current study s findings under wave conditions fig 9 for the pe netting under wave conditions fig 9a the changes in c d were relatively scattered but the c d decreased as rm increased similar to uniform current flow and other previously published results kumazawa et al 2012 we mainly consider the following two reasons for the data scatter first a small amount of deformation was observed in the experiment and second the interaction between the netting panels and the frame both of which may have been the reason for the scattered results of the experiment in addition c d was primarily distributed around the curve drawn according to the empirical formula for uniform current flow the relative error between the measured and calculated c d ranged from 1 07 to 32 03 average 8 78 hence the drag coefficient value for pe netting under wave conditions was similar to that in a uniform current as also shown by fu et al 1989 and liu et al 2012 for the chain link wire netting fig 9b calculated values were obtained using an empirical formula c d 15αr d 0 09 r d based on twine diameter deduced from uniform current flow the relationship between c d and r d was generally similar except when r d was 200 this will be investigated in future research 4 2 effect of netting material on hydrodynamic characteristics the pe netting had larger c d values than the chain link wire netting fig 10 a the average value of the latter was 81 that of the former similar to results under uniform current conditions reported by dong et al 2016 moreover for the same solidity ratio tsukrov et al 2011a b reported that the drag coefficient for nylon netting was approximately twice that of the chain link wire netting kumazawa et al 2012 reported that c d decreased from polyvinyl alcohol pva minnow netting polyamide pa minnow netting high strength polyethylene dyneema minnow netting the chain link wire netting also had consistently lower c m values fig 10b which can be attributed to the wettability and absorptivity of different materials in water drag coefficients can be expected to be smaller for materials with lower absorptivity or wettability as this easily leads to boundary layer flow separation the reasons behind this interesting result will be further explored using computational fluid dynamics methods cfd or particle image velocimetry piv experiments in the future following the work of cha et al 2013 and chen and christensen 2016 4 3 effect of various cd values on the dynamic response of netting panels to validate the numerical simulation model proposed in this study we compared the horizontal wave forces determined from the numerical results and experimental data taking experimental data every 0 2 s for a clear comparison fig 11 the relative error is given by r f s f e f e where f s and f e are the average values of the maximum amplitudes of the horizontal wave forces obtained from the numerical simulations and experimental measurements for the average values of the maximum amplitudes of the horizontal wave forces the relative error of the pe and chain link netting ranged from 5 0 to 37 1 and 1 9 27 3 respectively and the mean relative errors were 16 2 and 16 5 respectively for both the pe and chain link netting the simulated wave force histories generally agreed well with the measured data under the same wave conditions demonstrating that the c d and c m values obtained from the experimental data were reasonable and could be applied to numerical simulation models at open ocean aquaculture sites netting panels are often covered with marine fouling this may cause the operational hydrodynamic forces and weight to differ from design parameters affecting net cage behavior in waves and currents researchers have recently begun to consider the drag coefficient of biofouled netting in the laboratory and in the field consistently finding that drag coefficients were larger than for clean netting yamaguchi and nishinokubi 1998 swift et al 2006 gansel et al 2015 balash et al 2009 by varying the drag coefficient we simulated the dynamic response of netting panel no 3 in wave conditions using the above numerical model in this numerical simulation we fixed only the top of the netting and measured the horizontal displacement of the center position at the bottom of the netting the change in drag coefficient clearly affected the horizontal displacement of the netting panel fig 12 4 4 the effect of experimental frame on results in our previous research dong et al 2016 we found that a streamlined frame can effectively reduce the water flow disturbance the drag force of frame only to total drag force was very small only accounting for approximately 7 of the total drag force in this study to ensure the reliability of our data the effect of the streamlined frame on the wave force under wave conditions was evaluated it was found to be suitable for experimentation examples for the wave force acting on a streamlined frame with and without netting is shown in fig 13 the ratios of the wave force acting on only the frame to the total wave force acting on the netting panel as well as frame range from 0 05 to 0 11 under the current wave cases this indicates that the streamlined frame has little effect on the experimental results in this study therefore it is acceptable to neglect the force introduced by the interaction of the netting panels and the framework 4 5 suggested improvements to wave force models a consistent element model containing the mass force was proposed by tsukrov et al 2003 using a drag coefficient defined by the reynolds number for towed cables choo and casarella 1971 and the added mass coefficient 1 0 for a cylinder sarpkaya and isaacsson 1981 their results showed that the drag coefficient values of netting panels were different from those of cables and depended on the netting material in addition the added mass coefficient of netting panels in regular wave conditions was considerably larger than the cylinder value possibly because netting panels are easily deformed and their volume can increase due to absorption of water by the fiber this suggests that the drag coefficient and added mass coefficient of netting panels could be used to adjust tsukrov s model improving the performance of wave force predictions 5 conclusions we tested regular wave forces on five polyethylene and two chain link wire netting panels with different characteristics and solidity ratios using the resulting experimental data to investigate the dynamic response of netting panels under wave conditions with the following results 1 the patterns of the c d values for both pe and chain link netting in wave conditions were consistent with those of netting panels in uniform current flow conditions 2 the c m of both pe and chain link netting remained essentially unchanged when the kc number was 30 the average c m for the pe netting was 4 3 and was 2 8 for the chain link netting 3 different drag coefficients clearly affected the dynamic responses of the netting panels suggesting that marine biofouling effects should be considered in the design stage when investigating the hydrodynamic coefficients of netting panels the solidity ratio should be taken into consideration along with water conditions netting material mesh structure and the elasticity and roughness of the netting twine however the range of wave conditions used in this study was relatively small therefore further research should be conducted over a wider range of conditions also further research should assess the hydrodynamic characteristics of netting in additional flow conditions such as the effects of the drag coefficient and added mass coefficient in irregular waves reciprocating oscillation flow and combined wave current flow such research would allow a comprehensive

21844,the growth of offshore marine aquaculture requires improvements in the engineering and materials used for cage netting in order to better withstand wave forces to clarify the hydrodynamic characteristics of knotless polyethylene pe and chain link wire netting panels in non uniform currents we measured the wave forces acting on netting panels with varying solidity ratios and other parameters under regular wave conditions in a wave tank the drag and added mass coefficients c d c m were obtained using the morison equation and the behavioral trends in c d and c m for the netting panels were determined based on the reynolds number r e and the keulegan carpenter kc number the experimentally derived coefficients were then incorporated into numerical simulations with the same conditions and then were used to model the dynamic behavior of the netting panels the normal c d of pe netting was similar to that in a uniform current and was positively associated with the solidity ratio decreasing as r e increased when the kc number was 30 the normal c m of both the pe and chain link wire netting remained unchanged averaging 4 3 and 2 8 respectively large differences in displacement were observed for varying values of c d suggesting that the effects of marine fouling should be considered during the design stage overall these results provide a basis for further research toward a comprehensive hydrodynamic model for netting panels that can inform improved engineering for modern aquaculture keywords wave force knotless polyethylene netting panel chain link wire netting panels drag coefficients added mass coefficients 1 introduction net cages are an important infrastructure component in the marine aquaculture industry their ability to withstand the combined effects of currents waves and other hydrologic factors at sea is closely related to their productive efficiency and safety performance the development of optimum designs for open sea net cages that can withstand harsh ocean conditions is increasingly important as offshore cage based aquaculture continues to expand due to rising near shore water pollution as netting panels are a major component of these cages investigating their hydrodynamic characteristics provides an essential basis for improving net cage designs the most widely used netting panels are made of highly flexible fiber materials and can be greatly deformed under marine conditions meanwhile copper alloy and wire netting are increasingly used to reduce deformation tsukrov et al 2011a b drach et al 2016 cha and lee 2018 qu et al 2019 abundant modeling experiments and numerical simulations have assessed the hydrodynamic characteristics of different flexible fabric netting panels under uniform currents matsuda 2001 takagi et al 2002 tsukrov et al 2003 balash et al 2009 dong et al 2016 tang et al 2017 in general the hydrodynamic characteristics of netting panels are affected by current speed solidity ratio netting material knot type mesh shape and mesh structure tsukrov et al 2011a b o neill and summerbell 2017 several studies have analyzed the characteristics of flexible fiber netting under non uniform current conditions miyazaki 1964 measured the netting vibration period by exposing knotted polyvinyl netting to oscillating motions in still water proposing that as the reynolds number increased the added mass became considerably large song et al 2006 examined horizontal wave forces on flexible netting panels and proposed an empirical formula lader et al 2007 carried out extensive wave tank experiments on wave forces acting on netting panels with three different solidities and concluded that the mass force had a conspicuous effect on the total force and should be included in wave force models zhao et al 2008 performed experimental and numerical research on drag and mass forces acting on two knotted polyethylene netting panels showing that their mass force was very small under wave conditions of 0 714 hz and that inertial forces could be ignored in numerical simulations liu et al 2012 investigated the hydrodynamic loads on a nylon netting panel oscillating in a water tank and constructed a dynamic model concluding that varying values for the drag and inertial coefficients can cause significant differences in the results chen and christensen 2016 proposed a new numerical approach to simulate flow through and around netting panels and examined its accuracy in steady flow and wave conditions showing that the numerical model could accurately reproduce the experiments to our knowledge only a few studies have assessed the hydrodynamic characteristics of copper alloy netting panels for example tsukrov et al 2011a b and cha et al 2013 investigated the drag coefficients of copper alloy nets under a steady current showing that copper nets exhibited lower drag forces than nylon nets in addition dong et al 2019 conducted an experimental study of nylon and steel netting panels in a wave flume and developed a wave force model to predict the forces acting on the panels however there are relatively few studies on the hydrodynamic characteristics of knotless polyethylene and chain link wire netting especially under wave conditions therefore in this study we carried out a series of wave tank experiments to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients for knotless polyethylene and chain link wire netting panels with different solidities when subjected to varied regular wave conditions we then performed numerical simulations using the experimental data in order to predict the dynamic behavior of biofouled netting panels with differing assumed drag coefficients in waves 2 materials and methods all laboratory experiments were carried out in a wave tank at the national research institute of fisheries engineering japan fisheries research and education agency ibaraki japan 2 1 experiments 2 1 1 setup the wave tank was 143 0 m long and 6 0 m wide with a water depth h of 3 0 m fig 1 to improve measurement accuracy the same streamlined frame as was used in the uniform current flow test was chosen the square frame was assembled with four streamlined struts dong et al 2016 after the four sides of the netting 50 50 cm were fixed to the streamlined frame it was attached to a six component force measuring device fm 6h50s izumisokki co ltd japan and set perpendicular to incoming waves fully submerged beneath the surface to avoid the influence of the wave gauge on incoming waves as much as possible a non contact type wave gauge nws630 denshikogyo co ltd japan was located 1 32 m in the front left of the netting panel to record and measure the wave height at the same time the wave forces acting on the netting panels were measured by a six component force measuring device fig 2 shows a photograph taken during the experiment the wave force and height data were collected at a sampling frequency of 20 hz over a measuring time of 120 200 s the measured analog signals of the wave force and height were transformed to digital signals using an a d converter then transferred to a personal computer after each test run a waiting time of 30 min allowed the wave fluctuations from the experiment to disperse all data were analyzed using time series data the water temperature was kept at 15 18 c during the experiment the wave force acting on the streamlined frame was measured before the hydrodynamic force acting on the netting panel so the wave force of the netting panel could be obtained by subtracting the wave force of the streamline frame from the previously measured total wave force 2 1 2 netting panels we tested five knotless polyethylene netting panels hereafter referred to as pe netting and two zinc plated chain link woven wire netting panels jis g 3552 hereafter referred to as chain link wire netting all with different twine diameters bar lengths and solidity ratios table 1 in japan both types fig 3 have been used in aquaculture net cages for japanese amberjack seriola quinqueradiata red sea bream pagrus major and pacific bluefin tuna thunnus orientalis the bar diameter d and length l were the mean values of 10 random locations measured using an abs digimatic indicator standard type 547 301 mitutoyo co japan and digital calipers super caliper 500 774 mitutoyo co japan under wet conditions after the netting panels had been fixed to the frame 2 1 3 wave conditions the netting panels were exposed to three different wave case groups table 2 each of which used the same wave period range t but different length l and height h ranges the wave length was obtained using the linear wave theory nakamura 1979 the wave steepness was determined using the ratio of wave height to length h l 2 1 4 data analysis before data processing we conducted a linearity test of the steepest wave h l of 2 40 the linearity was very obvious fig 4 providing clear support for directly using all measured wave elevation time series in the post processing of our measurement results data collection began at the same time as the wave maker started after continuous acquisition for 60s 70s the data collection ended and the wave maker was stopped in the experiments we observed that some of the vertical wave force results showed visible variations in calm water which we believe caused the instability of the voltage transmission signal path in the vertical direction in contrast the voltage signal in the horizontal direction was quite stable further we considered the horizontal force on the netting panel as the major force from the two directions first the horizontal velocity of the water particles was always normal to the netting panel and the velocity in the vertical direction was tangential to the netting panel second the vertical alignment of the netting twines affected the change in vertical flow velocity dong et al 2019 lader et al 2007 also reported that the vertical force is much smaller as compared to the horizontal force therefore only the latter was considered further an example of the horizontal wave force measured is represented in fig 5 the noise could be eliminated by a band pass filter in addition we have selected the data from the relative stability period 50 60 s for analysis considering the measured wave force had a certain variation the horizontal wave force df acting per unit area of the netting panel is given by the morison equation 1 d f d f d d f i 1 2 c d ρ α u u d y d z c m 1 ρ l d α d u d t d y d z where f d is the drag force f i is the mass force c d is the drag coefficient c m is the added mass coefficient ρ is the density of the fluid dydz is the unit area of netting panel u is the velocity of water particles and l d is the thickness of the netting panel the parameters v l d and α in eq 1 can be obtained by 2 v s α d π d 2 4 s π α d 4 3 l d v s α 4 α d 2 l d l 2 s i n 2 β where v is the netting panel volume d is the twine diameter l is the bar length s is the outline area of the netting panel α is the solidity ratio defined as the ratio of projected area to the outline area of the netting panel and the half mesh angle β in eq 4 was 45 for the diamond mesh shape used in this study due to wave to force nonlinearities the least squares method refer to appendix a was used to obtain the drag coefficient c d and the added mass coefficient c m from the time series data of the wave force on the netting panels zhao et al 2008 fu et al 2013 2 2 numerical simulation we used a mass spring model lee et al 2008 to model the netting panel the finite element and lumped mass methods were combined and applied to the netting panel structure tsukrov et al 2003 the standard dynamic equilibrium equation was thus written as 5 m d k d r f w where d is the vector of nodal displacements m is the time independent diagonal mass matrix k is the global stiffness matrix r is the equivalent nodal force vector due to gravity and buoyancy forces and f w is the equivalent nodal force vector due to relative fluid motion here f w is the wave force acting on each element which can be written as follows 6 f w 1 2 c d ρ d u d u d l c m 1 ρ π d 2 4 u d l where d is the twine diameter l is the bar length d and d refer to the velocity and acceleration of the element and u and u are the velocity and acceleration of water particles respectively the regular wave fields were simulated according to the airy wave theory the horizontal and vertical velocities of a water particle are 7 u h h ω 2 cosh k z h sinh k h cos k x ω t 8 u v h ω 2 sinh k z h sinh k h sin k x ω t where h is the wave height h is the water depth k is the wave number and ω is the circular frequency equation 5 was solved using newmark methods to integrate the equation an in house program code was written using the matlab software which was then used for finite element modeling and simulation 3 results 3 1 drag coefficient cd for netting panel the flow through the netting

coefficient c d for both pe and chain link wire netting generally decreased when r e increased fig 6 for example the c d of the pe netting panel with the lowest solidity declined to a stable value between 1 3 and 1 5 at larger r e numbers in addition netting panels with higher solidity ratios had higher drag coefficients 3 2 added mass coefficient cm for netting panel the key non dimensional

simulation results the experimentally derived c d and c m were incorporated into numerical simulations under the same wave conditions and select horizontal wave force time histories fig 8 the horizontal wave force amplitude for both the pe and chain link wire netting increased with increasing netting solidity similar to results reported by lader et al 2007 and dong et al 2019 in addition wave height had a positive effect on the wave force acting on the netting panels 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of cd for netting panels in wave and uniform current conditions in a previous study dong et al 2016 we performed a series of experiments under uniform current conditions using the same netting panels and proposed empirical formulas for predicting the effects of solidity ratio attack angle and reynolds number on hydrodynamic coefficients for comparative purposes we plotted those results along with the current study s findings under wave conditions fig 9 for the pe netting under wave conditions fig 9a the changes in c d were relatively scattered but the c d decreased as rm increased similar to uniform current flow and other previously published results kumazawa et al 2012 we mainly consider the following two reasons for the data scatter first a small amount of deformation was observed in the experiment and second the interaction between the netting panels and the frame

netting the chain link wire netting also had consistently lower c m values fig 10b which can be attributed to the wettability and absorptivity of different materials in water drag coefficients can be expected to be smaller for materials with lower absorptivity or wettability as this easily leads to boundary layer flow separation the reasons behind this interesting result will be further explored

wave force based on the morison equation 2 f 1 2 c d ρ α u u s c m 1 ρ l d α u s where c d is the drag coefficient c m is the added mass coefficient ρ is the density of the fluid u is the velocity of water particles l d is the thickness of the netting panel s is the outline area of the netting panel and α is the solidity ratio squaring the equations on both sides e r 2 f m 2 c d ρ α s f m u u 2 c

to the least squares method if the following two equations are satisfied the error e r should be the minimum value 5 e r 2 c d ρ α s a 2 1 2 ρ 2 α 2 c d s 2 a 4 ρ 2 α 2 c m 1 s 2 l d a 5 0 6 e r 2 c m
