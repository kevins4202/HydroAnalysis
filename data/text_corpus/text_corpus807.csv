4035,the northeastern tibetan plateau netp represents the growth front of the tibetan plateau tp system this region has long been recognized as a key in understanding the topographic response and crustal thickening of the entire tp a heat flow anomaly gonghe basin 102 mw m2 was found in the netp however the heat generation mechanism and the heat source of the gonghe basin are still debated as it is unclear whether they are related to magmatic melting activities herein we provide systematic hydrogeochemical data of two types of geothermal waters type i and ii geothermal waters sampled from within the basin and the mountainous regions respectively found in the region type i high δd 85 0 to 59 0 δ18o 11 1 to 8 0 cl mostly range from 300 to 900 mg l and trace element whereas type ii has low δd 97 1 to 89 δ18o 13 0 to 11 8 cl 30 to 180 mg l and trace elements furthermore we identified the existence of a high temperature parent geothermal fluid based on the chloride enthalpy model it was estimated to possess a temperature of 310 c and a circulation depth of 6 8 7 8 km the parent geothermal fluid originated from snowmelt water which later mixed with a magmatic fluid the helium he ratios of geothermal gas ranged from 0 01 ra to 0 18 ra and indicated that the source of he was primarily from a crustal source in addition to the heat flow analysis and magnetotelluric mt data we suggested that the magmatic nature of the geothermal fluid is caused by a partial melt zone which is ubiquitous in the middle to lower crust and serves as the heat source in the netp finally a conceptual model was built to illustrate the occurrence of magmatic fluid and its genesis the findings will help to improve the understanding of the uplift of the tp and reveals the important role of deep groundwater circulation in the formation of high temperature geothermal resources keywords northeastern tibetan plateau geothermal energy gonghe basin parent geothermal fluids hydro geochemistry partial melt zone 1 introduction the indian plate started colliding with the eurasian plate from ca 55 ma tapponnier et al 2001 since the onset of the cenozoic the collision between the indian and eurasian continents has led to the formation of the tibetan himalayan orogen one of the largest orogens worldwide yin and harrison 2000 tapponnier et al 2001 as a result the tibetan plateau tp is one of the most active geothermal areas in the mediterranean himalayan geothermal belt yokoyama et al 1999 geothermal studies on the tp began in the 1990s resulting in the first collection of published heat flow values shen 1991 however the heat flow pattern and heat generation mechanism across the entire tp specifically the northeastern section is still uncertain because previous geothermal research primarily focused on southern tibetan region yokoyama et al 1999 hoke et al 2000 zhang et al 2017 guo et al 2019 the northeastern tibetan plateau netp represents the growth front of the plateau system huang et al 2020 therefore a better understanding of its heat generation mechanism is essential for studying the uplift mechanism of the tp and for exploiting geothermal resources hence a detailed study on the heat generation mechanism in the netp is crucial with increasing demand for the exploration of a high temperature enhanced geothermal system the china geological survey has been conducting a long term geological survey of geothermal resources since 2013 and had identified a heat flow anomaly 102 mw m2 in the netp region zhang et al 2018a the heat flow anomaly within the netp is located in the gonghe basin and is characterized by high heat flow and a geothermal gradient of up to 6 8 c 100 m zhang et al 2018a some studies have attempted to explain the heat flow anomaly including i the non magmatic heat source and the presence of a high concentration of heat producing elements in the basal granite sun et al 2011 liu et al 2016 and ii the duplicate effect of radiogenic heat in the thickened crust and cooling of the shallow magma chamber beneath the gonghe basin zhang et al 2018a overall there is great debate regarding the presence of partial melting zone in the crust kong et al 2020a fortunately recent geophysical observations have revealed pervasive zones of materials with high electrical conductivities gao et al 2018 gao et al 2020 and anomalously low shear wave velocities less than 3 3 km s zhang et al 2020b in the upper to middle crust beneath the gonghe basin however uncertainty still exists whether the geophysical anomaly is related to partial melting moreover the heat source attributes of the low resistivity and low velocity zone lrlvz beneath the gonghe basin could not be distinguished in the gonghe basin there are strong surface manifestations of geothermal systems including boiling spring fumarole and sinters liu et al 2016 xu et al 2018 geothermal systems are the near surface expressions of the heat transfer from the earth s core to the surface jolie et al 2021 fluids play a key role in the transportation of heat and mass bickle and mckenzie 1987 menzies et al 2014 as they can penetrate into large parts of the crust via permeable faults menzies et al 2014 luijendijk et al 2020 fluid geochemical data can provide vital information regarding the source of geothermal fluids geochemical processes occurring in a reservoir and the genesis of geothermal systems guo et al 2012 guo et al 2017 tian et al 2018 guo et al 2020 barberio et al 2021 tian et al 2021 based on this the heat source attributes of the lrlvz beneath the gonghe basin can be constrained by geochemical tools the isotopic composition of water could be used to determine the origin of geothermal fluids pang 2006 clark 2015 barbieri 2019 bowen et al 2019 kong et al 2020b and provide additional information than those obtained from geophysical or solute concentration data alone jasechko 2019 major and trace elements could also provide constraints for delineating hydrological processes clark 2015 and estimating the reservoir temperature reed and spycher 1984 pang and reed 1998 in addition gas isotopic compositions e g 3he 4he respond quickly to tectonic and magmatic processes sano et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 moreover hydrogeochemical data could provide information about the structure status and processes of the groundwater system and interpretations from hydrogeochemical data aid in water resource management barbieri 2019 in recent years several studies were carried out to investigate the hydrochemistry liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 reservoir temperature hou et al 2019 and stable isotopic compositions of geothermal fluids dai et al 2021 in the gonghe basin however these studies did not incorporate the geochemical evidence regional geophysical interpretation results and terrestrial heat flow data to investigate the genesis of high temperature geothermal systems in the region the heat source predominantly arises from residual mantle heat and the radiogenic heat in the crust wang 2015 however the most common heat source for high temperature geothermal systems is the magmatic heat source especially in the southern tp duo and zhao 2000 guo et al 2019 shi et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a a high temperature geothermal system with a magmatic heat source usually hosts a deep parent geothermal fluid shoedarto et al 2020 the parent geothermal fluid evolves to a high enthalpy fluid owing to the additional heating from the magmatic heat source the high temperature parent geothermal fluid is the deepest original geothermal fluid that remains in equilibrium with the surrounding rocks shoedarto et al 2020 cl is one of the conservative elements that can be employed to trace the origin of geothermal fluids truesdell et al 1989 guo et al 2012 shoedarto et al 2020 chloride is a highly soluble ion found in crustal fluids salt formations and seawater clark 2015 chloride in high temperature geothermal system with a magmatic heat source e g yangbajing tengchong rehai and yellowstone national park originates primarily from the mixing of meteoric waters with the magmatic fluid guo 2012 guo and wang 2012 truesdell and fournier 1976 hence the parent geothermal fluid is usually enriched in cl concentrations due to the effects of incorporating magmatic fluids nicholson 1993 along with enthalpy cl is useful for estimating the temperature of the parent geothermal fluid fournier 1977 guo and wang 2012 combining geochemical geological and geophysical evidence we can confirm whether there is a magmatic heat source in the region herein we perform a detailed geochemical analysis of geothermal waters and gases collected from the gonghe basin we also incorporate regional geophysical interpretation and terrestrial heat flow analysis results to investigate the heat source and heat generation mechanism in the region this research is valuable for understanding the heat generation and uplifting mechanism of the netp and will help explore the high temperature geothermal energy resources in the tp 2 geological setting the tp is bounded by the indian plate in the south the north china craton in the north the tarim basin in the west and the sichuan basin in the east fig 1 a gao et al 2013 the collision between the indian and eurasian plates uplifted the tp and caused thickening of the crust molnar and tapponnier 1978 yin and harrison 2000 as a result of the ongoing collision between the indian and eurasian plates the netp extrudes laterally during the cenozoic lease et al 2011 wang et al 2012 cenozoic deformation of the netp is associated with the localized growth of the associated basins fig 1b craddock et al 2014 the gonghe basin is a cenozoic diamond shaped intermontane basin controlled by the kunlun fault and altyn tagh fault fig 1 zhang et al 2012 gao et al 2020 the gonghe basin is located in the junction and transformation zone of the qilian kunlun and qinling orogenic belts the so called central chinese orogenic belt fig 1a and b wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2020a the cenozoic deformation of the gonghe basin is associated with two primary fault systems the qinghai nan shan and the gonghe nan shan craddock et al 2014 the qinghainanshan fault qhnsf and the gonghenanshan fault ghnsf are the northern and southern margins of the gonghe basin fig 1b and c the deformation of the qhnsf and ghnsf began ca 6 10 ma and ca 7 10 ma respectively craddock et al 2014 since the late miocene the qhnsf and ghnsf have accommodated 0 8 2 2 km and 5 1 6 9 km of shortening respectively craddock et al 2014 in addition geologic data indicate that the qhnsf and ghnsf sole into decollements in the upper or middle crust craddock et al 2014 the walihong wenquan fault wlh wqf and the duohemao fault dhmf are found at the western and eastern margins of the gonghe basin in the early miocene the nnw strike faults qhnsf and ghnsf and right lateral faults wlh wqf and dhmf controlled the deformation of the gonghe basin wang et al 2011 gao et al 2020 the marginal fault extended rapidly to the basin transforming the basin into an intermontane basin wang et al 2011 approximately during ca 3 6 ma the deposition rate rapidly increased wang et al 2011 covering the gonghe basin in thick cenozoic sedimentary strata such as the xining xianshuihe linxia and gonghe formations zhang et al 2018a moreover the shortening rates across the qhnsf and ghnsf 0 10 0 04 mm yr imply slow and steady deformation of the basin since the late miocene craddock et al 2014 geologic evidence suggests that the rapid uplift with the mountain s fracturing strongly extended to the basin sun 2004 gao et al 2020 fig 1c shows the locations of the samples in the basin there are several typical geothermal water groups in the gonghe basin including the qiabuqia qbq the qunaihai qnh the zhacangsi zcs the zhihai zh the lancai lc and the xinghai xh groups along the ela fault zone fig 1c xu et al 2018 the basement rock in the basin is composed of triassic sandy slate and indosinian acidic volcanic rocks granite and granodiorite zhang et al 2018a the sedimentary cap layers are composed of primarily sandstone of the paleogene neogene and quaternary lacustrine strata zhang et al 2020b fig 1d shows the borehole lithology profile in the qbq geothermal area zhang et al 2018b two geological cross sections a a and b b across qbq qnh zcs and zh geothermal areas are illustrated in fig 2 to provide information on the path of fluid circulation 3 methods in this section initially we discuss the sampling and analysis methods employed further we detail the procedure for using cl concentration enthalpy and δd and δ18o data to identify the origin of the parent geothermal fluid 3 1 sampling and analysis in 2019 and 2020 we collected 26 water samples 11 thermal water 5 cold groundwater and 10 surface water and five gas samples from the gonghe basin to obtain comprehensive chemical and isotopic data the annual average air temperature of the gonghe basin was 10 c dai et al 2021 in this study the groundwater temperature higher than 20 c was considered to represent thermal water liao 2018 we also collected data of 48 water samples from published studies liu 2015 liu et al 2016 li 2016 hou et al 2019 dai et al 2021 fig 1c shows the sampling locations at each sampling site we measured the temperature ph and electrical conductivity of groundwater with handled meters hq40d hach water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and collected in pre rinsed polyethylene bottles samples for cation analysis and trace elements were preserved by the dropwise addition of high purity nitric acid to a ph of less than 2 untreated samples were collected for anion oxygen and hydrogen analyses the samples for sio2 analysis were diluted with deionized water to prevent sio2 precipitation chemical and isotopic analyses were completed within two weeks of sampling trace elements were analyzed at the analytical laboratory of the beijing research institute of uranium geology the concentrations of major cations and trace elements were detected by icp aes icap6000 thermo fisher scientific and icpms 7500c agilent respectively multielement standard solutions 90243 and 51844 fluka used for quality control indicated that the analytical error margin of major cations and trace elements was less than 0 5 anions including f cl and so4 2 were determined using ion chromatography dionex ics600 thermo fisher scientific ion charge imbalances were calculated from the analyses and they are less than 10 for most of the samples oxygen and hydrogen isotope analyses were performed using a laser absorption water isotope spectrometer analyzer l1102 i picarro the isotopic ratios of d h and 18o 16o are referenced with the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow international standard the analytical precisions of δd and δ18o were 0 5 and 0 1 respectively samples for he and ne isotopes analysis were collected from the bubbling pools we collected samples using the drainage method and cooper tubes for the drainage method we filled a 50 ml glass bottle with geothermal waters and submerged it underwater the bottle was connected by a tube to an inverted teflon funnel we then sampled the geothermal gases after the water was entirely displaced finally we sealed the bottle with a rubber stopper and crimped with an aluminum cap sampling bottles were then sealed in 500 ml brown polyethylene bottles full of in situ geothermal water copper tubes were used at springs to collect water samples water was pumped through submerged copper tubes attached to tygon tubing until no air bubbles were visible the copper tubes were closed by clenching the he and ne isotopes were determined using a sector mass spectrometer at the beijing research institute of uranium geology and laboratory of gas geochemistry lanzhou gansu northwest institute of eco environment and resources chinese academy of sciences all the 3he 4he ratios are expressed as r ra where ra 1 4 10 6 is the 3he 4he ratio of air sano and wakita 1985 3 2 procedures for identifying the parent geothermal fluid the presence of parent geothermal fluid and its accompanying processes can be estimated from chloride enthalpy and chloride deuterium diagrams fournier 1977 shoedarto et al 2020 chloride enthalpy and chloride deuterium diagrams have been widely used to estimate the temperature of parent geothermal fluid and to understand their cooling and mixing mechanisms truesdell and fournier 1976 fournier 1977 fournier 1979 guo and wang 2012 shoedarto et al 2020 to obtain the enthalpy of each sample we first evaluated the reservoir temperature previous studies have proved that the quartz geothermometer is suitable for obtaining reservoir temperatures of geothermal waters in gonghe basin the reservoir temperatures estimated by the quartz geothermometer were approximately similar to that estimated by the integrated multicomponent geothermometry approach geot hou et al 2019 therefore we estimated the reservoir temperatures of different hydrothermal areas in the gonghe basin using the quartz geothermometer proposed by verma and santoyo 1997 the enthalpy of each sample was obtained from the international steam tables kretzschmar and wagner 2019 in the chloride enthalpy diagram two types of lines cooling and mixing lines were drawn to interpret the cooling and mixing mechanisms of the parent geothermal fluid the cooling line connects the sample points to s steam point with enthalpy value of 2779 4 j g and chloride concentration of 0 mg l the mixing line connects the sample points to cold groundwater then the intersection of these two lines represents the parent geothermal fluid truesdell and fournier 1976 fournier 1979 guo and wang 2012 we also used the chloride deuterium model proposed by truesdell et al 1977 to investigate the mixing and cooling processes that have influenced the composition of the geothermal fluids in the region similar to the chloride enthalpy diagram two lines were drawn to identify the parent geothermal fluid and investigate its mixing and cooling processes we applied snowmelt water as another endmember in addition to the cold groundwater and parent geothermal fluid endmembers the isotopic compositions of the parent geothermal fluid could be calculated for single steam separation at a given temperature truesdell et al 1977 shoedarto et al 2020 the proportion of vapor phase f v after boiling can be calculated by the following equation 1 f v h 0 h l h v h l where h l and h v are the enthalpies of liquid l and vapor v phases at a given temperature after boiling respectively h 0 is the initial enthalpy of the parent geothermal fluid before boiling the residual fluid holds isotopic equilibrium in the reservoir at the surface temperature assuming that rapid isotopic equilibration occurs between the liquid and vapor phases in the upflows towards the surface after boiling giggenbach 1992a ghomshei and clark 1993 thus the mass conservation of an isotope is given by 2 δ v f v δ l 1 f v δ 0 where δ 0 is the δ value of the isotope in the parent geothermal fluid δ l and δ v are the δ values in the liquid and vapor phases respectively the difference between δ l and δ v can be approximated by the fractionation factor of the isotope at a specific temperature between the liquid and vapor phases α bottinga and craig 1968 3 δ l δ v 1000 ln α l v consequently the δ value of the isotope in the parent geothermal fluid can be determined by the following equation d amore et al 1993 4 δ 0 δ l f v 1000 ln α l v in the temperature range from 0 c to 374 1 c ln α values for δd and δ18o can be calculated by the following equations horita et al 1995 5 1000 ln α l v δ 18 o 7 685 6 71123 10 3 t 1 6664 10 6 t 2 0 35041 10 9 t 3 6 1000 ln α l v δ d 1158 8 t 3 10 9 1620 1 t 2 10 6 794 84 t 10 3 161 04 2 9992 10 9 t 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry of geothermal waters physical properties stable isotopic compositions and major and trace elements of the water samples analyzed are shown in tables 1 and 2 the ph values of the geothermal waters varied from 7 2 to 8 56 which indicates neutral to alkaline conditions in this study we divided geothermal waters into two categories type i geothermal waters are situated in the basin qbq qnh and zcs sites and type ii geothermal waters are situated in the mountain areas zh lc and xh sites fig 3 presents the composition of gonghe groundwater in a trilinear piper plot it showed that some geothermal waters were compositionally similar to cold waters and plotted under the same area the blue shadow area in the plot hence it was suggested that the waters might have been mixed with cold groundwater during up flow fig 3 also demonstrates that the geothermal waters in the basin are distinct from the geothermal waters in the mountain areas the type i geothermal waters were of the na cl na cl so4 and na so4 cl types the type ii geothermal waters were of na so4 and na so4 cl types the type i geothermal waters have elevated concentrations of cl mostly range from 300 to 900 mg l table 2 whereas the type ii geothermal waters have low cl concentrations range from 30 to 180 mg l table 2 the high concentrations of cl in high temperature geothermal waters mainly originated from the mixing with magmatic fluid lowenstern et al 2012 guo et al 2014 tian et al 2018 in addition the elevated concentration of cl could not be caused by brine because the reservoir formation in the gonghe basin was of granitic composition thus it seems that certain geothermal waters in the basin mixed with magmatic fluid and there is a parent geothermal fluid in the gonghe basin 4 2 chloride enthalpy constraints on the presence of the parent geothermal fluid we applied the cl enthalpy model to investigate the hydrogeochemicalprocesses of all geothermal waters and to constraint the presence of the parent geothermal fluid as shown in fig 4 applying this in section 4 2 we successfully identified the presence of a parent geothermal fluid fig 4 suggests that the enthalpy of the parent geothermal fluid is 1410 j g 310 c from the international steam tables and the cl concentration of the parent geothermal fluid is 600 mg l accordingly the type i geothermal waters were derived from the parent geothermal fluid however the type ii geothermal waters did not originate from the parent geothermal fluid which indicated that these geothermal waters may have derived from meteoric water or snowmelt water that were not affected by the parent geothermal fluid overall these results indicate the possible presence of a parent geothermal fluid which led to the formation of the type i geothermal waters the composition of the parent geothermal fluid is crucial for investigating deep fluid origin hence we analyzed the li b and f concentrations of the parent geothermal fluid by applying the method proposed by aguilera et al 2005 the li b and f concentrations were regressed against cl excluding the samples that affected other secondary processes high cl and low trace elements concentrations as shown in fig s1 samples with high cl and low trace elements concentrations were the low enthalpy springs g04 g06 g19 g20 and g22 in the qbq geothermal area low trace element concentrations of these samples were attributed due to the mixing with cold groundwater the high cl concentration may be because of the unconsolidated sediments containing salts covering the reservoir rock the li b and f concentrations were obtained by using the cl concentration of the parent geothermal fluid 600 mg l fig s1 also illustrates the regression equations describing mixing processes the calculated li b and f concentrations of the parent geothermal fluid were 7 71 24 57 7 91 mg l respectively the characteristic of trace elements will be discussed in the following section 4 5 4 3 chloride deuterium constraints on the presence of the parent geothermal fluid we applied the cl δd model proposed by truesdell et al 1977 to constrain the presence of the parent geothermal fluid and verify the results obtained from the cl enthalpy model with the assumption that the steam separates at a given temperature in a single process we calculated the isotopic compositions of the parent geothermal fluid using equations 1 6 the δd value and cl concentration of the parent geothermal fluid were 97 and 600 mg l fig 5 shows a deuterium chloride diagram the results indicated that the type i geothermal waters derived from the parent geothermal fluid whereas the type ii geothermal waters did not therefore the mixing and cooling processes of geothermal fluids illustrated from the two models were consistent the δd values and cl concentrations of the type ii geothermal waters were lower than those type i geothermal waters there might be another recharge source for the type ii geothermal waters considering that the mountains are covered by snow in august we also included the δd and δ18o value of the snowmelt water in the netp δ18o 17 δd 123 as an end member fan et al 2015 fig 5 indicates that the type ii geothermal waters originate from the snowmelt water and are not affected by the parent geothermal fluid in addition fig 5 also suggests that the parent geothermal fluid is also rooted in snowmelt water intriguingly fig 5 illustrates that several samples have an increasing cl concentration along with the cooling trend in other words several samples have higher cl concentrations than the parent geothermal fluid notably these samples were obtained from mainly low enthalpy springs g04 g06 g19 g20 and g22 in the qbq geothermal area except for five high enthalpy springs g32 g33 g34 g35 and g36 in the qnh geothermal area fig 5 and table 2 the reservoir of these low enthalpy springs is fine sandstone and mudstone which are covered by unconsolidated sediments containing salts fig 1d liu et al 2016 hou et al 2019 this could have contributed to the higher cl concentration as for the five high enthalpy springs in the qnh geothermal area steam could be separated from the parent geothermal fluid and be lost during an adiabatic cooling process truesdell and fournier 1976 truesdell et al 1977 li et al 2015 the cl concentration of the five high enthalpy springs in the qnh geothermal area increased due to the vapor loss from geothermal fluid 4 4 isotopic characteristics of the geothermal system we revealed the relationship between δd and δ18o of all waters by the δd vs δ18o plot fig 6 fig 6 depicts that all the surface water samples and some geothermal waters samples plot close to the local meteoric water line lmwl and global meteoric water line gmwl demonstrating their meteoric origin for the type i geothermal water the δ18o values range from 11 1 to 8 0 and the δd values range from 85 0 to 59 0 the δ18o and δd values of the type ii geothermal water vary from 13 0 to 11 8 and 97 1 to 89 respectively table 1 and fig 6 the type ii geothermal waters are depleted in δd and δ18o compared to the type i geothermal waters which indicates a different origin the magmatic fluid distribution δ18o 10 2 δd 20 10 giggenbach 1992b and snowmelt water isotopes δ18o 17 δd 123 fan et al 2015 were plotted as two end members in fig 6 the estimated δd and δ18o values of the parent geothermal fluid were about 97 and 12 and they were plotted in the mixing zone of magmatic fluid and snowmelt water in fig 6 this indicated that the parent geothermal fluid originated from snowmelt water and mixed with the magmatic fluid in addition fig 6 shows that the type i geothermal waters are derived from the parent geothermal fluid and some geothermal waters are mixed with cold groundwater the type ii geothermal waters originate from the snowmelt water and are not affected by the parent geothermal fluid based on the above analysis we suggest that the parent geothermal fluid exists within the crust of the gonghe basin this result was consistent with the analyses of the enthalpy chloride and deuterium chloride diagrams 4 5 trace elements of geothermal fluids trace elements also act as conservative elements in geothermal waters and are essential for understanding deep geochemical processes and mass transfer in high temperature geothermal systems kaasalainen and stefánsson 2012 wang et al 2020 barberio et al 2021 the trace element compositions of geothermal waters are given in table 2 we presented the trace element concentrations of b li rb and cs in box and whiskers diagram as shown in fig 7 the type i geothermal waters have high b 0 26 26 42 mg l li 0 10 9 47 mg l rb 0 12 967 μg l and cs 0 07 2721 μg l concentrations whereas the type ii geothermal waters have lower b 0 92 5 94 mg l li 1 00 4 30 mg l rb 123 280 μg l and cs 306 663 μg l concentrations table 2 and fig 7 in addition several samples g04 g18 g19 g20 and g22 have low trace element concentrations because of mixing with cold groundwater water rock reactions are the main enrichment mechanism of alkali metals in high temperature geothermal fluids giggenbach and goguel 1989 kaasalainen and stefánsson 2012 intriguingly zhang et al 2016 calculated the mineral saturation indices of geothermal water samples in the gonghe basin using phreeqc code and found no lithium containing mineral as we mentioned before the type i geothermal waters were derived from the parent geothermal fluid which mixed with magmatic fluid in addition a high concentration of these trace elements is also associated with magmatic volatiles such as b as li rb and cs in a high temperature system with a magmatic heat source ellis and mahon 1964 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 b can also be released readily from host rocks guo 2012 and obtained from magmatic fluids arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 liu et al 2019 the highest b concentration in the sampled geothermal waters is 26 42 mg l compared with geothermal waters in the yangbajing and tengchong rehai high temperature geothermal systems with magmatic heat sources it was lower than the average b concentration of yangbajing 119 mg l guo et al 2012 and is equivalent to the average b concentration of rehai 20 mg l guo et al 2012 notably the depths of magmatic heat sources in yangbajing and tengchong rehai are much shallower than in gonghe basin therefore the effect of magmatic fluid input is not negligible in addition lü et al 2014 analyzed b concentrations and isotope compositions of yangbajing geothermal waters and suggested that the source of b was primarily from b enriched crustal country rocks therefore we suggest that the high concentrations of b li rb and cs are contributed by the magmatic fluids and from the leaching of host rocks granodiorite 4 6 geophysical interpretation and heat flow analysis results the parent geothermal fluid we identified below the gonghe basin had a temperature of 310 c we compared the characteristic of the parent geothermal fluid and partial melt zone in the gonghe basin to those of a typical high temperature system with a magmatic heat source as shown in table 3 generally parent geothermal fluids do not exhibit such a high temperature without the presence of an additional magmatic heat source thus the deeper lrlvz observed via geophysical methods could be a partial melt zone fig 8 and fig s2 based on the average temperature gradient of the gonghe basin 40 45 c km zhang et al 2018a we estimated the depth of the parent geothermal fluid as ranging from 6 8 to 7 8 km table 3 table 3 suggests that the circulation depth of the parent geothermal fluid is also controlled by the depth of the magmatic heat source magma chamber or partial melt zone the shallower the magmatic heat source the stronger the magmatic signal in geothermal water e g yangbajing tengchong rehai and yellowstone national park coincidently another lrlvz at a depth 5 10 km below the gonghe surface was identified by mt and seismic inversion fig 8 and fig s2 the geophysical interpretations showed that the parent geothermal fluid exists in the crust of the gonghe basin and could be connected to the partial melt zone via large scale faults the terrestrial heat flow should be high if there is a magmatic heat source in the region a previous heat flow study suggested that the average heat flow of gonghe basin was 102 2 mw m2 zhang et al 2018a therefore gonghe basin has a high heat flow and the heat anomaly is most likely to be influenced by an additional heat source such as a magmatic heat source in addition the presence of an additional heat source could be constrained by the heat flow partition analysis zhang et al 2020a based on the vertical heat flow distribution calculated by zhang et al 2020a we modified the diagram of the contributions of heat flow from individual layers of the gonghe basin as shown in fig 9 fig 9 shows that the heat production of crustal sections was 48 3 mw m2 which accounted for 47 3 of the terrestrial heat flow furthermore zhang et al 2020a suggested that the regional mantle heat flow was 27 mw m2 by applying terrestrial heat flow analysis fig 9 deng et al 2018 suggested that the velocity of the mantle beneath the gonghe basin was fast which indicates a relatively cooler mantle temperature this was consistent with the low heat flow of the regional mantle the sum of the heat production of the crust and the mantle heat flow was 75 3 mw m2 which was inconsistent with the average value of heat flow of the gonghe basin 102 2 mw m2 thus the most likely explanation for this additional heat flow contribution is the heat contribution from the partial melt zone which is approximately 27 mw m2 fig 9 zhang et al 2020a 4 7 helium isotopes in geothermal gases according to the analysis above we authenticated the possibility of a partial melt zone however whether the heat source originates from the upper mantle or exclusively from melts in the lower crust remains uncertain helium isotopes provide evidence of the influences of mantle derived volatiles because 3he is from the mantle and 4he is mainly from the crust o nions and oxburgh 1988 tian et al 2018 the he isotope data measured for the spring gases in the gonghe basin are shown in table 4 we used 4he 20ne ratios to estimate the content of air contamination we plotted all gas samples in the 3he 4he vs 4he 20ne diagram fig 10 as shown in fig 10 and table 4 the he ratios of all samples range from 0 01 ra to 0 18 ra indicating that the he in the gonghe basin primarily has a crustal source we calculated the percentage of mantle derived he by using he and ne isotopes sano et al 1982 the contribution of the mantle is 0 0 4 table 4 tectonic activities including mantle upwelling and crustal deformation control the distribution of geothermal resources and modify the composition of geothermal fluids kong et al 2020b barberio et al 2021 jolie et al 2021 yangbajing a world famous geothermal system hosts a magmatic heat source which was identified as re melted continental crust pham et al 1986 zhao et al 2002 duo 2003 guo et al 2012 similarly the percentage of mantle derived he is not higher than 3 zhao et al 2002 thus we suggest that the partial melt zone beneath the gonghe basin promotes melting in the crust instead of mantle upwelling fig 11 provides the conceptual model of the heat generation mechanism of the gonghe basin the radiogenic heat flow contribution of the thickened crust and the cooling of the partial melt zone in the lower crust are the primary heat sources in the gonghe basin meteoric water and snowmelt water infiltrate deeply into the crust through the regional faults and mix with magmatic fluids to form the parent geothermal fluid the parent geothermal fluid is rooted in snowmelt water and magmatic fluid most geothermal waters are derived from the parent geothermal fluid while some originate directly from snowmelt water 5 implication for the deformation mechanisms of tp based on the previous studies of the lithospheric structure of the netp gao et al 2013 guo et al 2016 huang et al 2020 2021 ye et al 2016 we suggest that the decoupling deformation between the upper and middle to lower crust promote the partial melt zone as shown in fig 12 a major detachment fault zone results in a decoupled deformation between the upper and middle crust the decoupling between the upper and middle to lower crust could dominate the lithosphere and promote the partial melt zone our results indicate that the lrlvz in the gonghe crust is a partial melt zone which might serve as an intra crustal decollement combined with the previous findings on the lvlrz usually interpreted as a partial melt zone distribution in the netp le pape et al 2012 li et al 2014 wang et al 2017 deng et al 2018 it seems that the partial melt zone is ubiquitous in the middle to lower crust of the netp this is consistent with the lateral extruding structure of the netp caused by the india eurasia collision since the middle miocene furthermore the regional heat flow distribution jiang et al 2019 indicated a similar pattern for the partial melt zone distribution therefore we suggest that the partial melt zone is the primary heat source of the netp based on previous research most cenozoic tectonic activities were related to the regional structure of local blocks within the crustal scale ye et al 2016 the widespread intra crustal weak layers may also be indicative of partial melt zones the proposed seismic profile across the junction of the northern margin of the western qilian mountains and the hexi corridor reveals the decoupled crustal deformation partitioned by the intra crustal decollement layer at a depth of 14 24 km huang et al 2021 this potentially plays a role in the outward growth of the plateau and improves our understanding of the tp crustal structure 6 conclusions in this study we performed a systematic hydro geochemical analysis of the geothermal fluids in the gonghe basin of the netp and identified a parent geothermal fluid by integrating geochemical results geophysical observations and heat flow partition analysis we suggest that the lrlvz beneath the gonghe basin is a partial melt zone which serves as an additional heat source for the heat anomaly of the gonghe basin a conceptual model was presented to illustrate the circulation of deep fluid and its genesis in the gonghe basin the parent geothermal fluid originates from snowmelt water and mixes with a magmatic fluid derived from the partial melt zone the parent geothermal fluid ascends and mixes with cooler water initiating the geothermal reservoirs our findings confirm a partial melt zone beneath the gonghe basin implying that the partial melt zone is ubiquitous in the middle to lower crust of the netp we further point out that the decoupling deformation between the upper and middle crust might be the dominant force forming the partial melt zone the findings reveal the critical role of deep groundwater circulation with the signature of magmatic fluid and will help understand the uplift mechanism of the netp and the aid in the exploration of high temperature geothermal resources credit

4035,the northeastern tibetan plateau netp represents the growth front of the tibetan plateau tp system this region has long been recognized as a key in understanding the topographic response and crustal thickening of the entire tp a heat flow anomaly gonghe basin 102 mw m2 was found in the netp however the heat generation mechanism and the heat source of the gonghe basin are still debated as it is unclear whether they are related to magmatic melting activities herein we provide systematic hydrogeochemical data of two types of geothermal waters type i and ii geothermal waters sampled from within the basin and the mountainous regions respectively found in the region type i high δd 85 0 to 59 0 δ18o 11 1 to 8 0 cl mostly range from 300 to 900 mg l and trace element whereas type ii has low δd 97 1 to 89 δ18o 13 0 to 11 8 cl 30 to 180 mg l and trace elements furthermore we identified the existence of a high temperature parent geothermal fluid based on the chloride enthalpy model it was estimated to possess a temperature of 310 c and a circulation depth of 6 8 7 8 km the parent geothermal fluid originated from snowmelt water which later mixed with a magmatic fluid the helium he ratios of geothermal gas ranged from 0 01 ra to 0 18 ra and indicated that the source of he was primarily from a crustal source in addition to the heat flow analysis and magnetotelluric mt data we suggested that the magmatic nature of the geothermal fluid is caused by a partial melt zone which is ubiquitous in the middle to lower crust and serves as the heat source in the netp finally a conceptual model was built to illustrate the occurrence of magmatic fluid and its genesis the findings will help to improve the understanding of the uplift of the tp and reveals the important role of deep groundwater circulation in the formation of high temperature geothermal resources keywords northeastern tibetan plateau geothermal energy gonghe basin parent geothermal fluids hydro geochemistry partial melt zone 1 introduction the indian plate started colliding with the eurasian plate from ca 55 ma tapponnier et al 2001 since the onset of the cenozoic the collision between the indian and eurasian continents has led to the formation of the tibetan himalayan orogen one of the largest orogens worldwide yin and harrison 2000 tapponnier et al 2001 as a result the tibetan plateau tp is one of the most active geothermal areas in the mediterranean himalayan geothermal belt yokoyama et al 1999 geothermal studies on the tp began in the 1990s resulting in the first collection of published heat flow values shen 1991 however the heat flow pattern and heat generation mechanism across the entire tp specifically the northeastern section is still uncertain because previous geothermal research primarily focused on southern tibetan region yokoyama et al 1999 hoke et al 2000 zhang et al 2017 guo et al 2019 the northeastern tibetan plateau netp represents the growth front of the plateau system huang et al 2020 therefore a better understanding of its heat generation mechanism is essential for studying the uplift mechanism of the tp and for exploiting geothermal resources hence a detailed study on the heat generation mechanism in the netp is crucial with increasing demand for the exploration of a high temperature enhanced geothermal system the china geological survey has been conducting a long term geological survey of geothermal resources since 2013 and had identified a heat flow anomaly 102 mw m2 in the netp region zhang et al 2018a the heat flow anomaly within the netp is located in the gonghe basin and is characterized by high heat flow and a geothermal gradient of up to 6 8 c 100 m zhang et al 2018a some studies have attempted to explain the heat flow anomaly including i the non magmatic heat source and the presence of a high concentration of heat producing elements in the basal granite sun et al 2011 liu et al 2016 and ii the duplicate effect of radiogenic heat in the thickened crust and cooling of the shallow magma chamber beneath the gonghe basin zhang et al 2018a overall there is great debate regarding the presence of partial melting zone in the crust kong et al 2020a fortunately recent geophysical observations have revealed pervasive zones of materials with high electrical conductivities gao et al 2018 gao et al 2020 and anomalously low shear wave velocities less than 3 3 km s zhang et al 2020b in the upper to middle crust beneath the gonghe basin however uncertainty still exists whether the geophysical anomaly is related to partial melting moreover the heat source attributes of the low resistivity and low velocity zone lrlvz beneath the gonghe basin could not be distinguished in the gonghe basin there are strong surface manifestations of geothermal systems including boiling spring fumarole and sinters liu et al 2016 xu et al 2018 geothermal systems are the near surface expressions of the heat transfer from the earth s core to the surface jolie et al 2021 fluids play a key role in the transportation of heat and mass bickle and mckenzie 1987 menzies et al 2014 as they can penetrate into large parts of the crust via permeable faults menzies et al 2014 luijendijk et al 2020 fluid geochemical data can provide vital information regarding the source of geothermal fluids geochemical processes occurring in a reservoir and the genesis of geothermal systems guo et al 2012 guo et al 2017 tian et al 2018 guo et al 2020 barberio et al 2021 tian et al 2021 based on this the heat source attributes of the lrlvz beneath the gonghe basin can be constrained by geochemical tools the isotopic composition of water could be used to determine the origin of geothermal fluids pang 2006 clark 2015 barbieri 2019 bowen et al 2019 kong et al 2020b and provide additional information than those obtained from geophysical or solute concentration data alone jasechko 2019 major and trace elements could also provide constraints for delineating hydrological processes clark 2015 and estimating the reservoir temperature reed and spycher 1984 pang and reed 1998 in addition gas isotopic compositions e g 3he 4he respond quickly to tectonic and magmatic processes sano et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 moreover hydrogeochemical data could provide information about the structure status and processes of the groundwater system and interpretations from hydrogeochemical data aid in water resource management barbieri 2019 in recent years several studies were carried out to investigate the hydrochemistry liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 reservoir temperature hou et al 2019 and stable isotopic compositions of geothermal fluids dai et al 2021 in the gonghe basin however these studies did not incorporate the geochemical evidence regional geophysical interpretation results and terrestrial heat flow data to investigate the genesis of high temperature geothermal systems in the region the heat source predominantly arises from residual mantle heat and the radiogenic heat in the crust wang 2015 however the most common heat source for high temperature geothermal systems is the magmatic heat source especially in the southern tp duo and zhao 2000 guo et al 2019 shi et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a a high temperature geothermal system with a magmatic heat source usually hosts a deep parent geothermal fluid shoedarto et al 2020 the parent geothermal fluid evolves to a high enthalpy fluid owing to the additional heating from the magmatic heat source the high temperature parent geothermal fluid is the deepest original geothermal fluid that remains in equilibrium with the surrounding rocks shoedarto et al 2020 cl is one of the conservative elements that can be employed to trace the origin of geothermal fluids truesdell et al 1989 guo et al 2012 shoedarto et al 2020 chloride is a highly soluble ion found in crustal fluids salt formations and seawater clark 2015 chloride in high temperature geothermal system with a magmatic heat source e g yangbajing tengchong rehai and yellowstone national park originates primarily from the mixing of meteoric waters with the magmatic fluid guo 2012 guo and wang 2012 truesdell and fournier 1976 hence the parent geothermal fluid is usually enriched in cl concentrations due to the effects of incorporating magmatic fluids nicholson 1993 along with enthalpy cl is useful for estimating the temperature of the parent geothermal fluid fournier 1977 guo and wang 2012 combining geochemical geological and geophysical evidence we can confirm whether there is a magmatic heat source in the region herein we perform a detailed geochemical analysis of geothermal waters and gases collected from the gonghe basin we also incorporate regional geophysical interpretation and terrestrial heat flow analysis results to investigate the heat source and heat generation mechanism in the region this research is valuable for understanding the heat generation and uplifting mechanism of the netp and will help explore the high temperature geothermal energy resources in the tp 2 geological setting the tp is bounded by the indian plate in the south the north china craton in the north the tarim basin in the west and the sichuan basin in the east fig 1 a gao et al 2013 the collision between the indian and eurasian plates uplifted the tp and caused thickening of the crust molnar and tapponnier 1978 yin and harrison 2000 as a result of the ongoing collision between the indian and eurasian plates the netp extrudes laterally during the cenozoic lease et al 2011 wang et al 2012 cenozoic deformation of the netp is associated with the localized growth of the associated basins fig 1b craddock et al 2014 the gonghe basin is a cenozoic diamond shaped intermontane basin controlled by the kunlun fault and altyn tagh fault fig 1 zhang et al 2012 gao et al 2020 the gonghe basin is located in the junction and transformation zone of the qilian kunlun and qinling orogenic belts the so called central chinese orogenic belt fig 1a and b wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2020a the cenozoic deformation of the gonghe basin is associated with two primary fault systems the qinghai nan shan and the gonghe nan shan craddock et al 2014 the qinghainanshan fault qhnsf and the gonghenanshan fault ghnsf are the northern and southern margins of the gonghe basin fig 1b and c the deformation of the qhnsf and ghnsf began ca 6 10 ma and ca 7 10 ma respectively craddock et al 2014 since the late miocene the qhnsf and ghnsf have accommodated 0 8 2 2 km and 5 1 6 9 km of shortening respectively craddock et al 2014 in addition geologic data indicate that the qhnsf and ghnsf sole into decollements in the upper or middle crust craddock et al 2014 the walihong wenquan fault wlh wqf and the duohemao fault dhmf are found at the western and eastern margins of the gonghe basin in the early miocene the nnw strike faults qhnsf and ghnsf and right lateral faults wlh wqf and dhmf controlled the deformation of the gonghe basin wang et al 2011 gao et al 2020 the marginal fault extended rapidly to the basin transforming the basin into an intermontane basin wang et al 2011 approximately during ca 3 6 ma the deposition rate rapidly increased wang et al 2011 covering the gonghe basin in thick cenozoic sedimentary strata such as the xining xianshuihe linxia and gonghe formations zhang et al 2018a moreover the shortening rates across the qhnsf and ghnsf 0 10 0 04 mm yr imply slow and steady deformation of the basin since the late miocene craddock et al 2014 geologic evidence suggests that the rapid uplift with the mountain s fracturing strongly extended to the basin sun 2004 gao et al 2020 fig 1c shows the locations of the samples in the basin there are several typical geothermal water groups in the gonghe basin including the qiabuqia qbq the qunaihai qnh the zhacangsi zcs the zhihai zh the lancai lc and the xinghai xh groups along the ela fault zone fig 1c xu et al 2018 the basement rock in the basin is composed of triassic sandy slate and indosinian acidic volcanic rocks granite and granodiorite zhang et al 2018a the sedimentary cap layers are composed of primarily sandstone of the paleogene neogene and quaternary lacustrine strata zhang et al 2020b fig 1d shows the borehole lithology profile in the qbq geothermal area zhang et al 2018b two geological cross sections a a and b b across qbq qnh zcs and zh geothermal areas are illustrated in fig 2 to provide information on the path of fluid circulation 3 methods in this section initially we discuss the sampling and analysis methods employed further we detail the procedure for using cl concentration enthalpy and δd and δ18o data to identify the origin of the parent geothermal fluid 3 1 sampling and analysis in 2019 and 2020 we collected 26 water samples 11 thermal water 5 cold groundwater and 10 surface water and five gas samples from the gonghe basin to obtain comprehensive chemical and isotopic data the annual average air temperature of the gonghe basin was 10 c dai et al 2021 in this study the groundwater temperature higher than 20 c was considered to represent thermal water liao 2018 we also collected data of 48 water samples from published studies liu 2015 liu et al 2016 li 2016 hou et al 2019 dai et al 2021 fig 1c shows the sampling locations at each sampling site we measured the temperature ph and electrical conductivity of groundwater with handled meters hq40d hach water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and collected in pre rinsed polyethylene bottles samples for cation analysis and trace elements were preserved by the dropwise addition of high purity nitric acid to a ph of less than 2 untreated samples were collected for anion oxygen and hydrogen analyses the samples for sio2 analysis were diluted with deionized water to prevent sio2 precipitation chemical and isotopic analyses were completed within two weeks of sampling trace elements were analyzed at the analytical laboratory of the beijing research institute of uranium geology the concentrations of major cations and trace elements were detected by icp aes icap6000 thermo fisher scientific and icpms 7500c agilent respectively multielement standard solutions 90243 and 51844 fluka used for quality control indicated that the analytical error margin of major cations and trace elements was less than 0 5 anions including f cl and so4 2 were determined using ion chromatography dionex ics600 thermo fisher scientific ion charge imbalances were calculated from the analyses and they are less than 10 for most of the samples oxygen and hydrogen isotope analyses were performed using a laser absorption water isotope spectrometer analyzer l1102 i picarro the isotopic ratios of d h and 18o 16o are referenced with the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow international standard the analytical precisions of δd and δ18o were 0 5 and 0 1 respectively samples for he and ne isotopes analysis were collected from the bubbling pools we collected samples using the drainage method and cooper tubes for the drainage method we filled a 50 ml glass bottle with geothermal waters and submerged it underwater the bottle was connected by a tube to an inverted teflon funnel we then sampled the geothermal gases after the water was entirely displaced finally we sealed the bottle with a rubber stopper and crimped with an aluminum cap sampling bottles were then sealed in 500 ml brown polyethylene bottles full of in situ geothermal water copper tubes were used at springs to collect water samples water was pumped through submerged copper tubes attached to tygon tubing until no air bubbles were visible the copper tubes were closed by clenching the he and ne isotopes were determined using a sector mass spectrometer at the beijing research institute of uranium geology and laboratory of gas geochemistry lanzhou gansu northwest institute of eco environment and resources chinese academy of sciences all the 3he 4he ratios are expressed as r ra where ra 1 4 10 6 is the 3he 4he ratio of air sano and wakita 1985 3 2 procedures for identifying the parent geothermal fluid the presence of parent geothermal fluid and its accompanying processes can be estimated from chloride enthalpy and chloride deuterium diagrams fournier 1977 shoedarto et al 2020 chloride enthalpy and chloride deuterium diagrams have been widely used to estimate the temperature of parent geothermal fluid and to understand their cooling and mixing mechanisms truesdell and fournier 1976 fournier 1977 fournier 1979 guo and wang 2012 shoedarto et al 2020 to obtain the enthalpy of each sample we first evaluated the reservoir temperature previous studies have proved that the quartz geothermometer is suitable for obtaining reservoir temperatures of geothermal waters in gonghe basin the reservoir temperatures estimated by the quartz geothermometer were approximately similar to that estimated by the integrated multicomponent geothermometry approach geot hou et al 2019 therefore we estimated the reservoir temperatures of different hydrothermal areas in the gonghe basin using the quartz geothermometer proposed by verma and santoyo 1997 the enthalpy of each sample was obtained from the international steam tables kretzschmar and wagner 2019 in the chloride enthalpy diagram two types of lines cooling and mixing lines were drawn to interpret the cooling and mixing mechanisms of the parent geothermal fluid the cooling line connects the sample points to s steam point with enthalpy value of 2779 4 j g and chloride concentration of 0 mg l the mixing line connects the sample points to cold groundwater then the intersection of these two lines represents the parent geothermal fluid truesdell and fournier 1976 fournier 1979 guo and wang 2012 we also used the chloride deuterium model proposed by truesdell et al 1977 to investigate the mixing and cooling processes that have influenced the composition of the geothermal fluids in the region similar to the chloride enthalpy diagram two lines were drawn to identify the parent geothermal fluid and investigate its mixing and cooling processes we applied snowmelt water as another endmember in addition to the cold groundwater and parent geothermal fluid endmembers the isotopic compositions of the parent geothermal fluid could be calculated for single steam separation at a given temperature truesdell et al 1977 shoedarto et al 2020 the proportion of vapor phase f v after boiling can be calculated by the following equation 1 f v h 0 h l h v h l where h l and h v are the enthalpies of liquid l and vapor v phases at a given temperature after boiling respectively h 0 is the initial enthalpy of the parent geothermal fluid before boiling the residual fluid holds isotopic equilibrium in the reservoir at the surface temperature assuming that rapid isotopic equilibration occurs between the liquid and vapor phases in the upflows towards the surface after boiling giggenbach 1992a ghomshei and clark 1993 thus the mass conservation of an isotope is given by 2 δ v f v δ l 1 f v δ 0 where δ 0 is the δ value of the isotope in the parent geothermal fluid δ l and δ v are the δ values in the liquid and vapor phases respectively the difference between δ l and δ v can be approximated by the fractionation factor of the isotope at a specific temperature between the liquid and vapor phases α bottinga and craig 1968 3 δ l δ v 1000 ln α l v consequently the δ value of the isotope in the parent geothermal fluid can be determined by the following equation d amore et al 1993 4 δ 0 δ l f v 1000 ln α l v in the temperature range from 0 c to 374 1 c ln α values for δd and δ18o can be calculated by the following equations horita et al 1995 5 1000 ln α l v δ 18 o 7 685 6 71123 10 3 t 1 6664 10 6 t 2 0 35041 10 9 t 3 6 1000 ln α l v δ d 1158 8 t 3 10 9 1620 1 t 2 10 6 794 84 t 10 3 161 04 2 9992 10 9 t 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry of geothermal waters physical properties stable isotopic compositions and major and trace elements of the water samples analyzed are shown in tables 1 and 2 the ph values of the geothermal waters varied from 7 2 to 8 56 which indicates neutral to alkaline conditions in this study we divided geothermal waters into two categories type i geothermal waters are situated in the basin qbq qnh and zcs sites and type ii geothermal waters are situated in the mountain areas zh lc and xh sites fig 3 presents the composition of gonghe groundwater in a trilinear piper plot it showed that some geothermal waters were compositionally similar to cold waters and plotted under the same area the blue shadow area in the plot hence it was suggested that the waters might have been mixed with cold groundwater during up flow fig 3 also demonstrates that the geothermal waters in the basin are distinct from the geothermal waters in the mountain areas the type i geothermal waters were of the na cl na cl so4 and na so4 cl types the type ii geothermal waters were of na so4 and na so4 cl types the type i geothermal waters have elevated concentrations of cl mostly range from 300 to 900 mg l table 2 whereas the type ii geothermal waters have low cl concentrations range from 30 to 180 mg l table 2 the high concentrations of cl in high temperature geothermal waters mainly originated from the mixing with magmatic fluid lowenstern et al 2012 guo et al 2014 tian et al 2018 in addition the elevated concentration of cl could not be caused by brine because the reservoir formation in the gonghe basin was of granitic composition thus it seems that certain geothermal waters in the basin mixed with magmatic fluid and there is a parent geothermal fluid in the gonghe basin 4 2 chloride enthalpy constraints on the presence of the parent geothermal fluid we applied the cl enthalpy model to investigate the hydrogeochemicalprocesses of all geothermal waters and to constraint the presence of the parent geothermal fluid as shown in fig 4 applying this in section 4 2 we successfully identified the presence of a parent geothermal fluid fig 4 suggests that the enthalpy of the parent geothermal fluid is 1410 j g 310 c from the international steam tables and the cl concentration of the parent geothermal fluid is 600 mg l accordingly the type i geothermal waters were derived from the parent geothermal fluid however the type ii geothermal waters did not originate from the parent geothermal fluid which indicated that these geothermal waters may have derived from meteoric water or snowmelt water that were not affected by the parent geothermal fluid overall these results indicate the possible presence of a parent geothermal fluid which led to the formation of the type i geothermal waters the composition of the parent geothermal fluid is crucial for investigating deep fluid origin hence we analyzed the li b and f concentrations of the parent geothermal fluid by applying the method proposed by aguilera et al 2005 the li b and f concentrations were regressed against cl excluding the samples that affected other secondary processes high cl and low trace elements concentrations as shown in fig s1 samples with high cl and low trace elements concentrations were the low enthalpy springs g04 g06 g19 g20 and g22 in the qbq geothermal area low trace element concentrations of these samples were attributed due to the mixing with cold groundwater the high cl concentration may be because of the unconsolidated sediments containing salts covering the reservoir rock the li b and f concentrations were obtained by using the cl concentration of the parent geothermal fluid 600 mg l fig s1 also illustrates the regression equations describing mixing processes the calculated li b and f concentrations of the parent geothermal fluid were 7 71 24 57 7 91 mg l respectively the characteristic of trace elements will be discussed in the following section 4 5 4 3 chloride deuterium constraints on the presence of the parent geothermal fluid we applied the cl δd model proposed by truesdell et al 1977 to constrain the presence of the parent geothermal fluid and verify the results obtained from the cl enthalpy model with the assumption that the steam separates at a given temperature in a single process we calculated the isotopic compositions of the parent geothermal fluid using equations 1 6 the δd value and cl concentration of the parent geothermal fluid were 97 and 600 mg l fig 5 shows a deuterium chloride diagram the results indicated that the type i geothermal waters derived from the parent geothermal fluid whereas the type ii geothermal waters did not therefore the mixing and cooling processes of geothermal fluids illustrated from the two models were consistent the δd values and cl concentrations of the type ii geothermal waters were lower than those type i geothermal waters there might be another recharge source for the type ii geothermal waters considering that the mountains are covered by snow in august we also included the δd and δ18o value of the snowmelt water in the netp δ18o 17 δd 123 as an end member fan et al 2015 fig 5 indicates that the type ii geothermal waters originate from the snowmelt water and are not affected by the parent geothermal fluid in addition fig 5 also suggests that the parent geothermal fluid is also rooted in snowmelt water intriguingly fig 5 illustrates that several samples have an increasing cl concentration along with the cooling trend in other words several samples have higher cl concentrations than the parent geothermal fluid notably these samples were obtained from mainly low enthalpy springs g04 g06 g19 g20 and g22 in the qbq geothermal area except for five high enthalpy springs g32 g33 g34 g35 and g36 in the qnh geothermal area fig 5 and table 2 the reservoir of these low enthalpy springs is fine sandstone and mudstone which are covered by unconsolidated sediments containing salts fig 1d liu et al 2016 hou et al 2019 this could have contributed to the higher cl concentration as for the five high enthalpy springs in the qnh geothermal area steam could be separated from the parent geothermal fluid and be lost during an adiabatic cooling process truesdell and fournier 1976 truesdell et al 1977 li et al 2015 the cl concentration of the five high enthalpy springs in the qnh geothermal area increased due to the vapor loss from geothermal fluid 4 4 isotopic characteristics of the geothermal system we revealed the relationship between δd and δ18o of all waters by the δd vs δ18o plot fig 6 fig 6 depicts that all the surface water samples and some geothermal waters samples plot close to the local meteoric water line lmwl and global meteoric water line gmwl demonstrating their meteoric origin for the type i geothermal water the δ18o values range from 11 1 to 8 0 and the δd values range from 85 0 to 59 0 the δ18o and δd values of the type ii geothermal water vary from 13 0 to 11 8 and 97 1 to 89 respectively table 1 and fig 6 the type ii geothermal waters are depleted in δd and δ18o compared to the type i geothermal waters which indicates a different origin the magmatic fluid distribution δ18o 10 2 δd 20 10 giggenbach 1992b and snowmelt water isotopes δ18o 17 δd 123 fan et al 2015 were plotted as two end members in fig 6 the estimated δd and δ18o values of the parent geothermal fluid were about 97 and 12 and they were plotted in the mixing zone of magmatic fluid and snowmelt water in fig 6 this indicated that the parent geothermal fluid originated from snowmelt water and mixed with the magmatic fluid in addition fig 6 shows that the type i geothermal waters are derived from the parent geothermal fluid and some geothermal waters are mixed with cold groundwater the type ii geothermal waters originate from the snowmelt water and are not affected by the parent geothermal fluid based on the above analysis we suggest that the parent geothermal fluid exists within the crust of the gonghe basin this result was consistent with the analyses of the enthalpy chloride and deuterium chloride diagrams 4 5 trace elements of geothermal fluids trace elements also act as conservative elements in geothermal waters and are essential for understanding deep geochemical processes and mass transfer in high temperature geothermal systems kaasalainen and stefánsson 2012 wang et al 2020 barberio et al 2021 the trace element compositions of geothermal waters are given in table 2 we presented the trace element concentrations of b li rb and cs in box and whiskers diagram as shown in fig 7 the type i geothermal waters have high b 0 26 26 42 mg l li 0 10 9 47 mg l rb 0 12 967 μg l and cs 0 07 2721 μg l concentrations whereas the type ii geothermal waters have lower b 0 92 5 94 mg l li 1 00 4 30 mg l rb 123 280 μg l and cs 306 663 μg l concentrations table 2 and fig 7 in addition several samples g04 g18 g19 g20 and g22 have low trace element concentrations because of mixing with cold groundwater water rock reactions are the main enrichment mechanism of alkali metals in high temperature geothermal fluids giggenbach and goguel 1989 kaasalainen and stefánsson 2012 intriguingly zhang et al 2016 calculated the mineral saturation indices of geothermal water samples in the gonghe basin using phreeqc code and found no lithium containing mineral as we mentioned before the type i geothermal waters were derived from the parent geothermal fluid which mixed with magmatic fluid in addition a high concentration of these trace elements is also associated with magmatic volatiles such as b as li rb and cs in a high temperature system with a magmatic heat source ellis and mahon 1964 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 b can also be released readily from host rocks guo 2012 and obtained from magmatic fluids arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 liu et al 2019 the highest b concentration in the sampled geothermal waters is 26 42 mg l compared with geothermal waters in the yangbajing and tengchong rehai high temperature geothermal systems with magmatic heat sources it was lower than the average b concentration of yangbajing 119 mg l guo et al 2012 and is equivalent to the average b concentration of rehai 20 mg l guo et al 2012 notably the depths of magmatic heat sources in yangbajing and tengchong rehai are much shallower than in gonghe basin therefore the effect of magmatic fluid input is not negligible in addition lü et al 2014 analyzed b concentrations and isotope compositions of yangbajing geothermal waters and suggested that the source of b was primarily from b enriched crustal country rocks therefore we suggest that the high concentrations of b li rb and cs are contributed by the magmatic fluids and from the leaching of host rocks granodiorite 4 6 geophysical interpretation and heat flow analysis results the parent geothermal fluid we identified below the gonghe basin had a temperature of 310 c we compared the characteristic of the parent geothermal fluid and partial melt zone in the gonghe basin to those of a typical high temperature system with a magmatic heat source as shown in table 3 generally parent geothermal fluids do not exhibit such a high temperature without the presence of an additional magmatic heat source thus the deeper lrlvz observed via geophysical methods could be a partial melt zone fig 8 and fig s2 based on the average temperature gradient of the gonghe basin 40 45 c km zhang et al 2018a we estimated the depth of the parent geothermal fluid as ranging from 6 8 to 7 8 km table 3 table 3 suggests that the circulation depth of the parent geothermal fluid is also controlled by the depth of the magmatic heat source magma chamber or partial melt zone the shallower the magmatic heat source the stronger the magmatic signal in geothermal water e g yangbajing tengchong rehai and yellowstone national park coincidently another lrlvz at a depth 5 10 km below the gonghe surface was identified by mt and seismic inversion fig 8 and fig s2 the geophysical interpretations showed that the parent geothermal fluid exists in the crust of the gonghe basin and could be connected to the partial melt zone via large scale faults the terrestrial heat flow should be high if there is a magmatic heat source in the region a previous heat flow study suggested that the average heat flow of gonghe basin was 102 2 mw m2 zhang et al 2018a therefore gonghe basin has a high heat flow and the heat anomaly is most likely to be influenced by an additional heat source such as a magmatic heat source in addition the presence of an additional heat source could be constrained by the heat flow partition analysis zhang et al 2020a based on the vertical heat flow distribution calculated by zhang et al 2020a we modified the diagram of the contributions of heat flow from individual layers of the gonghe basin as shown in fig 9 fig 9 shows that the heat production of crustal sections was 48 3 mw m2 which accounted for 47 3 of the terrestrial heat flow furthermore zhang et al 2020a suggested that the regional mantle heat flow was 27 mw m2 by applying terrestrial heat flow analysis fig 9 deng et al 2018 suggested that the velocity of the mantle beneath the gonghe basin was fast which indicates a relatively cooler mantle temperature this was consistent with the low heat flow of the regional mantle the sum of the heat production of the crust and the mantle heat flow was 75 3 mw m2 which was inconsistent with the average value of heat flow of the gonghe basin 102 2 mw m2 thus the most likely explanation for this additional heat flow contribution is the heat contribution from the partial melt zone which is approximately 27 mw m2 fig 9 zhang et al 2020a 4 7 helium isotopes in geothermal gases according to the analysis above we authenticated the possibility of a partial melt zone however whether the heat source originates from the upper mantle or exclusively from melts in the lower crust remains uncertain helium isotopes provide evidence of the influences of mantle derived volatiles because 3he is from the mantle and 4he is mainly from the crust o nions and oxburgh 1988 tian et al 2018 the he isotope data measured for the spring gases in the gonghe basin are shown in table 4 we used 4he 20ne ratios to estimate the content of air contamination we plotted all gas samples in the 3he 4he vs 4he 20ne diagram fig 10 as shown in fig 10 and table 4 the he ratios of all samples range from 0 01 ra to 0 18 ra indicating that the he in the gonghe basin primarily has a crustal source we calculated the percentage of mantle derived he by using he and ne isotopes sano et al 1982 the contribution of the mantle is 0 0 4 table 4 tectonic activities including mantle upwelling and crustal deformation control the distribution of geothermal resources and modify the composition of geothermal fluids kong et al 2020b barberio et al 2021 jolie et al 2021 yangbajing a world famous geothermal system hosts a magmatic heat source which was identified as re melted continental crust pham et al 1986 zhao et al 2002 duo 2003 guo et al 2012 similarly the percentage of mantle derived he is not higher than 3 zhao et al 2002 thus we suggest that the partial melt zone beneath the gonghe basin promotes melting in the crust instead of mantle upwelling fig 11 provides the conceptual model of the heat generation mechanism of the gonghe basin the radiogenic heat flow contribution of the thickened crust and the cooling of the partial melt zone in the lower crust are the primary heat sources in the gonghe basin meteoric water and snowmelt water infiltrate deeply into the crust through the regional faults and mix with magmatic fluids to form the parent geothermal fluid the parent geothermal fluid is rooted in snowmelt water and magmatic fluid most geothermal waters are derived from the parent geothermal fluid while some originate directly from snowmelt water 5 implication for the deformation mechanisms of tp based on the previous studies of the lithospheric structure of the netp gao et al 2013 guo et al 2016 huang et al 2020 2021 ye et al 2016 we suggest that the decoupling deformation between the upper and middle to lower crust promote the partial melt zone as shown in fig 12 a major detachment fault zone results in a decoupled deformation between the upper and middle crust the decoupling between the upper and middle to lower crust could dominate the lithosphere and promote the partial melt zone our results indicate that the lrlvz in the gonghe crust is a partial melt zone which might serve as an intra crustal decollement combined with the previous findings on the lvlrz usually interpreted as a partial melt zone distribution in the netp le pape et al 2012 li et al 2014 wang et al 2017 deng et al 2018 it seems that the partial melt zone is ubiquitous in the middle to lower crust of the netp this is consistent with the lateral extruding structure of the netp caused by the india eurasia collision since the middle miocene furthermore the regional heat flow distribution jiang et al 2019 indicated a similar pattern for the partial melt zone distribution therefore we suggest that the partial melt zone is the primary heat source of the netp based on previous research most cenozoic tectonic activities were related to the regional structure of local blocks within the crustal scale ye et al 2016 the widespread intra crustal weak layers may also be indicative of partial melt zones the proposed seismic profile across the junction of the northern margin of the western qilian mountains and the hexi corridor reveals the decoupled crustal deformation partitioned by the intra crustal decollement layer at a depth of 14 24 km huang et al 2021 this potentially plays a role in the outward growth of the plateau and improves our understanding of the tp crustal structure 6 conclusions in this study we performed a systematic hydro geochemical analysis of the geothermal fluids in the gonghe basin of the netp and identified a parent geothermal fluid by integrating geochemical results geophysical observations and heat flow partition analysis we suggest that the lrlvz beneath the gonghe basin is a partial melt zone which serves as an additional heat source for the heat anomaly of the gonghe basin a conceptual model was presented to illustrate the circulation of deep fluid and its genesis in the gonghe basin the parent geothermal fluid originates from snowmelt water and mixes with a magmatic fluid derived from the partial melt zone the parent geothermal fluid ascends and mixes with cooler water initiating the geothermal reservoirs our findings confirm a partial melt zone beneath the gonghe basin implying that the partial melt zone is ubiquitous in the middle to lower crust of the netp we further point out that the decoupling deformation between the upper and middle crust might be the dominant force forming the partial melt zone the findings reveal the critical role of deep groundwater circulation with the signature of magmatic fluid and will help understand the uplift mechanism of the netp and the aid in the exploration of high temperature geothermal resources credit

4036,in the paper we tested and compared the potential of some standardized meteorological indices to identify agricultural drought impacts in central italy the indices considered are the standardized precipitation index spi the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the reconnaissance drought index rdi and the standardized deficit distance index sddi a new index that is defined and evaluated in this paper sddi is a function of the euclidean distance between the actual p et0 and a reference deficit series p et0 max sddi unlike other indices also considers how the deficit is distributed in a certain span and assigns greater severities when the distribution is uneven e g presence of peaks the comparative analysis refers to 24 provinces of central italy and sunflower a typical non irrigated crop in the area considered the sunflower yield time series 1980 2019 were de trended and standardized for each province finally obtaining standardized yield residuals syrs the climatic data required for calculating the drought indices precipitation and temperatures for each province derive from the e obs gridded dataset with 0 25 resolution in the period 1980 2019 from the minimum and maximum daily temperatures the et0 was estimated by the fao penman monteith equation the drought indices were calculated for different time scales from 1 to 5 months and the months corresponding to the sunflower growing season april august the performance of the various indices in the prediction of syrs was assessed using the pearson correlation coefficient for all the indices the best correlations are found for the 2 month time scale and for july spi s performance is only slightly lower than that of the indices that integrate both precipitation and evapotranspiration spei rdi sddi among these sddi and spei provide somewhat better results considering both the percentage of significant correlation 63 and 67 respectively and the corresponding mean correlation 0 49 and 0 48 respectively sddi demonstrates good potential in assessing agricultural drought impacts while maintaining the advantage of limited data input keywords standardized precipitation index standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index reconnaissance drought index standardized yield residuals standardized deficit distance index 1 introduction over the last few decades several areas of the world have experienced warmer and drier conditions with a consequent increase in high severity drought events fao 2008 giddens 2011 van loon et al 2016 due to global warming ipcc 2014 future conditions will be even worse and agriculture due to its direct dependence on climate and water resources will be among the most sensitive and affected sectors therefore the assessment of drought risk in agriculture is crucial information for decision makers intending to mitigate drought related crop losses the identification and quantification of drought conditions generally present more difficulties in comparison to other natural hazards indeed droughts are creeping phenomena wilhite and glantz 1985 with an uncertain onset and end in the assessment of agricultural droughts further difficulties occur because they depend not only on climatic conditions but also on how these conditions interact with the soil crop and farm characteristics and impact agricultural production parsons et al 2019 despite this complexity agricultural droughts are often monitored and quantified using simple meteorological variables or indices generally based on precipitation only or also on temperature or evapotranspiration this information is in fact easy to retrieve on a large scale and can be effectively implemented in national or continental monitoring and early warning systems such as the european drought observatory for europe or the us drought monitor for the united states bachmair et al 2018 alternative approaches in agricultural drought monitoring are becoming more and more present thanks to remote sensing technologies examples are the use of vegetation indices e g gu et al 2007 lu et al 2015 ali et al 2019 huang et al 2020 or soil moisture indicators martínez fernández et al 2016 however as underlined by bachmair et al 2018 these innovative approaches still require extensive validation and usually they must be integrated with meteorological data or indices on the other hand the correct application of meteorological indices in agricultural drought monitoring makes it essential to evaluate their effectiveness in describing the corresponding impacts quiring and papakryiakou 2003 this objective was sought in several papers either at the global vicente serrano et al 2012 continental blauhut et al 2015 stagge et al 2015a bachmair et al 2018 or national regional quiring and papakryiakou 2003 wang et al 2016 chen et al 2016 potopová et al 2016 peña gallardo et al 2018 tian et al 2018 scale by analyzing the correlation between a certain type of meteorological variable or index and an indicator of its impact on agriculture in most cases the impact indicator is represented by the observed time series of actual crop yield or by qualitative datasets of crop productivity blauhut et al 2015 stagge et al 2015a bachmair et al 2018 the reference context is always that of rainfed agriculture since its vulnerability mostly depends on climatic conditions in some cases e g halwatura et al 2017 soil moisture is considered a proxy of agricultural impact the meteorological index is usually a standardized drought index or more than one index may be used to compare their performances for example vicente serrano et al 2012 evaluated at a global level the performances of different versions of the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 against the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 similar comparisons can be found in peña gallardo et al 2019 for spain in liu et al 2018 for china and in peña gallardo et al 2018 and tian et al 2018 for the usa often the analyses involved comparisons between the spi and spei as in potop et al 2012 gunst et al 2015 labudová et al 2017 and parsons et al 2019 some studies adopted the reconnaissance drought index rdi such as tigkas and tsakiris 2015 these comparative studies show that the effectiveness of standardized indices in predicting agricultural drought impacts varies significantly with the crop the index type the index time scale and the region generally the spi and spei perform better than the pdsi vicente serrano et al 2012 peña gallardo et al 2018 tian et al 2018 between the spi and spei the latter usually offers better performance chen et al 2016 vicente serrano et al 2012 labudová et al 2017 even on this point however there are no unequivocal conclusions for example bachmair et al 2018 and parsons et al 2019 indicate that the spi is usually better than the spei in continental europe and that only in southern europe mediterranean areas the spei is more effective than the spi due to the relevant effect of et0 under warmer climatic conditions concerning the time scale short scales of three months or a maximum of six months prove more effective than longer time scales a common problem described in the literature is the impossibility of referring to univocal indications when large areas are considered indeed the larger an area is the higher the variability of the drought influencing factors such as soils and crop varieties also if standardized indices are used the same index value can correspond to very different soil moisture conditions bachmair et al 2018 for this reason specific and accurate assessments of national and regional drought meteorological indicators against reported impacts are useful for italy despite the fact that several authors have described the space time variability of meteorological drought indices in different regions e g baronetti et al 2020 in northern italy buttafuoco et al 2015 in southern italy and di lena et al 2014 in central italy no studies addressed the relationship between drought indices and agricultural impacts from a quantitative perspective some information for italy can only be found in gunst et al 2015 which analyzed the relationships between meteorological drought indices spi and spei and crop yields wheat barley maize and sugar beet for several european territorial units nuts2 however they didn t find significant relationships for italy and mediterranean areas in general the probable reason is that maize and sugar beet are typically irrigated crops while wheat and barley are grown in the wet season for which yield reductions due to water shortages occur very rarely moreover most standardized meteorological indices such as the spi spei and rdi only depend on the cumulative amounts of p and et0 in a given multi month period without considering the internal distribution of those variables this characteristic excludes the possibility of adequately assessing the impact of deficit peaks which in the approaches mentioned above could be wholly mitigated or masked by preceding or subsequent sub periods of surplus in most biological processes e g crop yield such a balancing effect does not always occur and deficit peaks can have dramatic impacts the main objectives of the present study are 1 to evaluate the effectiveness of some standardized meteorological indices in the identification of agricultural drought impacts in central italy and 2 to define and test the potential of the new standardized deficit distance index sddi the sddi presents a calculation algorithm detailed in section 2 3 4 that allows the consideration of the uneven dynamics of water deficit in a given multi month period the performance of the sddi against some well known standardized indices spi spei and rdi was evaluated and discussed in relation to the sunflower crop yield in central italy sunflower is grown here typically in rainfed conditions thus representing an excellent reference for assessing the reliability of meteorological drought indices in agricultural drought assessment 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study refers to 24 provinces of central italy between latitudes41 and 44 5 n and longitudes 10 and 15 e fig 1 with a total area of about 72 157 km2 in central italy the climate is predominantly mediterranean summers are warm to hot and winters are generally mild but colder in inland areas and at higher altitudes the wettest season is the autumn and the driest the summer in this season months with zero or near zero rainfall amounts may occasionally occur the territory is mainly hilly and mountainous fig 1 in hilly areas tree crops olives and vines and forage crops prevail while herbaceous crops mainly wheat maize tobacco sunflower grain legumes and vegetable crops are widespread in the plains most of the crops grown in summer require an irrigation supply due to the considerable imbalance between precipitation and evapotranspiration 2 2 data 2 2 1 meteorological data we retrieved the meteorological data from the e obs ensemble dataset cornes et al 2018 at a 0 25 degree resolution accessed onnovember 28th 2019 the variables used include daily minimum and maximum temperature tmin and tmax respectively and daily precipitation p for the period 1980 2019 then we assigned single daily time series of tmin tmax and p to each province using the functions available in the r packages ncdf4 pierce 2019 and raster hijmans 2020 at this point we overlapped the province areas to the e obs grid and by a weighted average function based on the actual province area included in each e obs cell we derived a single time series for each variable considered after this procedure the daily series of reference evapotranspiration et0 mm day for each province were calculated using the temperature based penman monteith equation tpm allen et al 1998 this simplified method was chosen due to the lack of detailed data on solar radiation air humidity and wind speed which were computed following the estimating procedures and formulae provided in allen et al 1998 in particular for wind speed we assumed as suggested a constant value of 2 m s and for the latitude necessary for the calculation of the extraterrestrial radiation we used that of the province centroid several studies under different climatic conditions e g pandey and pandey 2016 lópez moreno et al 2009 have shown that the tpm method leads to limited errors compared to the fao penman monteith equation faopm furthermore these errors tend to decrease further when the comparison between tpm and faopm is based on the monthly cumulative et0 values such as those required for the calculation of the spei rdi and sddi moreover some authors e g beguería et al 2013 tigkas and tsakiris 2015 indicate that in most climatic conditions the et0 calculation method does not significantly affect the values of indices such as the spei or rdi therefore we consider the et0 obtained from the tpm method adequate for the purpose and characteristics of the study daily data were finally aggregated to the monthly time scale obtaining a database of 480 24 data points for each variable p tmin tmax et0 the mean values of precipitation and evapotranspiration for the year the winter january february march jfm the spring april may june amj the summer july august september jas and the autumn october november december ond are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively in those figures the provinces on the x axis are in increasing order of centroid latitude from fig 2 it is evident that the precipitation is characterized by a certain south to north increasing gradient which is not evident for et0 fig 3 summer jas is the season with the lowest rainfall and the highest evapotranspiration consumption both summer and spring amj are characterized by an average precipitation lower than evapotranspiration p et0 0 2 2 2 crop yield data the crop considered is sunflower a widespread crop in central italy in the spring summer growing season the typical growing cycle is between april sowing and august physiological maturation the crop is usually cultivated under rainfed conditions taking advantage of the high root depth of the crop steduto et al 2012 the growth period is earlier than that of other summer crops e g maize and therefore it is characterized by a more favorable balance between p and et0 fig 2 and fig 3 of course the seasonal climatic conditions greatly influence the sunflower crop yield which for this reason can be considered an excellent indicator of agricultural drought impacts in italy the reference source for the large scale data of the yield mg and cultivated areas ha of the various crops is the istat italian national institute of statistics which reports that information for each province fig 1 during the 1990s three provinces were split to create three other new provinces in this work however we referred to the provinces existing in 1980 fig 1 the yield data of the provinces resulting from the divisions were aggregated by a weighted average on the corresponding cultivated areas and reassigned to the old provinces we computed sunflower yields mg ha 1 as the ratio between each province s overall annual year production and the corresponding crop area the data collected refer to the period 1980 2019 with an interruption between 1994 and 2000 in some cases the sample size is further reduced due to a lack of surveys or due to provincial cultivated areas that were to small we did not consider reliable yields corresponding to areas less than 100 ha however the sample size is always greater than 27 years except for the provinces of pistoia and l aquila with 25 and 7 years of yield data respectively the spatial variability of the mean annual yields mg ha 1 and the corresponding coefficients of variation are represented in fig 4 from fig 4 it is evident that in most western provinces sunflower yields are lower and more variable than in the rest of the area the yield data quality is medium low since yields can refer even for the same province to extremely different conditions e g crop varieties soil characteristics disease and weed control moreover although the sunflower s agronomic practice in central italy is typically rainfed we cannot completely rule out the use of irrigation in particular in irrigation districts where water is not limited farmers could occasionally irrigate sunflowers but this information is not available in the istat reports the irrigation of the sunflower is however a very rare practice in central italy and it is not referable to a specific province for this reason even if this aspect can represent a disturbing element in the correlation analysis objective of this work it can be considered a random error not able to affect the comparative analysis significantly i e in a preferential direction however in this type of analysis it is important to focus only on the yield variability due to climatic factors therefore yields were de trended and standardized following the procedure described in potopová et al 2016 to eliminate the effect of usually positive trends due to the introduction of new management practices and technologies or more productive varieties to this end we fitted the time series of the yield data of each province to a second order polynomial model the de trended yields ydt have then obtained as the difference between the observed and the model estimated yields trend component the ydt were finally standardized to obtain the so called standardized yield residuals syrs 1 syrs y dt μ σ where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of ydt respectively as indicated by potopová et al 2016 the syrs are only affected by the climatic conditions and an error component i e fluctuations caused by random factors 2 3 drought indices the analysis was based on some well known standardized drought indices that are used worldwide which are calculated on the basis of precipitation only or both precipitation and reference evapotranspiration the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and the reconnaissance drought index rdi tsakiris and vangelis 2005 moreover the new standardized deficit distance index sddi was also defined and applied 2 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi a detailed description of the spi can be found in the mckee et al 1993 and several successive works where the index has been applied and discussed e g stagge et al 2015b here the main calculation steps and characteristics are briefly summarized the calculation of the spi starts with the fitting of a suitable probability density function pdf to a long term series of cumulative precipitation p i j k related to a given end month j j 1 12 and accumulation period k or time scale the subscript i i 1 n indicates the ith year of the time series of length n the fitting is carried out separately for each combination of month and time scale to take into account the differences due to seasonality once the pdf is determined the cumulative probability f p i j k of each observed precipitation amount p i j k can be estimated the corresponding spi i j k is finally obtained as 2 spi i j k φ 1 f p i j k where φ 1 denotes the inverse cumulative standard normal distribution a preliminary comparative analysis based on the akaike information criterion aic laio et al 2009 was conducted to determine the most suitable pdf for the variable p i j k considering similar evaluations conducted in the literature e g stagge et al 2015b vergni et al 2017 the comparison was limited to some 2 parameter distributions i e gamma weibull log normal and normal robust estimates of the distribution parameters were obtained from l moments hosking 1990 the analysis showed that the gamma distribution allows us to get the best performances lowest values of aic at all time scales from 1 to 24 months and it was therefore chosen as the pdf in the calculation of the spi however aic scores very similar to those of the gamma distribution are also obtained from the weibull distribution at the 1 month time scale and from the log normal distribution at the 12 and 24 month time scales 2 3 2 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the spei was proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 to overcome a relevant shortcoming of the spi i e the neglect of temperature or evapotranspiration variables which in a global warming context can represent a key factor in drought assessment the steps required for spei calculation are however quite similar to those described above for the spi instead of cumulative precipitation the reference variable in this case is the cumulative water balance d i j k i e p i j k e t 0 i j k the value of the spei for a given time scale k month j and year i can finally be obtained with eq 2 by just replacing f p i j k with f d i j k the best fitting distribution of d i j k was determined by the aic criterion comparing the pearson type iii log logistic generalized extreme value and normal distributions which have been already evaluated as potential candidate distributions for the spei stagge et al 2015b the distributions considered present very similar aic scores at all the time scales from 1 to 24 months with the exception of the normal which has slightly higher aic values therefore the log logistic distribution was chosen considering that it is also used in the original algorithm described by vicente serrano et al 2010 2 3 3 reconnaissance drought index rdi the rdi proposed by tsakiris and vangelis 2005 is another example of a meteorological index that integrates precipitation and evapotranspiration the reference variable is the ratio α i j k p i j k e t 0 i j k which is then standardized following a procedure analogous to both the spi and spei the most suitable pdf for α i j k was determined by comparing the aic scores for the gamma weibull log normal and normal distributions the lowest aic scores were obtained by the gamma distribution at all of the time scales considered from 1 to 24 months therefore the gamma distribution was adopted as the underlying distribution of the variable α i j k in accordance with the previous literature e g tigkas and tsakiris 2015 2 3 4 standardized deficit distance index sddi for the calculation of the standardized deficit distance index sddi first of all it is necessary to derive for each month j j 1 12 and year i i 1 n the climatic water balance dj i d i j p i j e t 0 i j 3 then for each calendar month j the maximum and minimum values of di j dmaxj and dminj respectively observed in the series of length n are computed 4 dma x j m a x d i j i 1 n j 1 12 5 dmi n j m i n d i j i 1 n j 1 12 a new monthly series δmaxi j is then derived as the difference between dmaxj and each di j 6 δ m a x i j dmax j d i j i 1 n j 1 12 after choosing an end month j and a time scale k the reference variable dd i j k for each year i of the time series is computed as dd i j k m j k 1 j δ m a x i m d m a x m dmin m 2 i 1 n 7 it can be noted that for a given month m the ratio δ m a x d m a x d m i n expresses a relative deficit condition varying between 0 when δ m a x i m 0 i e di m dmaxm and 1 when δ m a x i m d m a x m d m i n m i e di m dminm according to eq 7 the variable dd i j k is non negative and can theoretically assume values between 0 i e minimum deficit when the δ m a x i m 0 for all of the months included in the period of k months and k i e maximum deficit when δ m a x i m 1 for all of the months included in the period of k months dd i j k is conceptually analogous to the variables mentioned above p i j k d i j k and α i j k on which the spi spei and rdi are respectively based however dd i j k increases as the water stress increases thus exhibiting a behavior opposite to p i j k d i j k and α i j k the value of the sddi is finally computed by standardizing the variable dd i j k 8 sddi i j k φ 1 f dd i j k where f dd i j k is the cumulative probability of dd i j k in the paper the cumulative probability f dd i j k was computed by fitting an empirical distribution frequency edf to the dd i j k samples for each combination of month and time scale the edf approach was preferred to that of fitting theoretical probability distributions pdfs given the modest size of the samples 40 values and given the lack of previous literature dealing with the probability distribution of the variable dd i j k however a comparative analysis among some 2 parameter distributions based on the akaike information criterion indicated that the normal and weibull distributions are often the best in fitting dd i j k the minus sign in 8 allows us to have a standardized index with a reference scale equal to that of other similar indices as shown in table 1 the name chosen for the index derives from the fact that the variable dd depends on the euclidean distance between the series of the actual deficit d in a generic span of length k and the series of dmax i e the condition representing for each month the maximum historical surplus of p with respect to et0 moreover the difference between dmax and d is expressed in relative terms dividing by dmax dmin to consider the climatic differences among months the higher dd is the higher the deficit as stated by faloutsos et al 1994 the euclidean distance is one of the most used and effective measures of similitude among two series unlike the simple cumulative deficit the euclidean distance increases with the presence of peaks or uneven distributions of the total deficit this property should better describe the impact of water deficit peaks on crop production plaut 2003 the example illustrated in fig 5 is useful to understand the rationale behind the algorithm of the sddi and the differences with respect to the spi spei and rdi let s suppose that in two generic years a and b the precipitation observed for april may june and july is 270 10 60 and 20 mm year a and 70 90 90 and 110 mm year b the reference evapotranspiration et0 for the same months is respectively 90 130 140 and 150 mm for both years for simplicity s sake let s also suppose that dmax and dmin are the same for april may june and july and equal to 200 and 140 mm respectively for the time scale k 4 months including april may june and july we get for both years p i j k 360 mm d i j k 150 mm and α i j k p i j k e t 0 i j k 0 71 this means that the two years considered are equivalent in terms of the spi spei and rdi computed for july and a 4 month time scale instead dd i j k 270 90 200 140 2 10 130 200 140 2 60 140 200 140 2 20 150 200 140 2 1 58 for year a and dd i j k 70 90 200 140 2 90 130 200 140 2 90 140 200 140 2 110 150 200 140 2 1 40 for year b therefore the sddi is able to capture the difference between the years a and b assigning a higher value i e higher deficit to year a with respect to year b this is due to the higher euclidean distance between d and dmax but implicitly between p and et0 in year a with respect to year b the sddi index is expected to overcome some shortcomings of the spi spei and rdi when they are applied in the context of agricultural droughts or more generally in any biological ecological and hydrological context for which uneven distributions of the deficit can have serious impacts it should be noted in fact that the variables p d and α on which the spi spei and rdi are respectively based not only do not consider how the deficit is distributed in the period of length k but any surpluses in previous months could lead to a complete compensation of the deficits in the following months this approach is not very suitable for an assessment of drought impacts on crops in particular on annual crops indeed crops can benefit from any previous surplus only to a limited extent depending on the temporal distance and the soil retention capacity recently tian et al 2020 proposed an index based on a ratio similar to δ m a x d m a x d m i n their index however does not solve the problem of the compensatory effects illustrated in the previous paragraphs of course the differences between the spei or spi or rdi and sddi are expected to increase with the time scale due to the higher probability of compensatory effects among the months considered 2 3 5 other indices some literature e g rey et al 2016 dealing with meteorological indices for agricultural drought monitoring also considers the maximum potential soil moisture deficit psmd rodríguez díaz et al 2007 for comparison purpose the psmd at the generic time t i e month is computed as 9 psmd t psmd t 1 e t 0 t p t in months where pt psmdt 1 et0t any initial soil moisture deficit is filled and hence psmdt 0 in the paper for every province and year the maximum pmsd pmsdmax of the months from april to august corresponding to the sunflower growth period was computed and used in the correlation analysis with the syrs in the application of eq 4 we always assumed psmdt 0 for march 2 4 methods 2 4 1 assessment of the similarity and differences between indices considering that the analysis includes the new index sddi we conducted a preliminary evaluation of the similarities and differences between the drought indices to this end we quantified both the well known pearson correlation coefficient r and the coefficient of agreement k cohen 1960 vergni et al 2021 between the corresponding time series of drought indices for the calculation of k the severity categories assigned to each month of the time series by two generic indices according to table 1 are arranged in a confusion matrix and the k is computed as follows 10 k p o p e 1 p e where po is the total observed frequency of agreement and pe is the proportion of agreement expected by chance in practice k indicates how much the observational frequency of agreement is in excess of the frequency of agreement pe expected under a random classification the strength of agreement based on k can be qualitatively expressed as follow landis and koch 1977 almost perfect 1 k 0 81 substantial 0 80 k 0 61 moderate 0 60 k 0 41 fair 0 40 k 0 21 slight 0 2 k 0 poor k 0 as vergni et al 2021 explained the coefficient k is more effective than the traditional correlation coefficient r in evaluating the actual similarity between drought indices in fact similar temporal patterns i e high correlation can conceal differences in the severities value or category particularly during extreme events more details about the k coefficient and its particular use for drought indices comparison can be found in vergni et al 2021 in this preliminary comparative analysis the indices were computed at 1 3 6 12 and 24 month time scales 2 4 2 effectiveness of the meteorological indices in the identification of agricultural droughts the performance of the various indices in the prediction of sunflower syrs was assessed using the pearson correlation coefficient the indices have been calculated by adopting time scales 1 2 3 4 and 5 months and months april august useful to describe the drought conditions during the sunflower growth period of course for other crops or purposes e g hydrological droughts different time scales and months should be considered 3 results 3 1 comparison between indices the summary results of the correlation analysis between the indices time series are given in fig 6 which shows the variability of the correlations average of all provinces with both the time scale 1 3 6 12 and 24 months and the seasons the correlations among the spi spei and rdi are always higher than 0 82 and in most cases the correlation variability with both the season and the time scale is modest a larger variability can be observed for the summer months this depends on the high summer et0 fig 3 which can lead to a differentiation in the indices values especially in the most extreme situations strong imbalance between p and et0 however this effect is evident for the spi spei or spei rdi correlation but practically absent for the spi rdi correlation the reason may be that the spi and rdi use the same underlying distribution gamma thus reducing the differences in the tails extreme values the correlations spei sddi and rdi sddi are higher than the corresponding spi sddi correlation this was expected since the spei rdi and sddi unlike the spi are based on both p and et0 the spi sddi spei sddi and rdi sddi correlations exhibit similar behaviors i e a general decrease with the time scale in fact considering the sddi algorithm the higher the time scale the higher the possibility to obtain from the sddi a different evaluation of the drought conditions with respect to the other indices which do not consider the deficit distribution along the accumulation period this behavior has some exceptions particularly in summer this is likely due to the not easily predictable effects of dmax and dmin on the sddi finally it can be observed that the correlation between the spi and sddi is always lower than that between the spi and spei and that between the spi and rdi highlighting that the sddi differs more from the spi i e simple precipitation than the spei and rdi do a more detailed comparison between the new drought index sddi and the other indices considered is presented in fig 7 which shows for an example province perugia the scatter plots of the sddi versus the spi rdi and spei at short 1 month medium 6 months and long 24 months time scales from fig 7 it is evident that there is a progressive reduction of the correlation between the sddi and the other indices as the scale increases in particular consistent with eq 7 the differences between the spei and sddi at the 1 month scale are minimal and only attributable to different underlying distributions fig 8 shows the variability of the coefficient of agreement k average of all provinces with the time scale 1 3 6 12 and 24 months for all the possible pairs of drought indices in general the agreement between the indices tends to decrease as the time scale increases an exception is the pair spei rdi whose agreement tends to increase slightly with the time scale the new sddi index shows the least similarity to spi which is moderate at the 3 and 6 month time scales and only fair at the 12 and 24 month time scales the pairs spei sddi and rdi sddi show agreements decidedly lower than that of spei rdi except for the 1 month scale therefore although the correlation values between the indices considered are never lower than 0 75 there are relevant differences in the drought severity classification especially by the new index sddi a last comparison between the four meteorological indices is presented in fig 9 showing the space time variability of the indices in the provinces considered between march 2017 and june 2018 this period includes the severe drought event that affected much of europe in 2017 garcía herrera et al 2019 in this example a medium time scale of 6 months is adopted fig 9 shows that all the indices detect a widespread drought condition between august and october 2017 followed by an almost normal condition around january 2018 and a wet condition between february and june 2018 this general trend is in agreement with the literature e g garcia herrera et al 2019 however there are marked differences between the indices the most evident ones emerge comparing spi with the other indices particularly in the periods e g 10 2017 and 11 2017 in which the 6 month time scale includes the spring and summer months characterized by relevant et0 amounts the new sddi index indicates spatial patterns quite similar to rdi and spei in the onset phases i e 06 2017 and 07 2017 while in the period of maximum severity and spatial diffusion of the drought e g 10 2017 the differences become more evident the most relevant differences between sddi and the other indices appears at the end of the drought period i e 02 2018 in this period sddi detects a normal condition for all the provinces while the other indices show widespread wet conditions in most of the central eastern provinces the explanation lies in the high rainfall amounts of february 2018 in those provinces about 200 mm on average thus the indices based only on the cumulative rainfall or deficit indicate the entire 6 month period ending in february 2018 as moderate or severe wet offering a misleading description of the actual hydrological conditions of the whole period 3 2 correlation analysis between drought indices and sunflower syrs the detailed results of the correlation analysis between syrs and drought indices for different time scales and months are shown in fig 10 in this figure each panel s first and second rows indicate the time scale and end month respectively e g 2 and aug indicate the anomaly related to the months of july and august and so on the magnitude of positive and negative correlations is represented by blue and red gradients respectively table 2 shows some summary results i e the percentage of provinces with significant positive correlation spc and the mean correlation coefficient r spc computed only considering significant positive correlations significant correlations α 10 were determined according to a double tailed student s t test whose result also depends on the actual sample size an overview of fig 10 indicates a prevalence of positive correlations blue hue denoting a general ability of the indices to describe the agricultural drought impacts in fig 10 the provinces are shown in increasing order of latitude but there is not an evident relationship between correlation and latitude hereinafter the generic index x for a given time scale k and end month j will be indicated with the notation xk j e g spi2 7 stands for the spi at a 2 month time scale related to july a few provinces pescara chieti and rieti exhibit poor correlations or even negative correlations with drought indices particularly considering the spi or rdi spi1 8 also exhibits a prevailing negative correlation although it is never significant for the spei the best combinations of time scale and months are spei2 7 r spc 0 48 spc 67 spei1 6 r spc 0 50 spc 54 spei3 8 r spc 0 45 spc 54 and spei1 2 r spc 0 45 spc 42 for the spei the presence of negative correlations is slightly less evident than for the spi the results of the rdi seem more similar to those of the spi than to those of the spei fig 10 on the other hand the rdi and spi always show a high correlation and agreement at the short time scales figs 6 and 8 also for the rdi the best performances are obtained for rdi2 7 r spc 0 49 and spc 54 and rdi1 6 r spc 0 47 and spc 58 other satisfactory results are obtained by rdi3 8 the overall performance of the sddi is very similar to that of all other indices in particular the best results can be found for sddi2 7 r spc 0 49 and spc 63 sddi1 6 r spc 0 50 spc 54 sddi3 8 r spc 0 46 spc 54 and sddi3 7 r spc 0 50 spc 46 the presence of negative correlations is similar to that observed for the spei in regard to the spi fig 10 and table 2 it can be noted that the spi2 7 exhibits the highest mean correlation r spc 0 49 with a percentage of significant positive correlations spc of 46 however the highest spc of 58 is obtained by spi1 6 for which r spc is 0 44 satisfactory performances are also obtained by spi3 8 with r spc 0 44 and spc 42 for all the indices the highest mean correlation r including all provinces is obtained for the 2 month time scale and the month of july r values of 0 31 0 34 0 36 and 0 36 for spi2 7 rdi2 7 spei2 7 and sddi2 7 respectively the correlations of the indices spi2 7 spei2 7 rdi2 7 and sddi2 7 were finally compared by 1 1 plots with the correlations obtained for the pairs psmdmax syrs fig 11 from fig 11 it is evident that all of the standardized indices computed at the 2 month time scale for the month of july outperform psmdmax there is also the confirmation of the slightly better performance of both spei and sddi in comparison to the spi and rdi since the points are almost all below the 1 1 line and further to the right 4 discussion the analysis has shown that the standardized indices related to or including the months of june and july are the most correlated with sunflower crop yields in central italy these results are consistent with the phenological stages of the sunflower in the area considered in fact june and july correspond to the flowering and to the subsequent seed filling stages during which the impact of a water deficit on crop yield is maximum steduto et al 2012 only in a few provinces lucca rieti forlì pescara and chieti is the correlation between drought indices and crop yield very poor at any time scale in some cases lucca rieti and forlì this could be due to the frequent favourable climatic conditions as found by a statistical analysis of the corresponding values of p et0 and d for the pescara and chieti provinces the cause of the general poor correlation is not clear nor it can be attributed to factors such as irrigation given that interviews with local producer organizations have confirmed the very low diffusion of this practice analysing the indices at a 1 month time scale fig 10 and table 2 it is also evident that the meteorological conditions of april may and august are usually not crucial for sunflower crop yield indeed in april and may the crop is not fully developed and its moderate water requirement can generally also be satisfied also in drought years in august the crop has almost completed the critical phases and water deficit conditions have moderate or negligible consequences for this month on the contrary water excess could have counter productive effects and the general negative correlations although not significant obtained for spi1 8 could be related to this aspect significant negative correlations were obtained in a few cases usually for short time scales 1 or 2 months including april and may particularly for the spi spei and rdi and in particular for chieti and rieti provinces the reason could be the presence of adverse meteorological conditions e g water excess or cold periods after seeding but these cases are too few to attempt a robust interpretation the outperformance of all the standardized indices computed at the 2 month time scale for the month of july with respect to psmdmax can be rationalized by the fact that psmdmax includes the water stress of august which is usually high fig 2 and fig 3 but not significant in terms of yield impact as demonstrated by the correlations in fig 10 and table 2 the results can be considered consistent with those reported in the literature where the use of the spi spei and rdi as agricultural drought indicators was assessed potop et al 2012 gunst et al 2015 labudová et al 2017 parsons et al 2019 tigkas and tsakiris 2015 in terms of the time scale medium short time scales are generally suggested 6 months as in parsons et al 2019 but more often around 3 months as in bachmair et al 2018 tigkas and tsakiris 2015 and labudová et al 2017 the latter authors are among the few to have considered the sunflower however they conducted a study in continental europe and sunflower yields were negatively correlated with excess rather than with a deficit of water in the present study it was observed that in central italy for a typical spring summer cycle crop a 2 month or even 1 month time scale including the critical crop growth stages can be considered optimal the study shows that in central italy all the standardized indices considered have very similar performances the average correlations obtained by the indices integrating p and et0 the spei rdi and sddi are only slightly higher than those obtained by the spi also in this case the results are consistent with the literature which does not indicate a univocal conclusion about the advantage of drought indices which include et0 for the crop and area considered in this paper a significant advantage of also including et0 occurs probably occurs only in the years with the most extreme temperatures for the same reason however the use of et0 in the context of climate warming appears appropriate the new index sddi provides satisfactory results equivalent to the spei and slightly better than the rdi which are both based on the same input data i e p and et0 as previously explained one of the strengths of the sddi in agricultural ecological and hydrological applications lies in the possibility of evaluating how the monthly climatic deficits d p et0 are distributed within the period considered with the same cumulative value of d the sddi indicates more or less impactful conditions according to the presence of peaks or uneven distributions of the monthly deficits therefore the sddi represents an attempt to develop an index that while retaining the advantages of the spei or rdi including their dependence only on precipitation and evapotranspiration data could enhance its suitability for drought impact assessment the potential advantage of sddi compared to spei or rdi doesn t emerge clearly in the case study given that the most effective time scale for a drought impact assessment on sunflower crops is only two months at this short scale the spei rdi and sddi cannot differ much as shown by the high correlations and agreements fig 6 fig 7 and fig 8 in other contexts such as those related to perennial crops where longer time scales are required for evaluating the drought impacts the sddi could better highlight its advantages for the same reason the sddi could be particularly useful in the assessment of hydrological drought conditions and impacts as underlined in the analysis of fig 9 we also carried out an analysis based on a variable dd obtained as the simple sum of the ratios δ m a x d m a x d m i n of eq 7 evaluating the correlation of the corresponding standardized index with the sunflower syrs this index at the 2 month time scale of july reached slightly worse performances with respect to the sddi spc of 56 and r spc of 0 47 thus denoting a certain effectiveness of the algorithm of the sddi based on the euclidean distance however also in this case the short time scale limits the possibility to enhance the differences for all of the indices considered improvements in the correlation with the crop yield could be obtained using more crop oriented input variables such as the effective rainfall or crop potential or even actual evapotranspiration however these last modifications already proposed and evaluated in some studies e g ebrahimpour et al 2015 tigkas et al 2016 moorhead et al 2013 pei et al 2019 zarei and moghimi 2019 tigkas et al 2020 require further input data or crop and soil modelling in this first comparative analysis we preferred an assessment based on meteorological input only 5 conclusion in general considering the uncertainty of the data used in the analysis and the variety of factors affecting crop yield beyond water availability the results indicate the general reliability of standardized meteorological indices in assessing agricultural drought conditions in central italy the evaluation was carried out with specific reference to the sunflower yield but the conclusions can be considered valid for all of the other crops having a similar spring summer growth cycle in this work a new drought index sddi was defined and evaluated its value not only depends on the cumulative p and et0 but also on their synchronicity asynchronicity in the accumulation period the main results can be summarized as follows the new sddi index is more dissimilar from the other meteorological indices particularly at the medium and long time scales for all indices the highest correlations with crop yield were found in relation to the month of july and with an accumulation period of two months the indices show very similar performances the combined use of precipitation and evapotranspiration spei rdi and sddi leads to modest increases in performance compared to the use of precipitation alone spi thus indicating the dominance of the water availability factor for the crop and the area examined among the indices that use evapotranspiration the spei and the new sddi defined in this work are those providing the best performance the result obtained for the sddi appears encouraging and indicates that it could be used advantageously for the assessment of drought impacts in all contexts where evapotranspiration and deficit peaks play a crucial role future perspectives concern an in depth analysis of the statistical properties of the sddi and its evaluation for different climatic conditions and application contexts credit authorship contribution statement l vergni

4036,in the paper we tested and compared the potential of some standardized meteorological indices to identify agricultural drought impacts in central italy the indices considered are the standardized precipitation index spi the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the reconnaissance drought index rdi and the standardized deficit distance index sddi a new index that is defined and evaluated in this paper sddi is a function of the euclidean distance between the actual p et0 and a reference deficit series p et0 max sddi unlike other indices also considers how the deficit is distributed in a certain span and assigns greater severities when the distribution is uneven e g presence of peaks the comparative analysis refers to 24 provinces of central italy and sunflower a typical non irrigated crop in the area considered the sunflower yield time series 1980 2019 were de trended and standardized for each province finally obtaining standardized yield residuals syrs the climatic data required for calculating the drought indices precipitation and temperatures for each province derive from the e obs gridded dataset with 0 25 resolution in the period 1980 2019 from the minimum and maximum daily temperatures the et0 was estimated by the fao penman monteith equation the drought indices were calculated for different time scales from 1 to 5 months and the months corresponding to the sunflower growing season april august the performance of the various indices in the prediction of syrs was assessed using the pearson correlation coefficient for all the indices the best correlations are found for the 2 month time scale and for july spi s performance is only slightly lower than that of the indices that integrate both precipitation and evapotranspiration spei rdi sddi among these sddi and spei provide somewhat better results considering both the percentage of significant correlation 63 and 67 respectively and the corresponding mean correlation 0 49 and 0 48 respectively sddi demonstrates good potential in assessing agricultural drought impacts while maintaining the advantage of limited data input keywords standardized precipitation index standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index reconnaissance drought index standardized yield residuals standardized deficit distance index 1 introduction over the last few decades several areas of the world have experienced warmer and drier conditions with a consequent increase in high severity drought events fao 2008 giddens 2011 van loon et al 2016 due to global warming ipcc 2014 future conditions will be even worse and agriculture due to its direct dependence on climate and water resources will be among the most sensitive and affected sectors therefore the assessment of drought risk in agriculture is crucial information for decision makers intending to mitigate drought related crop losses the identification and quantification of drought conditions generally present more difficulties in comparison to other natural hazards indeed droughts are creeping phenomena wilhite and glantz 1985 with an uncertain onset and end in the assessment of agricultural droughts further difficulties occur because they depend not only on climatic conditions but also on how these conditions interact with the soil crop and farm characteristics and impact agricultural production parsons et al 2019 despite this complexity agricultural droughts are often monitored and quantified using simple meteorological variables or indices generally based on precipitation only or also on temperature or evapotranspiration this information is in fact easy to retrieve on a large scale and can be effectively implemented in national or continental monitoring and early warning systems such as the european drought observatory for europe or the us drought monitor for the united states bachmair et al 2018 alternative approaches in agricultural drought monitoring are becoming more and more present thanks to remote sensing technologies examples are the use of vegetation indices e g gu et al 2007 lu et al 2015 ali et al 2019 huang et al 2020 or soil moisture indicators martínez fernández et al 2016 however as underlined by bachmair et al 2018 these innovative approaches still require extensive validation and usually they must be integrated with meteorological data or indices on the other hand the correct application of meteorological indices in agricultural drought monitoring makes it essential to evaluate their effectiveness in describing the corresponding impacts quiring and papakryiakou 2003 this objective was sought in several papers either at the global vicente serrano et al 2012 continental blauhut et al 2015 stagge et al 2015a bachmair et al 2018 or national regional quiring and papakryiakou 2003 wang et al 2016 chen et al 2016 potopová et al 2016 peña gallardo et al 2018 tian et al 2018 scale by analyzing the correlation between a certain type of meteorological variable or index and an indicator of its impact on agriculture in most cases the impact indicator is represented by the observed time series of actual crop yield or by qualitative datasets of crop productivity blauhut et al 2015 stagge et al 2015a bachmair et al 2018 the reference context is always that of rainfed agriculture since its vulnerability mostly depends on climatic conditions in some cases e g halwatura et al 2017 soil moisture is considered a proxy of agricultural impact the meteorological index is usually a standardized drought index or more than one index may be used to compare their performances for example vicente serrano et al 2012 evaluated at a global level the performances of different versions of the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 against the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 similar comparisons can be found in peña gallardo et al 2019 for spain in liu et al 2018 for china and in peña gallardo et al 2018 and tian et al 2018 for the usa often the analyses involved comparisons between the spi and spei as in potop et al 2012 gunst et al 2015 labudová et al 2017 and parsons et al 2019 some studies adopted the reconnaissance drought index rdi such as tigkas and tsakiris 2015 these comparative studies show that the effectiveness of standardized indices in predicting agricultural drought impacts varies significantly with the crop the index type the index time scale and the region generally the spi and spei perform better than the pdsi vicente serrano et al 2012 peña gallardo et al 2018 tian et al 2018 between the spi and spei the latter usually offers better performance chen et al 2016 vicente serrano et al 2012 labudová et al 2017 even on this point however there are no unequivocal conclusions for example bachmair et al 2018 and parsons et al 2019 indicate that the spi is usually better than the spei in continental europe and that only in southern europe mediterranean areas the spei is more effective than the spi due to the relevant effect of et0 under warmer climatic conditions concerning the time scale short scales of three months or a maximum of six months prove more effective than longer time scales a common problem described in the literature is the impossibility of referring to univocal indications when large areas are considered indeed the larger an area is the higher the variability of the drought influencing factors such as soils and crop varieties also if standardized indices are used the same index value can correspond to very different soil moisture conditions bachmair et al 2018 for this reason specific and accurate assessments of national and regional drought meteorological indicators against reported impacts are useful for italy despite the fact that several authors have described the space time variability of meteorological drought indices in different regions e g baronetti et al 2020 in northern italy buttafuoco et al 2015 in southern italy and di lena et al 2014 in central italy no studies addressed the relationship between drought indices and agricultural impacts from a quantitative perspective some information for italy can only be found in gunst et al 2015 which analyzed the relationships between meteorological drought indices spi and spei and crop yields wheat barley maize and sugar beet for several european territorial units nuts2 however they didn t find significant relationships for italy and mediterranean areas in general the probable reason is that maize and sugar beet are typically irrigated crops while wheat and barley are grown in the wet season for which yield reductions due to water shortages occur very rarely moreover most standardized meteorological indices such as the spi spei and rdi only depend on the cumulative amounts of p and et0 in a given multi month period without considering the internal distribution of those variables this characteristic excludes the possibility of adequately assessing the impact of deficit peaks which in the approaches mentioned above could be wholly mitigated or masked by preceding or subsequent sub periods of surplus in most biological processes e g crop yield such a balancing effect does not always occur and deficit peaks can have dramatic impacts the main objectives of the present study are 1 to evaluate the effectiveness of some standardized meteorological indices in the identification of agricultural drought impacts in central italy and 2 to define and test the potential of the new standardized deficit distance index sddi the sddi presents a calculation algorithm detailed in section 2 3 4 that allows the consideration of the uneven dynamics of water deficit in a given multi month period the performance of the sddi against some well known standardized indices spi spei and rdi was evaluated and discussed in relation to the sunflower crop yield in central italy sunflower is grown here typically in rainfed conditions thus representing an excellent reference for assessing the reliability of meteorological drought indices in agricultural drought assessment 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study refers to 24 provinces of central italy between latitudes41 and 44 5 n and longitudes 10 and 15 e fig 1 with a total area of about 72 157 km2 in central italy the climate is predominantly mediterranean summers are warm to hot and winters are generally mild but colder in inland areas and at higher altitudes the wettest season is the autumn and the driest the summer in this season months with zero or near zero rainfall amounts may occasionally occur the territory is mainly hilly and mountainous fig 1 in hilly areas tree crops olives and vines and forage crops prevail while herbaceous crops mainly wheat maize tobacco sunflower grain legumes and vegetable crops are widespread in the plains most of the crops grown in summer require an irrigation supply due to the considerable imbalance between precipitation and evapotranspiration 2 2 data 2 2 1 meteorological data we retrieved the meteorological data from the e obs ensemble dataset cornes et al 2018 at a 0 25 degree resolution accessed onnovember 28th 2019 the variables used include daily minimum and maximum temperature tmin and tmax respectively and daily precipitation p for the period 1980 2019 then we assigned single daily time series of tmin tmax and p to each province using the functions available in the r packages ncdf4 pierce 2019 and raster hijmans 2020 at this point we overlapped the province areas to the e obs grid and by a weighted average function based on the actual province area included in each e obs cell we derived a single time series for each variable considered after this procedure the daily series of reference evapotranspiration et0 mm day for each province were calculated using the temperature based penman monteith equation tpm allen et al 1998 this simplified method was chosen due to the lack of detailed data on solar radiation air humidity and wind speed which were computed following the estimating procedures and formulae provided in allen et al 1998 in particular for wind speed we assumed as suggested a constant value of 2 m s and for the latitude necessary for the calculation of the extraterrestrial radiation we used that of the province centroid several studies under different climatic conditions e g pandey and pandey 2016 lópez moreno et al 2009 have shown that the tpm method leads to limited errors compared to the fao penman monteith equation faopm furthermore these errors tend to decrease further when the comparison between tpm and faopm is based on the monthly cumulative et0 values such as those required for the calculation of the spei rdi and sddi moreover some authors e g beguería et al 2013 tigkas and tsakiris 2015 indicate that in most climatic conditions the et0 calculation method does not significantly affect the values of indices such as the spei or rdi therefore we consider the et0 obtained from the tpm method adequate for the purpose and characteristics of the study daily data were finally aggregated to the monthly time scale obtaining a database of 480 24 data points for each variable p tmin tmax et0 the mean values of precipitation and evapotranspiration for the year the winter january february march jfm the spring april may june amj the summer july august september jas and the autumn october november december ond are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively in those figures the provinces on the x axis are in increasing order of centroid latitude from fig 2 it is evident that the precipitation is characterized by a certain south to north increasing gradient which is not evident for et0 fig 3 summer jas is the season with the lowest rainfall and the highest evapotranspiration consumption both summer and spring amj are characterized by an average precipitation lower than evapotranspiration p et0 0 2 2 2 crop yield data the crop considered is sunflower a widespread crop in central italy in the spring summer growing season the typical growing cycle is between april sowing and august physiological maturation the crop is usually cultivated under rainfed conditions taking advantage of the high root depth of the crop steduto et al 2012 the growth period is earlier than that of other summer crops e g maize and therefore it is characterized by a more favorable balance between p and et0 fig 2 and fig 3 of course the seasonal climatic conditions greatly influence the sunflower crop yield which for this reason can be considered an excellent indicator of agricultural drought impacts in italy the reference source for the large scale data of the yield mg and cultivated areas ha of the various crops is the istat italian national institute of statistics which reports that information for each province fig 1 during the 1990s three provinces were split to create three other new provinces in this work however we referred to the provinces existing in 1980 fig 1 the yield data of the provinces resulting from the divisions were aggregated by a weighted average on the corresponding cultivated areas and reassigned to the old provinces we computed sunflower yields mg ha 1 as the ratio between each province s overall annual year production and the corresponding crop area the data collected refer to the period 1980 2019 with an interruption between 1994 and 2000 in some cases the sample size is further reduced due to a lack of surveys or due to provincial cultivated areas that were to small we did not consider reliable yields corresponding to areas less than 100 ha however the sample size is always greater than 27 years except for the provinces of pistoia and l aquila with 25 and 7 years of yield data respectively the spatial variability of the mean annual yields mg ha 1 and the corresponding coefficients of variation are represented in fig 4 from fig 4 it is evident that in most western provinces sunflower yields are lower and more variable than in the rest of the area the yield data quality is medium low since yields can refer even for the same province to extremely different conditions e g crop varieties soil characteristics disease and weed control moreover although the sunflower s agronomic practice in central italy is typically rainfed we cannot completely rule out the use of irrigation in particular in irrigation districts where water is not limited farmers could occasionally irrigate sunflowers but this information is not available in the istat reports the irrigation of the sunflower is however a very rare practice in central italy and it is not referable to a specific province for this reason even if this aspect can represent a disturbing element in the correlation analysis objective of this work it can be considered a random error not able to affect the comparative analysis significantly i e in a preferential direction however in this type of analysis it is important to focus only on the yield variability due to climatic factors therefore yields were de trended and standardized following the procedure described in potopová et al 2016 to eliminate the effect of usually positive trends due to the introduction of new management practices and technologies or more productive varieties to this end we fitted the time series of the yield data of each province to a second order polynomial model the de trended yields ydt have then obtained as the difference between the observed and the model estimated yields trend component the ydt were finally standardized to obtain the so called standardized yield residuals syrs 1 syrs y dt μ σ where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of ydt respectively as indicated by potopová et al 2016 the syrs are only affected by the climatic conditions and an error component i e fluctuations caused by random factors 2 3 drought indices the analysis was based on some well known standardized drought indices that are used worldwide which are calculated on the basis of precipitation only or both precipitation and reference evapotranspiration the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and the reconnaissance drought index rdi tsakiris and vangelis 2005 moreover the new standardized deficit distance index sddi was also defined and applied 2 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi a detailed description of the spi can be found in the mckee et al 1993 and several successive works where the index has been applied and discussed e g stagge et al 2015b here the main calculation steps and characteristics are briefly summarized the calculation of the spi starts with the fitting of a suitable probability density function pdf to a long term series of cumulative precipitation p i j k related to a given end month j j 1 12 and accumulation period k or time scale the subscript i i 1 n indicates the ith year of the time series of length n the fitting is carried out separately for each combination of month and time scale to take into account the differences due to seasonality once the pdf is determined the cumulative probability f p i j k of each observed precipitation amount p i j k can be estimated the corresponding spi i j k is finally obtained as 2 spi i j k φ 1 f p i j k where φ 1 denotes the inverse cumulative standard normal distribution a preliminary comparative analysis based on the akaike information criterion aic laio et al 2009 was conducted to determine the most suitable pdf for the variable p i j k considering similar evaluations conducted in the literature e g stagge et al 2015b vergni et al 2017 the comparison was limited to some 2 parameter distributions i e gamma weibull log normal and normal robust estimates of the distribution parameters were obtained from l moments hosking 1990 the analysis showed that the gamma distribution allows us to get the best performances lowest values of aic at all time scales from 1 to 24 months and it was therefore chosen as the pdf in the calculation of the spi however aic scores very similar to those of the gamma distribution are also obtained from the weibull distribution at the 1 month time scale and from the log normal distribution at the 12 and 24 month time scales 2 3 2 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the spei was proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 to overcome a relevant shortcoming of the spi i e the neglect of temperature or evapotranspiration variables which in a global warming context can represent a key factor in drought assessment the steps required for spei calculation are however quite similar to those described above for the spi instead of cumulative precipitation the reference variable in this case is the cumulative water balance d i j k i e p i j k e t 0 i j k the value of the spei for a given time scale k month j and year i can finally be obtained with eq 2 by just replacing f p i j k with f d i j k the best fitting distribution of d i j k was determined by the aic criterion comparing the pearson type iii log logistic generalized extreme value and normal distributions which have been already evaluated as potential candidate distributions for the spei stagge et al 2015b the distributions considered present very similar aic scores at all the time scales from 1 to 24 months with the exception of the normal which has slightly higher aic values therefore the log logistic distribution was chosen considering that it is also used in the original algorithm described by vicente serrano et al 2010 2 3 3 reconnaissance drought index rdi the rdi proposed by tsakiris and vangelis 2005 is another example of a meteorological index that integrates precipitation and evapotranspiration the reference variable is the ratio α i j k p i j k e t 0 i j k which is then standardized following a procedure analogous to both the spi and spei the most suitable pdf for α i j k was determined by comparing the aic scores for the gamma weibull log normal and normal distributions the lowest aic scores were obtained by the gamma distribution at all of the time scales considered from 1 to 24 months therefore the gamma distribution was adopted as the underlying distribution of the variable α i j k in accordance with the previous literature e g tigkas and tsakiris 2015 2 3 4 standardized deficit distance index sddi for the calculation of the standardized deficit distance index sddi first of all it is necessary to derive for each month j j 1 12 and year i i 1 n the climatic water balance dj i d i j p i j e t 0 i j 3 then for each calendar month j the maximum and minimum values of di j dmaxj and dminj respectively observed in the series of length n are computed 4 dma x j m a x d i j i 1 n j 1 12 5 dmi n j m i n d i j i 1 n j 1 12 a new monthly series δmaxi j is then derived as the difference between dmaxj and each di j 6 δ m a x i j dmax j d i j i 1 n j 1 12 after choosing an end month j and a time scale k the reference variable dd i j k for each year i of the time series is computed as dd i j k m j k 1 j δ m a x i m d m a x m dmin m 2 i 1 n 7 it can be noted that for a given month m the ratio δ m a x d m a x d m i n expresses a relative deficit condition varying between 0 when δ m a x i m 0 i e di m dmaxm and 1 when δ m a x i m d m a x m d m i n m i e di m dminm according to eq 7 the variable dd i j k is non negative and can theoretically assume values between 0 i e minimum deficit when the δ m a x i m 0 for all of the months included in the period of k months and k i e maximum deficit when δ m a x i m 1 for all of the months included in the period of k months dd i j k is conceptually analogous to the variables mentioned above p i j k d i j k and α i j k on which the spi spei and rdi are respectively based however dd i j k increases as the water stress increases thus exhibiting a behavior opposite to p i j k d i j k and α i j k the value of the sddi is finally computed by standardizing the variable dd i j k 8 sddi i j k φ 1 f dd i j k where f dd i j k is the cumulative probability of dd i j k in the paper the cumulative probability f dd i j k was computed by fitting an empirical distribution frequency edf to the dd i j k samples for each combination of month and time scale the edf approach was preferred to that of fitting theoretical probability distributions pdfs given the modest size of the samples 40 values and given the lack of previous literature dealing with the probability distribution of the variable dd i j k however a comparative analysis among some 2 parameter distributions based on the akaike information criterion indicated that the normal and weibull distributions are often the best in fitting dd i j k the minus sign in 8 allows us to have a standardized index with a reference scale equal to that of other similar indices as shown in table 1 the name chosen for the index derives from the fact that the variable dd depends on the euclidean distance between the series of the actual deficit d in a generic span of length k and the series of dmax i e the condition representing for each month the maximum historical surplus of p with respect to et0 moreover the difference between dmax and d is expressed in relative terms dividing by dmax dmin to consider the climatic differences among months the higher dd is the higher the deficit as stated by faloutsos et al 1994 the euclidean distance is one of the most used and effective measures of similitude among two series unlike the simple cumulative deficit the euclidean distance increases with the presence of peaks or uneven distributions of the total deficit this property should better describe the impact of water deficit peaks on crop production plaut 2003 the example illustrated in fig 5 is useful to understand the rationale behind the algorithm of the sddi and the differences with respect to the spi spei and rdi let s suppose that in two generic years a and b the precipitation observed for april may june and july is 270 10 60 and 20 mm year a and 70 90 90 and 110 mm year b the reference evapotranspiration et0 for the same months is respectively 90 130 140 and 150 mm for both years for simplicity s sake let s also suppose that dmax and dmin are the same for april may june and july and equal to 200 and 140 mm respectively for the time scale k 4 months including april may june and july we get for both years p i j k 360 mm d i j k 150 mm and α i j k p i j k e t 0 i j k 0 71 this means that the two years considered are equivalent in terms of the spi spei and rdi computed for july and a 4 month time scale instead dd i j k 270 90 200 140 2 10 130 200 140 2 60 140 200 140 2 20 150 200 140 2 1 58 for year a and dd i j k 70 90 200 140 2 90 130 200 140 2 90 140 200 140 2 110 150 200 140 2 1 40 for year b therefore the sddi is able to capture the difference between the years a and b assigning a higher value i e higher deficit to year a with respect to year b this is due to the higher euclidean distance between d and dmax but implicitly between p and et0 in year a with respect to year b the sddi index is expected to overcome some shortcomings of the spi spei and rdi when they are applied in the context of agricultural droughts or more generally in any biological ecological and hydrological context for which uneven distributions of the deficit can have serious impacts it should be noted in fact that the variables p d and α on which the spi spei and rdi are respectively based not only do not consider how the deficit is distributed in the period of length k but any surpluses in previous months could lead to a complete compensation of the deficits in the following months this approach is not very suitable for an assessment of drought impacts on crops in particular on annual crops indeed crops can benefit from any previous surplus only to a limited extent depending on the temporal distance and the soil retention capacity recently tian et al 2020 proposed an index based on a ratio similar to δ m a x d m a x d m i n their index however does not solve the problem of the compensatory effects illustrated in the previous paragraphs of course the differences between the spei or spi or rdi and sddi are expected to increase with the time scale due to the higher probability of compensatory effects among the months considered 2 3 5 other indices some literature e g rey et al 2016 dealing with meteorological indices for agricultural drought monitoring also considers the maximum potential soil moisture deficit psmd rodríguez díaz et al 2007 for comparison purpose the psmd at the generic time t i e month is computed as 9 psmd t psmd t 1 e t 0 t p t in months where pt psmdt 1 et0t any initial soil moisture deficit is filled and hence psmdt 0 in the paper for every province and year the maximum pmsd pmsdmax of the months from april to august corresponding to the sunflower growth period was computed and used in the correlation analysis with the syrs in the application of eq 4 we always assumed psmdt 0 for march 2 4 methods 2 4 1 assessment of the similarity and differences between indices considering that the analysis includes the new index sddi we conducted a preliminary evaluation of the similarities and differences between the drought indices to this end we quantified both the well known pearson correlation coefficient r and the coefficient of agreement k cohen 1960 vergni et al 2021 between the corresponding time series of drought indices for the calculation of k the severity categories assigned to each month of the time series by two generic indices according to table 1 are arranged in a confusion matrix and the k is computed as follows 10 k p o p e 1 p e where po is the total observed frequency of agreement and pe is the proportion of agreement expected by chance in practice k indicates how much the observational frequency of agreement is in excess of the frequency of agreement pe expected under a random classification the strength of agreement based on k can be qualitatively expressed as follow landis and koch 1977 almost perfect 1 k 0 81 substantial 0 80 k 0 61 moderate 0 60 k 0 41 fair 0 40 k 0 21 slight 0 2 k 0 poor k 0 as vergni et al 2021 explained the coefficient k is more effective than the traditional correlation coefficient r in evaluating the actual similarity between drought indices in fact similar temporal patterns i e high correlation can conceal differences in the severities value or category particularly during extreme events more details about the k coefficient and its particular use for drought indices comparison can be found in vergni et al 2021 in this preliminary comparative analysis the indices were computed at 1 3 6 12 and 24 month time scales 2 4 2 effectiveness of the meteorological indices in the identification of agricultural droughts the performance of the various indices in the prediction of sunflower syrs was assessed using the pearson correlation coefficient the indices have been calculated by adopting time scales 1 2 3 4 and 5 months and months april august useful to describe the drought conditions during the sunflower growth period of course for other crops or purposes e g hydrological droughts different time scales and months should be considered 3 results 3 1 comparison between indices the summary results of the correlation analysis between the indices time series are given in fig 6 which shows the variability of the correlations average of all provinces with both the time scale 1 3 6 12 and 24 months and the seasons the correlations among the spi spei and rdi are always higher than 0 82 and in most cases the correlation variability with both the season and the time scale is modest a larger variability can be observed for the summer months this depends on the high summer et0 fig 3 which can lead to a differentiation in the indices values especially in the most extreme situations strong imbalance between p and et0 however this effect is evident for the spi spei or spei rdi correlation but practically absent for the spi rdi correlation the reason may be that the spi and rdi use the same underlying distribution gamma thus reducing the differences in the tails extreme values the correlations spei sddi and rdi sddi are higher than the corresponding spi sddi correlation this was expected since the spei rdi and sddi unlike the spi are based on both p and et0 the spi sddi spei sddi and rdi sddi correlations exhibit similar behaviors i e a general decrease with the time scale in fact considering the sddi algorithm the higher the time scale the higher the possibility to obtain from the sddi a different evaluation of the drought conditions with respect to the other indices which do not consider the deficit distribution along the accumulation period this behavior has some exceptions particularly in summer this is likely due to the not easily predictable effects of dmax and dmin on the sddi finally it can be observed that the correlation between the spi and sddi is always lower than that between the spi and spei and that between the spi and rdi highlighting that the sddi differs more from the spi i e simple precipitation than the spei and rdi do a more detailed comparison between the new drought index sddi and the other indices considered is presented in fig 7 which shows for an example province perugia the scatter plots of the sddi versus the spi rdi and spei at short 1 month medium 6 months and long 24 months time scales from fig 7 it is evident that there is a progressive reduction of the correlation between the sddi and the other indices as the scale increases in particular consistent with eq 7 the differences between the spei and sddi at the 1 month scale are minimal and only attributable to different underlying distributions fig 8 shows the variability of the coefficient of agreement k average of all provinces with the time scale 1 3 6 12 and 24 months for all the possible pairs of drought indices in general the agreement between the indices tends to decrease as the time scale increases an exception is the pair spei rdi whose agreement tends to increase slightly with the time scale the new sddi index shows the least similarity to spi which is moderate at the 3 and 6 month time scales and only fair at the 12 and 24 month time scales the pairs spei sddi and rdi sddi show agreements decidedly lower than that of spei rdi except for the 1 month scale therefore although the correlation values between the indices considered are never lower than 0 75 there are relevant differences in the drought severity classification especially by the new index sddi a last comparison between the four meteorological indices is presented in fig 9 showing the space time variability of the indices in the provinces considered between march 2017 and june 2018 this period includes the severe drought event that affected much of europe in 2017 garcía herrera et al 2019 in this example a medium time scale of 6 months is adopted fig 9 shows that all the indices detect a widespread drought condition between august and october 2017 followed by an almost normal condition around january 2018 and a wet condition between february and june 2018 this general trend is in agreement with the literature e g garcia herrera et al 2019 however there are marked differences between the indices the most evident ones emerge comparing spi with the other indices particularly in the periods e g 10 2017 and 11 2017 in which the 6 month time scale includes the spring and summer months characterized by relevant et0 amounts the new sddi index indicates spatial patterns quite similar to rdi and spei in the onset phases i e 06 2017 and 07 2017 while in the period of maximum severity and spatial diffusion of the drought e g 10 2017 the differences become more evident the most relevant differences between sddi and the other indices appears at the end of the drought period i e 02 2018 in this period sddi detects a normal condition for all the provinces while the other indices show widespread wet conditions in most of the central eastern provinces the explanation lies in the high rainfall amounts of february 2018 in those provinces about 200 mm on average thus the indices based only on the cumulative rainfall or deficit indicate the entire 6 month period ending in february 2018 as moderate or severe wet offering a misleading description of the actual hydrological conditions of the whole period 3 2 correlation analysis between drought indices and sunflower syrs the detailed results of the correlation analysis between syrs and drought indices for different time scales and months are shown in fig 10 in this figure each panel s first and second rows indicate the time scale and end month respectively e g 2 and aug indicate the anomaly related to the months of july and august and so on the magnitude of positive and negative correlations is represented by blue and red gradients respectively table 2 shows some summary results i e the percentage of provinces with significant positive correlation spc and the mean correlation coefficient r spc computed only considering significant positive correlations significant correlations α 10 were determined according to a double tailed student s t test whose result also depends on the actual sample size an overview of fig 10 indicates a prevalence of positive correlations blue hue denoting a general ability of the indices to describe the agricultural drought impacts in fig 10 the provinces are shown in increasing order of latitude but there is not an evident relationship between correlation and latitude hereinafter the generic index x for a given time scale k and end month j will be indicated with the notation xk j e g spi2 7 stands for the spi at a 2 month time scale related to july a few provinces pescara chieti and rieti exhibit poor correlations or even negative correlations with drought indices particularly considering the spi or rdi spi1 8 also exhibits a prevailing negative correlation although it is never significant for the spei the best combinations of time scale and months are spei2 7 r spc 0 48 spc 67 spei1 6 r spc 0 50 spc 54 spei3 8 r spc 0 45 spc 54 and spei1 2 r spc 0 45 spc 42 for the spei the presence of negative correlations is slightly less evident than for the spi the results of the rdi seem more similar to those of the spi than to those of the spei fig 10 on the other hand the rdi and spi always show a high correlation and agreement at the short time scales figs 6 and 8 also for the rdi the best performances are obtained for rdi2 7 r spc 0 49 and spc 54 and rdi1 6 r spc 0 47 and spc 58 other satisfactory results are obtained by rdi3 8 the overall performance of the sddi is very similar to that of all other indices in particular the best results can be found for sddi2 7 r spc 0 49 and spc 63 sddi1 6 r spc 0 50 spc 54 sddi3 8 r spc 0 46 spc 54 and sddi3 7 r spc 0 50 spc 46 the presence of negative correlations is similar to that observed for the spei in regard to the spi fig 10 and table 2 it can be noted that the spi2 7 exhibits the highest mean correlation r spc 0 49 with a percentage of significant positive correlations spc of 46 however the highest spc of 58 is obtained by spi1 6 for which r spc is 0 44 satisfactory performances are also obtained by spi3 8 with r spc 0 44 and spc 42 for all the indices the highest mean correlation r including all provinces is obtained for the 2 month time scale and the month of july r values of 0 31 0 34 0 36 and 0 36 for spi2 7 rdi2 7 spei2 7 and sddi2 7 respectively the correlations of the indices spi2 7 spei2 7 rdi2 7 and sddi2 7 were finally compared by 1 1 plots with the correlations obtained for the pairs psmdmax syrs fig 11 from fig 11 it is evident that all of the standardized indices computed at the 2 month time scale for the month of july outperform psmdmax there is also the confirmation of the slightly better performance of both spei and sddi in comparison to the spi and rdi since the points are almost all below the 1 1 line and further to the right 4 discussion the analysis has shown that the standardized indices related to or including the months of june and july are the most correlated with sunflower crop yields in central italy these results are consistent with the phenological stages of the sunflower in the area considered in fact june and july correspond to the flowering and to the subsequent seed filling stages during which the impact of a water deficit on crop yield is maximum steduto et al 2012 only in a few provinces lucca rieti forlì pescara and chieti is the correlation between drought indices and crop yield very poor at any time scale in some cases lucca rieti and forlì this could be due to the frequent favourable climatic conditions as found by a statistical analysis of the corresponding values of p et0 and d for the pescara and chieti provinces the cause of the general poor correlation is not clear nor it can be attributed to factors such as irrigation given that interviews with local producer organizations have confirmed the very low diffusion of this practice analysing the indices at a 1 month time scale fig 10 and table 2 it is also evident that the meteorological conditions of april may and august are usually not crucial for sunflower crop yield indeed in april and may the crop is not fully developed and its moderate water requirement can generally also be satisfied also in drought years in august the crop has almost completed the critical phases and water deficit conditions have moderate or negligible consequences for this month on the contrary water excess could have counter productive effects and the general negative correlations although not significant obtained for spi1 8 could be related to this aspect significant negative correlations were obtained in a few cases usually for short time scales 1 or 2 months including april and may particularly for the spi spei and rdi and in particular for chieti and rieti provinces the reason could be the presence of adverse meteorological conditions e g water excess or cold periods after seeding but these cases are too few to attempt a robust interpretation the outperformance of all the standardized indices computed at the 2 month time scale for the month of july with respect to psmdmax can be rationalized by the fact that psmdmax includes the water stress of august which is usually high fig 2 and fig 3 but not significant in terms of yield impact as demonstrated by the correlations in fig 10 and table 2 the results can be considered consistent with those reported in the literature where the use of the spi spei and rdi as agricultural drought indicators was assessed potop et al 2012 gunst et al 2015 labudová et al 2017 parsons et al 2019 tigkas and tsakiris 2015 in terms of the time scale medium short time scales are generally suggested 6 months as in parsons et al 2019 but more often around 3 months as in bachmair et al 2018 tigkas and tsakiris 2015 and labudová et al 2017 the latter authors are among the few to have considered the sunflower however they conducted a study in continental europe and sunflower yields were negatively correlated with excess rather than with a deficit of water in the present study it was observed that in central italy for a typical spring summer cycle crop a 2 month or even 1 month time scale including the critical crop growth stages can be considered optimal the study shows that in central italy all the standardized indices considered have very similar performances the average correlations obtained by the indices integrating p and et0 the spei rdi and sddi are only slightly higher than those obtained by the spi also in this case the results are consistent with the literature which does not indicate a univocal conclusion about the advantage of drought indices which include et0 for the crop and area considered in this paper a significant advantage of also including et0 occurs probably occurs only in the years with the most extreme temperatures for the same reason however the use of et0 in the context of climate warming appears appropriate the new index sddi provides satisfactory results equivalent to the spei and slightly better than the rdi which are both based on the same input data i e p and et0 as previously explained one of the strengths of the sddi in agricultural ecological and hydrological applications lies in the possibility of evaluating how the monthly climatic deficits d p et0 are distributed within the period considered with the same cumulative value of d the sddi indicates more or less impactful conditions according to the presence of peaks or uneven distributions of the monthly deficits therefore the sddi represents an attempt to develop an index that while retaining the advantages of the spei or rdi including their dependence only on precipitation and evapotranspiration data could enhance its suitability for drought impact assessment the potential advantage of sddi compared to spei or rdi doesn t emerge clearly in the case study given that the most effective time scale for a drought impact assessment on sunflower crops is only two months at this short scale the spei rdi and sddi cannot differ much as shown by the high correlations and agreements fig 6 fig 7 and fig 8 in other contexts such as those related to perennial crops where longer time scales are required for evaluating the drought impacts the sddi could better highlight its advantages for the same reason the sddi could be particularly useful in the assessment of hydrological drought conditions and impacts as underlined in the analysis of fig 9 we also carried out an analysis based on a variable dd obtained as the simple sum of the ratios δ m a x d m a x d m i n of eq 7 evaluating the correlation of the corresponding standardized index with the sunflower syrs this index at the 2 month time scale of july reached slightly worse performances with respect to the sddi spc of 56 and r spc of 0 47 thus denoting a certain effectiveness of the algorithm of the sddi based on the euclidean distance however also in this case the short time scale limits the possibility to enhance the differences for all of the indices considered improvements in the correlation with the crop yield could be obtained using more crop oriented input variables such as the effective rainfall or crop potential or even actual evapotranspiration however these last modifications already proposed and evaluated in some studies e g ebrahimpour et al 2015 tigkas et al 2016 moorhead et al 2013 pei et al 2019 zarei and moghimi 2019 tigkas et al 2020 require further input data or crop and soil modelling in this first comparative analysis we preferred an assessment based on meteorological input only 5 conclusion in general considering the uncertainty of the data used in the analysis and the variety of factors affecting crop yield beyond water availability the results indicate the general reliability of standardized meteorological indices in assessing agricultural drought conditions in central italy the evaluation was carried out with specific reference to the sunflower yield but the conclusions can be considered valid for all of the other crops having a similar spring summer growth cycle in this work a new drought index sddi was defined and evaluated its value not only depends on the cumulative p and et0 but also on their synchronicity asynchronicity in the accumulation period the main results can be summarized as follows the new sddi index is more dissimilar from the other meteorological indices particularly at the medium and long time scales for all indices the highest correlations with crop yield were found in relation to the month of july and with an accumulation period of two months the indices show very similar performances the combined use of precipitation and evapotranspiration spei rdi and sddi leads to modest increases in performance compared to the use of precipitation alone spi thus indicating the dominance of the water availability factor for the crop and the area examined among the indices that use evapotranspiration the spei and the new sddi defined in this work are those providing the best performance the result obtained for the sddi appears encouraging and indicates that it could be used advantageously for the assessment of drought impacts in all contexts where evapotranspiration and deficit peaks play a crucial role future perspectives concern an in depth analysis of the statistical properties of the sddi and its evaluation for different climatic conditions and application contexts credit authorship contribution statement l vergni

4037,streamflow from forested mountain watersheds is critical to aquatic ecosystems and social development in watersheds however understanding the intra annual variability of streamflow is limited by the lack of observation of terrestrial water storage tws in large scale watersheds this study developed a monthly budyko framework incorporating tws from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace the extended budyko framework was applied using four classic budyko equations in the qinba mountains the results showed that the extended budyko framework could competently represent the relationship between monthly water supply and demand with better performance than the original budyko framework based on the extended budyko framework this study further quantified the contributors of streamflow variability using the variance decomposition method the dominant contributor to intra annual streamflow variability was precipitation 50 followed by tws 11 and their covariance 21 in this region specifically precipitation played a dominant role on streamflow variability in summer and autumn while evapotranspiration and tws significantly impacted streamflow in spring and winter respectively furthermore the hydrologic effects of rainfall intensity and vegetation were investigated to explain streamflow variability as the rainfall intensity decreases more precipitation is partitioned into evapotranspiration and tws while the increase of rainfall intensity leads to the partitioning of precipitation into streamflow similarly monthly vegetation promotes the partitioning of precipitation into tws while inhibiting the partitioning of precipitation into streamflow the opposite effect of vegetation on streamflow and tws is weakened due to the neglect of tws at an annual timescale which may lead to an overestimation of the effect of annual vegetation on streamflow the results have implications for improving the performance of the budyko framework to reveal the relationship between monthly water supply and demand and understanding streamflow variability at an intra annual timescale keywords streamflow variability budyko framework grace intra annual timescale terrestrial water storage qinba mountains 1 introduction forested mountain watersheds which are important freshwater sources play a vital role in the provision of freshwater services to aquatic ecosystems and communities viviroli et al 2007 worldwide more than 30 of discharge meybeck et al 2001 viviroli et al 2003 a significant proportion of the drinking water for one third of the world s largest cities comes from forested mountain watersheds stolton and dudley 2003 young et al 2019 declines in water yield from forested mountain watersheds have been reported due to climate change and forest disturbances caldwell et al 2016 trenberth et al 2009 a multitude of studies have focused on the response of streamflow to climate change and vegetation at annual and multi annual timescales rather than at intra annual timescales choudhury 1999 dey and mishra 2017 huo et al 2021 ning et al 2017 potter and zhang 2009 zhang et al 2001 while the latter provides important information for the effective allocation of water resources tu et al 2015 for instance forests enhance the ability of watersheds to reduce flood peaks and increase streamflow during dry periods which are usually omitted at interannual timescales birch et al 2021 ogden et al 2013 peña arancibia et al 2019 in addition the changes in monthly climate conditions are largely responsible for the monthly streamflow variability berghuijs et al 2014 yao et al 2020 consequently understanding the streamflow variability from forested mountain watersheds at intra annual timescales is critical for the sustainable management of water resources the variability of streamflow from forested mountain watersheds reflects the sensitivity of the hydrologic cycle to climate conditions and its underlying characterizations for instance the mean annual partitioning of precipitation p into evapotranspiration e and streamflow r was first determined by the competition between water supply p and energy availability potential evapotranspiration e0 which was also regulated by corresponding underlying characterizations budyko et al 1974 fu 1981 the budyko framework which contains climate conditions and underlying characterizations is deemed a skillful tool for investigating hydrologic cycle and streamflow variability at annual and multiannual timescales choudhury 1999 wang and tang 2014 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 zhang et al 2004 the framework has been employed to analyze the impacts of climate change on streamflow variability in multiple studies dey and mishra 2017 given that terrestrial water storage tws is in a steady state the framework is not suitable for the intra annual timescale recently studies have attempted to extend the budyko framework to an intra annual timescale one way to extend the budyko framework is to directly include monthly terrestrial water storage change as a part of water supply du et al 2016 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 another way is to take into consideration the effects of monthly soil moisture dynamics on water balance by combining the budyko framework and the abcd model yao et al 2020 zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 meanwhile the errors of the budyko framework at intra annual timescale are analyzed the results suggested that incorporating water storage change into the budyko framework can improve its predictability wu et al 2018 a new relationship between intra annual water supply p tws in the previous period and water demand e tws is developed based on the budyko framework with greater advantages than the previous relationship between long term p and e0 zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 however the monthly terrestrial water storage used for the budyko framework mainly comes from model inversion such as the abcd model and noah model so obtaining accurate and independent terrestrial water storage is the key to developing the monthly budyko framework wu et al 2019 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission which was launched in 2002 effectively filled the shortage of large scale monthly terrestrial water storage observations terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa relative to a baseline temporal average from grace are commonly used in hydrological applications from regional to global scales such as monitoring terrestrial water storage change twsc landerer and swenson 2012 soltani et al 2021 evaluating groundwater depletion nanteza et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 assessing drought and flood events long et al 2014 thomas et al 2017 and calculating evapotranspiration lv et al 2017 rodell 2004 moreover previous studies have indicated that the application of twsa from grace can improve the budyko model s ability to evaluate the hydrologic cycle the link between the water storage amplitude from grace and the departure of the budyko model has been demonstrated fang et al 2016 the twsc from grace was used successfully to estimate monthly evapotranspiration based on the budyko framework xing et al 2018b despite the effort to explore the ability of grace to improve the budyko model accuracy in assessing water balance few people incorporate grace into the intra annual balance between water supply and demand based on the budyko framework in addition a comparison between different extended budyko models incorporating grace is warranted overall the challenge in understanding the intra annual variability of streamflow lies in the lack of accurate terrestrial water storage data especially in large scale regions lópez lópez et al 2017 soltani et al 2020 but the launch of grace provides an opportunity to address it consequently this study aims to 1 couple monthly twsa from grace into different monthly water balance models based on the budyko framework 2 analyze the intra annual variation characteristics of hydrological variables p e r twsc and quantify the contributors of streamflow variability using the variance decomposition method based on the budyko model and 3 investigate the effects of rainfall intensity and vegetation on streamflow variability 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the qinba mountains which are the watershed between the yangtze river and the yellow river are located in the central part of china 30 n 36 n 103 n 112 n with a total area of 2 8 105 km2 the region mainly includes the subregions of individual sources of the han river the largest tributary of the yangtze river weihe river the largest tributary of the yellow river jialing river and yiluo river fig 1 located in the han river subregion the danjiangkou reservoir is the water source region of the central route of china s south to north water diversion project li et al 2021 liu et al 2018 the weihe river subregion provides a significant proportion of the drinking water for xi an city which has a population of over 10 million and unsustainable development due to insufficient water resources song et al 2018 yang et al 2019b the qinba mountains block cold air from the north and warm air from the southwest which results in contrasting climates from north to south the average annual precipitation of this region is close to 1000 mm approximately 60 from june to november zhang and liang 2020 the annual average temperature varies from 15 c to 17 c the river flow is mostly recharged by rainfall with snowmelt streamflow accounting for a small part of the total streamflow the elevation in this region varies from 24 m to 5393 m above mean sea level with steep terrain the land cover type in this region is predominantly mixed forests and the soils are mainly red soil and paddy soil 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 dem and ndvi the digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m is provided by the geospatial data cloud site computer network information center chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn the monthly normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was obtained from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn 2 2 2 meteorological and hydrological data the monthly observed streamflow of 23 gauging stations in the qinba mountains was obtained from the china hydrological yearbook which was provided by the ministry of water resources china data from 52 meteorological stations including precipitation temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed were collected from the chinese daily surface weather database http data cma cn the inverse distance weighted idw method was applied for spatial interpolation 2 2 3 gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data grace data have been widely used to derive tws including ice snow surface water soil moisture and groundwater storage which are available in two forms spherical harmonics data and mass concentration mascon solution data soltani et al 2021 five of the latest rl06 datasets including three spherical harmonics datasets from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl s geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz s center for space research at university of texas austin csr s and two mascon datasets from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl m center for space research at university of texas austin csr m were provided from 2004 to 2015 at https grace jpl nasa gov missing monthly data were replaced by averaging the values of adjacent months zhang et al 2019 monthly twsa from the five datasets and their average grace a were compared with soil moisture data from the global land data assimilation system gldas s coupled with the noah model https earthdata nasa gov the pearson correlation coefficient r between grace and gldas are shown in fig 2 which indicates that the two data products exhibit a good coherence therefore grace could accurately capture terrestrial water storage in this region with the maximum r grace a was used in the following analysis 2 3 methods 2 3 1 an extended budyko framework incorporating twsa from grace as shown in fig 3 the water balance process can be expressed as 1 p t s t 1 e t s t r t where pt et and rt are the precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow at time t e g month year respectively st 1 and st are terrestrial water storage conditions at times t 1 and t respectively and their difference is twsc if t is long enough e g more than a year terrestrial water storage can be assumed to be steady st 1 st the partitioning of annual precipitation into annual evapotranspiration and streamflow is determined by the competition between available water p and available energy measured by potential evapotranspiration e0 2 e t p t b e 0 t p t n where b represents the budyko equation from different studies four classic budyko equations are used in this study table 1 including the choudhury yang equation choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 fu equation fu 1981 zhang et al 2004 wang tang equation wang and tang 2014 and zhang equation zhang et al 2001 n is the corresponding budyko parameter e0 is calculated by the fao56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 on an intra annual timescale equation 2 is unreasonable because the change in terrestrial water storage cannot be negligible and st 1 is also one of the available water sources a new relationship between water supply and demand was proposed based on the budyko framework zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 3 y t w t b b t w t n where wt represents the water supply from the atmosphere p and terrene st 1 yt represents the water demand from the atmosphere et and terrene st the value bt which represents the potential yt is the summation of potential evapotranspiration e0 and maximum terrestrial water storage smax in addition to st 1 equation 3 also considers the impacts of st and smax on the monthly water cycle compared to the previous budyko framework which is suitable for coupling grace into the budyko framework furthermore grace derived twsa is used to obtain terrestrial water storage conditions by the following equation 4 s t twsa t a where a is a constant therefore an extended budyko framework with three parameters n a and smax is established 5 e t twsa t a p t twsa t 1 a b e 0 t s max p t twsa t 1 a n the expression of streamflow can be obtained by combining equation 1 and equation 5 6 r t p t twsa t 1 a p t twsa t 1 a b e 0 t s max p t twsa t 1 a n these parameters are estimated with four commonly used budyko equations by minimizing the squared errors between observed and simulated r the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse is used to evaluate the performance of the extended budyko model moriasi et al 2007 2 3 2 quantifying the contributions of different factors to streamflow variability denoting equation 6 as r f p e0 tws the change in r defined as its unbiased sample variance rv can be decomposed into the variance of p e0 tws and their covariance ye et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 r v ε 1 2 σ p 2 ε 2 2 σ tws 2 ε 3 2 σ e 0 2 2 ε 1 ε 2 c o v p t w s 7 2 ε 1 ε 3 c o v p e 0 2 ε 2 ε 3 c o v t w s e 0 where ε1 ε2 and ε3 which are the sensitivities of streamflow concerning changes in p e0 and tws respectively can be obtained by equation 6 ε1 f p ε2 f e0 ε3 f tws hence the contributions of six factors to streamflow variability can be calculated by equation 7 3 results 3 1 model performance the extended budyko model with three parameters n a and smax is calibrated against monthly observed streamflow in the study region the values for the three calibrated model parameters n a and smax are summarized in table 2 the parameters n of the choudhury yang equation nc fu equation nf wang tang equation nw and zhang equation nz are 1 6 2 3 0 5 and 0 7 respectively which are similar to previous studies choudhury 1999 fu 1981 wang and tang 2014 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 zhang et al 2004 the parameters n of four equations represents different physical meanings for instance nf represents catchment characteristics while nz represents the plant available water coefficient however nf should have a unique relationship with nc 2 1 nf 2 2 1 nc which is reserved in this study parameters a and smax of the four equations are 118 mm and 365 mm respectively parameter a is used with twsa from grace to calculate st which represents terrestrial water supply the estimated st close to vegetation available water or root area soil water xing et al 2018a is significantly lower than the actual terrestrial water storage yang et al 2020 such a phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that only part of the terrestrial water is involved in the monthly water cycle smax the maximum terrestrial water storage is lower than that in other studies zhang et al 2020 since no extreme dry or wet event was detected during the study period smax may represent the maximum active terrestrial water storage good agreement exists between the simulated e r and the observed e from the water budget r the four equations showed similar performance with the r2 values of the e and r simulations all close to 0 95 and 0 81 fig 4 a c respectively in addition the nses of the e and r simulation ranges of the four equations are 0 95 to 0 96 and 0 82 to 0 83 during the calibration period 2004 2010 and 0 93 to 0 95 and 0 73 to 0 80 during the validation period 2011 2015 respectively table 2 moreover significant improvement in the e and r simulation of the extended model was observed compared to the original model the r2 values of the e and r simulations increased from 0 82 to 0 95 fig 4a b and 0 43 to 0 81 fig 4c d when using the extended budyko model with grace data respectively these results demonstrate that the extended budyko model can simulate monthly evapotranspiration and streamflow in the study region and has a better performance than the original model in addition to simulating e and r the extended budyko model could reflect the relationship between monthly water supply including p and st 1 and monthly water demand including e and st the fu equation was used to investigate the relationship between water supply and water demand from 2004 to 2015 water supply limited conditions always occur in spring while water demand limited conditions always occur in summer and autumn fig 5 b terrestrial water storage is diminished by evapotranspiration and discharge in winter and potential evapotranspiration increases in spring which results in water supply limited conditions in spring conversely reduced potential evapotranspiration combined with increased precipitation and terrestrial water storage in early autumn led to water demand limited conditions fig 5a therefore the extended budyko model can capture changes in the monthly water cycle 3 2 intra annual changes in hydrological variables time series of the monthly and mean monthly p e r and twsc over the qinba mountains from 2004 to 2015 are depicted in fig 6 the e was obtained using the extended budyko model twsc was derived by grace p and r were measured at meteorological and hydrological gauging stations similarly hereinafter similar seasonal cycles were identified with the highest amplitudes during summer and autumn june to september and the lowest amplitudes in winter december to february in the mean monthly time series the maximum values of p and e all occurred in july while the maximum values of r and twsc were identified in september and august respectively the twsc first increased from july to september due to p approximately 45 mm a and was subsequently consumed by e and r from november to april this process is important for the partitioning of precipitation especially for the streamflow regulation during wet and dry flow periods to better understand the intra annual variation in the four hydrological components the relative proportion of each component is displayed in fig 6c the proportion of p increased from january 15 6 to june 49 5 slowly rose from june to october and decreased from october to december with a minimum value of 13 8 in may the maximum proportion of e 37 7 was accompanied by the minimum proportion of r 11 5 while in january the minimum proportion of e 14 9 was observed along with the maximum proportion of r 36 4 the proportion of twsc experienced a significant decrease during december and april from 33 6 to 1 4 these results indicate that p and e are the major hydrological processes in most months march november while r and twsc play an important role in other months december february fig 7 shows the relationships between r and p twsc and e in spring march may summer june august autumn september october and winter december february the links between r and p and e were strongest in spring with r2 0 4 and 0 26 respectively the weak correlation between r and twsc may be due to the small recharge of twsc to r a strong response of r to p manifested in summer and autumn followed by twsc the good linear relationship between r and twsc can be attributed to the fact that increases in twsc and r are recharged by p in summer and autumn however the closest relationship between twsc e and r existed in winter with a negative correlation r2 0 12 and 0 16 respectively the reason for poor fitting in winter between r and the other three hydrological components may be that twsc becomes a significant recharge of r with snowfall complicating the hydrologic processes these results indicate that streamflow is dominated by p in the wet season summer and autumn while e and tws significantly impact streamflow in spring and winter respectively 3 3 contributions of different factors to streamflow variability four budyko equations were used to quantify the contributions of different factors to intra annual streamflow variance rv from 2004 to 2015 by equation 7 fig 8 shows that the r2 values of the three equations are over or equal to 0 91 except for the wang tang equation r2 0 9 similar performance of the wang tang equation was found in a previous study zhang et al 2020 overall the variance of p e0 tws and their covariance can effectively capture the rv fig 9 indicates a small difference in the evaluation results of the four budyko equations the contribution of p to rv ranges from 38 to 74 the mean contribution of 50 playing a dominant role in intra annual rv other important contributions result from tws the mean contribution of 11 and the covariance of p and tws the mean contribution of 21 however the contributions of e p e0 and s e0 to rv are limited these results indicate that p and tws are the dominant contributors to intra annual streamflow variability in the qinba mountains 4 discussion 4 1 the response of r twsc and e to rainfall intensity precipitation and twsc are the dominant contributors to the intra annual variability in streamflow moreover precipitation plays a decisive role in both the twsc and r during the wet season consequently r twsc and e responses to rainfall intensity are investigated in the rainy season three months annually with the heaviest rainfall the precipitation mm 12 h from 52 weather stations is divided into six levels pl1 pl6 as shown in table 3 fig 10 shows the precipitation of different rainfall intensities during the rainy season from 2004 to 2015 differences existed between precipitation events across both rainfall intensities and years moreover the rainfall mainly consisted of the first five precipitation levels pl1 pl5 and pl6 was omitted in the following analysis the relationships between precipitation and a streamflow coefficient cr r p b twsc coefficient ctwsc twsc p and c evapotranspiration coefficient ce e p at different rainfall intensities are shown in fig 11 a significant difference in the responses of r twsc and e to rainfall intensity was identified cr and ctwsc were positively correlated with precipitation at different intensities while ce was negatively correlated with precipitation fig 11a c the more precipitation there is within twelve hours the less evapotranspiration is induced proportionately attributed to the potential evapotranspiration a limiting factor demand limited in the rainy season the slopes between precipitation and cr ctwsc and ce at different rainfall intensities represent the sensitivities of r twsc and e to precipitation with a noticeable difference fig 11d the slopes of cr and rainfall intensity gradually increased with precipitation intensity indicating a high proportion of r at high rainfall intensity however the slopes of ctwsc and ce and rainfall intensity gradually decreased with rainfall intensity the results confirm that rainfall intensity affects the partitioning of precipitation into r twsc and e on large spatial scales which is consistent with previous results obtained from mostly point observations liu et al 2011 wei et al 2014 zabret et al 2018 4 2 interactions between vegetation and hydrometeorological factors vegetation has an inevitable impact on hydrological variables and is influenced by hydrometeorological factors i e temperature and precipitation to closely understand the interactions between vegetation and hydrometeorological factors the r between ndvi and temperature t p ce cr and ctwsc from 2004 to 2015 are shown in table 4 the strongest r appeared between ndvi and t at a monthly timescale with r 0 93 p 0 01 followed by p with r 0 79 p 0 01 this result suggests that the responses of vegetation to t and p are intense in this region ndvi was negatively correlated with cr r 0 49 p 0 01 while the relationship between ndvi and ctwsc was positively correlated r 0 37 p 0 01 the opposite effect of vegetation on r and twsc has been confirmed by previous studies lazo et al 2019 sun et al 2018 ukkola et al 2015 yang et al 2019a zhao et al 2012 on the one hand vegetation reduces r by rainfall intercept and transpiration iida et al 2020 yan et al 2021 on the other hand vegetation increases the soil infiltration rate which promotes p to recharge tws liu et al 2014 sun et al 2018 therefore vegetation can enhance the regulating of twsc on r by promoting p to recharge tws however the effect of vegetation on tws was weakened but its effect on r was strengthened at the annual timescale the positive correlation between ndvi and ctwsc was weakened from the monthly timescale to the annual timescale from 0 37 to 0 1 while the negative correlation between ndvi and cr was strengthened from 0 46 to 0 68 the role of vegetation in promoting tws which strengthens the regulation of tws on r could be misled as a direct effect of vegetation on r at the annual timescale therefore the relationship between vegetation and tws was neglected at the annual scale which resulted in the overrated role of annual vegetation on streamflow 4 3 the regulation of tws to streamflow the study shows that tws had a significant impact on intra annual streamflow variability the mean contributions of variance tws and covariance p and tws to streamflow variability are 11 and 21 respectively section 3 3 despite the low contribution to streamflow tws may provide a major recharge of streamflow in winter with a closer linear relationship and high relative proportion compared with p and e section 3 2 moreover the negative contribution 21 of p and tws to streamflow might be explained by the competition between tws and r for precipitation in the rainy season which is supported by the hydrological effects of rainfall intensity and vegetation sections 4 1 and 4 2 higher precipitation within twelve hours induced a higher r proportion and low tws proportion while low precipitation caused the opposite result similarly an opposite response of the partitioning of precipitation into r and tws to vegetation was observed in the relationship between monthly water supply and demand tws is not only a part of water supply st 1 but also a part of water demand st the unique ability of the monthly water cycle allows tws to reduce r in the rainy season and increase r in the dry season with an important role in the availability of water resources however warming shifts the balance between water supply and demand increasing tws to e condon et al 2020 thus the ability of tws to regulate r during wet and dry seasons needs to be further investigated 4 4 comparison with other monthly budyko models hydrological models based on the budyko framework have been applied to estimate monthly water balance terrestrial water storage is the key to extending the budyko model to a monthly timescale wu et al 2019 studies have developed a monthly budyko model by combining terrestrial water storage change with precipitation as the water supply wu et al 2019 ye et al 2015 while other efforts have been made to obtain a monthly model by integrating the budyko framework with the abcd model that can simulate soil moisture dynamics du et al 2016 zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 in contrast to the former the latter considers the hydrologic effect of monthly soil moisture storage dynamics the grace could independently provide the tws with a smaller error than other tws derived from the hydrological mode van dijk et al 2014 the advantage of grace in observing water storage is also reflected in the extended budyko model conversely grace has limitations in time observations began in 2002 and space coarse spatial scale which results in similar limitations in the extended budyko model 4 5 uncertainties three potential sources of uncertainty exist in the evaluation results the grace data the omission of human activities and the single study region here the three potential sources of uncertainty are discussed separately the grace products generally have three error sources measurement error model error from removing gravity signals other than tws and leakage error landerer and swenson 2012 soltani et al 2021 wiese et al 2016 in this study the leakage error needs to be considered previous studies have indicated that caution is warranted when the study area is smaller than 2 105 km2 the limited scale of the study area 2 8 105 km2 may induce leakage error despite the use of the average of five grace products in addition this study did not analyze individual pixels we would like to involve further spatial analysis that accounts for the individual pixels in future studies however we deem that the current study gives confidence in applying the grace product to evaluation terrestrial water storage conditions in the region this study analyzed intra annual streamflow variability with climate conditions and vegetation however human activities mainly irrigation damming mining and urbanization significantly impact streamflow song et al 2021 the land cover type of the study region is predominantly woodland with low population density owing to the steep terrain in the qinba mountains therefore the effects of irrigation mining and urbanization are limited moreover streamflow may be overestimated in the dry season e g winter while the impact of the danjiangkou reservoir on streamflow is negligible in the wet season the surface water area of the danjiangkou reservoir is approximately 350 km2 with a water level from 157 m to 170 m in recent years li et al 2015 liu et al 2018 the change in monthly water level is roughly considered to be 1 m which is equivalent to a water height of 1 5 mm over the study region note that the danjiangkou reservoir started sending water to northern china in late october 2014 with little impact on the water balance during the study period an extended budyko framework incorporating grace with good performance is developed in the qinba mountains previous studies have indicated that regional differences particularly in climate may affect the performance of hydrological models zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 although the qinba mountains can represent certain climate conditions more regions need to be included to comprehensively evaluate the extended model in the future 5 conclusions the study integrated monthly twsa from grace into the budyko framework with four different water balance equations based on this extended budyko model intra annual streamflow variability was investigated by quantifying the contributors of intra annual streamflow variability moreover the hydrologic effects of rainfall intensity and vegetation were subsequently discussed the main conclusions are as follows 1 an extended monthly budyko framework considering terrestrial water storage conditions from grace obtained applicable results in the qinba mountains china with similar performance the nses of the four budyko equations in simulating e and r ranged from 0 93 to 0 96 and 0 73 to 0 83 respectively moreover the performance of the extended model is improved by combining grace data compared to original budyko framework the r2 values of e and r increased from 0 82 to 0 95 and 0 43 to 0 81 respectively meanwhile the extended budyko framework successfully described this relationship between monthly water supply p st 1 and demand e st 2 in the wet season summer and autumn streamflow variability was dominated by p while tws and e significantly impacted streamflow variability in winter in spring p and e all played an important role in streamflow variability in general p is the dominant factor for intra annual streamflow variability the mean contribution of 50 followed by tws 11 and their covariance 21 moreover the role of tws approximately 45 mm a in the partitioning of precipitation and the regulation of streamflow during wet and dry periods is observed 3 the low rainfall intensity promotes the partitioning of p into tws and e while the large rainfall intensity is favorable for r to obtain the partitioning of p in the rainy season vegetation could promote the partitioning of p into tws while restraining the partitioning of p into r in the qinba mountains however the effect of vegetation on r may be overestimated due to the neglect of twsc at an annual timescale credit authorship

grace the extended budyko framework was applied using four classic budyko equations in the qinba mountains the results showed that the extended budyko framework could competently represent the relationship between monthly water supply and demand with better performance than the original budyko framework based on the extended budyko framework this study further quantified the contributors of streamflow variability using the variance decomposition method the dominant contributor to intra annual streamflow variability was precipitation 50 followed by tws 11 and their covariance 21 in this region specifically precipitation played a dominant role on streamflow variability in summer and autumn while evapotranspiration and tws significantly impacted streamflow in spring and winter respectively furthermore the hydrologic effects of rainfall intensity and vegetation were investigated to explain streamflow variability as the rainfall intensity decreases more precipitation is partitioned into evapotranspiration and tws while the increase of rainfall intensity leads to the partitioning of precipitation into streamflow similarly monthly vegetation promotes the partitioning of precipitation into tws while inhibiting the partitioning of precipitation into streamflow the opposite effect of vegetation on streamflow and tws is weakened due to the neglect of tws at an annual timescale which may lead to an overestimation of the effect of annual vegetation on streamflow the results have implications for improving the performance of the budyko framework to reveal the relationship between monthly water supply and demand and understanding streamflow variability at an intra annual timescale keywords streamflow variability budyko framework grace intra annual timescale terrestrial water storage qinba mountains 1 introduction forested mountain watersheds which are important freshwater sources play a vital role in the provision of freshwater services to aquatic ecosystems and communities viviroli et al 2007 worldwide more than 30 of discharge meybeck et al 2001 viviroli et al 2003 a significant proportion of the drinking water for one third of the world s largest cities comes from forested mountain watersheds stolton and dudley 2003 young et al 2019 declines in water yield from forested mountain watersheds have been reported due to climate change and forest disturbances caldwell et al 2016 trenberth et al 2009 a multitude of studies have focused on the response of streamflow to climate change and vegetation at annual and multi annual timescales rather than at intra annual timescales choudhury 1999 dey and mishra 2017 huo et al 2021 ning et al 2017 potter and zhang 2009 zhang et al 2001 while the latter provides important information for the effective allocation of water resources tu et al 2015 for instance forests enhance the ability of watersheds to reduce flood peaks and increase streamflow during dry periods which are usually omitted at interannual timescales birch et al 2021 ogden et al 2013 peña arancibia et al 2019 in addition the changes in monthly climate conditions are largely responsible for the monthly streamflow variability berghuijs et al 2014 yao et al 2020 consequently understanding the streamflow variability from forested mountain watersheds at intra annual timescales is critical for the sustainable management of water resources the variability of streamflow from forested mountain watersheds reflects the sensitivity of the hydrologic cycle to climate conditions and its underlying characterizations for instance the mean annual partitioning of precipitation p into evapotranspiration e and streamflow r was first determined by the competition between water supply p and energy availability potential evapotranspiration e0 which was also regulated by corresponding underlying characterizations budyko et al 1974 fu 1981 the budyko framework which contains climate conditions and underlying characterizations is deemed a skillful tool for investigating hydrologic cycle and streamflow variability at annual and multiannual timescales choudhury 1999 wang and tang 2014 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 zhang et al 2004 the framework has been employed to analyze the impacts of climate change on streamflow variability in multiple studies dey and mishra 2017 given that terrestrial water storage tws is in a steady state the framework is not suitable for the intra annual timescale recently studies have attempted to extend the budyko framework to an intra annual timescale one way to extend the budyko framework is to directly include monthly terrestrial water storage change as a part of water supply du et al 2016 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 another way is to take into consideration the effects of monthly soil moisture dynamics on water balance by combining the budyko framework and the abcd model yao et al 2020 zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 meanwhile the errors of the budyko framework at intra annual timescale are analyzed the results suggested that incorporating water storage change into the budyko framework can improve its predictability wu et al 2018 a new relationship between intra annual water supply p tws in the previous period and water demand e tws is developed based on the budyko framework with greater advantages than the previous relationship between long term p and e0 zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 however the monthly terrestrial water storage used for the budyko framework mainly comes from model inversion such as the abcd model and noah model so obtaining accurate and independent terrestrial water storage is the key to developing the monthly budyko framework wu et al 2019 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission which was launched in 2002 effectively filled the shortage of large scale monthly terrestrial water storage observations terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa relative to a baseline temporal average from grace are commonly used in hydrological applications from regional to global scales such as monitoring terrestrial water storage change twsc landerer and swenson 2012 soltani et al 2021 evaluating groundwater depletion nanteza et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 assessing drought and flood events long et al 2014 thomas et al 2017 and calculating evapotranspiration lv et al 2017 rodell 2004 moreover previous studies have indicated that the application of twsa from grace can improve the budyko model s ability to evaluate the hydrologic cycle the link between the water storage amplitude from grace and the departure of the budyko model has been demonstrated fang et al 2016 the twsc from grace was used successfully to estimate monthly evapotranspiration based on the budyko framework xing et al 2018b despite the effort to explore the ability of grace to improve the budyko model accuracy in assessing water balance few people incorporate grace into the intra annual balance between water supply and demand based on the budyko framework in addition a comparison between different extended budyko models incorporating grace is warranted overall the challenge in understanding the intra annual variability of streamflow lies in the lack of accurate terrestrial water storage data especially in large scale regions lópez lópez et al 2017 soltani et al 2020 but the launch of grace provides an opportunity to address it consequently this study aims to 1 couple monthly twsa from grace into different monthly water balance models based on the budyko framework 2 analyze the intra annual variation characteristics of hydrological variables p e r twsc and quantify the contributors of streamflow variability using the variance decomposition method based on the budyko model and 3 investigate the effects of rainfall intensity and vegetation on streamflow variability 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the qinba mountains which are the watershed between the yangtze river and the yellow river are located in the central part of china 30 n 36 n 103 n 112 n with a total area of 2 8 105 km2 the region mainly includes the subregions of individual sources of the han river the largest tributary of the yangtze river weihe river the largest tributary of the yellow river jialing river and yiluo river fig 1 located in the han river subregion the danjiangkou reservoir is the water source region of the central route of china s south to north water diversion project li et al 2021 liu et al 2018 the weihe river subregion provides a significant proportion of the drinking water for xi an city which has a population of over 10 million and unsustainable development due to insufficient water resources song et al 2018 yang et al 2019b the qinba mountains block cold air from the north and warm air from the southwest which results in contrasting climates from north to south the average annual precipitation of this region is close to 1000 mm approximately 60 from june to november zhang and liang 2020 the annual average temperature varies from 15 c to 17 c the river flow is mostly recharged by rainfall with snowmelt streamflow accounting for a small part of the total streamflow the elevation in this region varies from 24 m to 5393 m above mean sea level with steep terrain the land cover type in this region is predominantly mixed forests and the soils are mainly red soil and paddy soil 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 dem and ndvi the digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m is provided by the geospatial data cloud site computer network information center chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn the monthly normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was obtained from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn 2 2 2 meteorological and hydrological data the monthly observed streamflow of 23 gauging stations in the qinba mountains was obtained from the china hydrological yearbook which was provided by the ministry of water resources china data from 52 meteorological stations including precipitation temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed were collected from the chinese daily surface weather database http data cma cn the inverse distance weighted idw method was applied for spatial interpolation 2 2 3 gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data grace data have been widely used to derive tws including ice snow surface water soil moisture and groundwater storage which are available in two forms spherical harmonics data and mass concentration mascon solution data soltani et al 2021 five of the latest rl06 datasets including three spherical harmonics datasets from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl s geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz s center for space research at university of texas austin csr s and two mascon datasets from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl m center for space research at university of texas austin csr m were provided from 2004 to 2015 at https grace jpl nasa gov missing monthly data were replaced by averaging the values of adjacent months zhang et al 2019 monthly twsa from the five datasets and their average grace a were compared with soil moisture data from the global land data assimilation system gldas s coupled with the noah model https earthdata nasa gov the pearson correlation coefficient r between grace and gldas are shown in fig 2 which indicates that the two data products exhibit a good coherence therefore grace could accurately capture terrestrial water storage in this region with the maximum r grace a was used in the following analysis 2 3 methods 2 3 1 an extended budyko framework incorporating twsa from grace as shown in fig 3 the water balance process can be expressed as 1 p t s t 1 e t s t r t where pt et and rt are the precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow at time t e g month year respectively st 1 and st are terrestrial water storage conditions at times t 1 and t respectively and their difference is twsc if t is long enough e g more than a year terrestrial water storage can be assumed to be steady st 1 st the partitioning of annual precipitation into annual evapotranspiration and streamflow is determined by the competition between available water p and available energy measured by potential evapotranspiration e0 2 e t p t b e 0 t p t n where b represents the budyko equation from different studies four classic budyko equations are used in this study table 1 including the choudhury yang equation choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 fu equation fu 1981 zhang et al 2004 wang tang equation wang and tang 2014 and zhang equation zhang et al 2001 n is the corresponding budyko parameter e0 is calculated by the fao56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 on an intra annual timescale equation 2 is unreasonable because the change in terrestrial water storage cannot be negligible and st 1 is also one of the available water sources a new relationship between water supply and demand was proposed based on the budyko framework zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 3 y t w t b b t w t n where wt represents the water supply from the atmosphere p and terrene st 1 yt represents the water demand from the atmosphere et and terrene st the value bt which represents the potential yt is the summation of potential evapotranspiration e0 and maximum terrestrial water storage smax in addition to st 1 equation 3 also considers the impacts of st and smax on the monthly water cycle compared to the previous budyko framework which is suitable for coupling grace into the budyko framework furthermore grace derived twsa is used to obtain terrestrial water storage conditions by the following equation 4 s t twsa t a where a is a constant therefore an extended budyko framework with three parameters n a and smax is established 5 e t twsa t a p t twsa t 1 a b e 0 t s max p t twsa t 1 a n the expression of streamflow can be obtained by combining equation 1 and equation 5 6 r t p t twsa t 1 a p t twsa t 1 a b e 0 t s max p t twsa t 1 a n these parameters are estimated with four commonly used budyko equations by minimizing the squared errors between observed and simulated r the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse is used to evaluate the performance of the extended budyko model moriasi et al 2007 2 3 2 quantifying the contributions of different factors to streamflow variability denoting equation 6 as r f p e0 tws the change in r defined as its unbiased sample variance rv can be decomposed into the variance of p e0 tws and their covariance ye et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 r v ε 1 2 σ p 2 ε 2 2 σ tws 2 ε 3 2 σ e 0 2 2 ε 1 ε 2 c o v p t w s 7 2 ε 1 ε 3 c o v p e 0 2 ε 2 ε 3 c o v t w s e 0 where ε1 ε2 and ε3 which are the sensitivities of streamflow concerning changes in p e0 and tws respectively can be obtained by equation 6 ε1 f p ε2 f e0 ε3 f tws hence the contributions of six factors to streamflow variability can be calculated by equation 7 3 results 3 1 model performance the extended budyko model with three parameters n a and smax is calibrated against monthly observed streamflow in the study region the values for the three calibrated model parameters n a and smax are summarized in table 2 the parameters n of the choudhury yang equation nc fu equation nf wang tang equation nw and zhang equation nz are 1 6 2 3 0 5 and 0 7 respectively which are similar to previous studies choudhury 1999 fu 1981 wang and tang 2014 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 zhang et al 2004 the parameters n of four equations represents different physical meanings for instance nf represents catchment characteristics while nz represents the plant available water coefficient however nf should have a unique relationship with nc 2 1 nf 2 2 1 nc which is reserved in this study parameters a and smax of the four equations are 118 mm and 365 mm respectively parameter a is used with twsa from grace to calculate st which represents terrestrial water supply the estimated st close to vegetation available water or root area soil water xing et al 2018a is significantly lower than the actual terrestrial water storage yang et al 2020 such a phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that only part of the terrestrial water is involved in the monthly water cycle smax the maximum terrestrial water storage is lower than that in other studies zhang et al 2020 since no extreme dry or wet event was detected during the study period smax may represent the maximum active terrestrial water storage good agreement exists between the simulated e r and the observed e from the water budget r the four equations showed similar performance with the r2 values of the e and r simulations all close to 0 95 and 0 81 fig 4 a c respectively in addition the nses of the e and r simulation ranges of the four equations are 0 95 to 0 96 and 0 82 to 0 83 during the calibration period 2004 2010 and 0 93 to 0 95 and 0 73 to 0 80 during the validation period 2011 2015 respectively table 2 moreover significant improvement in the e and r simulation of the extended model was observed compared to the original model the r2 values of the e and r simulations increased from 0 82 to 0 95 fig 4a b and 0 43 to 0 81 fig 4c d when using the extended budyko model with grace data respectively these results demonstrate that the extended budyko model can simulate monthly evapotranspiration and streamflow in the study region and has a better performance than the original model in addition to simulating e and r the extended budyko model could reflect the relationship between monthly water supply including p and st 1 and monthly water demand including e and st the fu equation was used to investigate the relationship between water supply and water demand from 2004 to 2015 water supply limited conditions always occur in spring while water demand limited conditions always occur in summer and autumn fig 5 b terrestrial water storage is diminished by evapotranspiration and discharge in winter and potential evapotranspiration increases in spring which results in water supply limited conditions in spring conversely reduced potential evapotranspiration combined with increased precipitation and terrestrial water storage in early autumn led to water demand limited conditions fig 5a therefore the extended budyko model can capture changes in the monthly water cycle 3 2 intra annual changes in hydrological variables time series of the monthly and mean monthly p e r and twsc over the qinba mountains from 2004 to 2015 are depicted in fig 6 the e was obtained using the extended budyko model twsc was derived by grace p and r were measured at meteorological and hydrological gauging stations similarly hereinafter similar seasonal cycles were identified with the highest amplitudes during summer and autumn june to september and the lowest amplitudes in winter december to february in the mean monthly time series the maximum values of p and e all occurred in july while the maximum values of r and twsc were identified in september and august respectively the twsc first increased from july to september due to p approximately 45 mm a and was subsequently consumed by e and r from november to april this process is important for the partitioning of precipitation especially for the streamflow regulation during wet and dry flow periods to better understand the intra annual variation in the four hydrological components the relative proportion of each component is displayed in fig 6c the proportion of p increased from january 15 6 to june 49 5 slowly rose from june to october and decreased from october to december with a minimum value of 13 8 in may the maximum proportion of e 37 7 was accompanied by the minimum proportion of r 11 5 while in january the minimum proportion of e 14 9 was observed along with the maximum proportion of r 36 4 the proportion of twsc experienced a significant decrease during december and april from 33 6 to 1 4 these results indicate that p and e are the major hydrological processes in most months march november while r and twsc play an important role in other months december february fig 7 shows the relationships between r and p twsc and e in spring march may summer june august autumn september october and winter december february the links between r and p and e were strongest in spring with r2 0 4 and 0 26 respectively the weak correlation between r and twsc may be due to the small recharge of twsc to r a strong response of r to p manifested in summer and autumn followed by twsc the good linear relationship between r and twsc can be attributed to the fact that increases in twsc and r are recharged by p in summer and autumn however the closest relationship between twsc e and r existed in winter with a negative correlation r2 0 12 and 0 16 respectively the reason for poor fitting in winter between r and the other three hydrological components may be that twsc becomes a significant recharge of r with snowfall complicating the hydrologic processes these results indicate that streamflow is dominated by p in the wet season summer and autumn while e and tws significantly impact streamflow in spring and winter respectively 3 3 contributions of different factors to streamflow variability four budyko equations were used to quantify the contributions of different factors to intra annual streamflow variance rv from 2004 to 2015 by equation 7 fig 8 shows that the r2 values of the three equations are over or equal to 0 91 except for the wang tang equation r2 0 9 similar performance of the wang tang equation was found in a previous study zhang et al 2020 overall the variance of p e0 tws and their covariance can effectively capture the rv fig 9 indicates a small difference in the evaluation results of the four budyko equations the contribution of p to rv ranges from 38 to 74 the mean contribution of 50 playing a dominant role in intra annual rv other important contributions result from tws the mean contribution of 11 and the covariance of p and tws the mean contribution of 21 however the contributions of e p e0 and s e0 to rv are limited these results indicate that p and tws are the dominant contributors to intra annual streamflow variability in the qinba mountains 4 discussion 4 1 the response of r twsc and e to rainfall intensity precipitation and twsc are the dominant contributors to the intra annual variability in streamflow moreover precipitation plays a decisive role in both the twsc and r during the wet season consequently r twsc and e responses to rainfall intensity are investigated in the rainy season three months annually with the heaviest rainfall the precipitation mm 12 h from 52 weather stations is divided into six levels pl1 pl6 as shown in table 3 fig 10 shows the precipitation of different rainfall intensities during the rainy season from 2004 to 2015 differences existed between precipitation events across both rainfall intensities and years moreover the rainfall mainly consisted of the first five precipitation levels pl1 pl5 and pl6 was omitted in the following analysis the relationships between precipitation and a streamflow coefficient cr r p b twsc coefficient ctwsc twsc p and c evapotranspiration coefficient ce e p at different rainfall intensities are shown in fig 11 a significant difference in the responses of r twsc and e to rainfall intensity was identified cr and ctwsc were positively correlated with precipitation at different intensities while ce was negatively correlated with precipitation fig 11a c the more precipitation there is within twelve hours the less evapotranspiration is induced proportionately attributed to the potential evapotranspiration a limiting factor demand limited in the rainy season the slopes between precipitation and cr ctwsc and ce at different rainfall intensities represent the sensitivities of r twsc and e to precipitation with a noticeable difference fig 11d the slopes of cr and rainfall intensity gradually increased with precipitation intensity indicating a high proportion of r at high rainfall intensity however the slopes of ctwsc and ce and rainfall intensity gradually decreased with rainfall intensity the results confirm that rainfall intensity affects the partitioning of precipitation into r twsc and e on large spatial scales which is consistent with previous results obtained from mostly point observations liu et al 2011 wei et al 2014 zabret et al 2018 4 2 interactions between vegetation and hydrometeorological factors vegetation has an inevitable impact on hydrological variables and is influenced by hydrometeorological factors i e temperature and precipitation to closely understand the interactions between vegetation and hydrometeorological factors the r between ndvi and temperature t p ce cr and ctwsc from 2004 to 2015 are shown in table 4 the strongest r appeared between ndvi and t at a monthly timescale with r 0 93 p 0 01 followed by p with r 0 79 p 0 01 this result suggests that the responses of vegetation to t and p are intense in this region ndvi was negatively correlated with cr r 0 49 p 0 01 while the relationship between ndvi and ctwsc was positively correlated r 0 37 p 0 01 the opposite effect of vegetation on r and twsc has been confirmed by previous studies lazo et al 2019 sun et al 2018 ukkola et al 2015 yang et al 2019a zhao et al 2012 on the one hand vegetation reduces r by rainfall intercept and transpiration iida et al 2020 yan et al 2021 on the other hand vegetation increases the soil infiltration rate which promotes p to recharge tws liu et al 2014 sun et al 2018 therefore vegetation can enhance the regulating of twsc on r by promoting p to recharge tws however the effect of vegetation on tws was weakened but its effect on r was strengthened at the annual timescale the positive correlation between ndvi and ctwsc was weakened from the monthly timescale to the annual timescale from 0 37 to 0 1 while the negative correlation between ndvi and cr was strengthened from 0 46 to 0 68 the role of vegetation in promoting tws which strengthens the regulation of tws on r could be misled as a direct effect of vegetation on r at the annual timescale therefore the relationship between vegetation and tws was neglected at the annual scale which resulted in the overrated role of annual vegetation on streamflow 4 3 the regulation of tws to streamflow the study shows that tws had a significant impact on intra annual streamflow variability the mean contributions of variance tws and covariance p and tws to streamflow variability are 11 and 21 respectively section 3 3 despite the low contribution to streamflow tws may provide a major recharge of streamflow in winter with a closer linear relationship and high relative proportion compared with p and e section 3 2 moreover the negative contribution 21 of p and tws to streamflow might be explained by the competition between tws and r for precipitation in the rainy season which is supported by the hydrological effects of rainfall intensity and vegetation sections 4 1 and 4 2 higher precipitation within twelve hours induced a higher r proportion and low tws proportion while low precipitation caused the opposite result similarly an opposite response of the partitioning of precipitation into r and tws to vegetation was observed in the relationship between monthly water supply and demand tws is not only a part of water supply st 1 but also a part of water demand st the unique ability of the monthly water cycle allows tws to reduce r in the rainy season and increase r in the dry season with an important role in the availability of water resources however warming shifts the balance between water supply and demand increasing tws to e condon et al 2020 thus the ability of tws to regulate r during wet and dry seasons needs to be further investigated 4 4 comparison with other monthly budyko models hydrological models based on the budyko framework have been applied to estimate monthly water balance terrestrial water storage is the key to extending the budyko model to a monthly timescale wu et al 2019 studies have developed a monthly budyko model by combining terrestrial water storage change with precipitation as the water supply wu et al 2019 ye et al 2015 while other efforts have been made to obtain a monthly model by integrating the budyko framework with the abcd model that can simulate soil moisture dynamics du et al 2016 zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 in contrast to the former the latter considers the hydrologic effect of monthly soil moisture storage dynamics the grace could independently provide the tws with a smaller error than other tws derived from the hydrological mode van dijk et al 2014 the advantage of grace in observing water storage is also reflected in the extended budyko model conversely grace has limitations in time observations began in 2002 and space coarse spatial scale which results in similar limitations in the extended budyko model 4 5 uncertainties three potential sources of uncertainty exist in the evaluation results the grace data the omission of human activities and the single study region here the three potential sources of uncertainty are discussed separately the grace products generally have three error sources measurement error model error from removing gravity signals other than tws and leakage error landerer and swenson 2012 soltani et al 2021 wiese et al 2016 in this study the leakage error needs to be considered previous studies have indicated that caution is warranted when the study area is smaller than 2 105 km2 the limited scale of the study area 2 8 105 km2 may induce leakage error despite the use of the average of five grace products in addition this study did not analyze individual pixels we would like to involve further spatial analysis that accounts for the individual pixels in future studies however we deem that the current study gives confidence in applying the grace product to evaluation terrestrial water storage conditions in the region this study analyzed intra annual streamflow variability with climate conditions and vegetation however human activities mainly irrigation damming mining and urbanization significantly impact streamflow song et al 2021 the land cover type of the study region is predominantly woodland with low population density owing to the steep terrain in the qinba mountains therefore the effects of irrigation mining and urbanization are limited moreover streamflow may be overestimated in the dry season e g winter while the impact of the danjiangkou reservoir on streamflow is negligible in the wet season the surface water area of the danjiangkou reservoir is approximately 350 km2 with a water level from 157 m to 170 m in recent years li et al 2015 liu et al 2018 the change in monthly water level is roughly considered to be 1 m which is equivalent to a water height of 1 5 mm over the study region note that the danjiangkou reservoir started sending water to northern china in late october 2014 with little impact on the water balance during the study period an extended budyko framework incorporating grace with good performance is developed in the qinba mountains previous studies have indicated that regional differences particularly in climate may affect the performance of hydrological models zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 although the qinba mountains can represent certain climate conditions more regions need to be included to comprehensively evaluate the extended model in the future 5 conclusions the study integrated monthly twsa from grace into the budyko framework with four different water balance equations based on this extended budyko model intra annual streamflow variability was investigated by quantifying the contributors of intra annual streamflow variability moreover the hydrologic effects of rainfall intensity and vegetation were subsequently discussed the main conclusions are as follows 1 an extended monthly budyko framework considering terrestrial water storage conditions from grace obtained applicable results in the qinba mountains china with similar performance the nses of the four budyko equations in simulating e and r ranged from 0 93 to 0 96 and 0 73 to 0 83 respectively moreover the performance of the extended model is improved by combining grace data compared to original budyko framework the r2 values of e and r increased from 0 82 to 0 95 and 0 43 to 0 81 respectively meanwhile the extended budyko framework successfully described this relationship between monthly water supply p st 1 and demand e st 2 in the wet season summer and autumn streamflow variability was dominated by p while tws and e significantly impacted streamflow variability in winter in spring p and e all played an important role in streamflow variability in general p is the dominant factor for intra annual streamflow variability the mean contribution of 50 followed by tws 11 and their covariance 21 moreover the role of tws approximately 45 mm a in the partitioning of precipitation and the regulation of streamflow during wet and dry periods is observed 3 the low rainfall intensity promotes the partitioning of p into tws and e while the large rainfall intensity is favorable for r to obtain the partitioning of p in the rainy season vegetation could promote the partitioning of p into tws while restraining the partitioning of p into r in the qinba mountains however the effect of vegetation on r may be overestimated due to the neglect of twsc at an annual timescale credit authorship

4038,artificial thermal effluent ate is used as an effective measure for solving the problem of ice damage in cold regions the ate outlets introduce thermal water approximately 10 c into the diversion channel to increase the temperature of the channel water this study discusses two approaches for determining the change in the water temperature during the winter operation period at the hongshanzui diversion channel situated on the manas river china one method involves field observations to determine the temperature change process of the diversion channel the results indicate that the water temperature of the diversion channel increased from 0 2 c to 1 0 c average 0 5 c after ate outlets were employed the process of change in the water temperature is segregated into rapid rising rapid dropping and slow decreasing periods while the water flows through the ate outlet the second approach includes numerical simulations performed with a 3d nonhydrostatic model validated with field observed water temperature data the current research explores fundamental relationships among air temperature diversion channel discharge ate out discharge ate out temperature and diversion channel water temperature the paper provides a discussion on the fundamental interdependency among the heat flux ratio hfr air temperature and diversion channel water temperature the water temperature attenuation curve is a power function distribution with a logarithmic relationship between the index and the hfr given by y 0 03ln x 0 2 further the air temperature of 10 c is the turning point of the attenuation law it is suggested that the changing process of water temperature in diversion channel after ate outlets could be segregated into sudden drop transitional and slowed down periods depending on the hfr and atmospheric temperature finally taking hongshanzui and jingou river hydropower stations as examples the calculated unfrozen influence distances in this study are compared with the calculated results of three previous studies which indicates that each method has its applicability and the calculation formula in this study takes into account the influence of various factors

tens of kilometers to obtain a definite head of power generation gao and jin 2003 in these systems ice creates operational constraints during winter and this can lead to reductions in power production problems are present in the various phases of the ice regime because of frazil ice ice runs and ice jams zufelt 2015 shen 2003 solarski and rzętała 2020 current ice removal techniques are costly hazardous and time consuming gebre et al 2013 a study of a swedish hydropower intake in the early 1990s estimated annual losses of 1 million to 2 million because of frazil clogging of intakes andersson 1997 the annual operations and maintenance costs at the us corps of engineers projects caused by ice problems were estimated at 33 million in 1992 haynes et al 1993 meanwhile counteracting ice problems cost 0 4 million in 2011 for the hongshanzui hydropower station in xinjiang china fig 1 shows the ice damage photo of the diversion channel fig 2 shows a photo of breaking the ice manually and by using tnt explosives approximately 2 0 t tnt explosives are used each year pictures from the bulletin board of hongshanzui hydropower station shot in 2011 therefore ice damage to the channel during a full winter operation period for hydropower stations in cold regions is an urgent issue to be solved shen 2010 numerous options exist for ice damage control including structural and nonstructural measures structural measures make use of levees small dams or an ice control structure ics lever and gooch 2001 lever and daly 2003 morse et al 2006 nonstructural measures include the application of heat through natural or artificial sources flow or discharge control and moving flood prone structures out of the floodplain sarraf 1987 1990 zhao et al 2015 wu et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 the idea behind the application of heat through natural sources is to release thermal water into nearby watercourses that partially melt an ice cover and reduce its thickness if sufficient heat is introduced into the receiving flow the ice cover can be melted completely over a large distance which essentially doubles the stream of the discharge point sarraf 1987 1990 prowse et al 2011 kempema et al 2011 therefore artificial thermal effluents ates were developed to prevent ice damage this involves injecting thermal water into the diversion channel to increase the temperature of the channel water this technology was first applied to the xiangjia hydropower station in qinghai province china deng and liu 1987 another successful application of ate is in the jingou river and hongshanzui hydropower stations in the manas river in xinjiang china wherein the technology produced better benefits it has been applied at these power stations since 1986 and 1995 respectively wang and ding 1991 wang et al 2009 the ate technology is an economical safe and feasible method to solve ice damage during the winter operation period of diversion type hydropower stations in high altitude and cold regions as verified through actual project operations liu et al 2008 predicting the effect of the thermal effluent on the freezing water is of considerable interest for solving the ice damage problem faced by water channels during the winter operation period the ability to predict the changing process in water temperature may be of value in designing thermal effluent networks to ensure ice free diversion channels in diversion channels the appropriate positioning of the thermal side effluent may permit the effective use of rivers throughout the winter period sarraf and al saleh 1987 however the position of the thermal side effluent depends on the change in the water temperature wu et al 2017 zong et al 2018 several different methods have been used to investigate changes in water temperatures rabi et al 2015 studied the daily water temperature using only mean air temperature and the results indicated that multilayer perceptron mlp is a much better method for the estimation and prediction of daily mean river temperature the model system hec ras was applied by bakken et al 2016 to investigate the changes in water temperatures introduced by changes in the operational regime based on the field data of water temperature li et al 2006 proposed a new formula for estimating the water temperature of a river using meteorological factors with the least squares method in addition a new method based on coupling of wavelet transformation wt and artificial intelligence ai techniques including mlp neural network mlpnn and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis models was implemented to simulate daily river water temperatures in the kupa river watershed croatia by zhu et al 2019a b graf and wrzesiński 2020 determined water temperature trends in rivers in poland between 1971 and 2015 in addition to their spatial and temporal patterns which may be useful in optimizing the management of aquatic ecosystems further ren et al 2020 and wang et al 2020 used different water heating models and assessment methods to identify river water temperature variations for the yellow river and yangtze river respectively the previous studies have explained the effects of hydrodynamic conditions or changes in meteorological conditions on natural river water temperatures however the research results of previous studies focused on the process of water temperature change in the long river the thermal side effluent technology involves the injection of thermal water into the diversion channel to increase the temperature of the channel water which is thermally mixed along the depth and width directions within a certain distance and this has typical local three dimensional characteristics zheng et al 2018 the focus is on the water temperature change in the local and short river sections and it requires more time and space precision therefore the above research results can provide a reference for studying the channel water temperature characteristics of the ate technology however it is difficult to apply directly some studies on the ate technology have focused on the channel water temperature changes caused by changes in single factors such as flow rate and water temperature for example wu et al 2016 2017 studied the water temperature change process of the diversion channel under different ate discharges considering the hongshanzui hydropower station as an example zhao et al 2015 and zhu et al 2015 analyzed the influence of the ate flow changes on channel water temperature based on ate experiments given the lack of existing water temperature field data for the thermal side effluent there is a need to further study the water temperature changing process in a diversion channel and to determine an optimum position for the thermal side effluent compared with single factors such as flow and water temperature the heat flux ratio hfr is the key factor that affects the attenuation law of water temperature along the channel unfortunately in the existing research results there are few studies on the influence of hfr changes on the attenuation law of water temperature along the channel therefore this study aims to research the attenuation law of water temperature for the ate technology from the perspective of hfr combined with the numerical simulation and prototype observation methods according to the research a quantitative estimation formula for the changing process of channel water temperature is established and a critical value of air temperature for the attenuation process of water temperature is proposed which are expected to further promote and better guide the practical application of ate technology in this study two approaches field based measurements and computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling were used to discuss the water temperature change process for the thermal side effluent during the winter operation period in the hongshanzui diversion channel a diversion channel with some thermal effluent releases is described and the methods are presented to obtain water temperature field results from measurements performed in the channel then a cfd model is proposed to assess the effect of thermal effluent release under various hydrodynamic and meteorological conditions field results are used to validate the cfd model study findings results are discussed in the context of how the thermal effluent influences the water temperature in the field and the optimization of the position of the thermal side effluent in the channel the findings from this study are expected to help supplement general diversion channel design guidelines in cold regions 2 principle of artificial thermal effluent ate the basic principle of the ate is to pull underground high temperature water using lift pumps from wells injected into the diversion channel to increase the temperature of the channel water as shown in fig 3 the discharge of a tributary thermal effluent into a cold water channel results in a substantial loss of heat to the ice cover sarraf 1990 zufelt 2015 the portion of heat that is not transferred to the atmosphere causes local melting of the ice cover sarraf and al saleh 1987 further it can control the development of frazil ice and border ice which is favorable as it can help keep the channel clear in addition the water from the ate outlets along the channel increase the potential energy to a value considerably higher than the power consumption i e ate technology can not only improve the water temperature of the channel but also increase the generated energy fig 4 depicts the thermal effluent networks and a schematic of the working principle of the ate technology for example if the water temperature in the upper channel is approximately 0 1 c and the temperature of the thermal effluent release is approximately 10 c the low temperature and high temperature water will mix after the ate outlet the mixed water temperature of the channel will become approximately 0 4 c near the shore which is higher than the freezing point in other words the resulting temperature after mixing can ensure unfrozen water for a long distance in the diversion channel 3 methods 3 1 study area hongshanzui hydropower station e 86 07 17 02 n 44 09 36 69 is one of the largest diversion power stations in the cold region of northwest china located on the manas river it comprises five ladder hydropower stations fig 5 the second diversion channel of hongshanzui hydropower station was selected as the study area to investigate the effect of ate on the water temperature field in the channel the length of the second diversion channel was 11 280 m with 13 ate outlets along the channel according to the statistics from hydrologic stations 1959 2020 it is shown that the multiyear mean air temperature is 5 9 c in the manas river basin and the lowest value of air temperature reaches approximately 40 c this is a typical cold region with winter from november to april this region has up to 130 days where the temperature is below the freezing point of water 0 c based on long term observation data the ice period of the manas river can be divided into the icing period early november to early january freezing period early january to early march and melting period mid march to early april according to the statistics most of the freezing period is around 50 90 days with a maximum of 113 days 1969 1970 the largest ice thickness at the river core and shore over the years are 0 85 m and 1 36 m respectively the diversion channel is endangered by freezing ice in winter which hampers operation efficiency the ate technology was used in the hongshanzui project since the 1990s to solve the ice damage problem for hydropower stations the operating parameters of every ate outlet along the second diversion channel are listed in table 1 3 2 field observation and data collection river ice phenomena include formation evolution transport accumulation dissipation and deterioration of various forms of ice shen 2003 beltaos 2000 prowse 2001 lal and shen 1991 at the beginning of winter when the water temperature drops to the freezing point further heat loss leads to supercooling and frazil ice formation subsequently diverse types of ice can form in rivers depending on flow intensity in slow flowing areas where the turbulence intensity is not sufficiently strong to mix the water or frazil ice crystals from the surface over the depth the skim ice can form on the supercooled water surface before the depth averaged water temperature drops to the freezing point in shore zones this appears in the formation of static border ice further cooling will lead to the thermal growth of the skim and border ice and the supercooling of turbulent flow in the river therefore if frazil ice is not formed around the shore zones i e if the water temperature near the shore is higher than the freezing point it can be guaranteed that no ice damage will occur according to the aforementioned theory the observation points for sampling the channel water were located 0 18 m from the shore at the water surface the water temperatures were measured in real time using a beckmann thermometer the temperature measurement was accurate within 0 002 0 01 c with a range of 20 c to 120 c which could meet the requirements during the measurement process the channel water was removed by a thermally insulated container to maintain a constant temperature for ensuring an accurate representation of the results the wind speeds were measured using an anemometer manufactured by tsi technologies company usa the maximum range and error limits were 30 m s and 0 015 m s respectively various observed data were collected by field observations from february to march in 2013 which include the related temperature of the channel water and the ate released water air temperature discharges of channel and ate outlets in this study water temperature data along the second diversion channel from ate outlets no 5 to no 13 were collected during the field observation period temperature distribution downstream of the point of effluent discharge is controlled by the hydrodynamic characteristics of the channel and the meteorological conditions prevailing at the site the air temperature at the site fluctuated inordinately throughout winter however it was particularly mild during the day as measured in the field on february 21 2013 the average air temperature was 2 c which was nearly constant the magnitude and extent of changes in the channel temperature distribution caused by the thermal side effluent input depends on the degree of mixing between the thermal effluent and cooler receiving flow and on the rate of heat exchange between the water and the atmosphere fig 6 presents the discharge of the channel the initial discharge of the diversion channel was 10 m3 s with the ates operating the discharge increases gradually to the sum of the initial value of the diversion channel and the injected amount of ate as shown in table 1 the discharge of the ate outlet is much smaller 0 139 m3 s than that of the channel which is negligible in present 3 3 cfd modeling 3 3 1 governing equations considering the maturity of the simulation of open channel flow jaeger et al 2019 chang et al 2020 ansys fluent was used to create a numerical model simulating the diversion channel with ate nos 9 10 and 11 as shown in fig 7 the model uses the finite volume method to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation in three dimensions the continuity equation is satisfied using the simple pressure velocity algorithm ansys 2018 an additional scalar transport equation is solved to consider the temperature effects through the boussinesq assumption haque et al

2 boundary and initial conditions the channel geometries of the model match the dimensions of the diversion channel the length and top surface width of the channel are 1 8 km and 10 6 m respectively the bottom width is 1 0 m and the mean depth is approximately 2 75 m boundary conditions are applied to all faces of the domain water surface the top surface was modeled using a rigid lid approximation which implies that the water air surface is modeled as a rigid ceiling this approach is valid if the deformation of the water surface is less than 10 of the channel rodriguez et al 2004 lundström et al 2010 andersson et al 2013 in the present study the discharge from the upstream is constant fig 6 in other words the water surface in the channel is almost level which is well suited to this hypothesis the rigid lid approximation allows the use of larger time steps which saves computer time sengupta et al 1977 the heat transfer at the free surface should include short wave radiation long wave radiation evaporation and convection processes politano et al 2008 zheng et al 2017a ren et al 2020 however the effects of short and long wave radiation are reflected in a long time series which does not affect the results of the present study in addition according to the wind data wind velocity is normally less than 2 m s with a slight variation during winter hence given the study objective wave radiation and wind effects are neglected and only the atmospheric temperature on the free surface is specified in the present study haque et al 2007 inlet and outlet the mass flow rate and measured temperature were specified at the upstream inflow section and ate outlets in present the channel and ate discharges are listed in table 2 the temperature at the upstream inflow section varied from 0 1 c to 1 5 c the temperature in ate outlets varied from 8 0 c to 12 0 c the outlet of the diversion channel is defined as the outflow with a specified discharge where turbulent variables are assumed to be zero the discharge at the outflow section is equal to the sum of that in the diversion channel and ate outlets walls and channel bed a no slip condition and zero heat flux are imposed on all walls and the channel bed politano et al 2008 the standard wall function is used for the viscosity layer near the wall initial condition according to the field observation results there were zero or slight changes in the water temperature distribution along the depth further variations were observed only near ate outlets therefore a certain temperature is initialized in the full field to accelerate convergence politano et al 2006 zheng et al 2015 the heat flux is limited to atmospheric exchange assuming no conduction from the bed bakken et al 2016 zheng et al 2017b the initial velocity values of the diversion channel and ate outlet are 0 3 3 3 computational mesh and grid convergence study the computational grid scale should reflect the effects of the hydraulic structure and topography on the flow and temperature fields in the simulated region about the largest element it is determined by the scale of concern and the number of grids economic feasibility should also be considered a mesh sensitivity study of the entire channel was performed with different numerical grids with 0 89 1 8 and 3 2 million grids the water temperature near the shore along the channel was evaluated after ate outlet no 9 for the different grids and the conclusion was that the coarsest mesh did not capture the temperature variation with sufficient accuracy a mesh with 1 8 million grids produced a very similar temperature field to that of the 3 2 million mesh with significantly lower computational cost hence the 1 8 million grids mesh was selected the range of longitudinal and lateral grid dimensions of the channel region were 0 1 5 0 m and 0 1 0 3 m respectively the minimum and mean sizes in the depth direction were 0 1 m and 0 15 m respectively the complex geometry regions near the ate outlets were the key positions for the present calculation and required refined grids with an average volume of 0 05 m 0 25 m 0 25 m the cell dimensions along the vertical direction except near the bottom and free surfaces decreased mesh refinement was performed along the vertical direction near the top surface to resolve the strong thermal gradients for ensuring consistency with the field data the local grids of the numerical computations are shown in fig 7 3 3 4 numerical conditions numerical calculations were performed at the china institute of water resources and hydropower research iwhr the stability of the solutions is an important factor for accuracy and therefore a courant number analysis is required the courant number which is an important criterion for stability control limits the time step size and mesh size ratio which should be less than or equal to 1 chippada et al 1994 anderson 1995 boz et al 2014 thus the time step δt is calculated as 6 δ t m i n δ x u δ y v where δ x and δ y denote the minimum sizes of the grid cell in the x and y directions respectively the x direction is the main flow direction in the diversion channel and the y direction represents the ate flow direction as indicated in fig 7 in this study a fixed time step of 0 01 s was used such that the maximum courant number did not exceed 0 40 anywhere in the domain most simulations employing meshes with 1 8 million grids were run in real time using four processors of a linux pc cluster the average time to obtain a solution from scratch was approximately seven days this is a reasonable time that allows the model to be used as a design tool by the hydropower industry 4 field results and cfd model validation 4 1 effect analysis of ate the water temperature of the channel measured before and after the ate outlets on february 21 2013 is shown in fig 8 the water temperature of the channel before the addition of the ate outlet is the average value measured at a position 5 m upstream from the ate outlet and at 0 18 m from the shore this represents the channel water temperature without warm water injection as referenced above the water temperature of the channel after the ate outlet is the average value at a position 5 m downstream of the ate outlet this represents the channel water temperature with warm water injection the water temperature of the ate was approximately 10 c which is considerably higher than the freezing point 0 c this implies that the ate release ensures an increase in the water temperature of the channel and guarantees unfrozen water along a certain distance the water temperature of the channel is only 0 2 c before ate no 5 as indicated in fig 8 this temperature is close to the freezing point i e in the absence of warm water injection into the channel the surface water would freeze quickly over a short distance however when warm water is injected into the channel through ate no 5 the average water temperature of the channel in the measurement range increases rapidly to 0 8 c the comparison of the water temperature between the front and back region of every ate outlet confirmed that the warm water injected into channel increases the channel water temperature with an average value of 0 5 c the maximum increase occurred at the position of ate no 9 with an increase of 1 0 c the analysis results suggest that the effect of ate technology on increasing water temperature is appreciable further according to the field results the water temperature increased along the channel with an increase in the number of ate for example the water temperature after ate no 5 is approximately 1 0 c whereas it reached 2 8 c after ate no 13 thus the heat flux continuously injected into the channel by the ate was greater than the loss of heat flux which resulted in an obvious accumulation of heat flux in the channel further this implies that the operation schedule of the ate is currently lacking in rationality and must be optimized according to the variation of water temperature along the diversion channel 4 2 heat exchange process in channel the heat exchange process occurs with convection at the water top surface and diffusion in the channel in winter the water temperature decreases between the two ate outlets the water samples were obtained at distances of 5 10 20 30 50 100 150 250 and 350 m downstream in each ate outlet to study the water temperature attenuation law along the channel after ate outlets fig 9 shows the changing process of water temperature in the 350 m range after each ate outlet the water temperature after ate declined as a whole in addition the water temperature decreased sharply within approximately 50 m after the ate with significant fluctuation while exceeding 50 m after the ate the decrease in water temperature slowed although there were some fluctuations the fluctuation values were considerably smaller than those upstream if warm water is mixed with cold water the higher temperature water quickly transfers heat to the lower temperature water which increases the temperature of the cold water significantly shammaa and zhu 2010 the channel water temperature near the ate at 5 m was close to 3 0 c influenced by the high temperature water released by the ate however the channel discharge was considerably larger than that of the ate therefore the average channel water temperature rapidly decreases along the distance until it reaches stabilization in summary when the high temperature water of ate was first injected into the channel the water temperature of the diversion channel increased rapidly with an average value of 0 5 c approximately after ate outlets were employed water temperature would be dropped rapidly within a short distance about 50 m and slowly decreased along the channel until it reached the position where the next ate was located at the process of change in the water temperature is segregated into rapid rising rapid dropping and slow decreasing periods while the water flows through the ate outlet 4 3 cfd model validation the quantitative measurements of water temperature are vital to clarify the effect of ate technology however several factors involved in the heat exchange process led to difficulties in assessing the effect particularly for natural water bodies therefore the present study uses numerical results to complement the results from field observations in the present study water temperatures along the channel after ate outlets nos 9 10 and 11 were used for verification the simulation results for the outlet placed at a distance of 0 18 m from the shore at the water surface along the channel are extracted as shown in fig 10 the field collected data from 26 points are compared with the simulation results from the same position the water temperature values of all positions show good agreement the minimum and maximum water temperature of the measured results were 1 45 c and 2 13 c respectively and the average water temperature among all measured points was 1 73 c the water temperature from the simulation results in the same area varied from 1 42 c to 2 22 c and the average temperature was 1 69 c the maximum and minimum error values were 0 15 c and 0 01 c with relative errors of 8 93 and 0 03 respectively the average relative error was 4 61 which is significantly less than the allowable error of 10 this indicates that the numerical accuracy met the needs of the study moriasi et al 2007 5 cfd results 5 1 influence of heat flux ratio on the heat exchange the heat flux should be defined according to the previous achievements of mishima and nishihara 1987 zheng et al 2015 tananaev et al 2019 and georgiadi et al 2017 to investigate changes in water temperature caused by changes in the heat flux ratio the study object was divided into several layers wherein each layer has a depth d h then velocity v is multiplied by water temperature t on each layer the total heat flux is obtained using an integral method and it is represented as 7 q q ω t ρ ω ρ 0 h vtdh where q q ω ρ and v t and h denote the heat flux flow discharge m3 s specific heat capacity of water 4 186 kj kg c water density kg m3 and the water velocity m s temperature c and depth m respectively the water depth h of the diversion channel is 2 75 m which is small the density of warm water is increased for temperatures below 4 c the heat flux ratio is the ratio between the heat flux from the ate and that from upstream ahead of the ate outlet it is expressed as 8 hfr q m ω t m ρ q u ω t u ρ q m t m q u t u where subscripts m and u represent the ate and upstream ahead of the ate outlet respectively the atmospheric temperature was assumed to be 2 c and the discharge and water temperature of diversion channel at upstream was 5 0 20 0 m3 s and 0 2 1 5 c respectively furthermore the discharge of ate was 0 07 0 21 m3 s and the water temperature was 8 0 12 0 c to quantify the attenuation law and corresponding hfr values frazil ice is formed near the shore first which indicates that the water temperature near the bank should be emphasized rather than the maximum temperature at the cross section similar to the field observations 176 numerical points near the bank were obtained in this study fig 11 shows the water temperature variations along the channel with an upstream water temperature of 1 5 c and an effluent temperature of 10 0 c as anticipated the water temperature in the channel increased rapidly with an increase in the effluent temperature after mixing the warm and cold water heat exchange occurs along the longitudinal transverse direction and the effluent temperature decreases predominantly downstream near the shore on the side of the effluent discharge the changes in diversion channel water temperature after ate outlets can be segregated into three periods along the distance sudden drop period δt l 10 transitional period 10 δt l 1 and slowed down period δt l less than 1 rabi et al 2015 danner et al 2012 beaufort et al 2016 as shown in fig 11 where δt and l represent the difference in water temperature and distance respectively in the sudden drop period the water temperature with 10 0 c from ate decreased quickly to 2 5 c and the range of that period can be expressed as the effect of ate technology which depends on the hfr values the larger the hfr value representing a larger difference for water temperatures between that from ate outlet and in channel the shorter is the distance of the sudden drop period for example the numerical results indicate that the distance of the sudden drop period was about 20 m for hfr 1 9 but only 10 m for hfr 3 4 subsequently the water temperature changes slowed and passed through the transitional period in this period the water temperature of the diversion channel steadily declined from 2 5 c to 1 8 c the descent speed was considerably lower than that at the sudden drop period the final stage was the slowed down period wherein the water temperature dropped slowly along the distance as mentioned previously the hfr represents the ratio between the heat flux from the ate and that from the upstream ahead of the ate outlet table 1 and fig 6 for the hongshanzui hydropower station indicate that the hfr values are always less than 1 thus the present work takes different hfr values that are less than 1 to study the variations of t tu with distance from the ate outlet at 2 c air temperature where tu and t represent the water surface temperature upstream of the ate outlet and along the distance after the ate outlet respectively when the heat flux being injected into the diversion channel is constant a larger hfr value represents a lower water temperature upstream in the channel and downstream of the ate outlet the water temperature t0 at the starting point of the transitional section was considered in the present study as shown in fig 12 to facilitate the comparison of the heat exchange process with different hfr conditions in the figures the curves include two stages indicate the transitional period and the slowed down period compare to fig 11 the stage of sudden drop is ignored it is because the attenuation law of channel water temperature is almost same at this stage all results fall in a narrow band of constant width and the variation of water temperature near the shore follows a generalized trend line which displays a good power function relationship with a squared correlation coefficient r2 of 0 93 0 99 that is the decay curve can be expressed as 9 t t 0 k l a l 0 where k and a represent the control coefficients and k depends on the initial water temperature during the transitional period the fitting results show that k for the heat exchange in the channel was approximately 1 19 1 21 in all scenarios which can take an average value of 1 2 in the present study the coefficient a implies the attenuation speed of the channel water temperature along the distance and this affects the ate arrangement in the field it was found that a gradually increases with an increasing hfr the larger hfr value indicated a lower upstream water temperature in the diversion channel in the case of a certain heat flux injected into as such there is an enhanced difference in the water temperature of the ate outlet compared to that in the diversion channel which resulted in a faster decrease in the channel water temperature the variation in a with the hfr value is shown in fig 13 the fitting curve describing a can be expressed as 10 y 0 03 ln x 0 2 r 2 0 83 where y represents coefficient a and x is equal to the hfr value in fig 14 the red dashed line represents a 10 error fig 13 indicates that all the numerical points fall within a narrow band of 10 error width 5 2 influence of atmospheric temperature on the heat exchange in addition to the heat flux of the diversion channel and the ate outlet climatological conditions play key roles that significantly influence the heat exchange process in the channel ashton 1979 in this study wind velocity and air temperature are considered the dominant climatological factors from historical wind data it is known that there was slight variation for wind velocity during the winter at the study site and this was always 1 5 2 0 m s therefore air temperatures in the range of 2 c 30 c were selected to study the effect of meteorological conditions on the heat exchange process the purpose of the ate is to increase the water temperature of the channel to guarantee unfrozen water for long distances in the diversion channel thus the influence distance by ate is an important objective of the present study based on the results of the influence of hfr on the heat exchange it is concluded that the larger the hfr value the faster is the heat exchange in the channel i e the larger hfr value is an unfavorable condition in terms of the influence distance by ate therefore hfr 0 75 is employed to study the effect of ate in the present study to better serve engineering applications with a wind velocity of 2 0 m s the initial water temperature from the channel and ate outlet are 0 2 c and 10 c respectively fig 14 shows the attenuation law of the diversion channel water temperature near the bank for different air temperature values the temperature of water discharged from the ate outlet rapidly decayed to less than 1 0 c in a short distance less than1 0 m therefore the results shown in fig 14 ignored water temperatures higher than 1 0 c changes in the channel water temperature can be segregated into sudden drop transitional and slowed down periods in contrast the distance of every period was relatively uniform at different atmospheric temperatures the first sudden drop period was approximately 9 m from the ate outlet at this period the channel water temperature dropped rapidly from 1 0 c to 0 6 c and the attenuation trend was uniform in the case of different atmospheric temperatures in other words there was a low influence of atmospheric temperature on the changing process in the channel water temperature at the sudden drop period the next stage was the transitional stage which ranged from approximately 9 200 m from the ate outlet the influence of atmospheric temperature on changes at this stage became significant the lower the atmospheric temperature the faster the temperature drop of water the slowed down period started from approximately 200 m and the change laws presented linear attenuation in the case of every atmospheric temperature during this period however the decay rate was lower than that in the transitional period which is almost the same as that of the no thermal side effluent zheng et al 2018 the figure shows that the variation of water temperature along the channel for different atmospheric temperatures showed a good attenuation law of power function as 11 y b x n where b refers to the initial value and n is the decay rate with a decrease in the atmospheric temperature the decay rate n of the channel water temperature is accelerated coefficients b are 1 166 1 220 1 354 2 218 and 2 455 for 2 c 5 c 10 c 20 c and 30 c respectively further coefficients n are 0 316 0 351 0 406 0 631 and 0 718 comparing the attenuation law of the channel temperature it is implied that the atmospheric temperature of 10 c was the turning point of the attenuation law when the atmospheric temperature was higher than 10 c between 10 c and 2 c the attenuation curve of the channel water temperature was approximately uniform and the value of n which represents the attenuation speed ranged only from 0 31 0 40 further it has been suggested that the attenuation law of the diversion channel water temperature can be considered approximately the same as that when the atmospheric temperature is higher than 10 c that is only the influence of the change in hfr should be considered to study the variation of channel water temperature in the case of a particular atmospheric temperature the value of n changed rapidly from 0 4 to 0 7 when the atmospheric temperature dropped directly from 10 to 30 c this indicates that the influence of atmospheric temperature on changes in the channel water temperature are significant that is the atmospheric temperature must be considered concomitantly with hfr to study the variation of channel temperature when the atmospheric temperature is lower than 10 c 6 discussion ate technology involves injecting thermal water into a channel to warm the cold water given the complexity of the change process of the diversion channel water temperature for the ate technology this study explored the change process in channel water temperature by considering a single influence factor in the case of fixed external conditions the water temperature in the diversion channel drops rapidly initially and then slowly this was confirmed by the good agreement between the results of the as indicated by the field observations and numerical simulations the channel water temperature increased from 0 2 c to 1 0 c when the cold water flowed through the ate outlet this suggested that the ate technology had an obvious warming effect on the diversion channel water 6 1 influence distance the influence distance of the ate is a key factor for controlling the arrangement of ate outlets along the diversion channel and it is obtained from the law of the heat exchange process the influence distance can be divided into theoretical and unfrozen influence distances the theoretical influence distance is from the ate outlet to the site where the water temperature is equal to that at the head of the channel according to the field observation data in the jingou river and hongshanzui hydropower station diversion channels the initial channel water temperature is approximately 0 1 0 2 c at the head of the channel in winter in contrast the unfrozen influence distance is the length when the water temperature is larger than the freezing point 0 01 c in the present study wang and ding 1991 tie 1999 in the past decades some pioneers proposed empirical formulas to measure the influence distance of the channel combined with actual projects such as terenchuk river the left tributary of the kouban river hydropower station in russia пoтaлoв 1955 xiangjia hydropower station deng and liu 1987 and jingou river hydropower station wang and ding 1991 unfortunately the above calculation formula has its own limitations пoтaлoв 1955 and deng and liu 1987 consider only the mixed water depth mixed flow rate and mixed water temperature and do not consider the air temperature this would result in similar calculated lengths irrespective of the air temperature although wang and ding 1991 consider the discharge water temperature and air temperature in the heat exchange process their formula for unfrozen influence distance requires additional eight parameters to be calculated accurately in advance which will lead to a large calculation error due to the absence or inaccuracy of meteorological conditions as per the common air temperature in winter in the hongshanzui division channel the influence distances with air temperature 2 5 10 20 and 30 c respectively were calculated as summarized in table 3 by relationship 11 table 3 indicates that when the atmospheric temperature is higher than 10 c the calculations show that the distance with a water temperature larger than 0 1 c is nearly 600 2500 m which is the theoretical influence distance further the distance with a water temperature larger than the freezing point 0 01 c in the present study is almost between 177948 m and 3468848 m unfrozen influence distance and this is considerably longer than the distance of the second diversion channel of the hongshanzui hydropower station total 11280 m thus it was proved that when the atmospheric temperature is higher than 10 c the operation of one ate point at the head of the channel can ensure that the water temperature is higher than the freezing point along the entire second diversion channel however if the atmospheric temperature ranges between 20 30 c the theoretical influence distance is reduced from 80 m to 150 m which is considerably shorter than that calculated under the 10 c conditions according to the field observation results reported by wang et al 2009 some ice flowers above 50 concentration are formed at the 500 m site after the ate outlet without an ice sheet jam or ice sheet when the atmospheric temperature is 32 c this is consistent with the results of the present study the calculated value of the unfrozen influence distance is 2132 m under an atmospheric temperature of 30 c when calculating based on the freezing point and the relative error is 7 68 compared with the measure value of 1980 m zong et al 2018 from the operating parameters of the ates the distance between the two ate outlets is approximately from 250 m to 1 440 m which indicates that the operation of one ate can only ensure that the water temperature is above the freezing point in the channel between the operating ate and the next one in this case every ate should be operating to keep the entire diversion channel ice free considering the jingou river as an example the unfrozen influence distances are calculated by relationship 11 under the atmospheric temperature of 20 c as shown in fig 15 the calculation results were compared with the measured values the calculated unfrozen influence distance is 5222 m in the jingou river channel under an atmospheric temperature of 20 c and the relative error is 3 30 compared with the measured value of 5400 m therefore the calculation results of the unfrozen influence distance in this study are consistent with the prototype observation results 6 2 comparison of different relationships the results of this study are compared with the calculated results of пoтaлoв 1955 deng and liu 1987 and wang and ding 1991 fig 15 shows that the results of the unfrozen influence distance obtained by the various calculation formulas are considerably different the calculation results of пoтaлoв 1955 and deng and liu 1987 show that the change of the unfrozen influence distance tends to be the same as the temperature changes regardless of how the air temperature changes the unfrozen influence distance is almost the same which is inconsistent with the law that the influence distance becomes shorter as the temperature decreases this is because the two formulas are empirical formulas based on the diversion channel of a certain power plant wherein fewer influencing factors were considered to significantly change the calculation results thus the two formulas mentioned above have their own applicable conditions for example the unfrozen influence distances calculated by пoтaлoв 1955 and deng and liu 1987 are 1978 m and 5798 m respectively under the conditions of air temperature 20 and 30 c this result shows that the allowable value of the unfrozen influence distance is very small even under high air temperature conditions therefore these two calculated methods are applicable only to the case where the water source is warm spring water or when the upstream has a large reservoir and the water diversion channel is short comparing the calculation results of this study with those of wang and ding 1991 the unfrozen influence distance shortens faster from 5222 to 2132 m and from 5696 to 2894 m as the temperature drops from 20 to 30 c and its change is more obvious with the measured values from 5400 to 1980 m however it is obvious that the relative errors of wang and ding 1991 with 5 48 and 46 16 respectively are larger than those of this study the above analysis results indicate that each method for calculating the unfrozen influence distance is applicable however the three existing formulas are not applicable to the diversion channel of the hongshanzui hydropower station the calculation formula in this study considers the influence of various factors and has a wider application scope 7 conclusions in this study the temperature dynamics within the diversion channel of hongshanzui hydropower station in the manas river of xinjiang were studied using two mutually exclusive approaches including field based measurements and computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling the influence of several factors including the heat flux ratio and air temperature on the channel water temperature were simulated the following conclusions were drawn from this study 1 based on the field observation results the water temperature of the diversion channel increased from 0 2 c to 1 0 c average 0 5 c after ate outlets were employed the channel water temperature would be dropped rapidly within a short distance about 50 m and slowly decreased along the channel until it reached the position where the next ate was located at therefore the process of change in the water temperature is segregated into rapid rising rapid dropping and slow decreasing periods while the water flows through the ate outlet 2 the fundamental interdependency among the heat flux ratio hfr air temperature and diversion channel water temperature were discussed based on simulation results it is suggested that the changing process of water temperature in diversion channel after ate outlets could be segregated into sudden drop transitional and slowed down periods depending on the hfr and atmospheric temperature 3 according to the simulated results it could be deduced that the water temperature attenuation curve is a power function distribution with a logarithmic relationship between the index and the hfr given by y 0 03ln x 0 2 further the air temperature of 10 c is the turning point of the attenuation law the change in temperature is considered to be uniform when the air temperature is higher than 10 c if the air temperature is lower than 10 c it significantly affects the variation in water temperature 4 taking hongshanzui and jingou river hydropower stations as examples the influence distances are calculated under different air temperature which the unfrozen influence distances are compared with the calculated results of пoтaлoв 1955 deng and liu 1987 and wang and ding 1991 according to the comparative analysis it indicates that each method has its applicability and the calculation formula in this study takes into account the influence of various factors and has a wider scope of application 5 combined with the results of numerical simulation and field observation the heat exchange process along the ate channel was analyzed in this study and the influence of hfr and air temperature conditions on the attenuation law of channel water temperature was discussed however due to the limited application of ate technology as well as insufficient in data collection of flow rate water temperature and air temperature the water temperature attenuation relationship established in present study is only limited to 0 hfr 1 and 30 c air temperature 0 c which indicated that the universality needs to be further verified in the future in order to establish the calculation relationship of ate influence distance with good versatility it is necessary to develop the long time series monitoring data of multi year and multi factor changes in different hydropower stations and different regions credit authorship contribution statement tiegang zheng conceptualization data curation formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing quanli zong

4038,artificial thermal effluent ate is used as an effective measure for solving the problem of ice damage in cold regions the ate outlets introduce thermal water approximately 10 c into the diversion channel to increase the temperature of the channel water this study discusses two approaches for determining the change in the water temperature during the winter operation period at the hongshanzui diversion channel situated on the manas river china one method involves field observations to determine the temperature change process of the diversion channel the results indicate that the water temperature of the diversion channel increased from 0 2 c to 1 0 c average 0 5 c after ate outlets were employed the process of change in the water temperature is segregated into rapid rising rapid dropping and slow decreasing periods while the water flows through the ate outlet the second approach includes numerical simulations performed with a 3d nonhydrostatic model validated with field observed water temperature data the current research explores fundamental relationships among air temperature diversion channel discharge ate out discharge ate out temperature and diversion channel water temperature the paper provides a discussion on the fundamental interdependency among the heat flux ratio hfr air temperature and diversion channel water temperature the water temperature attenuation curve is a power function distribution with a logarithmic relationship between the index and the hfr given by y 0 03ln x 0 2 further the air temperature of 10 c is the turning point of the attenuation law it is suggested that the changing process of water temperature in diversion channel after ate outlets could be segregated into sudden drop transitional and slowed down periods depending on the hfr and atmospheric temperature finally taking hongshanzui and jingou river hydropower stations as examples the calculated unfrozen influence distances in this study are compared with the calculated results of three previous studies which indicates that each method has its applicability and the calculation formula in this study takes into account the influence of various factors and has a wider scope of application keywords ice damage artificial thermal effluent ate water temperature change process heat flux ratio hfr 1 introduction hydropower is a major energy source in cold climate countries prowse et al 2011 gebre et al 2013 and the largest renewable energy source offering significant potential for reducing carbon emissions which accounts for nearly 20 of the total electricity production in the world panwar et al 2011 demirbas 2009 saber et al 2021 diversion hydropower plants divert portions of river flow usually all the water up to the turbine capacity except for some instream flow through channels or pipelines using a low or in very rare cases partial dam habit et al 2007 the diversion hydropower station constructs a diversion channel spanning several tens of kilometers to obtain a definite head of power generation gao and jin 2003 in these systems ice creates operational constraints during winter and this can lead to reductions in power production problems are present in the various phases of the ice regime because of frazil ice ice runs and ice jams zufelt 2015 shen 2003 solarski and rzętała 2020 current ice removal techniques are costly hazardous and time consuming gebre et al 2013 a study of a swedish hydropower intake in the early 1990s estimated annual losses of 1 million to 2 million because of frazil clogging of intakes andersson 1997 the annual operations and maintenance costs at the us corps of engineers projects caused by ice problems were estimated at 33 million in 1992 haynes et al 1993 meanwhile counteracting ice problems cost 0 4 million in 2011 for the hongshanzui hydropower station in xinjiang china fig 1 shows the ice damage photo of the diversion channel fig 2 shows a photo of breaking the ice manually and by using tnt explosives approximately 2 0 t tnt explosives are used each year pictures from the bulletin board of hongshanzui hydropower station shot in 2011 therefore ice damage to the channel during a full winter operation period for hydropower stations in cold regions is an urgent issue to be solved shen 2010 numerous options exist for ice damage control including structural and nonstructural measures structural measures make use of levees small dams or an ice control structure ics lever and gooch 2001 lever and daly 2003 morse et al 2006 nonstructural measures include the application of heat through natural or artificial sources flow or discharge control and moving flood prone structures out of the floodplain sarraf 1987 1990 zhao et al 2015 wu et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 the idea behind the application of heat through natural sources is to release thermal water into nearby watercourses that partially melt an ice cover and reduce its thickness if sufficient heat is introduced into the receiving flow the ice cover can be melted completely over a large distance which essentially doubles the stream of the discharge point sarraf 1987 1990 prowse et al 2011 kempema et al 2011 therefore artificial thermal effluents ates were developed to prevent ice damage this involves injecting thermal water into the diversion channel to increase the temperature of the channel water this technology was first applied to the xiangjia hydropower station in qinghai province china deng and liu 1987 another successful application of ate is in the jingou river and hongshanzui hydropower stations in the manas river in xinjiang china wherein the technology produced better benefits it has been applied at these power stations since 1986 and 1995 respectively wang and ding 1991 wang et al 2009 the ate technology is an economical safe and feasible method to solve ice damage during the winter operation period of diversion type hydropower stations in high altitude and cold regions as verified through actual project operations liu et al 2008 predicting the effect of the thermal effluent on the freezing water is of considerable interest for solving the ice damage problem faced by water channels during the winter operation period the ability to predict the changing process in water temperature may be of value in designing thermal effluent networks to ensure ice free diversion channels in diversion channels the appropriate positioning of the thermal side effluent may permit the effective use of rivers throughout the winter period sarraf and al saleh 1987 however the position of the thermal side effluent depends on the change in the water temperature wu et al 2017 zong et al 2018 several different methods have been used to investigate changes in water temperatures rabi et al 2015 studied the daily water temperature using only mean air temperature and the results indicated that multilayer perceptron mlp is a much better method for the estimation and prediction of daily mean river temperature the model system hec ras was applied by bakken et al 2016 to investigate the changes in water temperatures introduced by changes in the operational regime based on the field data of water temperature li et al 2006 proposed a new formula for estimating the water temperature of a river using meteorological factors with the least squares method in addition a new method based on coupling of wavelet transformation wt and artificial intelligence ai techniques including mlp neural network mlpnn and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis models was implemented to simulate daily river water temperatures in the kupa river watershed croatia by zhu et al 2019a b graf and wrzesiński 2020 determined water temperature trends in rivers in poland between 1971 and 2015 in addition to their spatial and temporal patterns which may be useful in optimizing the management of aquatic ecosystems further ren et al 2020 and wang et al 2020 used different water heating models and assessment methods to identify river water temperature variations for the yellow river and yangtze river respectively the previous studies have explained the effects of hydrodynamic conditions or changes in meteorological conditions on natural river water temperatures however the research results of previous studies focused on the process of water temperature change in the long river the thermal side effluent technology involves the injection of thermal water into the diversion channel to increase the temperature of the channel water which is thermally mixed along the depth and width directions within a certain distance and this has typical local three dimensional characteristics zheng et al 2018 the focus is on the water temperature change in the local and short river sections and it requires more time and space precision therefore the above research results can provide a reference for studying the channel water temperature characteristics of the ate technology however it is difficult to apply directly some studies on the ate technology have focused on the channel water temperature changes caused by changes in single factors such as flow rate and water temperature for example wu et al 2016 2017 studied the water temperature change process of the diversion channel under different ate discharges considering the hongshanzui hydropower station as an example zhao et al 2015 and zhu et al 2015 analyzed the influence of the ate flow changes on channel water temperature based on ate experiments given the lack of existing water temperature field data for the thermal side effluent there is a need to further study the water temperature changing process in a diversion channel and to determine an optimum position for the thermal side effluent compared with single factors such as flow and water temperature the heat flux ratio hfr is the key factor that affects the attenuation law of water temperature along the channel unfortunately in the existing research results there are few studies on the influence of hfr changes on the attenuation law of water temperature along the channel therefore this study aims to research the attenuation law of water temperature for the ate technology from the perspective of hfr combined with the numerical simulation and prototype observation methods according to the research a quantitative estimation formula for the changing process of channel water temperature is established and a critical value of air temperature for the attenuation process of water temperature is proposed which are expected to further promote and better guide the practical application of ate technology in this study two approaches field based measurements and computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling were used to discuss the water temperature change process for the thermal side effluent during the winter operation period in the hongshanzui diversion channel a diversion channel with some thermal effluent releases is described and the methods are presented to obtain water temperature field results from measurements performed in the channel then a cfd model is proposed to assess the effect of thermal effluent release under various hydrodynamic and meteorological conditions field results are used to validate the cfd model study findings results are discussed in the context of how the thermal effluent influences the water temperature in the field and the optimization of the position of the thermal side effluent in the channel the findings from this study are expected to help supplement general diversion channel design guidelines in cold regions 2 principle of artificial thermal effluent ate the basic principle of the ate is to pull underground high temperature water using lift pumps from wells injected into the diversion channel to increase the temperature of the channel water as shown in fig 3 the discharge of a tributary thermal effluent into a cold water channel results in a substantial loss of heat to the ice cover sarraf 1990 zufelt 2015 the portion of heat that is not transferred to the atmosphere causes local melting of the ice cover sarraf and al saleh 1987 further it can control the development of frazil ice and border ice which is favorable as it can help keep the channel clear in addition the water from the ate outlets along the channel increase the potential energy to a value considerably higher than the power consumption i e ate technology can not only improve the water temperature of the channel but also increase the generated energy fig 4 depicts the thermal effluent networks and a schematic of the working principle of the ate technology for example if the water temperature in the upper channel is approximately 0 1 c and the temperature of the thermal effluent release is approximately 10 c the low temperature and high temperature water will mix after the ate outlet the mixed water temperature of the channel will become approximately 0 4 c near the shore which is higher than the freezing point in other words the resulting temperature after mixing can ensure unfrozen water for a long distance in the diversion channel 3 methods 3 1 study area hongshanzui hydropower station e 86 07 17 02 n 44 09 36 69 is one of the largest diversion power stations in the cold region of northwest china located on the manas river it comprises five ladder hydropower stations fig 5 the second diversion channel of hongshanzui hydropower station was selected as the study area to investigate the effect of ate on the water temperature field in the channel the length of the second diversion channel was 11 280 m with 13 ate outlets along the channel according to the statistics from hydrologic stations 1959 2020 it is shown that the multiyear mean air temperature is 5 9 c in the manas river basin and the lowest value of air temperature reaches approximately 40 c this is a typical cold region with winter from november to april this region has up to 130 days where the temperature is below the freezing point of water 0 c based on long term observation data the ice period of the manas river can be divided into the icing period early november to early january freezing period early january to early march and melting period mid march to early april according to the statistics most of the freezing period is around 50 90 days with a maximum of 113 days 1969 1970 the largest ice thickness at the river core and shore over the years are 0 85 m and 1 36 m respectively the diversion channel is endangered by freezing ice in winter which hampers operation efficiency the ate technology was used in the hongshanzui project since the 1990s to solve the ice damage problem for hydropower stations the operating parameters of every ate outlet along the second diversion channel are listed in table 1 3 2 field observation and data collection river ice phenomena include formation evolution transport accumulation dissipation and deterioration of various forms of ice shen 2003 beltaos 2000 prowse 2001 lal and shen 1991 at the beginning of winter when the water temperature drops to the freezing point further heat loss leads to supercooling and frazil ice formation subsequently diverse types of ice can form in rivers depending on flow intensity in slow flowing areas where the turbulence intensity is not sufficiently strong to mix the water or frazil ice crystals from the surface over the depth the skim ice can form on the supercooled water surface before the depth averaged water temperature drops to the freezing point in shore zones this appears in the formation of static border ice further cooling will lead to the thermal growth of the skim and border ice and the supercooling of turbulent flow in the river therefore if frazil ice is not formed around the shore zones i e if the water temperature near the shore is higher than the freezing point it can be guaranteed that no ice damage will occur according to the aforementioned theory the observation points for sampling the channel water were located 0 18 m from the shore at the water surface the water temperatures were measured in real time using a beckmann thermometer the temperature measurement was accurate within 0 002 0 01 c with a range of 20 c to 120 c which could meet the requirements during the measurement process the channel water was removed by a thermally insulated container to maintain a constant temperature for ensuring an accurate representation of the results the wind speeds were measured using an anemometer manufactured by tsi technologies company usa the maximum range and error limits were 30 m s and 0 015 m s respectively various observed data were collected by field observations from february to march in 2013 which include the related temperature of the channel water and the ate released water air temperature discharges of channel and ate outlets in this study water temperature data along the second diversion channel from ate outlets no 5 to no 13 were collected during the field observation period temperature distribution downstream of the point of effluent discharge is controlled by the hydrodynamic characteristics of the channel and the meteorological conditions prevailing at the site the air temperature at the site fluctuated inordinately throughout winter however it was particularly mild during the day as measured in the field on february 21 2013 the average air temperature was 2 c which was nearly constant the magnitude and extent of changes in the channel temperature distribution caused by the thermal side effluent input depends on the degree of mixing between the thermal effluent and cooler receiving flow and on the rate of heat exchange between the water and the atmosphere fig 6 presents the discharge of the channel the initial discharge of the diversion channel was 10 m3 s with the ates operating the discharge increases gradually to the sum of the initial value of the diversion channel and the injected amount of ate as shown in table 1 the discharge of the ate outlet is much smaller 0 139 m3 s than that of the channel which is negligible in present 3 3 cfd modeling 3 3 1 governing equations considering the maturity of the simulation of open channel flow jaeger et al 2019 chang et al 2020 ansys fluent was used to create a numerical model simulating the diversion channel with ate nos 9 10 and 11 as shown in fig 7 the model uses the finite volume method to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation in three dimensions the continuity equation is satisfied using the simple pressure velocity algorithm ansys 2018 an additional scalar transport equation is solved to consider the temperature effects through the boussinesq assumption haque et al

2 boundary and initial conditions the channel geometries of the model match the dimensions of the diversion channel the length and top surface width of the channel are 1 8 km and 10 6 m respectively the bottom width is 1 0 m and the mean depth is approximately 2 75 m boundary conditions are applied to all faces of the domain water surface the top surface was modeled using a rigid lid approximation which implies that the water air surface is modeled as a rigid ceiling this approach is valid if the deformation of the water surface is less than 10 of the channel rodriguez et al 2004 lundström et al 2010 andersson et al 2013 in the present study the discharge from the upstream is constant fig 6 in other words the water surface in the channel is almost level which is well suited to this hypothesis the rigid lid approximation allows the use of larger time steps which saves computer time sengupta et al 1977 the heat transfer at the free surface should include short wave radiation long wave radiation evaporation and convection processes politano et al 2008 zheng et al 2017a ren et al 2020 however the effects of short and long wave radiation are reflected in a long time series which does not affect the results of the present study in addition according to the wind data wind velocity is normally less than 2 m s with a slight variation during winter hence given the study objective wave radiation and wind effects are neglected and only the atmospheric temperature on the free surface is specified in the present study haque et al 2007 inlet and outlet the mass flow rate and measured temperature were specified at the upstream inflow section and ate outlets in present the channel and ate discharges are listed in table 2 the temperature at the upstream inflow section varied from 0 1 c to 1 5 c the temperature in ate outlets varied from 8 0 c to 12 0 c the outlet of the diversion channel is defined as the outflow with a specified discharge where turbulent variables are assumed to be zero the discharge at the outflow section is equal to the sum of that in the diversion channel and ate outlets walls and channel bed a no slip condition and zero heat flux are imposed on all walls and the channel bed politano et al 2008 the standard wall function is used for the viscosity layer near the wall initial condition according to the field observation results there were zero or slight changes in the water temperature distribution along the depth further variations were observed only near ate outlets therefore a certain temperature is initialized in the full field to accelerate convergence politano et al 2006 zheng et al 2015 the heat flux is limited to atmospheric exchange assuming no conduction from the bed bakken et al 2016 zheng et al 2017b the initial velocity values of the diversion channel and ate outlet are 0 3 3 3 computational mesh and grid convergence study the computational grid scale should reflect the effects of the hydraulic structure and topography on the flow and temperature fields in the simulated region about the largest element it is determined by the scale of concern and the number of grids economic feasibility should also be considered a mesh sensitivity study of the entire channel was performed with different numerical grids with 0 89 1 8 and 3 2 million grids the water temperature near the shore along the channel was evaluated after ate outlet no 9 for the different grids and the conclusion was that the coarsest mesh did not capture the temperature variation with sufficient accuracy a mesh with 1 8 million grids produced a very similar temperature field to that of the 3 2 million mesh with significantly lower computational cost hence the 1 8 million grids mesh was selected the range of longitudinal and lateral grid dimensions of the channel region were 0 1 5 0 m and 0 1 0 3 m respectively the minimum and mean sizes in the depth direction were 0 1 m and 0 15 m respectively the complex geometry regions near the ate outlets were the key positions for the present calculation and required refined grids with an average volume of 0 05 m 0 25 m 0 25 m the cell dimensions along the vertical direction except near the bottom and free surfaces decreased mesh refinement was performed along the vertical direction near the top surface to resolve the strong thermal gradients for ensuring consistency with the field data the local grids of the numerical computations are shown in fig 7 3 3 4 numerical conditions numerical calculations were performed at the china institute of water resources and hydropower research iwhr the stability of the solutions is an important factor for accuracy and therefore a courant number analysis is required the courant number which is an important criterion for stability control limits the time step size and mesh size ratio which should be less than or equal to 1 chippada et al 1994 anderson 1995 boz et al 2014 thus the time step δt is calculated as 6 δ t m i n δ x u δ y v where δ x and δ y denote the minimum sizes of the grid cell in the x and y directions respectively the x direction is the main flow direction in the diversion channel and the y direction represents the ate flow direction as indicated in fig 7 in this study a fixed time step of 0 01 s was used such that the maximum courant number did not exceed 0 40 anywhere in the domain most simulations employing meshes with 1 8 million grids were run in real time using four processors of a linux pc cluster the average time to obtain a solution from scratch was approximately seven days this is a reasonable time that allows the model to be used as a design tool by the hydropower industry 4 field results and cfd model validation 4 1 effect analysis of ate the water temperature of the channel measured before and after the ate outlets on february 21 2013 is shown in fig 8 the water temperature of the channel before the addition of the ate outlet is the average value measured at a position 5 m upstream from the ate outlet and at 0 18 m from the shore this represents the channel water temperature without warm water injection as referenced above the water temperature of the channel after the ate outlet is the average value at a position 5 m downstream of the ate outlet this represents the channel water temperature with warm water injection the water temperature of the ate was approximately 10 c which is considerably higher than the freezing point 0 c this implies that the ate release ensures an increase in the water temperature of the channel and guarantees unfrozen water along a certain distance the water temperature of the channel is only 0 2 c before ate no 5 as indicated in fig 8 this temperature is close to the freezing point i e in the absence of warm water injection into the channel the surface water would freeze quickly over a short distance however when warm water is injected into the channel through ate no 5 the average water temperature of the channel in the measurement range increases rapidly to 0 8 c the comparison of the water temperature between the front and back region of every ate outlet confirmed that the warm water injected into channel increases the channel water temperature with an average value of 0 5 c the maximum increase occurred at the position of ate no 9 with an increase of 1 0 c the analysis results suggest that the effect of ate technology on increasing water temperature is appreciable further according to the field results the water temperature increased along the channel with an increase in the number of ate for example the water temperature after ate no 5 is approximately 1 0 c whereas it reached 2 8 c after ate no 13 thus the heat flux continuously injected into the channel by the ate was greater than the loss of heat flux which resulted in an obvious accumulation of heat flux in the channel further this implies that the operation schedule of the ate is currently lacking in rationality and must be optimized according to the variation of water temperature along the diversion channel 4 2 heat exchange process in channel the heat exchange process occurs with convection at the water top surface and diffusion in the channel in winter the water temperature decreases between the two ate outlets the water samples were obtained at distances of 5 10 20 30 50 100 150 250 and 350 m downstream in each ate outlet to study the water temperature attenuation law along the channel after ate outlets fig 9 shows the changing process of water temperature in the 350 m range after each ate outlet the water temperature after ate declined as a whole in addition the water temperature decreased sharply within approximately 50 m after the ate with significant fluctuation while exceeding 50 m after the ate the decrease in water temperature slowed although there were some fluctuations the fluctuation values were considerably smaller than those upstream if warm water is mixed with cold water the higher temperature water quickly transfers heat to the lower temperature water which increases the temperature of the cold water significantly shammaa and zhu 2010 the channel water temperature near the ate at 5 m was close to 3 0 c influenced by the high temperature water released by the ate however the channel discharge was considerably larger than that of the ate therefore the average channel water temperature rapidly decreases along the distance until it reaches stabilization in summary when the high temperature water of ate was first injected into the channel the water temperature of the diversion channel increased rapidly with an average value of 0 5 c approximately after ate outlets were employed water temperature would be dropped rapidly within a short distance about 50 m and slowly decreased along the channel until it reached the position where the next ate was located at the process of change in the water temperature is segregated into rapid rising rapid dropping and slow decreasing periods while the water flows through the ate outlet 4 3 cfd model validation the quantitative measurements of water temperature are vital to clarify the effect of ate technology however several factors involved in the heat exchange process led to difficulties in assessing the effect particularly for natural water bodies therefore the present study uses numerical results to complement the results from field observations in the present study water temperatures along the channel after ate outlets nos 9 10 and 11 were used for verification the simulation results for the outlet placed at a distance of 0 18 m from the shore at the water surface along the channel are extracted as shown in fig 10 the field collected data from 26 points are compared with the simulation results from the same position the water temperature values of all positions show good agreement the minimum and maximum water temperature of the measured results were 1 45 c and 2 13 c respectively and the average water temperature among all measured points was 1 73 c the water temperature from the simulation results in the same area varied from 1 42 c to 2 22 c and the average temperature was 1 69 c the maximum and minimum error values were 0 15 c and 0 01 c with relative errors of 8 93 and 0 03 respectively the average relative error was 4 61 which is significantly less than the allowable error of 10 this indicates that the numerical accuracy met the needs of the study moriasi et al 2007 5 cfd results 5 1 influence of heat flux ratio on the heat exchange the heat flux should be defined according to the previous achievements of mishima and nishihara 1987 zheng et al 2015 tananaev et al 2019 and georgiadi et al 2017 to investigate changes in water temperature caused by changes in the heat flux ratio the study object was divided into several layers wherein each layer has a depth d h then velocity v is multiplied by water temperature t on each layer the total heat flux is obtained using an integral method and it is represented as 7 q q ω t ρ ω ρ 0 h vtdh where q q ω ρ and v t and h denote the heat flux flow discharge m3 s specific heat capacity of water 4 186 kj kg c water density kg m3 and the water velocity m s temperature c and depth m respectively the water depth h of the diversion channel is 2 75 m which is small the density of warm water is increased for temperatures below 4 c the heat flux ratio is the ratio between the heat flux from the ate and that from upstream ahead of the ate outlet it is expressed as 8 hfr q m ω t m ρ q u ω t u ρ q m t m q u t u where subscripts m and u represent the ate and upstream ahead of the ate outlet respectively the atmospheric temperature was assumed to be 2 c and the discharge and water temperature of diversion channel at upstream was 5 0 20 0 m3 s and 0 2 1 5 c respectively furthermore the discharge of ate was 0 07 0 21 m3 s and the water temperature was 8 0 12 0 c to quantify the attenuation law and corresponding hfr values frazil ice is formed near the shore first which indicates that the water temperature near the bank should be emphasized rather than the maximum temperature at the cross section similar to the field observations 176 numerical points near the bank were obtained in this study fig 11 shows the water temperature variations along the channel with an upstream water temperature of 1 5 c and an effluent temperature of 10 0 c as anticipated the water temperature in the channel increased rapidly with an increase in the effluent temperature after mixing the warm and cold water heat exchange occurs along the longitudinal transverse direction and the effluent temperature decreases predominantly downstream near the shore on the side of the effluent discharge the changes in diversion channel water temperature after ate outlets can be segregated into three periods along the distance sudden drop period δt l 10 transitional period 10 δt l 1 and slowed down period δt l less than 1 rabi et al 2015 danner et al 2012 beaufort et al 2016 as shown in fig 11 where δt and l represent the difference in water temperature and distance respectively in the sudden drop period the water temperature with 10 0 c from ate decreased quickly to 2 5 c and the range of that period can be expressed as the effect of ate technology which depends on the hfr values the larger the hfr value representing a larger difference for water temperatures between that from ate outlet and in channel the shorter is the distance of the sudden drop period for example the numerical results indicate that the distance of the sudden drop period was about 20 m for hfr 1 9 but only 10 m for hfr 3 4 subsequently the water temperature changes slowed and passed through the transitional period in this period the water temperature of the diversion channel steadily declined from 2 5 c to 1 8 c the descent speed was considerably lower than that at the sudden drop period the final stage was the slowed down period wherein the water temperature dropped slowly along the distance as mentioned previously the hfr represents the ratio between the heat flux from the ate and that from the upstream ahead of the ate outlet table 1 and fig 6 for the hongshanzui hydropower station indicate that the hfr values are always less than 1 thus the present work takes different hfr values that are less than 1 to study the variations of t tu with distance from the ate outlet at 2 c air temperature where tu and t represent the water surface temperature upstream of the ate outlet and along the distance after the ate outlet respectively when the heat flux being injected into the diversion channel is constant a larger hfr value represents a lower water temperature upstream in the channel and downstream of the ate outlet the water temperature t0 at the starting point of the transitional section was considered in the present study as shown in fig 12 to facilitate the comparison of the heat exchange process with different hfr conditions in the figures the curves include two stages indicate the transitional period and the slowed down period compare to fig 11 the stage of sudden drop is ignored it is because the attenuation law of channel water temperature is almost same at this stage all results fall in a narrow band of constant width and the variation of water temperature near the shore follows a generalized trend line which displays a good power function relationship with a squared correlation coefficient r2 of 0 93 0 99 that is the decay curve can be expressed as 9 t t 0 k l a l 0 where k and a represent the control coefficients and k depends on the initial water temperature during the transitional period the fitting results show that k for the heat exchange in the channel was approximately 1 19 1 21 in all scenarios which can take an average value of 1 2 in the present study the coefficient a implies the attenuation speed of the channel water temperature along the distance and this affects the ate arrangement in the field it was found that a gradually increases with an increasing hfr the larger hfr value indicated a lower upstream water temperature in the diversion channel in the case of a certain heat flux injected into as such there is an enhanced difference in the water temperature of the ate outlet compared to that in the diversion channel which resulted in a faster decrease in the channel water temperature the variation in a with the hfr value is shown in fig 13 the fitting curve describing a can be expressed as 10 y 0 03 ln x 0 2 r 2 0 83 where y represents coefficient a and x is equal to the hfr value in fig 14 the red dashed line represents a 10 error fig 13 indicates that all the numerical points fall within a narrow band of 10 error width 5 2 influence of atmospheric temperature on the heat exchange in addition to the heat flux of the diversion channel and the ate outlet climatological conditions play key roles that significantly influence the heat exchange process in the channel ashton 1979 in this study wind velocity and air temperature are considered the dominant climatological factors from historical wind data it is known that there was slight variation for wind velocity during the winter at the study site and this was always 1 5 2 0 m s therefore air temperatures in the range of 2 c 30 c were selected to study the effect of meteorological conditions on the heat exchange process the purpose of the ate is to increase the water temperature of the channel to guarantee unfrozen water for long distances in the diversion channel thus the influence distance by ate is an important objective of the present study based on the results of the influence of hfr on the heat exchange it is concluded that the larger the hfr value the faster is the heat exchange in the channel i e the larger hfr value is an unfavorable condition in terms of the influence distance by ate therefore hfr 0 75 is employed to study the effect of ate in the present study to better serve engineering applications with a wind velocity of 2 0 m s the initial water temperature from the channel and ate outlet are 0 2 c and 10 c respectively fig 14 shows the attenuation law of the diversion channel water temperature near the bank for different air temperature values the temperature of water discharged from the ate outlet rapidly decayed to less than 1 0 c in a short distance less than1 0 m therefore the results shown in fig 14 ignored water temperatures higher than 1 0 c changes in the channel water temperature can be segregated into sudden drop transitional and slowed down periods in contrast the distance of every period was relatively uniform at different atmospheric temperatures the first sudden drop period was approximately 9 m from the ate outlet at this period the channel water temperature dropped rapidly from 1 0 c to 0 6 c and the attenuation trend was uniform in the case of different atmospheric temperatures in other words there was a low influence of atmospheric temperature on the changing process in the channel water temperature at the sudden drop period the next stage was the transitional stage which ranged from approximately 9 200 m from the ate outlet the influence of atmospheric temperature on changes at this stage became significant the lower the atmospheric temperature the faster the temperature drop of water the slowed down period started from approximately 200 m and the change laws presented linear attenuation in the case of every atmospheric temperature during this period however the decay rate was lower than that in the transitional period which is almost the same as that of the no thermal side effluent zheng et al 2018 the figure shows that the variation of water temperature along the channel for different atmospheric temperatures showed a good attenuation law of power function as 11 y b x n where b refers to the initial value and n is the decay rate with a decrease in the atmospheric temperature the decay rate n of the channel water temperature is accelerated coefficients b are 1 166 1 220 1 354 2 218 and 2 455 for 2 c 5 c 10 c 20 c and 30 c respectively further coefficients n are 0 316 0 351 0 406 0 631 and 0 718 comparing the attenuation law of the channel temperature it is implied that the atmospheric temperature of 10 c was the turning point of the attenuation law when the atmospheric temperature was higher than 10 c between 10 c and 2 c the attenuation curve of the channel water temperature was approximately uniform and the value of n which represents the attenuation speed ranged only from 0 31 0 40 further it has been suggested that the attenuation law of the diversion channel water temperature can be considered approximately the same as that when the atmospheric temperature is higher than 10 c that is only the influence of the change in hfr should be considered to study the variation of channel water temperature in the case of a particular atmospheric temperature the value of n changed rapidly from 0 4 to 0 7 when the atmospheric temperature dropped directly from 10 to 30 c this indicates that the influence of atmospheric temperature on changes in the channel water temperature are significant that is the atmospheric temperature must be considered concomitantly with hfr to study the variation of channel temperature when the atmospheric temperature is lower than 10 c 6 discussion ate technology involves injecting thermal water into a channel to warm the cold water given the complexity of the change process of the diversion channel water temperature for the ate technology this study explored the change process in channel water temperature by considering a single influence factor in the case of fixed external conditions the water temperature in the diversion channel drops rapidly initially and then slowly this was confirmed by the good agreement between the results of the as indicated by the field observations and numerical simulations the channel water temperature increased from 0 2 c to 1 0 c when the cold water flowed through the ate outlet this suggested that the ate technology had an obvious warming effect on the diversion channel water 6 1 influence distance the influence distance of the ate is a key factor for controlling the arrangement of ate outlets along the diversion channel and it is obtained from the law of the heat exchange process the influence distance can be divided into theoretical and unfrozen influence distances the theoretical influence distance is from the ate outlet to the site where the water temperature is equal to that at the head of the channel according to the field observation data in the jingou river and hongshanzui hydropower station diversion channels the initial channel water temperature is approximately 0 1 0 2 c at the head of the channel in winter in contrast the unfrozen influence distance is the length when the water temperature is larger than the freezing point 0 01 c in the present study wang and ding 1991 tie 1999 in the past decades some pioneers proposed empirical formulas to measure the influence distance of the channel combined with actual projects such as terenchuk river the left tributary of the kouban river hydropower station in russia пoтaлoв 1955 xiangjia hydropower station deng and liu 1987 and jingou river hydropower station wang and ding 1991 unfortunately the above calculation formula has its own limitations пoтaлoв 1955 and deng and liu 1987 consider only the mixed water depth mixed flow rate and mixed water temperature and do not consider the air temperature this would result in similar calculated lengths irrespective of the air temperature although wang and ding 1991 consider the discharge water temperature and air temperature in the heat exchange process their formula for unfrozen influence distance requires additional eight parameters to be calculated accurately in advance which will lead to a large calculation error due to the absence or inaccuracy of meteorological conditions as per the common air temperature in winter in the hongshanzui division channel the influence distances with air temperature 2 5 10 20 and 30 c respectively were calculated as summarized in table 3 by relationship 11 table 3 indicates that when the atmospheric temperature is higher than 10 c the calculations show that the distance with a water temperature larger than 0 1 c is nearly 600 2500 m which is the theoretical influence distance further the distance with a water temperature larger than the freezing point 0 01 c in the present study is almost between 177948 m and 3468848 m unfrozen influence distance and this is considerably longer than the distance of the second diversion channel of the hongshanzui hydropower station total 11280 m thus it was proved that when the atmospheric temperature is higher than 10 c the operation of one ate point at the head of the channel can ensure that the water temperature is higher than the freezing point along the entire second diversion channel however if the atmospheric temperature ranges between 20 30 c the theoretical influence distance is reduced from 80 m to 150 m which is considerably shorter than that calculated under the 10 c conditions according to the field observation results reported by wang et al 2009 some ice flowers above 50 concentration are formed at the 500 m site after the ate outlet without an ice sheet jam or ice sheet when the atmospheric temperature is 32 c this is consistent with the results of the present study the calculated value of the unfrozen influence distance is 2132 m under an atmospheric temperature of 30 c when calculating based on the freezing point and the relative error is 7 68 compared with the measure value of 1980 m zong et al 2018 from the operating parameters of the ates the distance between the two ate outlets is approximately from 250 m to 1 440 m which indicates that the operation of one ate can only ensure that the water temperature is above the freezing point in the channel between the operating ate and the next one in this case every ate should be operating to keep the entire diversion channel ice free considering the jingou river as an example the unfrozen influence distances are calculated by relationship 11 under the atmospheric temperature of 20 c as shown in fig 15 the calculation results were compared with the measured values the calculated unfrozen influence distance is 5222 m in the jingou river channel under an atmospheric temperature of 20 c and the relative error is 3 30 compared with the measured value of 5400 m therefore the calculation results of the unfrozen influence distance in this study are consistent with the prototype observation results 6 2 comparison of different relationships the results of this study are compared with the calculated results of пoтaлoв 1955 deng and liu 1987 and wang and ding 1991 fig 15 shows that the results of the unfrozen influence distance obtained by the various calculation formulas are considerably different the calculation results of пoтaлoв 1955 and deng and liu 1987 show that the change of the unfrozen influence distance tends to be the same as the temperature changes regardless of how the air temperature changes the unfrozen influence distance is almost the same which is inconsistent with the law that the influence distance becomes shorter as the temperature decreases this is because the two formulas are empirical formulas based on the diversion channel of a certain power plant wherein fewer influencing factors were considered to significantly change the calculation results thus the two formulas mentioned above have their own applicable conditions for example the unfrozen influence distances calculated by пoтaлoв 1955 and deng and liu 1987 are 1978 m and 5798 m respectively under the conditions of air temperature 20 and 30 c this result shows that the allowable value of the unfrozen influence distance is very small even under high air temperature conditions therefore these two calculated methods are applicable only to the case where the water source is warm spring water or when the upstream has a large reservoir and the water diversion channel is short comparing the calculation results of this study with those of wang and ding 1991 the unfrozen influence distance shortens faster from 5222 to 2132 m and from 5696 to 2894 m as the temperature drops from 20 to 30 c and its change is more obvious with the measured values from 5400 to 1980 m however it is obvious that the relative errors of wang and ding 1991 with 5 48 and 46 16 respectively are larger than those of this study the above analysis results indicate that each method for calculating the unfrozen influence distance is applicable however the three existing formulas are not applicable to the diversion channel of the hongshanzui hydropower station the calculation formula in this study considers the influence of various factors and has a wider application scope 7 conclusions in this study the temperature dynamics within the diversion channel of hongshanzui hydropower station in the manas river of xinjiang were studied using two mutually exclusive approaches including field based measurements and computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling the influence of several factors including the heat flux ratio and air temperature on the channel water temperature were simulated the following conclusions were drawn from this study 1 based on the field observation results the water temperature of the diversion channel increased from 0 2 c to 1 0 c average 0 5 c after ate outlets were employed the channel water temperature would be dropped rapidly within a short distance about 50 m and slowly decreased along the channel until it reached the position where the next ate was located at therefore the process of change in the water temperature is segregated into rapid rising rapid dropping and slow decreasing periods while the water flows through the ate outlet 2 the fundamental interdependency among the heat flux ratio hfr air temperature and diversion channel water temperature were discussed based on simulation results it is suggested that the changing process of water temperature in diversion channel after ate outlets could be segregated into sudden drop transitional and slowed down periods depending on the hfr and atmospheric temperature 3 according to the simulated results it could be deduced that the water temperature attenuation curve is a power function distribution with a logarithmic relationship between the index and the hfr given by y 0 03ln x 0 2 further the air temperature of 10 c is the turning point of the attenuation law the change in temperature is considered to be uniform when the air temperature is higher than 10 c if the air temperature is lower than 10 c it significantly affects the variation in water temperature 4 taking hongshanzui and jingou river hydropower stations as examples the influence distances are calculated under different air temperature which the unfrozen influence distances are compared with the calculated results of пoтaлoв 1955 deng and liu 1987 and wang and ding 1991 according to the comparative analysis it indicates that each method has its applicability and the calculation formula in this study takes into account the influence of various factors and has a wider scope of application 5 combined with the results of numerical simulation and field observation the heat exchange process along the ate channel was analyzed in this study and the influence of hfr and air temperature conditions on the attenuation law of channel water temperature was discussed however due to the limited application of ate technology as well as insufficient in data collection of flow rate water temperature and air temperature the water temperature attenuation relationship established in present study is only limited to 0 hfr 1 and 30 c air temperature 0 c which indicated that the universality needs to be further verified in the future in order to establish the calculation relationship of ate influence distance with good versatility it is necessary to develop the long time series monitoring data of multi year and multi factor changes in different hydropower

4039,increases in extreme rainfall intensities as a result of climate change pose a great risk due to the possibility of increases in pluvial flooding particularly in urban and developed areas but evidence is emerging that the observed increases in extreme rainfall are not resulting in universal increases in flooding indeed on a global scale studies consistently find more gauge stations with decreasing rather than increasing trends in the annual maxima flood magnitude here we aim to improve our understanding of how rainfall and streamflow extremes are changing and why floods are not always observed to increase despite increases in rainfall extremes to do so we examine trends in streamflow events using 2776 stations from the global runoff data centre with events chosen to isolate the impact of changes to their respective rainfall and antecedent soil moisture the analysis is limited to stations with 30 years or more of active record with the majority of stations in north america europe brazil oceania and southern africa consistent with physical reasoning for more frequent events such as the annual maxima it is found the peak 1 day rainfall event intensity is increasing approximately a rate of 6 7 c with rarer event intensities increasing at a rate exceeding the clausius clapeyron relation we find that storm volumes are not increasing as greatly as the peak rainfall and storm durations are decreasing pointing to an intensification of rainfall events and a peakier temporal pattern while rainfall is intensifying the magnitude of frequent floods those expected to occur on average once per year are in general decreasing particularly in tropical and arid regions of the world we find that this is likely due to a dominance of drying antecedent soil moisture conditions however the magnitude of rarer floods has on average been increasing we suggest this is because for these rarer events the increase in rainfall outweighs the decrease in soil moisture our results point to a worst of both world s scenario where small floods responsible for filling our water supplies are decreasing while the large flood events which pose a risk to life and infrastructure are increasing keywords flooding extreme rainfall soil moisture trend analysis climate change 1 introduction flooding is one of the most common and costliest natural disasters razavi et al 2020 with increasingly more people at risk of flooding paprotny et al 2018 with climate change flood risk is expected to increase in urban areas due to intensification of extreme rainfall and a lack of pervious surfaces fadhel et al 2018 hettiarachchi et al 2018 jha et al 2012 any change in the frequency of flooding is likely to have huge economic consequences with greater flood magnitudes increasing economic losses arent et al 2014 wasko et al 2021b and decreases in flood magnitude threatening water security sharma et al 2018 only small changes in climate are required to have large consequences to our ecosystems and economy alley et al 2003 for example changes of 1 2 c and 10 20 in annual precipitation can cause order of magnitude changes in flooding knox 1993 average precipitation across the globe has increased by approximately 2 mm year per decade hartmann et al 2013 with a suggestion that this has primarily occurred over the tropics with decreases elsewhere beck et al 2019 while changes in annual mean precipitation rates will affect antecedent moisture conditions changes in peak or high streamflow magnitude here termed flooding for simplicity are expected to be driven by changes in extreme precipitation globally the magnitude of extreme precipitation has increased donat et al 2016 westra et al 2013 for daily annual maxima the average increase of 5 9 7 7 c sun et al 2021 westra et al 2013 matches the theoretical clausius clapeyron 6 7 c increase in the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere due to higher temperatures fowler et al 2021 trenberth 2011 but there is also an expectation that more extreme rarer daily rainfalls will increase even further pendergrass 2018 pendergrass and hartmann 2014 with increases above the clausius clapeyron rate observed guerreiro et al 2018 wasko and nathan 2019 and modelled bao et al 2017 for events rarer than daily annual maxima in contrast to the increasing trends in precipitation extremes on a global scale regional studies of flood magnitude show very mixed trends archfield et al 2016 blöschl et al 2019 hall et al 2014 mallakpour and villarini 2015 wasko and nathan 2019 one global investigation of trends in annual flood maxima using 9213 stations found the number of sites showing statistically significant decreasing trends was greater than the number of sites showing statistically significant increases do et al 2017 similar results were also found for a range of flow percentiles across the world suggesting entire flow distributions have moved either upward or downward gudmundsson et al 2019 another global study found increasing 20 year and 50 year floods in temperate climates but mostly decreases elsewhere slater et al 2021 further confounding our understanding modelled do et al 2020a and projected hirabayashi et al 2013 increases in flooding are not consistent with the large number of stations exhibiting historical decreases in flood magnitudes global flood models project 30 year and 100 year average recurrence interval ari flood increases across the majority of the globe with decreases only in limited regions of central europe south east australia and central south america arnell and gosling 2016 dankers et al 2014 hirabayashi et al 2013 it can be expected that changes to pluvial flooding in highly urban areas may be driven by changes in precipitation extremes as there is little impervious area hettiarachchi et al 2018 but this transfer function between precipitation and flooding doesn t hold in non urban areas ivancic and shaw 2015 sharma et al 2018 the soil moisture state of the catchment before it rains modulates flooding ivancic and shaw 2015 pathiraja et al 2012 and hence the historical trend in flooding tramblay et al 2019 wasko and nathan 2019 indeed monthly precipitation anomalies do not correlate well with flood anomalies stephens et al 2015 and a low correlation was found between changes in precipitation extremes and changes in flooding across the u s do et al 2020b here we suggest that the discrepancy between extreme rainfall trends and flood trends is at least in part due to a a lack of consistency in the magnitude of the extreme event considered bennett et al 2018 bertola et al 2021 wasko and nathan 2019 and b changes in the antecedent moisture conditions ivancic and shaw 2015 sharma et al 2018 wasko 2021 although many studies examine trends in rainfall and streamflow few studies examine trends in the drivers of flooding villarini and wasko 2021 historical trends in antecedent moisture are rarely studied with studies focusing on either changes in the mean soil moisture albergel et al 2013 feng and zhang 2015 or the antecedent precipitation woldemeskel and sharma 2016 as a surrogate for the antecedent soil moisture here we examine the influence of changes in extreme rainfall and soil moisture on flood magnitude and how this influence varies with event duration and rarity in doing so we aim to understand why in the absence of snowmelt floods are not always observed to increase despite increases in rainfall extremes using the global runoff data centre streamflow database we identify the antecedent soil moisture storm volume and peak rainfall associated with flood events we investigate the trend in each along with the resultant peak flood magnitude across a range of event severities to see whether any consistency between changes to rainfall extremes and flooding can be identified 2 methods streamflow event peaks are identified from the global runoff data centre grdc 2015 with the peak rainfall storm volume and soil moisture coincident with the flood event obtained from the global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 rodell et al 2004 events are sampled on the basis of rainfall to ensure that antecedent conditions are independent from the resultant flood a peak over threshold approach is employed to identify rainfall events and the associated flood peak with historical trends subsequently investigated by quantile regression in order to capture variation with event rarity 2 1 data daily streamflow from the global runoff data centre grdc 2015 was analysed as these have been successfully used in other global studies do et al 2017 lee et al 2015 milly et al 2018 wasko et al 2020 rainfall snow fall snow depth snowmelt and root zone soil moisture at the catchment outlet were extracted from the global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 rodell et al 2004 for the years 1948 to 2014 gldas forcings including rainfall are from the global meteorological forcing dataset which combines a suite of observation based datasets with reanalysis sheffield et al 2006 hence the rainfall can be considered observed as root zone soil moisture has been identified to be most correlated with catchment flood response hill and thomson 2019 root zone soil moisture was used as representative of the catchment soil moisture state the model for soil moisture is a stationary deterministic process and hence will not interfere with calculated trends wasko and nathan 2019 the assumptions that outlet measurements are representative of catchment conditions and that gldas is representative of gauged observations were verified using a high quality observed catchment average data set for australia and are discussed in section 4 3 2 2 event sampling events were selected on the basis of rainfall to ensure that the antecedent conditions are independent of the flood response for example sampling events on the basis of flooding will bias antecedent conditions towards wet catchment conditions a rainfall event is identified if separated by one or more days of zero rainfall with any rainfall below 1 mm assumed to be zero the storm volume is the sum of the rainfalls over the duration of the event the peak rainfall is the maximum daily rainfall within the event and the antecedent moisture or soil moisture is the root zone soil moisture on the day before an event commenced the peak streamflow or peak flow is the maximum streamflow observed after the start of the rainfall event to five days after the end of the rainfall event or before the next event baseflow was removed from the streamflow using a recursive digital filter nathan and mcmahon 1990 meaning the peak flow response is a function of the storm rainfall and soil moisture the total number of events for each station was equal to five times the record length with only the largest rainfall events sampled for example for a site with 50 years of record the largest 250 events are sampled and subsequently analysed this approach ensures that exceedance percentiles are consistent between stations to focus on the impact of changes in soil moisture on the pluvial flood process we need ensure our data set is free of snowmelt any event that has snow present in the precipitation or is modelled to have snowmelt present is removed to ensure no mixing of flood mechanisms other than the interaction of rainfall and antecedent soil moisture collins 2019 wasko et al 2019 flood drivers also vary with catchment size wasko and sharma 2017a for example smaller catchments are less sensitive to changes in antecedent moisture wasko and nathan 2019 with larger rainfalls and hence floods less likely to be influenced by soil moisture storage ivancic and shaw 2015 as a result we restrict our analysis to catchments less than 20000 km2 we note that catchments smaller than 20 000 km2 have a lag time between rainfall and streamflow of less than five days ensuring the peak flow is captured and there is a more direct link between the rainfall and runoff increasing the maximum allowed lag time between the rainfall event and peak flow did not materially change the results 2 3 station selection to reduce the impact of drought periods stations in highly ephemeral or arid catchments where more than 20 of events result in zero flow were omitted as were stations with periods of zero flow greater than three years we restricted our analysis to sites with 30 years or more of active record in total 2776 sites were analysed with median record length of 51 years fig 1 a with the majority of sites located in temperate and cold köppen climate zones across north america europe brazil oceania and southern africa fig 1b the median catchment area is 1129 km2 and 78 of sites have a catchment area less than 5000 km2 hence the majority of catchments can be considered hydrologically small for the readers interest the mean seasonality calculated as a circular mean fisher 1993 wasko et al 2020a of the chosen events is presented in fig s1 in the southern hemisphere sampled events generally occur in the month of peak rainfall seasonality in the tropics the austral summer and further south the austral winter in the northern hemisphere events sampled generally occur in the boreal summer this confirms the absence of snowmelt in the sample we note the analysis was repeated restricting the data range to a common period 1970 2000 and to only using the pristine grdc stations those largely free of diversions and basin development and the results were consistent with those presented here 2 4 calculation of trend and association with flood drivers with the exception of the storm duration for which linear regression was used trends for each of the peak over threshold series peak rainfall storm volume soil moisture and peak flow were calculated using quantile regression hao and naiman 2007 koenker 2021 koenker and bassett 1978 quantile regression was used as it allows investigation of trends in extreme percentiles a quantile regression was fitted between the independent response variable yi and the dependent variable time ti in the units of days peak rainfall storm volume and peak flow were logarithmically transformed with the following relationship fitted 1 l o g 10 y i β 0 q β 1 q t i i q where 0 q 1 is the quantile i is an error term with zero expectation and i 1 m where m is the total number of samples for the site location the logarithmic transform was employed to obtain residuals with zero expectation where zero flows were set to the minimum recorded flow to allow for log transformation sensitivity tests showed that setting zero flows to the minimum on record had almost no influence on calculated trends the regression coefficients β 0 and β 1 represent a constant and the linear change in the response variable per unit change in time t respectively a choice of q 0 5 for the quantile non exceedance percentile corresponds to the median tendency between the dependent variable ti and response yi trends for more extreme data quantiles were investigated using quantiles q above 0 5 the trend per decade δ 10 y as a percentage was calculated using following transformation where n is the number of days in 10 years 2 δ 10 y 100 10 n β 1 1 soil moisture did not require transformation of residuals and the trend per decade is reported as the slope β 1 of the fitted regression multiplied by the number of days in 10 years a notional ari was assigned to the rainfall quantile using the following equation stedinger et al 1993 3 q 1 1 λ l n t a t a 1 where q is the non exceedance percentile of interest λ is the average number of events per year in this case 5 section 2 2 and ta is the ari in years finally the association between the peak flow and the flood drivers peak rainfall storm volume and soil moisture was calculated using a pearson correlation coefficient the use of a rank based spearman correlation gave similar results 3 results 3 1 association of the flood peak to event rainfall and soil moisture conditions to assess the influence of antecedent soil moisture peak rainfall and storm volume on the peak flow we present the correlation of peak flow with each of these streamflow drivers in fig 2 for a sampling frequency of five events per year the peak rainfall has a relatively low median correlation 0 12 with the peak flow the storm volume peak flow median correlation is slightly higher 0 28 but the highest correlation for the peak flow is with antecedent soil moisture 0 39 peak rainfall storm volume and soil moisture are hence all driving the resulting peak flow but for frequent events on average occurring five times a year the antecedent soil moisture is the primary driver of the flood response overall the correlations changed little when sampling frequency was varied from 1 to 10 events per year on average fig s2 to quantify the magnitude of the response to changes in antecedent soil moisture and rainfall the variation in peak flow resulting from different combinations of peak rainfall and soil moisture is presented in fig 3 a to aggregate between sites at each station the events for each variable are divided by the mean at that site with contours presenting a heat map of antecedent soil moisture referring to fig 3a a relatively small rainfall leads to a small flow peak when the soil is dry bottom left however the same relatively small rainfall can result in a large flow peak if the catchment is wet top left hence for the same rainfall magnitude differing catchment soil moisture before the rainfall can result in orders of magnitude difference in the flow if the rainfall is large a large flow will result regardless of the soil moisture top right this is because the more extreme the rainfall event is the less the modulating effect of the antecedent soil moisture conditions we note the same relationship is observed for the storm volume fig 3b whereby a small difference in the soil moisture can result in order of magnitude differences in the peak flow for the same storm volume 3 2 trends in flood drivers trends in frequent flooding and its drivers peak rainfall storm volume and soil moisture are presented in fig 4 for the 50th and 95th percentile we first focus on the results for 50th percentile in the left column there is an almost universal increase in peak rainfall for the 50th percentile of sampled events top left in the order of 0 2 per decade fig 4 storm volumes show very mixed trends for the 50th percentile storm volumes are decreasing across most of europe south africa and australia as well as part of the west coast of the u s increases are observed in the uk and over the east and mid west of the u s on average the 50th percentile antecedent soil moisture is decreasing fig 4 it needs to be noted that this is distinct from annual mean soil moisture although trends in antecedent root zone soil moisture exhibit a strong positive correlation of 0 78 with trends in annual mean soil moisture trends not shown they will not necessarily correspond for example although europe exhibits historical increases in mean soil moisture albergel et al 2013 antecedent soil moisture for events devoid of snowmelt has been decreasing here the only regions that show increases in antecedent soil moisture are those that show increases in storm volumes that is the mid west of the u s and the u k fig 4 these regions correspond to regions that have also previously been identified as having increased flood magnitudes such as the north east u s archfield et al 2016 and northern europe blöschl et al 2019 the bottom left panel summarises the trends in the 50th percentile of peak flows and confirms trends presented in previous regional studies merz et al 2021 wasko 2021 peak flow magnitude is trending negatively in the south and western u s southern europe and the majority of the southern hemisphere these regions coincide well with the regions of drier antecedent soil moisture conditions and reductions in storm volume presented in the panels above the regions experiencing greater peak flow magnitudes generally correspond to the regions of wetter antecedent moisture for frequent events trends in the peak flow appear more linked to soil moisture with trends in peak flow bearing little resemblance to the increasing extreme rainfalls the right column presents the trend in the 95th percentile of sampled events compared to the more frequent events left column there are now strong increases in the magnitude of severe rainfall extremes in the order of 4 6 per decade top right storm volume trends remain similar to the 50th percentile across europe there is a slight drying trend and across the u s a slight wetting trend again similar to the 50th percentile for the 95th percentile soil moisture has been decreasing across australia parts of brazil and southern europe with the only exception northern europe the east coast of the u s and northern australia however flood trends differ for the 95th percentile compared to the 50th percentile in the southern hemisphere the more severe events exhibit more positive trends in southern africa and less negative trends in south america and southern australia similarly the peak flow trends in the south west of the u s are less negative for these rarer events although peak flow trends do not follow peak rainfall trends the dependence on rainfall magnitude presented in fig 3 appears in the trends presented in fig 4 with trends in more extreme events potentially less modulated by changes in soil moisture the relationship between the trend in the peak rainfall storm volume soil moisture and peak flow and the rarity of the event percentile is elucidated further in section 3 4 3 3 trend in storm duration the discrepancy between changes in the peak rainfall and storm volume requires further attention as one would expect with increasing peak rainfall that storm volumes would also increase the results presented in fig 4 where extreme peak rainfall is increasing but storm volume is not increasing point to a peakier temporal pattern where to compensate for the increasing trend in the peak rainfall the remaining rainfall in the storm is decreasing wasko and sharma 2015 a change to a peakier storm temporal pattern is equivalent and consistent with a decreasing storm duration hence it is prudent to investigate trends in the storm duration the mean storm duration is presented in fig 5 a the mean storm duration in the southern latitudes varies generally between 2 and 4 days but increases to 4 5 days in the tropics and longer in brazil consistent with the prevalence of summer monsoonal rainfall across europe similar to the temperate climate of australia average storm durations of 2 4 days have been sampled but interestingly across the midwest of the u s shorter storm events indicate a prevalence of summer mesoscale convective weather systems prein et al 2017 the trend in storm event duration is calculated using linear regression fig 5b there is an almost universal decrease in storm duration in the order of 0 to 0 2 days per decade across the globe some larger decreases are observed over brazil where the largest durations are observed however overall the picture is very consistent the average decrease across stations analysed is approximately 0 1 day per decade due to the skew of some longer events showing larger decreases the median change is closer to 0 05 days per decade given that the majority of events sampled are well below 5 days in duration this represents a substantial decreasing trend in rainfall event duration using different thresholds for the rainfall above the 50th 80th and 90th percentile of rainfall at that station and recalculating the trend in the storm duration did not present any evidence of greater trends with increasing event magnitude 3 4 variability in flood peak storm rainfall and antecedent soil moisture trends to understand at what level of rarity the dominant flood driver changes antecedent soil moisture vs peak rainfall the median trend across all sites analysed for the peak rainfall storm volume and soil moisture is presented against the non exceedance percentile of sampled events fig 6 the percentile is converted to a notional average recurrence interval in years using equation 3 and is also presented in fig 6 for reference the three panels present a repetition of the sampling described in section 2 2 progressively restricting the sample to shorter maximum rainfall event durations as presented in fig 4 there is a strong consistent positive trend in the peak rainfall that increases with event rarity and this trend is consistent across event durations fig 6 assuming an increase in global temperature over land of 0 2 c per decade daily annual maxima increase at approximately the clausius clapeyron rate of 6 7 c similar to previous studies guerreiro et al 2018 westra et al 2013 events rarer than this however are increasing at a much greater rate that exceeds the clausius clapeyron scaling rate focusing on the left most panel which presents results that do not restrict the event duration storm volumes show mixed trends and hence on average the trend is approximately zero there is little evidence for increasing peak flows with a much larger variability in the streamflow response wider confidence intervals relative to the peak rainfall trend despite increases in peak rainfall across all recurrence intervals average peak flow is decreasing for frequent events it is only for the more extreme rainfalls above the 98th percentile recurrence intervals rarer than approximately 10 to 20 years the median peak flow trend is positive this points to more frequent flood magnitudes decreasing while rarer flood magnitudes are increasing as we progressively reduce the duration of the storm event sample to events of seven days or less centre panel and three days or less right panel the peak one day rainfall becomes a greater fraction of the total storm volume and an increasing trend in the storm volume emerges fig 6 the increasing trend in the storm volume is stronger the rarer the event as well as the shorter the storm duration a pattern in the flood trends also emerges whereby the peak flows are increasing in response to the increase in storm volumes but they do not exceed the storm volume increase due to the average decrease in antecedent soil moisture as the threshold of what was considered rainfall here 1 mm was increased the events being sampled become larger and more extreme also resulting in increasing storm volumes in response to the increasing extreme rainfalls despite increasing storm volumes for larger events storm durations continue to shorten section 3 3 3 5 influence of climate region on trends in flood peak storm rainfall and antecedent soil moisture recognising that flood trends vary with region fig 4 we follow slater et al 2021 and aggregate trends on köppen climate zone beck et al 2019 the trends with non exceedance percentile for the main climate zones tropical arid temperate and cold using all events are presented in fig 7 consistent with the aggregated results fig 6 peak rainfall is increasing in each climate zone with the magnitude of the increase greater with increasing event rarity sites located in the tropics exhibit increasing peak rainfall but decreasing storm volumes and antecedent soil moisture across all percentiles peak flows do not exhibit increases even for the most extreme events sites located in arid zones also exhibit increases in the peak rainfall but this increase is smaller in magnitude than in tropical zones or the aggregated sample median fig 6 there is little positive or negative trend in the storm volume or antecedent soil moisture conditions and peak flows are decreasing for the common events there is evidence of increasing peak flows only for the most extreme flows but there is large uncertainty due to the small sample size the magnitude of the decrease in the peak flow for the more frequent non exceedance percentiles is greater in tropical and arid zones than in the temperate and cold zones as most of the sites are in temperate and cold climate zones fig 7 the results for these regions look more similar to the results when the stations were aggregated fig 6 for both the temperate and cold zones peak rainfalls are increasing and the magnitude of the increases is greater the more extreme the event for the temperate zone we see decreasing soil moisture and peak flows with increases only for approximately the 98th percentile this suggests the decrease in soil moisture has a strong influence on events that are more common than the 98th percentile and the increase in peak rainfall dominates above the 98th percentile in the cold zone the antecedent moisture on average is still decreasing but storm volumes are on average increasing as are the peak rainfalls however the magnitude of the storm volume increases does not increase with the event rarity as it does for peak rainfalls the peak flow responds similarly to these increases and is increasing across percentiles but due to the drier antecedent soil moisture conditions these increases still do not match the increase in the peak rainfall we further stratify these results restricting our sampling to storm durations less than or equal to three days fig s5 in tropical and arid regions despite increases in storm volumes there is still little evidence for increasing peak flows except for the rarest events it is only in temperate and cold regions that increasing peak flows are found across all percentiles for these shorter storm durations this suggests that the results in fig 6 though showing a clear interaction between the antecedent soil moisture conditions and peak flows are heavily weighted by temperate climate stations particularly from europe we can conclude that irrespective of the storm duration for colder regions of the world increases in flooding are more likely than for warmer regions trends are also calculated for the subregions presented in fig s1 and are presented in fig s6 the two regions for europe and one region for southern africa are drawn directly from the international panel on climate change ipcc reports gudmundsson et al 2019 seneviratne et al 2012 while the remaining regions are aggregations of the ipcc regions the subregion results fig s6 reflect the trends aggregated by climate zone fig 7 sites in brazil are largely tropical and arid in the south west of the us and hence both regions exhibit the greatest decreases in peak flow whereas the north eastern us and northern europe are largely cold and antecedent soil moisture and peak flows are increasing in southern europe increasing peak flows on average above the 95th percentile are commensurate with the fact that studies using annual maxima find decreases in flood magnitude blöschl et al 2019 gudmundsson et al 2019 mediero et al 2014 but increases are projected for more extreme events arnell and gosling 2016 dankers et al 2014 hirabayashi et al 2013 southern africa shows little evidence of increasing trends in the peak flow for common events but for the rarest percentile studied increases in the peak flow start to follow the increases in the peak rainfall 4 discussion 4 1 influence of larger scale atmospheric changes here the focus remains on changes in the antecedent soil moisture and storm rainfall as these changes are the key drivers of changes in flooding ivancic and shaw 2015 neri et al 2019 wasko et al 2021a although changes in evapotranspiration are a secondary consideration due to the relatively short timescales of flooding they will nevertheless impact on the antecedent soil moisture conditions for example increases in temperature can increase vapor pressure deficits denson et al 2021 driving greater evapotranspiration massmann et al 2019 resulting in drier soils due to greater water scarcity stephens et al 2018 but higher terrestrial water storage resulting in wetter antecedent moisture conditions is also possible as higher carbon dioxide concentrations result in reduced stomatal conductance retallack and conde 2020 swann et al 2016 antecedent soil moisture conditions and storm rainfalls will also be affected by changes in large scale circulation patterns for example changes in storm tracks and moisture transport impact extreme rainfall events and antecedent soil moisture changing flood response shaw et al 2016 the interannual frequency and intensity of atmospheric rivers across the u s is linked to flood occurrence and these atmospheric rivers are also non stationary steinschneider and lall 2015 the changes in flood hazard in southern africa have been tied to changes in the namibia low level jet tramblay et al 2020 across australia where shifts in flooding are tied to antecedent soil moisture these changes to antecedent moisture are highly correlated to changes in the mean rainfall due to hadley cell expanding poleward mathew and kumar 2019 wasko et al 2020b wasko and nathan 2019 4 2 changes in extreme rainfalls it is generally expected with climate change there will be a shift to shorter more intense rainfall bursts occurring with less frequency and hence longer dry periods between events chang et al 2016 it is worth observing that the decreasing trend in storm volume across the southern hemisphere is consistent with decreasing mean annual rainfalls outside of the tropics beck et al 2019 in addition in parts of the u s where the reverse is true increases in the storm size and depth in response to higher temperatures have been observed in convective permitting models prein et al 2017 the greater increase to peak rainfalls than storm volumes is consistent with a shift to less uniform rainfall distributions as a result of higher temperatures wasko and sharma 2015 and a greater frequency of convective rainfall events berg et al 2013 molnar et al 2015 it is expected that the magnitude of extreme rainfall events will increase with higher temperatures due to the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere increasing allan et al 2020 trenberth 1999 this is generally approximated to a rate of increase of 6 7 c the increases in peak rainfalls presented here for events similar in rarity to annual maxima are consistent with the increase expected due to increases in the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere it is expected that extremes that are greater than this may increase at an even greater rate due to latent heat releases which further invigorate the storm strength lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 pendergrass 2018 and will be coupled with the increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall events papalexiou and montanari 2019 the increases observed in rare quantile peak rainfalls here appear to be in line with the largest increases simulated in climate models pendergrass 2018 and correspond to continuous rainfall simulation projections with higher temperatures wasko and sharma 2017b 4 3 assumptions and limitations to prevent confounding of trends due to a mixing of flood mechanisms snowmelt was omitted collins 2019 stein et al 2020 wasko et al 2019 it is important to note that as rising temperatures are expected to cause precipitation to fall preferentially as rain trenberth 2011 and cause flood processes to be more rainfall dominant chegwidden et al 2020 vormoor et al 2016 it can be expected that the results presented here will only become more relevant as temperatures increase further even as snowpack decreases with increased temperatures this will be offset by the increases in rainfall driven and rain on snow flood events davenport et al 2020 the results presented here assume that trends in point estimates of variables are representative of catchment averages and gldas is representative of gauged rainfall and soil moisture observations trends calculated using high quality australian streamflow data recommended for climate change studies matched to observed catchment average rainfall and modelled soil moisture wasko and nathan 2019 are similar to the trends using outlet data from gldas fig s7 the magnitude of the peak rainfall increases are almost identical we cannot expect the peak flow trends to match exactly as the two studies use different station samples but the close agreement between results suggest that trends in point estimates of variables from gldas are representative of observed catchment averages for small catchments although not shown here repeating the analysis presented in wasko and nathan 2019 on the identical catchment sample zhang et al 2016 using catchment outlet data from gldas found very similar correlations between trends in peak flow with both soil moisture and peak rainfall trends albeit with different trend magnitudes providing confidence in the adopted methodology every effort was made to ensure the results presented here are able to be generalised across regions truly global reanalysis data sets are becoming available yang et al 2021 as well as continental observations across regions such as northern and central africa tramblay et al 2021a which were not well represented here however we note that the analysis performed here requires streamflow time series and many published data sets only publish flow indices e g do et al 2018 tramblay et al 2021 to the best of the authors knowledge no studies have been undertaken on the impact of changes in antecedent conditions on flooding outside the regions studied here it is noted however that the seasonality of annual maxima flooding in africa is more associated with soil moisture than rainfall tramblay et al 2021b and this is consistent with the finding here that frequent flood magnitude is modulated by soil moisture changes across the eastern monsoon region of china floods with return periods greater than 10 years are generated by extreme rainfall yang et al 2020 the fact that the dominant flood causing mechanism across the world is generally saturation excess for annual maxima stein et al 2020 points to the modulating effect of soil moisture on these more frequent floods that occur on average once per year and those rarer floods that occur less frequently than once every ten years being rainfall driven wasko and nathan 2019 finally it needs to be noted that percentage changes in flow do not have to match percentage changes in rainfalls as some of the storm rainfall is removed in the conversion to streamflow due to absorption to the soil and transmission losses however the fact that the percentage changes in flow are less than the percentage in rainfall does conclusively point to the influence of changes in soil moisture on the flood peak wasko 2021 although one should be careful about conflating temporal trends with temperature sensitivities it is encouraging that the results presented here are consistent with peak flow temperature sensitivities where using catchment outlet data it was found that although rainfall increased with increasing rarity streamflow only had a positive association with temperature above the 99th percentile wasko and sharma 2017a 5 conclusions in this manuscript we investigated trends in flood magnitude in response to extreme rainfall with a focus on the antecedent conditions driving the flood event where previous studies have focused on either mean changes in soil moisture albergel et al 2013 feng and zhang 2015 or antecedent precipitation woldemeskel and sharma 2016 this study presents an analysis of the soil moisture prior to the onset of flooding we also used quantile regression to extrapolate past the commonly studied annual maxima in engineering applications annual maxima are generally termed minor flooding and may be used for design of minor infrastructure such as domestic stormwater drainage but most infrastructure is designed to withstand major flooding arising from events approaching or exceeding the 100 year recurrence interval here we find that the processes driving changes in flooding for rarer recurrence intervals are different to those driving change to frequent events hence the trends presented in previous manuscripts studying annual maxima may not be materially relevant to engineering design moreover factoring only peak rainfall intensities for estimating future flood risk may not be sufficient due to the influence of changing storm patterns and antecedent soil moisture conditions wasko et al 2021c we found that across many regions in the world in the absence of snowmelt changes in flood magnitude do not follow increases in peak rainfalls storm durations are decreasing with more frequent extreme rainfalls increasing at a rate similar to increases in the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere and rarer events exhibiting an even greater increase in contrast storm volumes show little consistent trend varying with region and duration for frequent events soil moisture drying is often sufficient to outweigh increases in extreme rainfall resulting in decreased flood magnitude however the impact of changes in soil moisture reduces with increasing event rarity meaning for rarer events flood magnitudes are increasing in response to increasing extreme rainfalls these results suggest climate change is increasing major flooding and hence increasing the risk of flood damage to infrastructure while also decreasing the minor flooding responsible for filling water supplies particularly in tropical and arid regions of the world credit authorship contribution statement conrad

4039,increases in extreme rainfall intensities as a result of climate change pose a great risk due to the possibility of increases in pluvial flooding particularly in urban and developed areas but evidence is emerging that the observed increases in extreme rainfall are not resulting in universal increases in flooding indeed on a global scale studies consistently find more gauge stations with decreasing rather than increasing trends in the annual maxima flood magnitude here we aim to improve our understanding of how rainfall and streamflow extremes are changing and why floods are not always observed to increase despite increases in rainfall extremes to do so we examine trends in streamflow events using 2776 stations from the global runoff data centre with events chosen to isolate the impact of changes to their respective rainfall and antecedent soil moisture the analysis is limited to stations with 30 years or more of active record with the majority of stations in north america europe brazil oceania and southern africa consistent with physical reasoning for more frequent events such as the annual maxima it is found the peak 1 day rainfall event intensity is increasing approximately a rate of 6 7 c with rarer event intensities increasing at a rate exceeding the clausius clapeyron relation we find that storm volumes are not increasing as greatly as the peak rainfall and storm durations are decreasing pointing to an intensification of rainfall events and a peakier temporal pattern while rainfall is intensifying the magnitude of frequent floods those expected to occur on average once per year are in general decreasing particularly in tropical and arid regions of the world we find that this is likely due to a dominance of drying antecedent soil moisture conditions however the magnitude of rarer floods has on average been increasing we suggest this is because for these rarer events the increase in rainfall outweighs the decrease in soil moisture our results point to a worst of both world s scenario where small floods responsible for filling our water supplies are decreasing while the large flood events which pose a risk to life and infrastructure are increasing keywords flooding extreme rainfall soil moisture trend analysis climate change 1 introduction flooding is one of the most common and costliest natural disasters razavi et al 2020 with increasingly more people at risk of flooding paprotny et al 2018 with climate change flood risk is expected to increase in urban areas due to intensification of extreme rainfall and a lack of pervious surfaces fadhel et al 2018 hettiarachchi et al 2018 jha et al 2012 any change in the frequency of flooding is likely to have huge economic consequences with greater flood magnitudes increasing economic losses arent et al 2014 wasko et al 2021b and decreases in flood magnitude threatening water security sharma et al 2018 only small changes in climate are required to have large consequences to our ecosystems and economy alley et al 2003 for example changes of 1 2 c and 10 20 in annual precipitation can cause order of magnitude changes in flooding knox 1993 average precipitation across the globe has increased by approximately 2 mm year per decade hartmann et al 2013 with a suggestion that this has primarily occurred over the tropics with decreases elsewhere beck et al 2019 while changes in annual mean precipitation rates will affect antecedent moisture conditions changes in peak or high streamflow magnitude here termed flooding for simplicity are expected to be driven by changes in extreme precipitation globally the magnitude of extreme precipitation has increased donat et al 2016 westra et al 2013 for daily annual maxima the average increase of 5 9 7 7 c sun et al 2021 westra et al 2013 matches the theoretical clausius clapeyron 6 7 c increase in the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere due to higher temperatures fowler et al 2021 trenberth 2011 but there is also an expectation that more extreme rarer daily rainfalls will increase even further pendergrass 2018 pendergrass and hartmann 2014 with increases above the clausius clapeyron rate observed guerreiro et al 2018 wasko and nathan 2019 and modelled bao et al 2017 for events rarer than daily annual maxima in contrast to the increasing trends in precipitation extremes on a global

trends in annual flood maxima using 9213 stations found the number of sites showing statistically significant decreasing trends was greater than the number of sites showing statistically significant

2019 another global study found increasing 20 year and 50 year floods in temperate climates but mostly decreases elsewhere slater et al 2021 further confounding our understanding modelled do et al 2020a and projected hirabayashi et al 2013 increases in flooding are not consistent with the large number of stations exhibiting historical decreases in flood magnitudes global flood models project 30 year and 100 year average recurrence interval ari flood increases across the majority of the globe with decreases only in limited regions of central europe south east australia and central south america arnell and gosling 2016 dankers et al 2014 hirabayashi et al 2013 it can be expected that changes to pluvial flooding in highly urban areas may be driven by changes in precipitation extremes as there is little impervious area hettiarachchi et al 2018 but this transfer function between precipitation and flooding doesn t hold in non urban areas ivancic and shaw 2015 sharma et al 2018 the soil moisture state of the catchment before it rains modulates flooding ivancic and shaw 2015 pathiraja et al 2012 and hence the historical trend in flooding tramblay et al 2019 wasko and nathan 2019 indeed monthly precipitation anomalies do not correlate well with flood anomalies stephens et al 2015 and a low correlation was found between changes in precipitation extremes and changes in flooding across the u s do et al 2020b here we suggest that the discrepancy between extreme rainfall trends and flood trends is at least in part due to a a lack of consistency in the magnitude of the extreme event considered bennett et al 2018 bertola et al 2021 wasko and nathan 2019 and b changes in the antecedent moisture conditions ivancic and shaw 2015 sharma et al 2018 wasko 2021 although many studies examine trends in rainfall and streamflow few studies examine trends in the drivers of flooding villarini and wasko 2021 historical trends in antecedent moisture are rarely studied with studies focusing on either changes in the mean soil moisture albergel et al 2013 feng and zhang 2015 or the antecedent precipitation woldemeskel and sharma 2016 as a surrogate for the antecedent soil moisture here we examine the influence of changes in extreme rainfall and soil moisture on flood magnitude and how this influence varies with event duration and rarity in doing so we aim to understand why in the absence of snowmelt floods are not always observed to increase despite increases in rainfall extremes using the global runoff data centre streamflow database we identify the antecedent soil moisture storm volume and peak rainfall associated with flood events we investigate the trend in each along with the resultant peak flood magnitude across a range of event severities to see whether any consistency between changes to rainfall extremes and flooding can be identified 2 methods streamflow event peaks are identified from the global runoff data centre grdc 2015 with the peak rainfall storm volume and soil moisture coincident with the flood event obtained from the global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 rodell et al 2004 events are sampled on the basis of rainfall to ensure that antecedent conditions are independent from the resultant flood a peak over threshold approach is employed to identify rainfall events and the associated flood peak with historical trends subsequently investigated by quantile regression in order to capture variation with event rarity 2 1 data daily streamflow from the global runoff data centre grdc 2015 was analysed as these have been successfully used in other global studies do et al 2017 lee et al 2015 milly et al 2018 wasko et al 2020 rainfall snow fall snow depth snowmelt and root zone soil moisture at the catchment outlet were extracted from the global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 rodell et al 2004 for the years 1948 to 2014 gldas forcings including rainfall are from the global meteorological forcing dataset which combines a suite of observation based datasets with reanalysis sheffield et al 2006 hence the rainfall can be considered observed as root zone soil moisture has been identified to be most correlated with catchment flood response hill and thomson 2019 root zone soil moisture was used as representative of the catchment soil moisture state the model for soil moisture is a stationary deterministic process and hence will not interfere with calculated trends wasko and nathan 2019 the assumptions that outlet measurements are representative of catchment conditions and that gldas is representative of gauged observations were verified using a high quality observed catchment average data set for australia and are discussed in section 4 3 2 2 event sampling events were selected on the basis of rainfall to ensure that the antecedent conditions are independent of the flood response for example sampling events on the basis of flooding will bias antecedent conditions towards wet catchment conditions a rainfall event is identified if separated by one or more days of zero rainfall with any rainfall below 1 mm assumed to be zero the storm volume is the sum of the rainfalls over the duration of the event the peak rainfall is the maximum daily rainfall within the event and the antecedent moisture or soil moisture is the root zone soil moisture on the day before an event commenced the peak streamflow or peak flow is the maximum streamflow observed after the start of the rainfall event to five days after the end of the rainfall event or before the next event baseflow was removed from the streamflow using a recursive digital filter nathan and mcmahon 1990 meaning the peak flow response is a function of the storm rainfall and soil moisture the total number of events for each station was equal to five times the record length with only the largest rainfall events sampled for example for a site with 50 years of record the largest 250 events are sampled and subsequently analysed this approach ensures that exceedance percentiles are consistent between stations to focus on the impact of changes in soil moisture on the pluvial flood process we need ensure our data set is free of snowmelt any event that has snow present in the precipitation or is modelled to have snowmelt present is removed to ensure no mixing of flood mechanisms other than the interaction of rainfall and antecedent soil moisture collins 2019 wasko et al 2019 flood drivers also vary with catchment size wasko and sharma 2017a for example smaller catchments are less sensitive to changes in antecedent moisture wasko and nathan 2019 with larger rainfalls and hence floods less likely to be influenced by soil moisture storage ivancic and shaw 2015 as a result we restrict our analysis to catchments less than 20000 km2 we note that catchments smaller than 20 000 km2 have a lag time between rainfall and streamflow of less than five days ensuring the peak flow is captured and there is a more direct link between the rainfall and runoff increasing the maximum allowed lag time between the rainfall event and peak flow did not materially change the results 2 3 station selection to reduce the impact of drought periods stations in highly ephemeral or arid catchments where more than 20 of events result in zero flow were omitted as were stations with periods of zero flow greater than three years we restricted our analysis to sites with 30 years or more of active record in total 2776 sites were analysed with median record length of 51 years fig 1 a with the majority of sites located in temperate and cold köppen climate zones across north america europe brazil oceania and southern africa fig 1b the median catchment area is 1129 km2 and 78 of sites have a catchment area less than 5000 km2 hence the majority of catchments can be considered hydrologically small for the readers interest the mean seasonality calculated as a circular mean fisher 1993 wasko et al 2020a of the chosen events is presented in fig s1 in the southern hemisphere sampled events generally occur in the month of peak rainfall seasonality in the tropics the austral summer and further south the austral winter in the northern hemisphere events sampled generally occur in the boreal summer this confirms the absence of snowmelt in the sample we note the analysis was repeated restricting the data range to a common period 1970 2000 and to only using the pristine grdc stations those largely free of diversions and basin development and the results were consistent with those presented here 2 4 calculation of trend and association with flood drivers with the exception of the storm duration for which linear regression was used trends for each of the peak over threshold series peak rainfall storm volume soil moisture and peak flow were calculated using quantile regression hao and naiman 2007 koenker 2021 koenker and bassett 1978 quantile regression was used as it allows investigation of trends in extreme percentiles a quantile regression was fitted between the independent response variable yi and the dependent variable time ti in the units of days peak rainfall storm volume and peak flow were logarithmically transformed with the following relationship fitted 1 l o g 10 y i β 0 q β 1 q t i i q where 0 q 1 is the quantile i is an error term with zero expectation and i 1 m where m is the total number of samples for the site location the logarithmic transform was employed to obtain residuals with zero expectation where zero flows were set to the minimum recorded flow to allow for log transformation sensitivity tests showed that setting zero flows to the minimum on record had almost no influence on calculated trends the regression coefficients β 0 and β 1 represent a constant and the linear change in the response variable per unit change in time t respectively a choice of q 0 5 for the quantile non exceedance percentile corresponds to the median tendency between the dependent variable ti and response yi trends for more extreme data quantiles were investigated using quantiles q above 0 5 the trend per decade δ 10 y as a percentage was calculated using following transformation where n is the number of days in 10 years 2 δ 10 y 100 10 n β 1 1 soil moisture did not require transformation of residuals and the trend per decade is reported as the slope β 1 of the fitted regression multiplied by the number of days in 10 years a notional ari was assigned to the rainfall quantile using the following equation stedinger et al 1993 3 q 1 1 λ l n t a t a 1 where q is the non exceedance percentile of interest λ is the average number of events per year in this case 5 section 2 2 and ta is the ari in years finally the association between the peak flow and the flood drivers peak rainfall storm volume and soil moisture was calculated using a pearson correlation coefficient the use of a rank based spearman correlation gave similar results 3 results 3 1 association of the flood peak to event rainfall and soil moisture conditions to assess the influence of antecedent soil moisture peak rainfall and storm volume on the peak flow we present the correlation of peak flow with each of these streamflow drivers in fig 2 for a sampling frequency of five events per year the peak rainfall has a relatively low median correlation 0 12 with the peak flow the storm volume peak flow median correlation is slightly higher 0 28 but the highest correlation for the peak flow is with antecedent soil moisture 0 39 peak rainfall storm volume and soil moisture are hence all driving the resulting peak flow but for frequent events on average occurring five times a year the antecedent soil moisture is the primary driver of the flood response overall the correlations changed little when sampling frequency was varied from 1 to 10 events per year on average fig s2 to quantify the magnitude of the response to changes in antecedent soil moisture and rainfall the variation in peak flow resulting from different combinations of peak rainfall and soil moisture is presented in fig 3 a to aggregate between sites at each station the events for each variable are divided by the mean at that site with contours presenting a heat map of antecedent soil moisture referring to fig 3a a relatively small rainfall leads to a small flow peak when the soil is dry bottom left however the same relatively small rainfall can result in a large flow peak if the catchment is wet top left hence for the same rainfall magnitude differing catchment soil moisture before the rainfall can result in orders of magnitude difference in the flow if the rainfall is large a large flow will result regardless of the soil moisture top right this is because the more extreme the rainfall event is the less the modulating effect of the antecedent soil moisture conditions we note the same relationship is observed for the storm volume fig 3b whereby a small difference in the soil moisture can result in order of magnitude differences in the peak flow for the same storm volume 3 2 trends in flood drivers trends in frequent flooding and its drivers peak rainfall storm volume and soil moisture are presented in fig 4 for the 50th and 95th percentile we first focus on the results for 50th percentile in the left column there is an almost universal increase in peak rainfall for the 50th percentile of sampled events top left in the order of 0 2 per decade fig 4 storm volumes show very mixed trends for the 50th percentile storm volumes are decreasing across most of europe south africa and australia as well as part of the west coast of the u s increases are observed in the uk and over the east and mid west of the u s on average the 50th percentile antecedent soil moisture is decreasing fig 4 it needs to be noted that this is distinct from annual mean soil moisture although trends in antecedent root zone soil moisture exhibit a strong positive correlation of 0 78 with trends in annual mean soil moisture trends not shown they will not necessarily correspond for example although europe exhibits historical increases in mean soil moisture albergel et al 2013 antecedent soil moisture for events devoid of snowmelt has been decreasing here the only regions that show increases in antecedent soil moisture are those that show increases in storm volumes that is the mid west of the u s and the u k fig 4 these regions correspond to regions that have also previously been identified as having increased flood magnitudes such as the north east u s archfield et al 2016 and northern europe blöschl et al 2019 the bottom left panel summarises the trends in the 50th percentile of peak flows and confirms trends presented in previous regional studies merz et al 2021 wasko 2021 peak flow magnitude is trending negatively in the south and western u s southern europe and the majority of the southern hemisphere these regions coincide well with the regions of drier antecedent soil moisture conditions and reductions in storm volume presented in the panels above the regions experiencing greater peak flow magnitudes generally correspond to the regions of wetter antecedent moisture for frequent events trends in the peak flow appear more linked to soil moisture with trends in peak flow bearing little resemblance to the increasing extreme rainfalls the right column presents the trend in the 95th percentile of sampled events compared to the more frequent events left column there are now strong increases in the magnitude of severe rainfall extremes in the order of 4 6 per decade top right storm volume trends remain similar to the 50th percentile across europe there is a slight drying trend and across the u s a slight wetting trend again similar to the 50th percentile for the 95th percentile soil moisture has been decreasing across australia parts of brazil and southern europe with the only exception northern europe the east coast of the u s and northern australia however flood trends differ for the 95th percentile compared to the 50th percentile in the southern hemisphere the more severe events exhibit more positive trends in southern africa and less negative trends in south america and southern australia similarly the peak flow trends in the south west of the u s are less negative for these rarer events although peak flow trends do not follow peak rainfall trends the dependence on rainfall magnitude presented in fig 3 appears in the trends presented in fig 4 with trends in more extreme events potentially less modulated by changes in soil moisture the relationship between the trend in the peak rainfall storm volume soil moisture and peak flow and the rarity of the event percentile is elucidated further in section 3 4 3 3 trend in storm duration the discrepancy between changes in the peak rainfall and storm volume requires further attention as one would expect with increasing peak rainfall that storm volumes would also increase the results presented in fig 4 where extreme peak rainfall is increasing but storm volume is not increasing point to a peakier temporal pattern where to compensate for the increasing trend in the peak rainfall the remaining rainfall in the storm is decreasing wasko and sharma 2015 a change to a peakier storm temporal pattern is equivalent and consistent with a decreasing storm duration hence it is prudent to investigate trends in the storm duration the mean storm duration is presented in fig 5 a the mean storm duration in the southern latitudes varies generally between 2 and 4 days but increases to 4 5 days in the tropics and longer in brazil consistent with the prevalence of summer monsoonal rainfall across europe similar to the temperate climate of australia average storm durations of 2 4 days have been sampled but interestingly across the midwest of the u s shorter storm events indicate a prevalence of summer mesoscale convective weather systems prein et al 2017 the trend in storm event duration is calculated using linear regression fig 5b there is an almost universal decrease in storm duration in the order of 0 to 0 2 days per decade across the globe some larger decreases are observed over brazil where the largest durations are observed however overall the picture is very consistent the average decrease across stations analysed is approximately 0 1 day per decade due to the skew of some longer events showing larger decreases the median change is closer to 0 05 days per decade given that the majority of events sampled are well below 5 days in duration this represents a substantial decreasing trend in rainfall event duration using different thresholds for the rainfall above the 50th 80th and 90th percentile of rainfall at that station and recalculating the trend in the storm duration did not present any evidence of greater trends with increasing event magnitude 3 4 variability in flood peak storm rainfall and antecedent soil moisture trends to understand at what level of rarity the dominant flood driver changes antecedent soil moisture vs peak rainfall the median trend across all sites analysed for the peak rainfall storm volume and soil moisture is presented against the non exceedance percentile of sampled events fig 6 the percentile is converted to a notional average recurrence interval in years using equation 3 and is also presented in fig 6 for reference the three panels present a repetition of the sampling described in section 2 2 progressively restricting the sample to shorter maximum rainfall event durations as presented in fig 4 there is a strong consistent positive trend in the peak rainfall that increases with event rarity and this trend is consistent across event durations fig 6 assuming an increase in global temperature over land of 0 2 c per decade daily annual maxima increase at approximately the clausius clapeyron rate of 6 7 c similar to previous studies guerreiro et al 2018 westra et al 2013 events rarer than this however are increasing at a much greater rate that exceeds the clausius clapeyron scaling rate focusing on the left most panel which presents results that do not restrict the event duration storm volumes show mixed trends and hence on average the trend is approximately zero there is little evidence for increasing peak flows with a much larger variability in the streamflow response wider confidence intervals relative to the peak rainfall trend despite increases in peak rainfall across all recurrence intervals average peak flow is decreasing for frequent events it is only for the more extreme rainfalls above the 98th percentile recurrence intervals rarer than approximately 10 to 20 years the median peak flow trend is positive this points to more frequent flood magnitudes decreasing while rarer flood magnitudes are increasing as we progressively reduce the duration of the storm event sample to events of seven days or less centre panel and three days or less right panel the peak one day rainfall becomes a greater fraction of the total storm volume and an increasing trend in the storm volume emerges fig 6 the increasing trend in the storm volume is stronger the rarer the event as well as the shorter the storm duration a pattern in the flood trends also emerges whereby the peak flows are increasing in response to the increase in storm volumes but they do not exceed the storm volume increase due to the average decrease in antecedent soil moisture as the threshold of what was considered rainfall here 1 mm was increased the events being sampled become larger and more extreme also resulting in increasing storm volumes in response to the increasing extreme rainfalls despite increasing storm volumes for larger events storm durations continue to shorten section 3 3 3 5 influence of climate region on trends in flood peak storm rainfall and antecedent soil moisture recognising that flood trends vary with region fig 4 we follow slater et al 2021 and aggregate trends on köppen climate zone beck et al 2019 the trends with non exceedance percentile for the main climate zones tropical arid temperate and cold using all events are presented in fig 7 consistent with the aggregated results fig 6 peak rainfall is increasing in each climate zone with the magnitude of the increase greater with increasing event rarity sites located in the tropics exhibit increasing peak rainfall but decreasing storm volumes and antecedent soil moisture across all percentiles peak flows do not exhibit increases even for the most extreme events sites located in arid zones also exhibit increases in the peak rainfall but this increase is smaller in magnitude than in tropical zones or the aggregated sample median fig 6 there is little positive or negative trend in the storm volume or antecedent soil moisture conditions and peak flows are decreasing for the common events there is evidence of increasing peak flows only for the most extreme flows but there is large uncertainty due to the small sample size the magnitude of the decrease in the peak flow for the more frequent non exceedance percentiles is greater in tropical and arid zones than in the temperate and cold zones as most of the sites are in temperate and cold climate zones fig 7 the results for these regions look more similar to the results when the stations were aggregated fig 6 for both the temperate and cold zones peak rainfalls are increasing and the magnitude of the increases is greater the more extreme the event for the temperate zone we see decreasing soil moisture and peak flows with increases only for approximately the 98th percentile this suggests the decrease in soil moisture has a strong influence on events that are more common than the 98th percentile and the increase in peak rainfall dominates above the 98th percentile in the cold zone the antecedent moisture on average is still decreasing but storm volumes are on average increasing as are the peak rainfalls however the magnitude of the storm volume increases does not increase with the event rarity as it does for peak rainfalls the peak flow responds similarly to these increases and is increasing across percentiles but due to the drier antecedent soil moisture conditions these increases still do not match the increase in the peak rainfall we further stratify these results restricting our sampling to storm durations less than or equal to three days fig s5 in tropical and arid regions despite increases in storm volumes there is still little evidence for increasing peak flows except for the rarest events it is only in temperate and cold regions that increasing peak flows are found across all percentiles for these shorter storm durations this suggests that the results in fig 6 though showing a clear interaction between the antecedent soil moisture conditions and peak flows are heavily weighted by temperate climate stations particularly from europe we can conclude that irrespective of the storm duration for colder regions of the world increases in flooding are more likely than for warmer regions trends are also calculated for the subregions presented in fig s1 and are presented in fig s6 the two regions for europe and one region for southern africa are drawn directly from the international panel on climate change ipcc reports gudmundsson et al 2019 seneviratne et al 2012 while the remaining regions are aggregations of the ipcc regions the subregion results fig s6 reflect the trends aggregated by climate zone fig 7 sites in brazil are largely tropical and arid in the south west of the us and hence both regions exhibit the greatest decreases in peak flow whereas the north eastern us and northern europe are largely cold and antecedent soil moisture and peak flows are increasing in southern europe increasing peak flows on average above the 95th percentile are commensurate with the fact that studies using annual maxima find decreases in flood magnitude blöschl et al 2019 gudmundsson et al 2019 mediero et al 2014 but increases are projected for more extreme events arnell and gosling 2016 dankers et al 2014 hirabayashi et al 2013 southern africa shows little evidence of increasing trends in the peak flow for common events but for the rarest percentile studied increases in the peak flow start to follow the increases in the peak rainfall 4 discussion 4 1 influence of larger scale atmospheric changes here the focus remains on changes in the antecedent soil moisture and storm rainfall as these changes are the key drivers of changes in flooding ivancic and shaw 2015 neri et al 2019 wasko et al 2021a although changes in evapotranspiration are a secondary consideration due to the relatively short timescales of flooding they will nevertheless impact on the antecedent soil moisture conditions for example increases in temperature can increase vapor pressure deficits denson et al 2021 driving greater evapotranspiration massmann et al 2019 resulting in drier soils due to greater water scarcity stephens et al 2018 but higher terrestrial water storage resulting in wetter antecedent moisture conditions is also possible as higher carbon dioxide concentrations result in reduced stomatal conductance retallack and conde 2020 swann et al 2016 antecedent soil moisture conditions and storm rainfalls will also be affected by changes in large scale circulation patterns for example changes in storm tracks and moisture transport impact extreme rainfall events and antecedent soil moisture changing flood response shaw et al 2016 the interannual frequency and intensity of atmospheric rivers across the u s is linked to flood occurrence and these atmospheric rivers are also non stationary steinschneider and lall 2015 the changes in flood hazard in southern africa have been tied to changes in the namibia low level jet tramblay et al 2020 across australia where shifts in flooding are tied to antecedent soil moisture these changes to antecedent moisture are highly correlated to changes in the mean rainfall due to hadley cell expanding poleward mathew and kumar 2019 wasko et al 2020b wasko and nathan 2019 4 2 changes in extreme rainfalls it is generally expected with climate change there will be a shift to shorter more intense rainfall bursts occurring with less frequency and hence longer dry periods between events chang et al 2016 it is worth observing that the decreasing trend in storm volume across the southern hemisphere is consistent with decreasing mean annual rainfalls outside of the tropics beck et al 2019 in addition in parts of the u s where the reverse is true increases in the storm size and depth in response to higher temperatures have been observed in convective permitting models prein et al 2017 the greater increase to peak rainfalls than storm volumes is consistent with a shift to less uniform rainfall distributions as a result of higher temperatures wasko and sharma 2015 and a greater frequency of convective rainfall events berg et al 2013 molnar et al 2015 it is expected that the magnitude of extreme rainfall events will increase with higher temperatures due to the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere increasing allan et al 2020 trenberth 1999 this is generally approximated to a rate of increase of 6 7 c the increases in peak rainfalls presented here for events similar in rarity to annual maxima are consistent with the increase expected due to increases in the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere it is expected that extremes that are greater than this may increase at an even greater rate due to latent heat releases which further invigorate the storm strength lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 pendergrass 2018 and will be coupled with the increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall events papalexiou and montanari 2019 the increases observed in rare quantile peak rainfalls here appear to be in line with the largest increases simulated in climate models pendergrass 2018 and correspond to continuous rainfall simulation projections with higher temperatures wasko and sharma 2017b 4 3 assumptions and limitations to prevent confounding of trends due to a mixing of flood mechanisms snowmelt was omitted collins 2019 stein et al 2020 wasko et al 2019 it is important to note that as rising temperatures are expected to cause precipitation to fall preferentially as rain trenberth 2011 and cause flood processes to be more rainfall dominant chegwidden et al 2020 vormoor et al 2016 it can be expected that the results presented here will only become more relevant as temperatures increase further even as snowpack decreases with increased temperatures this will be offset by the increases in rainfall driven and rain on snow flood events davenport et al 2020 the results presented here assume that trends in point estimates of variables are representative of catchment averages and gldas is representative of gauged rainfall and soil moisture observations trends calculated using high quality australian streamflow data recommended for climate change studies matched to observed catchment average rainfall and modelled soil moisture wasko and nathan 2019 are similar to the trends using outlet data from gldas fig s7 the magnitude of the peak rainfall increases are almost identical we cannot expect the peak flow trends to match exactly as the two studies use different station samples but the close agreement between results suggest that trends in point estimates of variables from gldas are representative of observed catchment averages for small catchments although not shown here repeating the analysis presented in wasko and nathan 2019 on the identical catchment sample zhang et al 2016 using catchment outlet data from gldas found very similar correlations between trends in peak flow with both soil moisture and peak rainfall trends albeit with different trend magnitudes providing confidence in the adopted methodology every effort was made to ensure the results presented here are able to be generalised across regions truly global reanalysis data sets are becoming available yang et al 2021 as well as continental observations across regions such as northern and central africa tramblay et al 2021a which were not well represented here however we note that the analysis performed here requires streamflow time series and many published data sets only publish flow indices e g do et al 2018 tramblay et al 2021 to the best of the authors knowledge no studies have been undertaken on the impact of changes in antecedent conditions on flooding outside the regions studied here it is noted however that the seasonality of annual maxima flooding in africa is more associated with soil moisture than rainfall tramblay et al 2021b and this is consistent with the finding here that frequent flood magnitude is modulated by soil moisture changes across the eastern monsoon region of china floods with return periods greater than 10 years are generated by extreme rainfall yang et al 2020 the fact that the dominant flood causing mechanism across the world is generally saturation excess for annual maxima stein et al 2020 points to the modulating effect of soil moisture on these more frequent floods that occur on average once per year and those rarer floods that occur less frequently than once every ten years being rainfall driven wasko and nathan 2019 finally it needs to be noted that percentage changes in flow do not have to match percentage changes in rainfalls as some of the storm rainfall is removed in the conversion to streamflow due to absorption to the soil and transmission losses however the fact that the percentage changes in flow are less than the percentage in rainfall does conclusively point to the influence of changes in soil moisture on the flood peak wasko 2021 although one should be careful about conflating temporal trends with temperature sensitivities it is encouraging that the results presented here are consistent with peak flow temperature sensitivities where using catchment outlet data it was found that although rainfall increased with increasing rarity streamflow only had a positive association with temperature above the 99th percentile wasko and sharma 2017a 5 conclusions in this manuscript we investigated trends in flood magnitude in response to extreme rainfall with a focus on the antecedent conditions driving the flood event where previous studies have focused on either mean changes in soil moisture albergel et al 2013 feng and zhang 2015 or antecedent precipitation woldemeskel and sharma 2016 this study presents an analysis of the soil moisture prior to the onset of flooding we also used quantile regression to extrapolate past the commonly studied annual maxima in engineering applications annual maxima are generally termed minor flooding and may be used for design of minor infrastructure such as domestic stormwater drainage but most infrastructure is designed to withstand major flooding arising from events approaching or exceeding the 100 year recurrence interval here we find that the processes driving changes in flooding for rarer recurrence intervals are different to those driving change to frequent events hence the trends presented in previous manuscripts studying annual maxima may not be materially relevant to engineering design moreover factoring only peak rainfall intensities for estimating future flood risk may not be sufficient due to the influence of changing storm patterns and antecedent soil moisture conditions wasko et al 2021c we found that across many regions in the world in the absence of snowmelt changes in flood magnitude do not follow increases in peak rainfalls storm durations are decreasing with more frequent extreme rainfalls increasing at a rate similar to increases in the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere and rarer events exhibiting an even greater increase in contrast storm volumes show little consistent trend varying with region and duration for frequent events soil moisture drying is often sufficient to outweigh increases in extreme rainfall resulting in decreased flood magnitude however the impact of changes in soil moisture reduces with increasing event rarity meaning for rarer events flood magnitudes are increasing in response to increasing extreme rainfalls these results suggest climate change is increasing major flooding and hence increasing the risk of flood damage to infrastructure while also decreasing the minor flooding responsible for filling water supplies particularly in tropical and arid regions of the world credit authorship contribution statement conrad
