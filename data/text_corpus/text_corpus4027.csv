20135,snow glaciers and permafrost translate fluctuations of atmospheric conditions and highlight current environmental changes monitoring of these changes is one of the major objectives of the international climate observation strategy developed by the global climate observing system gcos under ongoing climate change the implication of altering meltwater released by snow ice and permafrost will become increasingly relevant for the fragile mountain and lowland environments of central asia these changes will affect the livelihood particularly for mountain communities but also for the highly populated regions downstream a degrading cryosphere may cause drastic ecological changes and endanger water food and health security leading to pronounced political instabilities and changing socio hydrological interactions for successful mitigation the adaptation capacity has to be enforced by first creating basic observational datasets on the state and changes of the cryosphere and secondly by providing well calibrated models in connection with climate scenario output this information is a pre condition to reduce on mid to long term the vulnerability of the local population so far significant data gaps of in situ measurements in central asia mainly from the mid 1990 s to around 2010 impeded sound interpretations of long term trends in the cryosphere however the progress made on glacier observation and capacity building in recent years promises a future perspective for monitoring including snow and permafrost this paper summarizes the current knowledge on the state of three essential climate variables ecv of the central asian cryosphere snow glaciers and permafrost in a context of future water security it highlights the challenges for cryosphere assessments in the region and discusses ongoing monitoring efforts future directions and emerging approaches which might address current shortcomings of today s monitoring network 1 relevance of the cryosphere for water availability the changing cryosphere has become an icon for climate warming 1 changes of snow glaciers and permafrost translate the fluctuations of atmospheric conditions and highlight current environmental changes 2 during the past decades such changes have strongly affected the major central asian mountain ranges tien shan and pamir 3 these form the north western margin of high mountain asia hma fig 1 hosting 25 000 glaciers maximum snow cover can exceed 80 of the mountainous terrain and up to 32 of the lowlands 4 permafrost contains highly variable amounts of ice depending on the substrate e g rock glacier bedrock fine material etc a rock glacier can contain ice contents between 10 and 90 vol whereas massive bedrock has in general very low ice contents the different landforms of permafrost are found in the central asian highlands but have so far not been quantified ice and snowmelt are principal water resources for the highly populated lowlands of central asia e g 5 7 and have a crucial role for mountain communities 8 10 especially where irrigation is a general practise continuous socio hydrological interactions establish 8 snow accumulation acts as a water reservoir mainly during winter months controlling river runoff in spring and early summer with increasing summer precipitation towards the east summer snowfall is frequent 11 12 snow strongly influences the temperature regime in the ground and therewith permafrost distribution 13 15 furthermore fresh snow increases the albedo and hence provokes a significant reduction of glacier melt 16 18 glaciers and permafrost release most of their melt water during july to september during dry and hot periods glacier melt is a vital fresh water source 19 20 so far it is unknown how much permafrost melt contributes to the total river runoff changes in the cryosphere have implications on the occurrence of natural hazards 21 hazards associated with glacier or permafrost degradation are expected to become more frequent and stronger in magnitude with the ongoing climate warming 22 24 associated processes could reach densely populated areas might be transboundary and cause numerous victims i e 25 27 increasing rates of glacier lake expansion from 0 8 yr 1 28 to 3 yr 1 were observed for both the tien shan and pamir 24 29 however no evidence of an increase in glacier lake outburst floods since 1970 ies could be observed 30 but is expected for catchments with large high altitude glaciers in the future 31 33 the slow degradation of permafrost may lead to large rock falls this creates the potential of strong cascading events which include processes such as overtopping and lake dam breeches provoking large debris flows 34 35 long term monitoring of the cryosphere enables an improved understanding on the controlling processes driving its response to changing climate and on hazard potential 36 39 in addition it helps to better quantify the associated changes in meltwater release e g 40 despite the significance and our current knowledge of the cryosphere at a global level the heterogeneous response of snow ice and permafrost in central asia remains poorly understood half a decade ago the imminent need of improving the knowledge about spatio temporal changes in the water cycle of central asian headwaters was highlighted 41 43 in this study we provide a review of recent research concerning the state change and impact of the central asian cryosphere for the past decade 2 the central asian cryosphere under a changing climate the climate of central asia is formed at the boundary between temperate and subtropical climate zones and is characterised by an extreme continentality and strong topographical effects cold inflows of northerly and north westerly direction and moist air masses from the western atlantic region are influencing the western and north western flat plains of central asia in the south and east the mountain ranges of the himalayan pamir hindukush and tien shan almost completely isolate central asia from moist air masses from the indian ocean 45 due to such barrier effects arid and cold conditions dominate in the eastern part of both the tien shan 11 and pamir 20 46 47 with precipitation maxima towards the summer 48 a pronounced west to east gradient in seasonal precipitation distribution for the tien shan 11 and the pamir 47 produces regionally variable snow cover accumulation and ablation regimes glacier mass balance gradients and permafrost distribution for the tien shan a consistent air temperature increase of about 0 1 to 0 2 c per decade with more pronounced warming in the winter months was recorded during 1960 2007 49 51 this was accompanied by an increase of total annual precipitation while the share of solid precipitation decreased due to warming 42 43 52 these trends are still ongoing based on data from meteorological stations near golubin glacier and near glacier no 354 where significant may september warming was observed until 2018 there are no significant trends in annual to seasonal precipitation changes the changes are non uniform across the region with a strong inter annual variability 12 51 53 for the pamir pohl et al 20 detected a temperature increase of 0 07 to 0 11 c yr 1 and likewise no precipitation trend during the last decades knoche et al 54 highlighted the heterogeneity in solid precipitation evolution and found declining summer temperatures along with increasing annual precipitation amounts for the northern pamir unger shayesteh et al 42 emphasized a shift in the timing of the onset of the melt season towards the earlier spring due to warmer spring temperatures aizen et al 55 reported a reduction of the maximum snow thickness and snow cover duration by 0 1 m and 9 days over the tien shan from 1940 to 1991 however certain regions in the eastern tien shan and pamir tended to have increased average snow cover duration due to altered snow fall patterns and precipitation amounts that counterbalance the effect of air temperature increase 41 56 this has been confirmed through recent monitoring of the meteorological variables and glacier mass balances at abramov glacier 38 3 snow seasonal snow cover forms a major part of the annual water budget in central asia with estimates of snow water equivalent contribution of over 50 for the main basins 38 armstrong et al 57 found seasonal snow contributions as high as 65 72 of mean annual runoff in the amu darya and sry darya basins using remote sensing and degree day melt modelling this contrasts to 23 contribution of rainfall and 2 8 from glacier ice to the annual runoff 41 58 typically annual glacier melt contribution is about 6 for syr daria and 20 for amu darya 35 it is however much larger during the melting season and can reach up to 1 5 to 3 times the mean annual input 41 in an earlier study aizen et al 58 also found snowmelt to be a dominant contributor to annual runoff throughout the tien shan based on long term hydrological records of the former ussr albeit lower at around 30 most studies on recent climate impacts on snow cover in central asia have focused on optical satellites to quantify snow cover extent sce for example zhou et al 59 used a combined avhrr and modis dataset of sce to assess changes in snow cover days and found significant decreases in number of snow on ground days for central asia from 1986 to 2008 however results from a study covering the period 1986 2008 using passive microwave data mankin et al 60 showed reduced snow cover duration and maximum snow depths in western and eastern parts of the tien shan whereas increased snow depth in central tien shan which was attributed to an increase in winter precipitation mankin et al 60 investigated the sensitivity of global river basins to changes in snow supply under climate change projections they found a high risk that snowmelt will no longer meet summer demand by mid century in central asian basins increasing glacial runoff will possibly buffer decreasing snowpacks until mid century when peak water is expected in many areas of central asia 40 61 the second half of the century will then likely see decreasing runoff as both snow and glacial components will diminish the ability of black carbon bc and other aerosols to change the surface energy balance of snowpacks is of growing interest in the light of anthropogenic climate change with many growing industrial centres close to the tien shan and pamir bc is increasingly being deposited in seasonal snowpacks 62 deposited bc reduces the surface albedo and therefore increase radiative forcing and can increase melt rates significantly 62 63 the impacts of climate change on snow cover is driven by the interplay of accumulation precipitation and its rain snow partitioning and ablation air temperature radiation high elevation regions that are less sensitive to temperature increases and shifts in rain snow partitioning will possibly see increased snowpacks e g 64 as for example has been attributed to the so called and arguably misnamed cf 65 karakoram anomaly particularly over northern regions of central asia and north eastern tibetan plateau where precipitation increases are projected under cmip5 simulations e g 66 67 however projected temperature increases will likely change the seasonality of snowmelt and reduce lower elevation snow cover 67 our knowledge of snow cover magnitudes dynamics and climate norms in the region is still very limited due to remote terrain few in situ observations and often poor performance of models during the soviet era field measurements of snow depth and density were routinely made fig 2 however most recent studies have tended to focus on the parameter snow cover extent which can be robustly observed by optical satellite sensors over large regions e g 68 however this only tells half the story the other key parameters are snow water equivalent swe and temporal behaviour of accumulation and melt estimating swe remains one of the great challenges in snow hydrology 69 largely due to the challenge of quantifying solid precipitation particularly at high altitude cf 70 in general high altitude precipitation regimes of central asia remain significantly unconstrained 71 in situ observations are scarce and often highly uncertain due to undercatch particularly at high elevations which produces high uncertainties in observation based datasets e g cru gpcc etc combined remote sensing methods e g trmm chirps etc strongly underestimate solid precipitation and coarse grid scales lead to uncertainties in complex terrain pure modelling approaches such as era5 reanalysis from the european centre medium range weather forecasts in which precipitation is prognostic and not assimilated have also been shown to have large biases over hma 72 the uncertainties inherent in these different products are highlighted by the spatially and temporally heterogeneous trends 73 future directions and emerging approaches which may address these challenges are further discussed in section 7 4 glaciers the tien shan hosts almost 15 000 glaciers covering a surface area of around 12 300 km2 74 the pamir contains over 13 000 glaciers that cover an area of approximately 12 000 km2 75 for the pamir median glacier elevation follows a gradient from west 3800 m a s l to east 5000 m a s l for the tien shan median glacier elevations range from 3700 to 4200 m a s l and are highest in the central part 74 most glaciers in both mountain ranges in central asia are so called polythermal glaciers polythermal glaciers contain cold ice but include also large volumes that are temperate at the melting point most commonly in dry and cold climates small and non dynamic glaciers have cold ice in the ablation area or at least in a surface layer with tens of meters of thickness at lower altitudes in contrary cold firn and ice in accumulation areas are only found at higher elevations around 5000 m a s l 185 186 these areas are going to play an important role in the near future because the additional energy input from atmospheric warming is not transformed directly into increased and accelerated melting but rather into a rise in the firn and ice temperatures by the release of latent heat through refreezing in general the observations of firn and ice temperatures are very reliable climate indicators and the impacts of a change from cold to temperate firn ice in the accumulation zones is directly reflected in an increase of mass loss for larger high altitude glaciers 46 past and recent measurements on selected sites in central asia highlight the occurrence of both cold ice in the ablation and accumulation zones recent ice temperature measurements at the tongue of batysh sook glacier a very small glacier 2 km2 showed temperatures below zero degrees approx ranging from 5 to 7 c at 10 to 16 m depth from a 90 m deep borehole at the accumulation area of gregoriev glacier thompson et al 76 measured very low accumulation rates of around 0 3 m w e a 1 during the period of 1961 1990 and negative temperatures throughout the whole borehole profile the authors reported a minimum temperature of close to 4 c at the bottom of the borehole at the same site kronenberg et al 77 confirmed similar accumulation rates for the period 1986 2017 however the englacial temperature measurements in a depth of 15 m corresponding to the zero annual amplitude zaa had considerably increased from 3 c 76 to 1 5 c 77 from 1990 to 2018 however kronenberg et al 78 found that for abramov glacier at an altitude of around 4400 m a s l in the pamir alay the accumulation sites were found to be temperate they showed that the firn stratigraphy has however not changed importantly farinotti et al 79 calculated a total glacier ice volume of 3 27 0 85 103 km3 for central asia the study showed that hma the area with one of the largest ice volumes outside the polar regions hosts about 27 less glacier ice than previously suggested only a few measurements of individual glacier thicknesses are available for central asia e g 80 83 however data on glacier thickness distribution internal ice and firn structure and their change remain sparse in central asia data on glacier covered area are still incomplete and heterogeneous 75 more accurate glacier inventories appeared in the last years e g 75 84 comparison with previous datasets is however not straightforward several studies using consistent data reported on heterogeneous area change e g 85 89 in four catchments in the pamir alay area reduction rates decreased from 0 46 yr 1 in 1957 1980 to 0 27 yr 1 in 1980 2001 90 for the tien shan narama et al 91 reported an increase of area loss rates from 0 4 yr 1 to 0 57 yr 1 for at bashy central tien shan and from 0 63 yr 1 to 0 71 yr 1 for pskem western tien shan but a decrease from 0 33 yr 1 to 0 yr 1 for the fergana range from 1970 to 2000 to 2000 2007 for the ak shyrak massif central tien shan area loss rates increased from 0 12 yr 1 for 1943 1977 to 0 33 yr 1 for 1977 2003 92 and to 0 59 0 34 yr 1 for 2003 2013 93 these rates further accelerated up to 0 93 0 61 yr 1 from 2013 to 2018 with a significant negative correlation with glacier size during ussr most glacier mass balance monitoring sites were established in mid 1950 s 94 95 the majority of the observation programmes stopped during the early 1990 s today only one continuous series exist tuyuksu glacier kazakhstan for tuyuksu a mass balance of 0 4 m w e yr 1 was reported from 1957 to 2018 39 urumqi glacier in the east tien shan has a relatively complete record since 1980 s with a reconstructed period back to the late 1950 s a similar mass loss of 0 4 m w e yr 1 was reported from 1957 to 2017 39 efforts to re establish in situ glacier observations have started since 2010 38 such datasets however are limited to a few selected well accessible glaciers but are of great importance to validate modelling studies and regional assessments current results directions and monitoring strategies are further discussed in section 7 zemp et al 96 and wouters et al 97 suggested a mass loss of 0 15 0 12 m w e yr 1 from 2006 to 2016 and of 0 06 0 09 m w e yr 1 from 2002 to 2016 for central asia respectively most other studies distinguish between pamir and tien shan published mass change assessments for the pamir are inconsistent fig 3 a unfortunately increasing the uncertainty of the understanding on the ongoing glacier changes in the region 98 103 similar discrepancies prevail also on more localized catchment scale for muztagh ata holzer et al 104 provided almost balanced conditions of 0 01 0 30 m w e yr 1 for 1973 to 2013 barandun et al 44 found substantial mass loss of 0 68 0 32 m w e yr 1 from 2000 to 2018 while uncertainties connected to both methods are high for the central pamir barandun et al 44 modelled stable conditions of 0 04 0 32 m w e yr 1 from 2000 to 2018 that agree well with the mass balance of 0 06 0 68 m w e yr 1 for the karakul catchment from 2000 to 2010 found by holzer et al 105 zhou et al 106 found a balanced mass change for fedchenko glacier of 0 03 0 24 m w e yr 1 from 1974 to 1999 whereas lambrecht et al 107 highlighted a strong imbalance for the same glacier in recent years with an increase of mass loss from 0 27 0 05 m w e yr 1 to 0 51 0 04 m w e yr 1 for 2000 2011 and 2011 to 2018 respectively an assimilation of historical modern and reconstructed data for abramov revealed a mass loss of approximately 0 4 m w e yr 1 from 1968 to 2018 108 109 and a geodetic survey based on historical aerial photography provided similar results of approximately 0 4 m w e yr 1 from 1975 to 2015 110 for the tien shan better agreement between region wide e g 44 99 100 and on subregion catchment scale with farinotti et al 103 and bolch 83 was found fig 3b gardner et al 101 published a somewhat more negative regional mass loss from 2000 to 2009 as well as pieczonka and bolch 111 and goerlich et al 112 on catchment scale for the second half of the 20th century a combination of modern glaciological observations reconstruction and reanalysis of legacy data for golubin located in the northern western tien shan indicated an increase of mass loss from 0 1 m w e yr 1 for 1927 1972 to 0 3 m w e yr 1 for 1972 2016 113 the aforementioned differences in literature might relate to i important methodological differences ii different study periods and iii inconsistent region division inherent differences of the methodology individual studies relate to the uncertainty of each technique and were believed not to exceed the error bars provided by the individual studies inconsistent time periods make straightforward comparison difficult typically studies including the early years of the 21st century revealed often less negative values 98 100 than studies focusing on periods after 2004 101 103 using the annual time series barandun et al 44 identified clearly less negative mass balances at the beginning of the study period prior 2005 this might explain part of the tendency to provide more negative results when focusing on the period 2003 to 2009 i e icesat based inconsistent perimeter of the study regions can explain an additional fraction of the encountered differences in the results due to heterogeneous glacier responses within the individual subregions validation datasets from complete cryosphere monitoring remain strongly under represented in central asia it is now a priority to develop and install monitoring schemes to characterise region wide past and present cryosphere changes coupled to high alpine meteorological observations at high temporal and spatial resolution for central asia despite the differences in the published decadal mass losses most of the studies highlight a complex and heterogeneous response through central asia e g 44 99 101 103 114 brun et al 115 showed that morphological variables explain only a limited fraction of the mass balance variability 8 for the pamir 20 for the pamir alay and 36 for the tien shan many glaciers of the study area are heavily debris covered in their ablation areas and debris thickness varies considerably 116 the interaction with mass balance remains however poorly understood 115 furthermore both the tien shan and pamir are known to host numerous surge type glaciers 117 119 biasing the glacier response to climate despite dehecq et al 120 showed that the flow velocities of glaciers in central asia correlate well with the decadal glacier mass change for the period 2000 2016 pronounced variations of the meteorological settings throughout the region might principally be responsible for high local variability and distinct spatial pattern of glacier responses 20 47 the variable climate conditions in central asia 121 122 are reflected in the heterogeneous accumulation and ablation regimes mass balance gradients 11 47 and mass balance sensitivities 123 sakai and fujita 124 showed that climatic settings represented by the three factors summer temperature temperature range and summer precipitation ratio explain up to 60 of the spatially contrasting glacier response in high mountain asia despite the strong local differences in glacier response detailed assessments with a focus on central asia remain so far limited the scarcity of reliable and appropriate glaciological datasets as well as the heterogeneity of both their spatial and temporal extent for the tien shan and pamir hamper sound synthesis to a regional picture on annual to seasonal time scales 3 42 43 remote sensing has become very popular to shed light into unobserved passed glacier changes it is a powerful tool to study inaccessible glaciers from space however mass change assessments are yet limited to intervals of 5 to 10 years geodetic surveys thus do not allow assessing glacier specific annual mass balance variability and detailed runoff contribution changes for the past decades furthermore geodetic height change measurements over accumulation areas relates to strong uncertainties due to the snow density assumptions needed to calculate mass change thus region wide assessments cannot rely solely on geodetic surveys but also need to be combined with other techniques to investigate glacier mass changes at annual to seasonal scale currently the potential to identify climatic and non climatic drivers and the complex process chains and feedbacks interacting with the glacier mass change of the different subregions is limited observational datasets on climatic variables remain significantly unconstrained in central asia due to the scarcity of meteorological stations and their uneven distribution 72 125 126 gridded climate datasets based either on observations reanalysis or remote sensing show severe differences and due to the lack of validation data remain largely unconstrained in terms of precipitation intensities and seasonality 73 125 128 particularly important for future impact studies in central asia are subregional and local catchment based estimates of water availability including sound assessments of glacier mass changes and their corresponding uncertainties by combining in situ observations with remote sensing and numerical models this demands a solid base of observational long term data that is currently incomplete for central asia 5 permafrost the central asian region encompasses the largest area of mountain permafrost in the world it covers 3 5x106 km2 amounting to 15 of the total areal extent of permafrost in the northern hemisphere the regional pattern of permafrost distribution primarily depends on elevation slope and aspect which have a major influence on the energy balance at the ground surface the mountain permafrost distribution depends on various additional parameters such as vegetation debris and snow cover ground surface texture winter air temperature inversion surface and groundwater presence as well as terrain movement e g 129 130 permafrost can be categorized into three zones continuous discontinuous and sporadic table 1 131 the altitudinal distribution of permafrost is controlled primarily by latitude with approximately 140 m elevation increase of its lower limit per 1 south 131 because of the differences in surface energy balance mainly higher insolation the lower limit of permafrost on south facing slopes is about 400 800 m higher than on north oriented slopes 131 132 permafrost temperature in the tien shan varied from 0 38 c to 0 68 c at depths of 14 25 m during 1974 1977 and has experienced a continuous warming since the 1950 s until present 133 in accordance with interpolation of borehole temperature data the active layer thickness showed an increase from 3 2 to 3 4 m in the 1970 s to a maximum of 5 2 m in 1992 and 5 0 m in 2001 and 2004 the average active layer thickness for all measured sites increased by 23 in comparison to the early 1970 s 133 monitoring of permafrost temperatures in a network of boreholes at the zhosalykezen pass in the ili alatau range since 1974 suggested a warming rate of about 0 01 c yr 1 at the depth of zero annual amplitude zaa 13 17 m while mean annual air temperature maat at the tuyuksu meteorological station increased by 0 02 c yr 1 134 warming of mountain slopes and permafrost has several important implications which may affect communities many kilometers downstream 135 136 creep rates of rock glaciers are likely to increase 137 138 and increased thermally induced slope instabilities are expected potentially leading to various types of mass movements such as debris flows rock avalanches or in the case of ice cored moraine dams glacial lake outburst floods e g 31 129 139 140 furthermore permafrost ground ice in the central asian mountains could also significantly contribute to the hydrological cycle of the region 40 rock glaciers as a clearly visible permafrost landform have been estimated to be especially valuable in terms of ground ice volumes and hydrological importance they are currently the focus of research e g 41 138 141 144 with a relatively high ratio of rock glacier to surface ice in central asia 143 145 their role as a water reservoir may be of great importance it has to be noted that current estimates for permafrost ground ice volumes only consider rock glaciers while ground ice within other permafrost terrain is neglected this may lead to an underestimation of the real values 145 146 furthermore permafrost responds more slowly to climate change due to the insulating effect of the overlying active layer together with ventilation effects which facilitate cooling of the ground 147 148 permafrost based water resources are therefore likely to be available on a longer time scale and may buffer water resource losses from surface ice 143 149 however it has to be stressed that permafrost distribution in central asia 15 129 and even more so ground ice volumes contained in permafrost terrain are currently very uncertain thus the estimates available today could change substantially once more data becomes available 144 146 moreover assessing the contribution of permafrost ground ice to the hydrological cycle of a region remains challenging permafrost can influence the runoff regime in different ways it may act as a water barrier during spring summer snow melt and speed up the runoff process by providing surface and near surface flow paths above frozen and partially impermeable frozen layers further annually variable amounts of seasonally frozen water from the thawing active layer is released in summer finally a largely unknown amount of water can be released by degradation of permafrost ground ice especially in ice rich permafrost forms such as rock glaciers rogger et al 150 suggest that during degradation of permafrost in an alpine catchment downstream runoff may be increased by up to 19 however the importance of rock glaciers to the total runoff is still object of discussion in the literature 141 146 151 a better understanding of permafrost degradation processes has yet to be established and quantified at different spatial and temporal scales 150 in ca in particular baseline data and in situ observations on permafrost is extremely scarce and thus very little progress has been made on quantifying changes of permafrost under climate change 3 it is however crucial to improve our knowledge on permafrost distribution thermal regime and its temporal evolution as well as ground ice contents in order to improve model estimates for decision making and implementation of disaster risk reduction and water resource management measures in central asia 6 implications of changes in the cryosphere on water security as highlighted above the central asian cryosphere is undergoing substantial changes driven by atmospheric warming this may have profound consequences on water availability for the region in near future particularly under higher emission scenarios fig 4 the dry summer months in central asia correspond to peak vegetation season and hence water demand snow and ice melt provide release of water resources during this time 143 145 149 152 particularly glacier melt becomes a vital buffer for fresh water during droughts 19 20 55 153 unlike seasonal snow cover that fluctuates annually glaciers delay the passage of water through the hydrological system pritchard 153 showed that glaciers in aral and chu issyk kul basins produce meltwater net 7 5 1 7 km3 on an average year which is equivalent to ten months of municipal and industrial demand for afghanistan tajikistan turkmenistan uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan or the absolute scarcity needs of 45 10 million people over half of the population for four months a reduction of solid precipitation in future will influence mainly spring and early summer runoff changes in the seasonality of the snowpack e g earlier melt out can have severe impacts on runoff regimes particularly in unregulated watersheds 154 atmospheric warming will lead to higher glacier melt rates and will increase runoff until the so called peak water is reached 155 beyond this point melt water runoff will decrease as glacier mass diminishes beyond a certain threshold fig 4 glacier melt water contribution in central asia will reach its peak in the next few decades 156 157 huss and hock 40 showed that changes in glacier melt contribution to total river runoff affects the major central asian river basins severely with an expected decrease of over 25 in the next century besides the reduced freshwater availability the seasonality of river discharge will change 51 82 158 160 expected changes in the magnitude and seasonality can provoke water shortage and unexpectedly high meltwater releases leading to flooding fig 4 however to understand the full picture of the regional river runoff changes full hydrological modelling that includes processes related to i e ground water precipitation evaporation and permafrost is crucial such modelling however needs to rely on spatially and temporally high resolved monitoring of the main water storage bodies and meteorological variables in high alpine environments of central asia and hence is therefore often not straightforward the uncertainty of water availability in the context of a changing climate creates a major potential for political tensions and builds a complex set of future threats affecting different domains such as water management energy production and irrigation 161 164 currently central asian countries are among the highest per capita users of water in the world and 90 of the region s water is used for irrigation 164 165 while agricultural share of gross domestic product gdp in central asia has almost halved since the disintegration of the soviet union 166 changes in water supply in combination with rapidly growing and industrialising economies lead to an increased risk of water scarcity in the region in addition the complex geopolitical setting of transboundary water systems and energy flows provide increased potential for conflicts driven by reduced resources 167 169 complex allocation trade offs exist in the region 168 the energy poor yet water rich upstream countries kyrgyzstan and tajikistan use water for hydropower production in the winter 162 conversely the downstream states uzbekistan turkmenistan and kazakhstan have a high water demand in the summer irrigation season 154 170 171 in response to energy needs and perceived future water shortages upstream countries have been investing heavily in hydropower schemes hpp which generate power and balance water availability reservoir construction will undoubtedly form a large part of regional climate change mitigation strategies 172 in order to address changes in future water availability however these projects need to be implemented in a coordinated fashion in order to avoid increased regional tensions 163 on the other hand the economic return on water is lower in central asia than anywhere else on the planet therefore it is evident that primary focus of the central asia countries should be on curbing excessive water demand and expanding other sectors of economy 164 detailed scientific knowledge on past and present changes particularly at high temporal and spatial resolution is vital to implement comprehensive adaptation and mitigation measures for sustainable water management currently most of the water availability forecasting schemes in central asia are based on extremely sparse datasets and do often not account for climate change in the soviet era a threshold equal to runoff for the average dry year e g 80 of the average annual runoff for the water demand for irrigation was determined 173 this scheme is still being enforced today poor water accounting and decay of infrastructure the system becomes even more inefficient this is further exacerbated by changing runoff due to degrading cryosphere especially after the peak water will be passed yet they are used as a basis for national and international allocation discussions e g interstate commission for water coordination of central asia interstate commission for water coordination of central asia http www icwc aral uz icwc bulletins htm scarcity of reliable and appropriate meteorological and glaciological datasets hampers a sound synthesis of a regional picture 42 remote sensing techniques are suitable to study remote and unmeasured areas on a cost effective basis and can partly bridge the aforementioned deficit in data availability e g 102 114 115 174 however the discrepancy and disagreement between region wide surveys e g 98 102 103 as well as the coarse temporal resolution accentuate the indispensable need for i improved and extended ground measurements including deeper boreholes in permafrost areas ii enhanced methods to observe glacier mass changes at regional scales on high spatio temporal resolution and iii for more process based research 7 future directions and initiatives to improve cryosphere monitoring in central asia a new glacier monitoring network has been re established since 2010 fig 5 and helped to rebuild a scientific community focusing on cryosphere sciences as part of the international climate observation strategy developed by gcos long term mass balance time series for four glaciers in kyrgyzstan were re analysed and reconstructed as far back as to the last century fig 5 108 113 175 176 recent in situ data suggest a mean mass loss of 0 3 m w e yr 1 for abramov from 2012 to 2018 and for golubin from 2011 to 2018 data averaged for hydrological year 39 these values are of the same order of magnitude as reconstructed mass balance time series for the past decades of 0 26 m w e yr 1 for abramov 1998 2016 and 0 4 m w e yr 1 golubin 2000 2016 109 despite a sharp increase of mass loss for golubin since the onset of the 20th century the above summarised results show neither signs of an accelerating mass loss during the second half of the 20th century nor clear positive trends in recent years for both golubin and abramov additional long term glacier monitoring programmes in the tien shan were re initiated for e g barkrak middle batysh sook no 354 fig 1 the modern glaciological measurements revealed mass losses ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 0 2 m w e yr 1 2011 2018 data for hydrological year 39 and for barkrak middle from 2017 reconstructed mass balance time series for these glaciers confirmed the negative signal of 0 3 to 0 4 0 3 m w e yr 1 for the last decades 175 176 for the eastern and western pamir barely any in situ observations are available so far 38 and a first long term monitoring programme for the western pamir was only just initiated at zulmart and yakarcha glacier in 2018 and 2019 respectively 3 despite the successful re establishment of glacier monitoring at selected sites figs 1 and 5 complete cryosphere monitoring especially for snow and permafrost remains strongly under represented in central asia within the projects cawa 177 and catcos cicada 38 meteorological variables and ground temperatures were measured at two high altitude automatic weather stations aws in kyrgyzstan since 2011 2013 127 both are located nearby a glacier abramov and golubin and part of the worldwide long term monitoring network gtn g global terrestrial network on glaciers 38 at the abramov station the ground temperatures closely follow the air temperatures even during the winter months fig 6 this indicates absent or thin snow cover at the sensor location most likely due to strong winds precipitation is recorded mainly during spring and summer due to missing corrections of undercatch measured values are substantially lower than annual precipitation sums in historical data recorded at a nearby location 178 the observed ground temperature trend at 0 1 m depth correlates well with the air temperature trend of around 0 12 c yr 1 for 2011 2019 this is much higher than that estimated by marchenko et al 133 and may either be a result of the relatively short measuring period or an indication for stronger warming in recent years for a sound comparison of different datasets and periods long term measurements are indispensable the meteorological and ground measurements presented here show a first step to such long term time series that need to be connected to legacy measurements of the past the re established monitoring networks in central asia provide a base for a first comparison and shows the importance of their continuation we found an annual thermal offset between air temperature and ground temperature at 0 1 m depth ranges between 2 5 c and 4 5 c not shown these values are similar to observations made in the swiss alps 179 the ground freezing gfi and thawing index thi i e the sum of all daily negative respectively positive temperatures measured during one hydrological year showed relatively low annual variabilities fig 7 compared to most of the sites included in permos the indices calculated for the abramov site are considerably lower 179 the permafrost thickness under current conditions using a simple approach according to williams and smith 130 is estimated to be 70 100 m however permafrost temperatures most likely are not in equilibrium with the present day climate and therefore the actual permafrost thickness might be underestimated however to date the time series are still short and other in situ observations on permafrost are scarce the continuation and expansion of these measurements are of high priority for the local communities that are potentially affected by the effects of permafrost degradation uncertainties in quantifying snow based water resources may be addressed by emerging next generation methods that combine physically based models and data assimilation schemes to constrain prognostic variables such as swe 180 182 which will likely help us to narrow down recent climate change impacts and therefore also debias climate models for improved climate impact projections fig 8 recent advances from the european space agency sentinel missions have allowed the retrieval of snow depth at reasonably high resolution of 1 km in mountains fig 9 183 airborne photogrammetric methods e g 184 can provide cm scale snow depth maps over large remote areas at reasonably cost and therefore likely an appropriate technology for mountains of central asia particularly set within a data assimilation framework in combination with improved earth observation and modelling approaches increased in situ observational networks are critical particularly in poorly sampled high elevation regions where the bulk of snowpack mass balance is stored programmes such as the world meteorological organisation s global cryosphere watch aim to promote this effort particularly in harnessing science led observation and monitoring networks 8 conclusion a new glacier monitoring network has been re established since 2010 strong efforts focused on the generation of new human capacities related to the corresponding research areas despite the successful re establishment of glacier monitoring complete cryosphere monitoring remains strongly under represented in central asia particularly there is still a lack of in situ data of the other two cryospheric variables snow and permafrost yet conclusions on observed changes and their impacts on water availability remain subject of large uncertainties it is now a priority to develop and install monitoring schemes to characterise region wide past and present cryosphere processes and associated runoff changes at high temporal and spatial resolution for central asia which can be used for improved water management however this demands a universal strategy by combining in situ observations numerical modelling and remote sensing to reduce the currently existing uncertainties these actions should have highest priority and should be combined with strong efforts in convincing the corresponding stakeholders to support these monitoring systems by strengthening the current fragile equilibrium between cooperation partners finally this will allow generating long term and sustainable cryospheric networks credit authorship contribution statement martina barandun

20135,snow glaciers and permafrost translate fluctuations of atmospheric conditions and highlight current environmental changes monitoring of these changes is one of the major objectives of the international climate observation strategy developed by the global climate observing system gcos under ongoing climate change the implication of altering meltwater released by snow ice and permafrost will become increasingly relevant for the fragile mountain and lowland environments of central asia these changes will affect the livelihood particularly for mountain communities but also for the highly populated regions downstream a degrading cryosphere may cause drastic ecological changes and endanger water food and health security leading to pronounced political instabilities and changing socio hydrological interactions for successful mitigation the adaptation capacity has to be enforced by first creating basic observational datasets on the state and changes of the cryosphere and secondly by providing well calibrated models in connection with climate scenario output this information is a pre condition to reduce on mid to long term the vulnerability of the local population so far significant data gaps of in situ measurements in central asia mainly from the mid 1990 s to around 2010 impeded sound interpretations of long term trends in the cryosphere however the progress made on glacier observation and capacity building in recent years promises a future perspective for monitoring including snow and permafrost this paper summarizes the current knowledge on the state of three essential climate variables ecv of the central asian cryosphere snow glaciers and permafrost in a context of future water security it highlights the challenges for cryosphere assessments in the region and discusses ongoing monitoring efforts future directions and emerging approaches which might address current shortcomings of today s monitoring network 1 relevance of the cryosphere for water availability the changing cryosphere has become an icon for climate warming 1 changes of snow glaciers and permafrost translate the fluctuations of atmospheric conditions and highlight current environmental changes 2 during the past decades such changes have strongly affected the major central asian mountain ranges tien shan and pamir 3 these form the north western margin of high mountain asia hma fig 1 hosting 25 000 glaciers maximum snow cover can exceed 80 of the mountainous terrain and up to 32 of the lowlands 4 permafrost contains highly variable amounts of ice depending on the substrate e g rock glacier bedrock fine material etc a rock glacier can contain ice contents between 10 and 90 vol whereas massive bedrock has in general very low ice contents the different landforms of permafrost are found in the central asian highlands but have so far not been quantified ice and snowmelt are principal water resources for the highly populated lowlands of central asia e g 5 7 and have a crucial role for mountain communities 8 10 especially where irrigation is a general practise continuous socio hydrological interactions establish 8 snow accumulation acts as a water reservoir mainly during winter months controlling river runoff in spring and early summer with increasing summer precipitation towards the east summer snowfall is frequent 11 12 snow strongly influences the temperature regime in the ground and therewith permafrost distribution 13 15 furthermore fresh snow increases the albedo and hence provokes a significant reduction of glacier melt 16 18 glaciers and permafrost release most of their melt water during july to september during dry and hot periods glacier melt is a vital fresh water source 19 20 so far it is unknown how much permafrost melt contributes to the total river runoff changes in the cryosphere have implications on the occurrence of natural hazards 21 hazards associated with glacier or permafrost degradation are expected to become more frequent and stronger in magnitude with the ongoing climate warming 22 24 associated processes could reach densely populated areas might be transboundary and cause numerous victims i e 25 27 increasing rates of glacier lake expansion from 0 8 yr 1 28 to 3 yr 1 were observed for both the tien shan and pamir 24 29 however no evidence of an increase in glacier lake outburst floods since 1970 ies could be observed 30 but is expected for catchments with large high altitude glaciers in the future 31 33 the slow degradation of permafrost may lead to large rock falls this creates the potential of strong cascading events which include processes such as overtopping and lake dam breeches provoking large debris flows 34 35 long term monitoring of the cryosphere enables an improved understanding on the controlling processes driving its response to changing climate and on hazard potential 36 39 in addition it helps to better quantify the associated changes in meltwater release e g 40 despite the significance and our current knowledge of the cryosphere at a global level the heterogeneous response of snow ice and permafrost in central asia remains poorly understood half a decade ago the imminent need of improving the knowledge about spatio temporal changes in the water cycle of central asian headwaters was highlighted 41 43 in this study we provide a review of recent research concerning the state change and impact of the central asian cryosphere for the past decade 2 the central asian cryosphere under a changing climate the climate of central asia is formed at the boundary between temperate and subtropical climate zones and is characterised by an extreme continentality and strong topographical effects cold inflows of northerly and north westerly direction and moist air masses from the western atlantic region are influencing the western and north western flat plains of central asia in the south and east the mountain ranges of the himalayan pamir hindukush and tien shan almost completely isolate central asia from moist air masses from the indian ocean 45 due to such barrier effects arid and cold conditions dominate in the eastern part of both the tien shan 11 and pamir 20 46 47 with precipitation maxima towards the summer 48 a pronounced west to east gradient in seasonal precipitation distribution for the tien shan 11 and the pamir 47 produces regionally variable snow cover accumulation and ablation regimes glacier mass balance gradients and permafrost distribution for the tien shan a consistent air temperature increase of about 0 1 to 0 2 c per decade with more pronounced warming in the winter months was recorded during 1960 2007 49 51 this was accompanied by an increase of total annual precipitation while the share of solid precipitation decreased due to warming 42 43 52 these trends are still ongoing based on data from meteorological stations near golubin glacier and near glacier no 354 where significant may september warming was observed until 2018 there are no significant trends in annual to seasonal precipitation changes the changes are non uniform across the region with a strong inter annual variability 12 51 53 for the pamir pohl et al 20 detected a temperature increase of 0 07 to 0 11 c yr 1 and likewise no precipitation trend during the last decades knoche et al 54 highlighted the heterogeneity in solid precipitation evolution and found declining summer temperatures along with increasing annual precipitation amounts for the northern pamir unger shayesteh et al 42 emphasized a shift in the timing of the onset of the melt season towards the earlier spring due to warmer spring temperatures aizen et al 55 reported a reduction of the maximum snow thickness and snow cover duration by 0 1 m and 9 days over the tien shan from 1940 to 1991 however certain regions in the eastern tien shan and pamir tended to have increased average snow cover duration due to altered snow fall patterns and precipitation amounts that counterbalance the effect of air temperature increase 41 56 this has been confirmed through recent monitoring of the meteorological variables and glacier mass balances at abramov glacier 38 3 snow seasonal snow cover forms a major part of the annual water budget in central asia with estimates of snow water equivalent contribution of over 50 for the main basins 38 armstrong et al 57 found seasonal snow contributions as high as 65 72 of mean annual runoff in the amu darya and sry darya basins using remote sensing and degree day melt modelling this contrasts to 23 contribution of rainfall and 2 8 from glacier ice to the annual runoff 41 58 typically annual glacier melt contribution is about 6 for syr daria and 20 for amu darya 35 it is however much larger during the melting season and can reach up to 1 5 to 3 times the mean annual input 41 in an earlier study aizen et al 58 also found snowmelt to be a dominant contributor to annual runoff throughout the tien shan based on long term hydrological records of the former ussr albeit lower at around 30 most studies on recent climate impacts on snow cover in central asia have focused on optical satellites to quantify snow cover extent sce for example zhou et al 59 used a combined avhrr and modis dataset of sce to assess changes in snow cover days and found significant decreases in number of snow on ground days for central asia from 1986 to 2008 however results from a study covering the period 1986 2008 using passive microwave data mankin et al 60 showed reduced snow cover duration and maximum snow depths in western and eastern parts of the tien shan whereas increased snow depth in central tien shan which was attributed to an increase in winter precipitation mankin et al 60 investigated the sensitivity of global river basins to changes in snow supply under climate change projections they found a high risk that snowmelt will no longer meet summer demand by mid century in central asian basins increasing glacial runoff will possibly buffer decreasing snowpacks until mid century when peak water is expected in many areas of central asia 40 61 the second half of the century will then likely see decreasing runoff as both snow and glacial components will diminish the ability of black carbon bc and other aerosols to change the surface energy balance of snowpacks is of growing interest in the light of anthropogenic climate change with many growing industrial centres close to the tien shan and pamir bc is increasingly being deposited in seasonal snowpacks 62 deposited bc reduces the surface albedo and therefore increase radiative forcing and can increase melt rates significantly 62 63 the impacts of climate change on snow cover is driven by the interplay of accumulation precipitation and its rain snow partitioning and ablation air temperature radiation high elevation regions that are less sensitive to temperature increases and shifts in rain snow partitioning will possibly see increased snowpacks e g 64 as for example has been attributed to the so called and arguably misnamed cf 65 karakoram anomaly particularly over northern regions of central asia and north eastern tibetan plateau where precipitation increases are projected under cmip5 simulations e g 66 67 however projected temperature increases will likely change the seasonality of snowmelt and reduce lower elevation snow cover 67 our knowledge of snow cover magnitudes dynamics and climate norms in the region is still very limited due to remote terrain few in situ observations and often poor performance of models during the soviet era field measurements of snow depth and density were routinely made fig 2 however most recent studies have tended to focus on the parameter snow cover extent which can be robustly observed by optical satellite sensors over large regions e g 68 however this only tells half the story the other key parameters are snow water equivalent swe and temporal behaviour of accumulation and melt estimating swe remains one of the great challenges in snow hydrology 69 largely due to the challenge of quantifying solid precipitation particularly at high altitude cf 70 in general high altitude precipitation regimes of central asia remain significantly unconstrained 71 in situ observations are scarce and often highly uncertain due to undercatch particularly at high elevations which produces high uncertainties in observation based datasets e g cru gpcc etc combined remote sensing methods e g trmm chirps etc strongly underestimate solid precipitation and coarse grid scales lead to uncertainties in complex terrain pure modelling approaches such as era5 reanalysis from the european centre medium range weather forecasts in which precipitation is prognostic and not assimilated have also been shown to have large biases over hma 72 the uncertainties inherent in these different products are highlighted by the spatially and temporally heterogeneous trends 73 future directions and emerging approaches which may address these challenges are further discussed in section 7 4 glaciers the tien shan hosts almost 15 000 glaciers covering a surface area of around 12 300 km2 74 the pamir contains over 13 000 glaciers that cover an area of approximately 12 000 km2 75 for the pamir median glacier elevation follows a gradient from west 3800 m a s l to east 5000 m a s l for the tien shan median glacier elevations range from 3700 to 4200 m a s l and are highest in the central part 74 most glaciers in both mountain ranges in central asia are so called polythermal glaciers polythermal glaciers contain cold ice but include also large volumes that are temperate at the melting point most commonly in dry and cold climates small and non dynamic glaciers have cold ice in the ablation area or at least in a surface layer with tens of meters of thickness at lower altitudes in contrary cold firn and ice in accumulation areas are only found at higher elevations around 5000 m a s l 185 186 these areas are going to play an important role in the near future because the additional energy input from atmospheric warming is not transformed directly into increased and accelerated melting but rather into a rise in the firn and ice temperatures by the release of latent heat through refreezing in general the observations of firn and ice temperatures are very reliable climate indicators and the impacts of a change from cold to temperate firn ice in the accumulation zones is directly reflected in an increase of mass loss for larger high altitude glaciers 46 past and recent measurements on selected sites in central asia highlight the occurrence of both cold ice in the ablation and accumulation zones recent ice temperature measurements at the tongue of batysh sook glacier a very small glacier 2 km2 showed temperatures below zero degrees approx ranging from 5 to 7 c at 10 to 16 m depth from a 90 m deep borehole at the accumulation area of gregoriev glacier thompson et al 76 measured very low accumulation rates of around 0 3 m w e a 1 during the period of 1961 1990 and negative temperatures throughout the whole borehole profile the authors reported a minimum temperature of close to 4 c at the bottom of the borehole at the same site kronenberg et al 77 confirmed similar accumulation rates for the period 1986 2017 however the englacial temperature measurements in a depth of 15 m corresponding to the zero annual amplitude zaa had considerably increased from 3 c 76 to 1 5 c 77 from 1990 to 2018 however kronenberg et al 78 found that for abramov glacier at an altitude of around 4400 m a s l in the pamir alay the accumulation sites were found to be temperate they showed that the firn stratigraphy has however not changed importantly farinotti et al 79 calculated a total glacier ice volume of 3 27 0 85 103 km3 for central asia the study showed that hma the area with one of the largest ice volumes outside the polar regions hosts about 27 less glacier ice than previously suggested only a few measurements of individual glacier thicknesses are available for central asia e g 80 83 however data on glacier thickness distribution internal ice and firn structure and their change remain sparse in central asia data on glacier covered area are still incomplete and heterogeneous 75 more accurate glacier inventories appeared in the last years e g 75 84 comparison with previous datasets is however not straightforward several studies using consistent data reported on heterogeneous area change e g 85 89 in four catchments in the pamir alay area reduction rates decreased from 0 46 yr 1 in 1957 1980 to 0 27 yr 1 in 1980 2001 90 for the tien shan narama et al 91 reported an increase of area loss rates from 0 4 yr 1 to 0 57 yr 1 for at bashy central tien shan and from 0 63 yr 1 to 0 71 yr 1 for pskem western tien shan but a decrease from 0 33 yr 1 to 0 yr 1 for the fergana range from 1970 to 2000 to 2000 2007 for the ak shyrak massif central tien shan area loss rates increased from 0 12 yr 1 for 1943 1977 to 0 33 yr 1 for 1977 2003 92 and to 0 59 0 34 yr 1 for 2003 2013 93 these rates further accelerated up to 0 93 0 61 yr 1 from 2013 to 2018 with a significant negative correlation with glacier size during ussr most glacier mass balance monitoring sites were established in mid 1950 s 94 95 the majority of the observation programmes stopped during the early 1990 s today only one continuous series exist tuyuksu glacier kazakhstan for tuyuksu a mass balance of 0 4 m w e yr 1 was reported from 1957 to 2018 39 urumqi glacier in the east tien shan has a relatively complete record since 1980 s with a reconstructed period back to the late 1950 s a similar mass loss of 0 4 m w e yr 1 was reported from 1957 to 2017 39 efforts to re establish in situ glacier observations have started since 2010 38 such datasets however are limited to a few selected well accessible glaciers but are of great importance to validate modelling studies and regional assessments current results directions and monitoring strategies are further discussed in section 7 zemp et al 96 and wouters et al 97 suggested a mass loss of 0 15 0 12 m w e yr 1 from 2006 to 2016 and of 0 06 0 09 m w e yr 1 from 2002 to 2016 for central asia respectively most other studies distinguish between pamir and tien shan published mass change assessments for the pamir are inconsistent fig 3 a unfortunately increasing the uncertainty of the understanding on the ongoing glacier changes in the region 98 103 similar discrepancies prevail also on more localized catchment scale for muztagh ata holzer et al 104 provided almost balanced conditions of 0 01 0 30 m w e yr 1 for 1973 to 2013 barandun et al 44 found substantial mass loss of 0 68 0 32 m w e yr 1 from 2000 to 2018 while uncertainties connected to both methods are high for the central pamir barandun et al 44 modelled stable conditions of 0 04 0 32 m w e yr 1 from 2000 to 2018 that agree well with the mass balance of 0 06 0 68 m w e yr 1 for the karakul catchment from 2000 to 2010 found by holzer et al 105 zhou et al 106 found a balanced mass change for fedchenko glacier of 0 03 0 24 m w e yr 1 from 1974 to 1999 whereas lambrecht et al 107 highlighted a strong imbalance for the same glacier in recent years with an increase of mass loss from 0 27 0 05 m w e yr 1 to 0 51 0 04 m w e yr 1 for 2000 2011 and 2011 to 2018 respectively an assimilation of historical modern and reconstructed data for abramov revealed a mass loss of approximately 0 4 m w e yr 1 from 1968 to 2018 108 109 and a geodetic survey based on historical aerial photography provided similar results of approximately 0 4 m w e yr 1 from 1975 to 2015 110 for the tien shan better agreement between region wide e g 44 99 100 and on subregion catchment scale with farinotti et al 103 and bolch 83 was found fig 3b gardner et al 101 published a somewhat more negative regional mass loss from 2000 to 2009 as well as pieczonka and bolch 111 and goerlich et al 112 on catchment scale for the second half of the 20th century a combination of modern glaciological observations reconstruction and reanalysis of legacy data for golubin located in the northern western tien shan indicated an increase of mass loss from 0 1 m w e yr 1 for 1927 1972 to 0 3 m w e yr 1 for 1972 2016 113 the aforementioned differences in literature might relate to i important methodological differences ii different study periods and iii inconsistent region division inherent differences of the methodology individual studies relate to the uncertainty of each technique and were believed not to exceed the error bars provided by the individual studies inconsistent time periods make straightforward comparison difficult typically studies including the early years of the 21st century revealed often less negative values 98 100 than studies focusing on periods after 2004 101 103 using the annual time series barandun et al 44 identified clearly less negative mass balances at the beginning of the study period prior 2005 this might explain part of the tendency to provide more negative results when focusing on the period 2003 to 2009 i e icesat based inconsistent perimeter of the study regions can explain an additional fraction of the encountered differences in the results due to heterogeneous glacier responses within the individual subregions validation datasets from complete cryosphere monitoring remain strongly under represented in central asia it is now a priority to develop and install monitoring schemes to characterise region wide past and present cryosphere changes coupled to high alpine meteorological observations at high temporal and spatial resolution for central asia despite the differences in the published decadal mass losses most of the studies highlight a complex and heterogeneous response through central asia e g 44 99 101 103 114 brun et al 115 showed that morphological variables explain only a limited fraction of the mass balance variability 8 for the pamir 20 for the pamir alay and 36 for the tien shan many glaciers of the study area are heavily debris covered in their ablation areas and debris thickness varies considerably 116 the interaction with mass balance remains however poorly understood 115 furthermore both the tien shan and pamir are known to host numerous surge type glaciers 117 119 biasing the glacier response to climate despite dehecq et al 120 showed that the flow velocities of glaciers in central asia correlate well with the decadal glacier mass change for the period 2000 2016 pronounced variations of the meteorological settings throughout the region might principally be responsible for high local variability and distinct spatial pattern of glacier responses 20 47 the variable climate conditions in central asia 121 122 are reflected in the heterogeneous accumulation and ablation regimes mass balance gradients 11 47 and mass balance sensitivities 123 sakai and fujita 124 showed that climatic settings represented by the three factors summer temperature temperature range and summer precipitation ratio explain up to 60 of the spatially contrasting glacier response in high mountain asia despite the strong local differences in glacier response detailed assessments with a focus on central asia remain so far limited the scarcity of reliable and appropriate glaciological datasets as well as the heterogeneity of both their spatial and temporal extent for the tien shan and pamir hamper sound synthesis to a regional picture on annual to seasonal time scales 3 42 43 remote sensing has become very popular to shed light into unobserved passed glacier changes it is a powerful tool to study inaccessible glaciers from space however mass change assessments are yet limited to intervals of 5 to 10 years geodetic surveys thus do not allow assessing glacier specific annual mass balance variability and detailed runoff contribution changes for the past decades furthermore geodetic height change measurements over accumulation areas relates to strong uncertainties due to the snow density assumptions needed to calculate mass change thus region wide assessments cannot rely solely on geodetic surveys but also need to be combined with other techniques to investigate glacier mass changes at annual to seasonal scale currently the potential to identify climatic and non climatic drivers and the complex process chains and feedbacks interacting with the glacier mass change of the different subregions is limited observational datasets on climatic variables remain significantly unconstrained in central asia due to the scarcity of meteorological stations and their uneven distribution 72 125 126 gridded climate datasets based either on observations reanalysis or remote sensing show severe differences and due to the lack of validation data remain largely unconstrained in terms of precipitation intensities and seasonality 73 125 128 particularly important for future impact studies in central asia are subregional and local catchment based estimates of water availability including sound assessments of glacier mass changes and their corresponding uncertainties by combining in situ observations with remote sensing and numerical models this demands a solid base of observational long term data that is currently incomplete for central asia 5 permafrost the central asian region encompasses the largest area of mountain permafrost in the world it covers 3 5x106 km2 amounting to 15 of the total areal extent of permafrost in the northern hemisphere the regional pattern of permafrost distribution primarily depends on elevation slope and aspect which have a major influence on the energy balance at the ground surface the mountain permafrost distribution depends on various additional parameters such as vegetation debris and snow cover ground surface texture winter air temperature inversion surface and groundwater presence as well as terrain movement e g 129 130 permafrost can be categorized into three zones continuous discontinuous and sporadic table 1 131 the altitudinal distribution of permafrost is controlled primarily by latitude with approximately 140 m elevation increase of its lower limit per 1 south 131 because of the differences in surface energy balance mainly higher insolation the lower limit of permafrost on south facing slopes is about 400 800 m higher than on north oriented slopes 131 132 permafrost temperature in the tien shan varied from 0 38 c to 0 68 c at depths of 14 25 m during 1974 1977 and has experienced a continuous warming since the 1950 s until present 133 in accordance with interpolation of borehole temperature data the active layer thickness showed an increase from 3 2 to 3 4 m in the 1970 s to a maximum of 5 2 m in 1992 and 5 0 m in 2001 and 2004 the average active layer thickness for all measured sites increased by 23 in comparison to the early 1970 s 133 monitoring of permafrost temperatures in a network of boreholes at the zhosalykezen pass in the ili alatau range since 1974 suggested a warming rate of about 0 01 c yr 1 at the depth of zero annual amplitude zaa 13 17 m while mean annual air temperature maat at the tuyuksu meteorological station increased by 0 02 c yr 1 134 warming of mountain slopes and permafrost has several important implications which may affect communities many kilometers downstream 135 136 creep rates of rock glaciers are likely to increase 137 138 and increased thermally induced slope instabilities are expected potentially leading to various types of mass movements such as debris flows rock avalanches or in the case of ice cored moraine dams glacial lake outburst floods e g 31 129 139 140 furthermore permafrost ground ice in the central asian mountains could also significantly contribute to the hydrological cycle of the region 40 rock glaciers as a clearly visible permafrost landform have been estimated to be especially valuable in terms of ground ice volumes and hydrological importance they are currently the focus of research e g 41 138 141 144 with a relatively high ratio of rock glacier to surface ice in central asia 143 145 their role as a water reservoir may be of great importance it has to be noted that current estimates for permafrost ground ice volumes only consider rock glaciers while ground ice within other permafrost terrain is neglected this may lead to an underestimation of the real values 145 146 furthermore permafrost responds more slowly to climate change due to the insulating effect of the overlying active layer together with ventilation effects which facilitate cooling of the ground 147 148 permafrost based water resources are therefore likely to be available on a longer time scale and may buffer water resource losses from surface ice 143 149 however it has to be stressed that permafrost distribution in central asia 15 129 and even more so ground ice volumes contained in permafrost terrain are currently very uncertain thus the estimates available today could change substantially once more data becomes available 144 146 moreover assessing the contribution of permafrost ground ice to the hydrological cycle of a region remains challenging permafrost can influence the runoff regime in different ways it may act as a water barrier during spring summer snow melt and speed up the runoff process by providing surface and near surface flow paths above frozen and partially impermeable frozen layers further annually variable amounts of seasonally frozen water from the thawing active layer is released in summer finally a largely unknown amount of water can be released by degradation of permafrost ground ice especially in ice rich permafrost forms such as rock glaciers rogger et al 150 suggest that during degradation of permafrost in an alpine catchment downstream runoff may be increased by up to 19 however the importance of rock glaciers to the total runoff is still object of discussion in the literature 141 146 151 a better understanding of permafrost degradation processes has yet to be established and quantified at different spatial and temporal scales 150 in ca in particular baseline data and in situ observations on permafrost is extremely scarce and thus very little progress has been made on quantifying changes of permafrost under climate change 3 it is however crucial to improve our knowledge on permafrost distribution thermal regime and its temporal evolution as well as ground ice contents in order to improve model estimates for decision making and implementation of disaster risk reduction and water resource management measures in central asia 6 implications of changes in the cryosphere on water security as highlighted above the central asian cryosphere is undergoing substantial changes driven by atmospheric warming this may have profound consequences on water availability for the region in near future particularly under higher emission scenarios fig 4 the dry summer months in central asia correspond to peak vegetation season and hence water demand snow and ice melt provide release of water resources during this time 143 145 149 152 particularly glacier melt becomes a vital buffer for fresh water during droughts 19 20 55 153 unlike seasonal snow cover that fluctuates annually glaciers delay the passage of water through the hydrological system pritchard 153 showed that glaciers in aral and chu issyk kul basins produce meltwater net 7 5 1 7 km3 on an average year which is equivalent to ten months of municipal and industrial demand for afghanistan tajikistan turkmenistan uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan or the absolute scarcity needs of 45 10 million people over half of the population for four months a reduction of solid precipitation in future will influence mainly spring and early summer runoff changes in the seasonality of the snowpack e g earlier melt out can have severe impacts on runoff regimes particularly in unregulated watersheds 154 atmospheric warming will lead to higher glacier melt rates and will increase runoff until the so called peak water is reached 155 beyond this point melt water runoff will decrease as glacier mass diminishes beyond a certain threshold fig 4 glacier melt water contribution in central asia will reach its peak in the next few decades 156 157 huss and hock 40 showed that changes in glacier melt contribution to total river runoff affects the major central asian river basins severely with an expected decrease of over 25 in the next century besides the reduced freshwater availability the seasonality of river discharge will change 51 82 158 160 expected changes in the magnitude and seasonality can provoke water shortage and unexpectedly high meltwater releases leading to flooding fig 4 however to understand the full picture of the regional river runoff changes full hydrological modelling that includes processes related to i e ground water precipitation evaporation and permafrost is crucial such modelling however needs to rely on spatially and temporally high resolved monitoring of the main water storage bodies and meteorological variables in high alpine environments of central asia and hence is therefore often not straightforward the uncertainty of water availability in the context of a changing climate creates a major potential for political tensions and builds a complex set of future threats affecting different domains such as water management energy production and irrigation 161 164 currently central asian countries are among the highest per capita users of water in the world and 90 of the region s water is used for irrigation 164 165 while agricultural share of gross domestic product gdp in central asia has almost halved since the disintegration of the soviet union 166 changes in water supply in combination with rapidly growing and industrialising economies lead to an increased risk of water scarcity in the region in addition the complex geopolitical setting of transboundary water systems and energy flows provide increased potential for conflicts driven by reduced resources 167 169 complex allocation trade offs exist in the region 168 the energy poor yet water rich upstream countries kyrgyzstan and tajikistan use water for hydropower production in the winter 162 conversely the downstream states uzbekistan turkmenistan and kazakhstan have a high water demand in the summer irrigation season 154 170 171 in response to energy needs and perceived future water shortages upstream countries have been investing heavily in hydropower schemes hpp which generate power and balance water availability reservoir construction will undoubtedly form a large part of regional climate change mitigation strategies 172 in order to address changes in future water availability however these projects need to be implemented in a coordinated fashion in order to avoid increased regional tensions 163 on the other hand the economic return on water is lower in central asia than anywhere else on the planet therefore it is evident that primary focus of the central asia countries should be on curbing excessive water demand and expanding other sectors of economy 164 detailed scientific knowledge on past and present changes particularly at high temporal and spatial resolution is vital to implement comprehensive adaptation and mitigation measures for sustainable water management currently most of the water availability forecasting schemes in central asia are based on extremely sparse datasets and do often not account for climate change in the soviet era a threshold equal to runoff for the average dry year e g 80 of the average annual runoff for the water demand for irrigation was determined 173 this scheme is still being enforced today poor water accounting and decay of infrastructure the system becomes even more inefficient this is further exacerbated by changing runoff due to degrading cryosphere especially after the peak water will be passed yet they are used as a basis for national and international allocation discussions e g interstate commission for water coordination of central asia interstate commission for water coordination of central asia http www icwc aral uz icwc bulletins htm scarcity of reliable and appropriate meteorological and glaciological datasets hampers a sound synthesis of a regional picture 42 remote sensing techniques are suitable to study remote and unmeasured areas on a cost effective basis and can partly bridge the aforementioned deficit in data availability e g 102 114 115 174 however the discrepancy and disagreement between region wide surveys e g 98 102 103 as well as the coarse temporal resolution accentuate the indispensable need for i improved and extended ground measurements including deeper boreholes in permafrost areas ii enhanced methods to observe glacier mass changes at regional scales on high spatio temporal resolution and iii for more process based research 7 future directions and initiatives to improve cryosphere monitoring in central asia a new glacier monitoring network has been re established since 2010 fig 5 and helped to rebuild a scientific community focusing on cryosphere sciences as part of the international climate observation strategy developed by gcos long term mass balance time series for four glaciers in kyrgyzstan were re analysed and reconstructed as far back as to the last century fig 5 108 113 175 176 recent in situ data suggest a mean mass loss of 0 3 m w e yr 1 for abramov from 2012 to 2018 and for golubin from 2011 to 2018 data averaged for hydrological year 39 these values are of the same order of magnitude as reconstructed mass balance time series for the past decades of 0 26 m w e yr 1 for abramov 1998 2016 and 0 4 m w e yr 1 golubin 2000 2016 109 despite a sharp increase of mass loss for golubin since the onset of the 20th century the above summarised results show neither signs of an accelerating mass loss during the second half of the 20th century nor clear positive trends in recent years for both golubin and abramov additional long term glacier monitoring programmes in the tien shan were re initiated for e g barkrak middle batysh sook no 354 fig 1 the modern glaciological measurements revealed mass losses ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 0 2 m w e yr 1 2011 2018 data for hydrological year 39 and for barkrak middle from 2017 reconstructed mass balance time series for these glaciers confirmed the negative signal of 0 3 to 0 4 0 3 m w e yr 1 for the last decades 175 176 for the eastern and western pamir barely any in situ observations are available so far 38 and a first long term monitoring programme for the western pamir was only just initiated at zulmart and yakarcha glacier in 2018 and 2019 respectively 3 despite the successful re establishment of glacier monitoring at selected sites figs 1 and 5 complete cryosphere monitoring especially for snow and permafrost remains strongly under represented in central asia within the projects cawa 177 and catcos cicada 38 meteorological variables and ground temperatures were measured at two high altitude automatic weather stations aws in kyrgyzstan since 2011 2013 127 both are located nearby a glacier abramov and golubin and part of the worldwide long term monitoring network gtn g global terrestrial network on glaciers 38 at the abramov station the ground temperatures closely follow the air temperatures even during the winter months fig 6 this indicates absent or thin snow cover at the sensor location most likely due to strong winds precipitation is recorded mainly during spring and summer due to missing corrections of undercatch measured values are substantially lower than annual precipitation sums in historical data recorded at a nearby location 178 the observed ground temperature trend at 0 1 m depth correlates well with the air temperature trend of around 0 12 c yr 1 for 2011 2019 this is much higher than that estimated by marchenko et al 133 and may either be a result of the relatively short measuring period or an indication for stronger warming in recent years for a sound comparison of different datasets and periods long term measurements are indispensable the meteorological and ground measurements presented here show a first step to such long term time series that need to be connected to legacy measurements of the past the re established monitoring networks in central asia provide a base for a first comparison and shows the importance of their continuation we found an annual thermal offset between air temperature and ground temperature at 0 1 m depth ranges between 2 5 c and 4 5 c not shown these values are similar to observations made in the swiss alps 179 the ground freezing gfi and thawing index thi i e the sum of all daily negative respectively positive temperatures measured during one hydrological year showed relatively low annual variabilities fig 7 compared to most of the sites included in permos the indices calculated for the abramov site are considerably lower 179 the permafrost thickness under current conditions using a simple approach according to williams and smith 130 is estimated to be 70 100 m however permafrost temperatures most likely are not in equilibrium with the present day climate and therefore the actual permafrost thickness might be underestimated however to date the time series are still short and other in situ observations on permafrost are scarce the continuation and expansion of these measurements are of high priority for the local communities that are potentially affected by the effects of permafrost degradation uncertainties in quantifying snow based water resources may be addressed by emerging next generation methods that combine physically based models and data assimilation schemes to constrain prognostic variables such as swe 180 182 which will likely help us to narrow down recent climate change impacts and therefore also debias climate models for improved climate impact projections fig 8 recent advances from the european space agency sentinel missions have allowed the retrieval of snow depth at reasonably high resolution of 1 km in mountains fig 9 183 airborne photogrammetric methods e g 184 can provide cm scale snow depth maps over large remote areas at reasonably cost and therefore likely an appropriate technology for mountains of central asia particularly set within a data assimilation framework in combination with improved earth observation and modelling approaches increased in situ observational networks are critical particularly in poorly sampled high elevation regions where the bulk of snowpack mass balance is stored programmes such as the world meteorological organisation s global cryosphere watch aim to promote this effort particularly in harnessing science led observation and monitoring networks 8 conclusion a new glacier monitoring network has been re established since 2010 strong efforts focused on the generation of new human capacities related to the corresponding research areas despite the successful re establishment of glacier monitoring complete cryosphere monitoring remains strongly under represented in central asia particularly there is still a lack of in situ data of the other two cryospheric variables snow and permafrost yet conclusions on observed changes and their impacts on water availability remain subject of large uncertainties it is now a priority to develop and install monitoring schemes to characterise region wide past and present cryosphere processes and associated runoff changes at high temporal and spatial resolution for central asia which can be used for improved water management however this demands a universal strategy by combining in situ observations numerical modelling and remote sensing to reduce the currently existing uncertainties these actions should have highest priority and should be combined with strong efforts in convincing the corresponding stakeholders to support these monitoring systems by strengthening the current fragile equilibrium between cooperation partners finally this will allow generating long term and sustainable cryospheric networks credit authorship contribution statement martina barandun

20136,irrigated agriculture in the aral sea basin asb is commonly known for its high water consumption inefficient water management and dysfunctional irrigation and drainage infrastructure since 1991 six states have been engaged in intensive irrigated agriculture in the aral sea basin asb afghanistan kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan in this region irrigated agriculture is commonly known for its high water consumption inefficient water management and dysfunctional irrigation and drainage infrastructure extensive land degradation e g soil salinization is considered as the main result of mismanagement in the irrigation sector and sustainable solutions are urgently required this study analysed international peer reviewed scientific studies based on satellite remote sensing rs products and methods addressing potential improvements of irrigation water and land management in the asb ways to transfer rs based knowledge into practice were discussed using the example of the online tool wuemoca that was developed from 2015 to 2019 within the german water initiative in central asia cawa for the period 2008 2019 a total of 49 studies contributed knowledge about land use soils and vegetation crop production and use of irrigation water in the asb the use of rs revealed increased diversification of agricultural production spatial temporal patterns of land degradation and effects of varying water availability on cropping intensity modelling of crop yields and evapotranspiration at varying scales i e farm to provincial scale underlined the comparably moderate water productivity in the asb one relevant future research task is to intensively collect in situ data for validation and secondary data and hence to mitigate the situation in particular improved socio ecological and economic information could help to better understand the spatially differing drivers of soil and land degradation eventually this study provides relevant information and data sources for decision making and requirements for better integration of rs based information into practice using online tools like wuemoca keywords remote sensing agricultural monitoring water productivity irrigation aral sea basin central asia wuemoca 1 introduction almost 30 years after the break up of the soviet union su in 1991 and despite remarkable socio economic transformations in the new riparian countries of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan the critical ecological and economic situation in the aral sea basin asb in central asia ca has hardly improved 70 elevated water table associated with secondary soil salinization in irrigated croplands still cause land degradation and land abandonment over extensive areas 75 66 dilapidated irrigation and drainage infrastructure low water use efficiency and reduced agricultural diversification further challenge sustainable agricultural production 44 16 excess freshwater withdrawals from rivers cause upstream downstream disparities and threaten natural ecosystems 53 in comparison to other parts of the world the economic return of water is exceptionally low in the asb 88 for instance to produce one gdp dollar turkmenistan requires three times more water than india at the same time the gdp share of irrigated crop production in the countries of the asb is still immense ranging between 11 and 38 2 17 in densely populated parts of the asb this sector is additionally under pressure because irrigated cropland area has been reduced due to rural population growth and traditional settlement development 27 among others solutions for sustainable land and water management in irrigation agriculture are mandatory to overcome this conflictual situation alternative crops sustainable crop rotation conservation agriculture or increased crop diversification are largely considered by the ca governments to mitigate environmental degradation and to sustain production in the region the same is valid for improved cooperation in the use and distribution of water from transboundary to local levels yet this is especially true if water is to be used more efficiently and the water productivity of plants is to be increased at the same time 53 88 45 however despite some advancements the success and failure of individual measures in the field remain frequently unclear and information for decision makers to adjust measures for the different parts of the irrigation zones in the asb are unavailable decision making towards more sustainable irrigated crop production in the asb requires up to date and robust data as well as access to databases providing agriculturally relevant information a big challenge is the scarce and unstructured agricultural monitoring in the asb as can be observed throughout the entire developing world 80 moreover the credibility of officially available data in the land and water sector of ca has been increasingly called into question 86 according to abdullaev and rakhmatullaev 2 only few databases providing meaningful information to enhance integrated water resource management exist in the region the central asia regional water information base carewib is the only accessible database it was implemented by the scientific information center of the interstate commission for water coordination of ca sic icwc with support from by international partners it is regularly updated http www cawater info net and provides datasets on agriculture but only at the level of provinces and river basins remote sensing rs information has become a complementary data supplier to in situ monitoring networks 80 rs information is accepted as a relevant option to contribute to sustainability in the land and water sector 76 in the context of agricultural monitoring applications numerous environmental variables can be derived from multiple satellite platforms among others these variables relate to the usage of croplands e g the discrimination of crop types 73 soil and vegetation assessments vegetation trend analyses biomass and yield mapping 7 or assessments of water uses 10 12 they were also addressed in numerous scientific studies on agricultural land use in ca as recently underlined by hamidov et al 45 however an overview of rs based results useful for land and water management and adding to a deeper understanding of irrigation agriculture in the asb is missing also none of the above mentioned databases that may be used for land and water management in the irrigation water sector of the asb or ca relies on rs data 2 the present study therefore aims to review scientific publications dealing with the topics of rs based agricultural monitoring applications of i land use ii soil and vegetation status iii crop production and iv irrigation water uses for irrigated cropland in the asb the overarching goal is to elaborate existing results and research gaps and to highlight ready to use applications and datasets for irrigated land and water management in the asb to assess the practical usefulness of rs technology in ca this study addresses a new online tool cf section 8 and discusses options for a better utilization of rs and geoinformation in the region using this example 2 study area the asb covers 1 76 million km2 and is shared by tajikistan 99 of the country area turkmenistan and uzbekistan both 95 kyrgyzstan 59 kazakhstan 13 afghanistan 38 and a small part of iran fig 1 climate in the asb is continental with high daily and seasonal temperature variation high solar radiation and low humidity elevation ranges from 0 m in the western lowlands of turan to 7 500 m a s l in the tian shan and pamir mountains in the east 71 precipitation mainly occurs in the mountainous east where the predominant part of runoff is generated in contrast deserts with low annual precipitation 100 mm 300 mm characterize the flat western part of the asb total renewable water resources of the asb are about 130 km3 per year the majority of this water is piped through a channel network exceeding a length of 300 000 km to irrigate about 9 76 million ha of cropland 41 about 80 reservoirs with an average volume of more than 100 million m3 were constructed for irrigation purposes drainage is an essential component in the irrigation system in the asb total length of drainage systems is approximately 200 000 km including sub surface drainage of about 50 000 km 41 cotton and cereals wheat rice maize and others dominate the irrigated cropping systems in the asb 3 article selection and assignment to sub categories literature search was conducted based on the web of science https www webofknowledge com and scopus https www scopus com databases from 2008 to date only international peer reviewed articles following the isi standards for publication were considered the search was conducted using three terms addressing i remote sensing rs ii countries in the asb and iii keywords that refer to irrigated land use system analysis research on land cover vegetation cover crops land degradation cropland productivity and water use efficiency the search for these terms included title abstract and keywords of a particular article the research papers that emerged from this scheme were manually checked for their potential contribution to this study the results were also cross checked with google scholar https scholar google com initially we identified 92 publications to avoid duplications this number was reduced by subsequent manual screening research studies with a spatial focus located outside the boundaries of the asb were excluded fig 2 a the contextual analysis revealed 49 publications that generated new information for the four categories of interest fig 2b few publications belonged to more than one category for instance approaches to assess water productivity required if the information was not available elsewhere three steps i e crop type discrimination crop yield estimation and modelling evapotranspiration e g 18 the majority of the publications had a focus in the category land use 28 e g the mapping of crop types 22 23 67 26 58 60 62 83 crop type mapping also served as input e g for assessments of irrigation water demand and use another focus was the estimation of cropland area 40 82 68 46 89 that can also be part of land cover land use mapping 51 20 the rest of the studies in this category focus on land abandonment 61 66 cropping intensity 30 65 33 and crop diversity 29 31 study focus in the category soil and vegetation 16 publications was on the use of rs for soil salinity assessments 78 3 4 48 81 and the analysis of land surface dynamics i e time series analysis of land cover vegetation parameters and or other environmental information such as land surface temperature net primary production npp or evapotranspiration et 14 20 15 vegetation development based on rs data was analysed to assess land degradation 35 37 85 38 to monitor cropland phenology 49 and to detect drought hazards 39 the crop production category nine publications included studies on modelling of crop biophysical parameters 43 52 useful for the implementation of yield models modelling of crop yields was the subject of another set of studies 74 67 64 65 18 this category also comprised locust habitat monitoring 72 63 because locust infestation can dramatically decrease crop yields all publications in the category irrigation water use eight publications focused on modeling et either crop specific potential et etcrop 25 or actual et etact 19 83 the latter is of high interest to water management as it describes the amount of water consumed or depleted from the irrigation systems and can contribute to strategic and operational irrigation performance assessments 9 for instance etact was integrated with crop yields into water productivity assessments 65 74 18 and combined with hydrological measurements for irrigation performance assessments 8 24 it is worth mentioning that mainly foreign researchers have published rs based studies and results within different projects from germany usa and china almost no author named as first or corresponding author was associated with a local institution within ca 4 numerical overview the following numerical overview summarises i the spatial scales and the spatial distribution of studies ii the usage of different rs data and spatial resolutions and iii the usage of in situ data for validation and the integration of geodata secondary data less attention was paid to rs based methods since most methods and algorithms applied in the studies were developed elsewhere 4 1 spatial scales and spatial distribution of studies four scales of application occurred in the final list of publications i farm level i e addressing single field plots on few farms ii province level ranging from irrigated areas of 20 000 ha to large irrigation subsystems up to a few 100 000 ha iii national and iv regional level i e ca or asb at the regional scale five out of nine papers focussed on states and their political boundaries within ca excluding afghanistan one of them included china four regional papers provided exclusively information on irrigation systems within the asb including the northern part of afghanistan only four studies addressed the national scale three for kazakhstan and one for tajikistan 82 the majority of the studies were available at the province level 24 followed by the farm level 20 most of them were located in uzbekistan 35 kazakhstan and turkmenistan played a minor role with six and two studies addressing the provincial or farm levels respectively no publications were found for the sub national level of irrigation systems in the asb located in kyrgyzstan tajikistan or afghanistan table1 the highest number of investigations at the province and farm scales were published for uzbekistan 36 this country holds almost half of the irrigated area in the asb 41 in uzbekistan most sub national studies 19 were conducted in the khorezm province followed by the provinces of fergana 11 karakalpakstan 9 syrdarya 5 andizhan and namangan both 4 and kashkadarya 1 this spatial distribution of published studies can clearly be related to project activities and scientific cooperation in ca examples are the zef unesco khorezm project funded by the german ministry of research and education from 2001 to 2010 45 and a project on agroforestry in khorezm and karakalpakstan funded by the german robert bosch foundation 2009 2015 the fergana province is a key partner of the sic icwc the fergana valley is a focus region of the international center for agricultural research in the dry areas icarda in ca 4 2 rs data usage landsat and modis systems clearly lead the list of data sources with 26 and 24 publications for each sensor respectively data utilization from rapideye stands third in the list with nine studies other sensors include quickbird irs spot aster noaa avhrr and meris with six five four three two and one publication respectively few studies integrated higher level products derived from modis and avhrr data such as global data on net primary production or evapotranspiration or ndvi datasets e g gimms about 25 studies were based on rs data from one sensor only whereas the rest of the studies utilized multiple data sources table 2 presents the results for rs data sources at various scales the results show that landsat and other fine spatial resolution data were utilized at the farm scale whereas modis data was selected at the province and state scales landsat data was also extensively used at the province scale but mostly in support of modis for validation of results at finer resolutions 4 3 validation with in situ data and integration of secondary data the usage of in situ data is an integral part of any rs based study due to its relevance for calibration and validation of results almost half of the studies 25 utilized in situ data collected in field campaigns while two studies fully relied on google maps as a supplier for validation data the remaining studies 22 did not utilize any in situ or secondary data for validation purposes a total of 24 studies integrated geodata from other external sources including twelve studies using meteorological data meteorological data is essential for assessing the usage of irrigation water in particular for modelling evapotranspiration biomass and crop yields 10 secondary data is a key feature for driver analyses targeting e g spatial patterns of land degradation e g soil salinization or cropping pattern analysis 5 remote sensing based results 5 1 land use remote sensing based analyses allowed the monitoring of agricultural system development in the asb mainly after 1991 chen et al 20 found a decline of irrigated cropland between 1990 and 2000 i e the early transformation phase after the break up of the soviet union su followed by an increase until 2009 this increasing trend was also confirmed by dimov et al 33 for 2000 2016 however spatial patterns of cropping intensity i e the number of harvests per year varied among and within the irrigation zones from 2000 to 2012 30 time series analyses of cropland phenology showed that in north afghanistan almost two harvests occurred every year 2000 2012 on the other hand land abandonment and very low land use intensity is widespread especially downstream 66 for the amudarya catchment conrad et al 30 showed that land use intensity varied largely with water supply 2000 2012 however overlaying the maps of cropping intensity and dependency of water supply with land abandonment 66 shows the difficulties in understanding or disentangling the different effects of land degradation or water supply on cropping patterns in the asb for instance farmers in the kazalinsk region stated that some land parcels were only used to fulfil the rice production plan and were never included in existing cadaster systems of the su pers communication with aibek samakov university of tübingen germany july 2018 thus missing socio economic information may mislead interpretations of land abandonment as a sign of increasing land degradation in solely rs based studies in the asb crop rotations dominated by cotton were very typical during the su era from 1924 to 1991 13 every year more than 60 of the cropland was used for cotton production statistical information e g 41 and socio economic studies e g 1 16 reported a diversification of these cotton monoculture systems by the introduction of winter wheat in turkmenistan and uzbekistan after 1991 44 regional rs based analyses confirm this development e g 33 49 15 the wuemoca online tool c f section 8 offers a map of leading crop types derived from modis time series aggregated to 5 km 5 km grids fig 3 cotton wheat and rice sectors dominated in the period 2000 2018 orchards characterized upstream regions of uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan and hotspots of fodder crop production alfalfa occurred e g in kazakhstan studies about the large scale irrigation systems in fergana valley and khorezm demonstrated ongoing crop diversification in uzbekistan 29 31 by integrating further geodata it could be shown that increased crop diversity mainly occurred in vicinity of settlements whilst monoculture coincided mainly with low population density and soils of reduced quality meaning that these two modes of cotton cultivation monocultures and rotation are often linked to practical management decisions of the farmers mono cropping of cotton and rice prevailed in the irrigation systems of the kazakh part of the asb cotton in the south rice in the north 33 this can be attributed to both privatization by large scale agribusiness companies 6 and the fact that wheat is cultivated in the steppe ecosystem in the north of the country reduced diversity e g in the amudarya delta the provinces of tashauz turkmenistan and karakalpakstan uzbekistan and in kyzyl orda in kazakhstan 33 often coincide with reduced cropping intensity 30 and land abandonment 61 66 crop maps at farm level derived from high resolution data spatial resolution 30 m of the fergana valley in 2010 and khorezm in 2009 both uzbekistan revealed area shares of cotton wheat of 34 7 32 and 34 8 24 6 respectively 25 26 this is in line with an 11 year average 2004 2014 derived from synthetic landsat time series for the fergana valley 65 in the lebab province of turkmenistan thevs et al 83 measured an area share of cotton wheat of 34 7 47 using landsat data of 2009 and 2010 for the uzbek kashkadarya province edlinger et al 40 observed from landsat time series that winter wheat in 1998 59 of 350 000 ha had more than doubled in comparison to 1987 5 2 soil and vegetation secondary salinization is the main cause of wide spread land degradation in the asb 75 however soil salinity assessments challenge rs applications first soil salinity mainly occurs below the soil surface it is highly dynamic in the vertical dimension of the soil profile and thus largely invisible for rs sensors 5 second crop cover blurs the signals of rs systems for soil analyses accordingly only five mainly methodological articles were published on soil salinity in the asb between 2008 and 2019 rukhovich et al 78 applied expert knowledge and visual interpretation of aerial photographs aps and landsat data at the farm level in the golodnaya steppe i e hungry steppe in uzbekistan to estimate the sodium concentration in the first meter of the soil column over a period of 20 years soil salinity in the soil column expressed as electrical conductivity was modelled with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 48 by integrating landsat data at the farm and district levels in khorezm 3 4 these studies demonstrated the necessity of integrating further data on groundwater soil and terrain parameters into the modelling framework using optical rs data however multi temporal rs data could replace some secondary data when modeling bulk soil salinity r2 values of 0 36 to 0 50 at the end of the cropping season 81 cropland degradation in the asb largely refers to soil degradation and was addressed by extracting negative trends in time series of vegetation indices available through moderate to coarse resolution rs data such as modis or avhrr spatial resolutions of 250 to 8 000 m dubovyk et al 35 identified one third of the khorezm province to be affected by land degradation multiple logistic regression revealed that groundwater levels and salinity as well as soil salinity control these vegetation declines over time dubovyk et al 36 further integrated these negative trends in vegetation cover with ecological knowledge and identified priority sites for potential improvements recommending e g the replacement of crops with tree plantations time series analysis of vegetation indices and thermal information revealed high land surface dynamics in turkmenistan and kazakhstan from 2000 to 2013 de beurs et al 15 attributed this to changes in irrigated cropping systems in these countries kariyeva and van leeuwen 50 found reduced phenological variations in the cropping zones of the asb in rs based time series of vegetation cover for the time period of 1981 to 2006 only in the amudarya delta a sharp decline in land use occurred after the collapse of the su in 1991 due to ecological problems time series from rs data e g vegetation and thermal data or etact also allow the identification of effects of irrigation system change on climate 54 and of climate impacts on irrigation systems 55 5 3 crop production achieving sustainable crop yields in agriculture will challenge science and practice during the next decades and is against the background of a still increasing rural population of paramount importance in the asb 45 this review showed that despite the enormous potential of rs to provide data on crop production or identify areas that require improvements 57 only a small number of peer reviewed articles on rs based modeling of crop yields biophysical parameters or influencing factors here locust habitat modeling were applied at the farm scale platonov et al 74 empirically modelled crop yields of lint cotton average of field data 1 23 t ha 1 for the year 2006 using a vegetation index derived from landsat data r2 of 0 82 for two farms in uzbekistan cai et al 18 modelled crop yields of cotton r2 of 0 7 and wheat r2 of 0 67 based on in situ data of 2006 and 2007 and irs liss data spatial resolution of 23 5 m the average yields of lint cotton and wheat observed in the field amounted to 2 11 t ha 1 and approximately 3 5 t ha 1 respectively mariotto et al 67 identified high r2 0 9 using regression analyses for modelling crop yields of maize wheat rice alfalfa and cotton using data of the explorative hyperspectral hyperion system but without reporting any crop yield levels a semi empirical light use efficiency lue model was applied to multi temporal high resolution rs data 30 m for assessing crop yields in the fergana valley 64 for the period from 2010 to 2012 and 2014 cotton wheat and rice yields averaged to 3 06 t ha 1 average area 182 000 ha 4 53 t ha 1 144 240 ha and 2 97 t ha 1 16 872 ha respectively correlation of the results for all crops with the official statistics at the district level yielded an r2 of 0 71 the same approach applied to rs data of 2004 2014 returned yield levels of cotton wheat amounting to 3 04 t ha 1 4 65 t ha 1 and a value of r2 of 0 81 65 table 3 presents a summary of crop yields gleaned from various studies and a global comparison by averaging crop yields for the period of 2010 2012 and 2014 löw et al 2017a derived a map of crop productivity for the fergana valley the enormous variability of estimated yields underlined the impact of agricultural land and water management driver analysis integrating 23 environmental and socio economic indicators showed that e g cropping diversity significantly impacted crop productivity in addition distance analyses underlined that yield gaps increased with increasing distance from settlements the only regional map addressing crop productivity was derived from the modis npp 500 m data product 33 where npp is used as an indicator for yield levels under the assumption that cropping patterns resemble each other in all regions and all the years theoretically a lue model could be applied to the entire region but uncertainty is hard to quantify without sufficient in situ yield observations this in situ information is also relevant for the assessment of the harvest index i e the factor for converting npp to crop yield 5 4 irrigation water use crop water demands based on meteorological data and derived from temporal aggregation of etcrop for cotton wheat and rice e g 83 in a few provinces of the asb range around 900 mm 550 mm and 1 050 mm table 4 these values were found to be quite high compared to global averages for instance howell et al 47 reported 617 mm of actual water usage for cotton in california usa dong et al 34 reported 465 mm of actual water use for rice in china zwart 91 reported location specific results of actual water usage for wheat in various regions of the world including egypt usa mexico china and pakistan of 355 mm 395 mm 403 mm 380 436 mm and 467 mm respectively modelled information on water consumption seasonal etact in lebab province turkmenistan ranged clearly below water demand in 2010 2011 table 4 thevs et al 83 interpreted this result as a consequence of high water usage for leaching salts from the fields and potential systematic underestimations by the etact model applied conrad et al 24 modelled spatially distributed relative et etrel etact etcrop which indicates the efficacy of water supply for crop production and found both water oversupply etact etcrop and undersupply for the khorezm province in 2005 a water rich year in the amudarya basin www cawater info net it should be noted that values for etrel below 0 75 indicate critical production conditions due to water scarcity 77 awan et al 8 and conrad et al 24 analyzed irrigation performance based on water balances at farm and province levels in khorezm by modeling etact from landsat and modis data combining hydrological measurements of the components of the water balance supplemented by etact from rs based models depleted water yielded irrigation water use efficiencies of approximately 0 4 at both scales this indicator describes the use of water in relation to the provision of irrigation water to the system 9 the biggest challenge faced by water managers today is to produce more crop per drop of water use 87 this is becoming increasingly difficult with decreasing shares of fresh water for agriculture thus putting food security at stake 90 in such situations sustaining or increasing crop production in irrigation systems requires either increasing land and water resource consumption or increasing crop water productivity however differences in agricultural management water use salinity and climate change have led to variable crop productivity on local and regional scales according to platonov et al 74 water productivity of cotton derived from the combination of spatially distributed crop yield and etact based on landsat data at farm level in the syrdarya province uzbekistan showed great variability i e 0 kg m 3 0 54 kg m 3 about 87 of the farm land exhibited a crop water productivity of less than 0 30 kg m 3 on 11 of the area values ranged between 0 30 kg m 3 0 36 kg m 3 and only on 2 of the area showed a crop water productivity greater than 0 36 kg m 3 similar results were reported by cai et al 18 who modelled cotton crop water productivity for the same farm crop yield information was extracted from quickbird and irs liss data whilst etact resulted from thermal information provided by landsat numbers for the crop water productivity of maize winter wheat and rice were not given löw et al 65 showed potential improvements of crop productivities in the fergana valley which can amount to 1 t ha 1 and 1 4 t ha 1 for cotton and wheat respectively these gains are possible by addressing the effects of local geographical factors on crop yield including geographical field location irrigation system distribution and field position relative to infrastructure by analysing multi annual landsat and modis based estimations of water productivity at field level in the fergana valley löw et al 65 identified potentials to increase yields of cotton and wheat by 25 when reducing water stress in affected sectors of the irrigation system 6 discussion and research gaps despite the fact that the major part of rs based studies conducted in the asb has a methodological focus only 45 or is spatially limited to parts of the basin farms provinces or single time steps they contribute valuable information about the status of land and water use in the irrigated croplands results show that rs based information was rarely linked to ecological and socio economic data this is particularly interesting as such integrative assessments are considered essential for planning and managing future sustainable developments e g 76 data collection in the region requires local knowledge communication skill and official permissions thus many studies between 2008 and 2019 utilizing geodata integration e g driver analyses of land abandonment or cropping intensity 30 66 are available at the regional or provincial levels where ready to use and accessible generic information from the carewib database could be integrated in this context the collection of further environmental data e g groundwater recharge soil properties biodiversity socio economic data e g farm management parameters such as degree of mechanization chemical input etc digital legacy data on infrastructure data on water administration boundaries as well as the organization and management of data is urgently required 2 suitable data may originate from national monitoring programs and project reports of regional institutions but are often hard to access or unusable for external users e g due to missing metadata expanding ground based data collection in irrigation systems to other provinces e g in the upstream countries of the asb or in turkmenistan may complete the picture increased availability of digital secondary data would also allow for soil salinity assessments at larger scales a rs application that is still in its experimental stage 81 the review showed numerous assessments of cropland use in the asb however analyses of minor crops or plantations e g fruit orchards that typically exhibit intercropping 26 or private gardens are absent orchards and private gardens are essential components in irrigation management for example in uzbekistan private gardens are officially prioritized in irrigation water distribution hence in drought situations to better understand the complexity of irrigation water management and to gain knowledge on how rs can support herein both orchard types require more attention especially in view of food and water security or rural livelihoods for a more complete picture of the land use system integrative studies showing the interaction of land and water uses with biodiversity and natural ecosystems e g 72 28 are of high interest as already pointed out in a review about agriculture in ca by hamidov et al 45 one option for fostering regional assessments in the asb is the use of globally existing rs products e g modis npp or et products provided by nasa e g 33 in situ data in combination with modelling approaches at farm or province level may help evaluate the quality of such global products fritsch et al 43 showed for instance a systematic overestimation of global modis fpar products an important input to the modis npp product 84 in comparison to in situ data statistically upscaled to the khorezm province using rapideye data however such global datasets have an enormous potential for deriving indicators such as proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture and change in water use efficiency over time in the framework of the united nation s sustainable developments goals 2 zero hunger and 6 clean water and sanitation one shortcoming and a potential reason for the limited number of publications in the categories crop production and irrigation water use is seen in the absence of in situ data for validation the usefulness of validating rs studies with secondary data e g crop yields at the district level is questionable as rs based models mainly operate at the level of cells i e pixels rather than spatial aggregation in addition the credibility of official data is often debatable which makes their use comparisons impractical however such validation approaches at least indicate the plausibility of the results 56 regarding actual evapotranspiration etact validation of the approaches applied in the asb rely on the general validity of the models proven in other parts of the world 74 18 plausibility analysis of input parameters class a pan measurements 21 or other project reports 65 comparisons with eddy covariance and bowen ratio data often used for validation of etact 11 have been not reported as such data lacks for the asb but plausibility analyses would already benefit from an increased access to meteorological data from the region technically the integration of sar data in rs based applications is unexplored in the asb this technology may improve the separation of spectrally similar crop types such as cotton and maize 42 the monitoring of soil moisture and irrigation requirements and crop biomass 69 untapped potential can also be seen in the utilization of high resolution time series with data fusion as shown e g for landsat and modis 65 and in the use of thermal information for irrigated cropland monitoring 73 so far no rs study in the asb utilized the european sentinel systems 7 integration of remote sensing data into databases robust trustworthy data to support informed scientific decision making is essential for developing policies 32 this review underpins the potential of rs based analyses to supplement datasets and databases on land use land productivity crop production and irrigation water use e g as shown by dimov et al 33 recently the online web service wuemoca water use efficiency monitor in central asia https wuemoca geo uni halle de app started it was developed within the framework of the german initiative water in central asia cawa this tool provides access to numerous indicators approved by the sic icwc to be useful for regional water management in the asb 79 and is based on initial work by conrad et al 30 it integrates regional applications of yield modeling for cotton wheat and rice as well as s sebi based assessments of 10 day and seasonal etact for instance seasonal water consumption by irrigation etact can be aggregated at the district level and the scale of 5 km 5 km spatial grids as shown for the year 2011 in fig 4 a and 4b however the use of tools such as wuemoca as database or decision support instrumentin the land and water sectors in the asb is challenging but possible as indicated by abdullaev and rakhmatullaev 2 such databases and integrative tools can be seen as a first step towards digitization of irrigated agriculture and understanding of geodata integration in the asb experiences with wuemoca show that a transfer of the tool to regional stakeholders has to meet some requirements i e sustaining data integration and utilizing the information over project runtimes in a daily workflow further requirements include a clear definition of a limited number of target groups trust in rs based results and understanding of uncertainties common specifications of national and regional water administration authorities while considering differences among them and an awareness of the strong political top down approaches in ca to increase the acceptance and usage of the tool wuemoca for instance was designed for regional water distribution in the asb with a strong focus on 13 basin irrigation system administrations bisa in uzbekistan which were involved in the specification and development process as well as through information days and trainings however the fact that rs is yet not well integrated in the university system of ca as indicated by the low number of publications by authors from the region cf section 3 may reduce further development and communication of the tool and its potential strengthening digital technologies in research and education is thus an essential task for the can countries to adopt the digital technology in the land and water sectors 88 8 conclusions and recommendations against the background of a high and pressing demand for increasing sustainability of land and water use in the irrigation systems in the asb 49 peer reviewed journal articles that apply rs technology were investigated all focused on land use soil and vegetation status crop production and water use for irrigation regional assessments predominantly conducted with 250 m to 1000 m resolution data from modis showed the big picture of irrigated land use systems in the asb from 2000 to date rs based monitoring approaches at the national scale are rarely published and information at province or farm level show examples only these were mainly investigated using rs data with spatial resolutions of less than 30 m up to 250 m i e rapideye landsat and modis crop production and irrigation water use were mainly investigated at the farm and province levels many of these studies remained at an experimental stage only however these insights into the asb allow the tracking of the enormous water demands and water consumption for achieving intermediate crop yield levels in comparison to other irrigated crop production systems globally data integration into irrigation performance assessments at the system and farm levels may help to reorganize the distribution of water and subsequently to increase water use efficiency this was shown for the khorezm region in uzbekistan where most of the reviewed rs based analyses were conducted the limited availability of in situ information for validation particularly regarding crop yields and evapotranspiration underpins the necessity of setting a focus on linking field and rs based research it further stresses the need for national monitoring of the vegetation soil atmosphere complex in the asb one recommendation refers to the installation and instrumentation of validation sites e g by following the joint experiment for crop assessment and monitoring www jecam org an activity within the geoss network by nasa due to the fact that almost all of the rs based studies included in this review originated from international research strengthening cooperation between the international rs community and scientific institutions in the region is recommended this could help to provide workflows and tools for national monitoring systems in the irrigation sector of ca countries and afghanistan and to mosaic collected information e g for the carewib portal the latter is also assumed to increase the accessibility of secondary data this is important for analyzing the socio economic setting in the region and assessing risks e g of extreme situations and climate change from 2008 to 2019 the different rs methods at farm to province levels have increasingly been upscaled to regional applications they come with an enormous potential to fill gaps in databases e g with indicators as shown by the example of the wuemoca tool in turn these databases are assumed to contribute to indicator systems and to supplement the indicator system within the framework of the united nation s sustainable development goals however experiences show that the inclusion of wuemoca in the workflows of the target groupsis difficult participation of the policy level in the development process is necessary to increase awareness and promote acceptance of rs results in the land water and environmental sectors of the asb further rs studies and practical implementation of rs based

20136,irrigated agriculture in the aral sea basin asb is commonly known for its high water consumption inefficient water management and dysfunctional irrigation and drainage infrastructure since 1991 six states have been engaged in intensive irrigated agriculture in the aral sea basin asb afghanistan kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan in this region irrigated agriculture is commonly known for its high water consumption inefficient water management and dysfunctional irrigation and drainage infrastructure extensive land degradation e g soil salinization is considered as the main result of mismanagement in the irrigation sector and sustainable solutions are urgently required this study analysed international peer reviewed scientific studies based on satellite remote sensing rs products and methods addressing potential improvements of irrigation water and land management in the asb ways to transfer rs based knowledge into practice were discussed using the example of the online tool wuemoca that was developed from 2015 to 2019 within the german water initiative in central asia cawa for the period 2008 2019 a total of 49 studies contributed knowledge about land use soils and vegetation crop production and use of irrigation water in the asb the use of rs revealed increased diversification of agricultural production spatial temporal patterns of land degradation and effects of varying water availability on cropping intensity modelling of crop yields and evapotranspiration at varying scales i e farm to provincial scale underlined the comparably moderate water productivity in the asb one relevant future research task is to intensively collect in situ data for validation and secondary data and hence to mitigate the situation in particular improved socio ecological and economic information could help to better understand the spatially differing drivers of soil and land degradation eventually this study provides relevant information and data sources for decision making and requirements for better integration of rs based information into practice using online tools like wuemoca keywords remote sensing agricultural monitoring water productivity irrigation aral sea basin central asia wuemoca 1 introduction almost 30 years after the break up of the soviet union su in 1991 and despite remarkable socio economic transformations in the new riparian countries of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan the critical ecological and economic situation in the aral sea basin asb in central asia ca has hardly improved 70 elevated water table associated with secondary soil salinization in irrigated croplands still cause land degradation and land abandonment over extensive areas 75 66 dilapidated irrigation and drainage infrastructure low water use efficiency and reduced agricultural diversification further challenge sustainable agricultural production 44 16 excess freshwater withdrawals from rivers cause upstream downstream disparities and threaten natural ecosystems 53 in comparison to other parts of the world the economic return of water is exceptionally low in the asb 88 for instance to produce one gdp dollar turkmenistan requires three times more water than india at the same time the gdp share of irrigated crop production in the countries of the asb is still immense ranging between 11 and 38 2 17 in densely populated parts of the asb this sector is additionally under pressure because irrigated cropland area has been reduced due to rural population growth and traditional settlement development 27 among others solutions for sustainable land and water management in irrigation agriculture are mandatory to overcome this conflictual situation alternative crops sustainable crop rotation conservation agriculture or increased crop diversification are largely considered by the ca governments to mitigate environmental degradation and to sustain production in the region the same is valid for improved cooperation in the use and distribution of water from transboundary to local levels yet this is especially true if water is to be used more efficiently and the water productivity of plants is to be increased at the same time 53 88 45 however despite some advancements the success and failure of individual measures in the field remain frequently unclear and information for decision makers to adjust measures for the different parts of the irrigation zones in the asb are unavailable decision making towards more sustainable irrigated crop production in the asb requires up to date and robust data as well as access to databases providing agriculturally relevant information a big challenge is the scarce and unstructured agricultural monitoring in the asb as can be observed throughout the entire developing world 80 moreover the credibility of officially available data in the land and water sector of ca has been increasingly called into question 86 according to abdullaev and rakhmatullaev 2 only few databases providing meaningful information to enhance integrated water resource management exist in the region the central asia regional water information base carewib is the only accessible database it was implemented by the scientific information center of the interstate commission for water coordination of ca sic icwc with support from by international partners it is regularly updated http www cawater info net and provides datasets on agriculture but only at the level of provinces and river basins remote sensing rs information has become a complementary data supplier to in situ monitoring networks 80 rs information is accepted as a relevant option to contribute to sustainability in the land and water sector 76 in the context of agricultural monitoring applications numerous environmental variables can be derived from multiple satellite platforms among others these variables relate to the usage of croplands e g the discrimination of crop types 73 soil and vegetation assessments vegetation trend analyses biomass and yield mapping 7 or assessments of water uses 10 12 they were also addressed in numerous scientific studies on agricultural land use in ca as recently underlined by hamidov et al 45 however an overview of rs based results useful for land and water management and adding to a deeper understanding of irrigation agriculture in the asb is missing also none of the above mentioned databases that may be used for land and water management in the irrigation water sector of the asb or ca relies on rs data 2 the present study therefore aims to review scientific publications dealing with the topics of rs based agricultural monitoring applications of i land use ii soil and vegetation status iii crop production and iv irrigation water uses for irrigated cropland in the asb the overarching goal is to elaborate existing results and research gaps and to highlight ready to use applications and datasets for irrigated land and water management in the asb to assess the practical usefulness of rs technology in ca this study addresses a new online tool cf section 8 and discusses options for a better utilization of rs and geoinformation in the region using this example 2 study area the asb covers 1 76 million km2 and is shared by tajikistan 99 of the country area turkmenistan and uzbekistan both 95 kyrgyzstan 59 kazakhstan 13 afghanistan 38 and a small part of iran fig 1 climate in the asb is continental with high daily and seasonal temperature variation high solar radiation and low humidity elevation ranges from 0 m in the western lowlands of turan to 7 500 m a s l in the tian shan and pamir mountains in the east 71 precipitation mainly occurs in the mountainous east where the predominant part of runoff is generated in contrast deserts with low annual precipitation 100 mm 300 mm characterize the flat western part of the asb total renewable water resources of the asb are about 130 km3 per year the majority of this water is piped through a channel network exceeding a length of 300 000 km to irrigate about 9 76 million ha of cropland 41 about 80 reservoirs with an average volume of more than 100 million m3 were constructed for irrigation purposes drainage is an essential component in the irrigation system in the asb total length of drainage systems is approximately 200 000 km including sub surface drainage of about 50 000 km 41 cotton and cereals wheat rice maize and others dominate the irrigated cropping systems in the asb 3 article selection and assignment to sub categories literature search was conducted based on the web of science https www webofknowledge com and scopus https www scopus com databases from 2008 to date only international peer reviewed articles following the isi standards for publication were considered the search was conducted using three terms addressing i remote sensing rs ii countries in the asb and iii keywords that refer to irrigated land use system analysis research on land cover vegetation cover crops land degradation cropland productivity and water use efficiency the search for these terms included title abstract and keywords of a particular article the research papers that emerged from this scheme were manually checked for their potential contribution to this study the results were also cross checked with google scholar https scholar google com initially we identified 92 publications to avoid duplications this number was reduced by subsequent manual screening research studies with a spatial focus located outside the boundaries of the asb were excluded fig 2 a the contextual analysis revealed 49 publications that generated new information for the four categories of interest fig 2b few publications belonged to more than one category for instance approaches to assess water productivity required if the information was not available elsewhere three steps i e crop type discrimination crop yield estimation and modelling evapotranspiration e g 18 the majority of the publications had a focus in the category land use 28 e g the mapping of crop types 22 23 67 26 58 60 62 83 crop type mapping also served as input e g for assessments of irrigation water demand and use another focus was the estimation of cropland area 40 82 68 46 89 that can also be part of land cover land use mapping 51 20 the rest of the studies in this category focus on land abandonment 61 66 cropping intensity 30 65 33 and crop diversity 29 31 study focus in the category soil and vegetation 16 publications was on the use of rs for soil salinity assessments 78 3 4 48 81 and the analysis of land surface dynamics i e time series analysis of land cover vegetation parameters and or other environmental information such as land surface temperature net primary production npp or evapotranspiration et 14 20 15 vegetation development based on rs data was analysed to assess land degradation 35 37 85 38 to monitor cropland phenology 49 and to detect drought hazards 39 the crop production category nine publications included studies on modelling of crop biophysical parameters 43 52 useful for the implementation of yield models modelling of crop yields was the subject of another set of studies 74 67 64 65 18 this category also comprised locust habitat monitoring 72 63 because locust infestation can dramatically decrease crop yields all publications in the category irrigation water use eight publications focused on modeling et either crop specific potential et etcrop 25 or actual et etact 19 83 the latter is of high interest to water management as it describes the amount of water consumed or depleted from the irrigation systems and can contribute to strategic and operational irrigation performance assessments 9 for instance etact was integrated with crop yields into water productivity assessments 65 74 18 and combined with hydrological measurements for irrigation performance assessments 8 24 it is worth mentioning that mainly foreign researchers have published rs based studies and results within different projects from germany usa and china almost no author named as first or corresponding author was associated with a local institution within ca 4 numerical overview the following numerical overview summarises i the spatial scales and the spatial distribution of studies ii the usage of different rs data and spatial resolutions and iii the usage of in situ data for validation and the integration of geodata secondary data less attention was paid to rs based methods since most methods and algorithms applied in the studies were developed elsewhere 4 1 spatial scales and spatial distribution of studies four scales of application occurred in the final list of publications i farm level i e addressing single field plots on few farms ii province level ranging from irrigated areas of 20 000 ha to large irrigation subsystems up to a few 100 000 ha iii national and iv regional level i e ca or asb at the regional scale five out of nine papers focussed on states and their political boundaries within ca excluding afghanistan one of them included china four regional papers provided exclusively information on irrigation systems within the asb including the northern part of afghanistan only four studies addressed the national scale three for kazakhstan and one for tajikistan 82 the majority of the studies were available at the province level 24 followed by the farm level 20 most of them were located in uzbekistan 35 kazakhstan and turkmenistan played a minor role with six and two studies addressing the provincial or farm levels respectively no publications were found for the sub national level of irrigation systems in the asb located in kyrgyzstan tajikistan or afghanistan table1 the highest number of investigations at the province and farm scales were published for uzbekistan 36 this country holds almost half of the irrigated area in the asb 41 in uzbekistan most sub national studies 19 were conducted in the khorezm province followed by the provinces of fergana 11 karakalpakstan 9 syrdarya 5 andizhan and namangan both 4 and kashkadarya 1 this spatial distribution of published studies can clearly be related to project activities and scientific cooperation in ca examples are the zef unesco khorezm project funded by the german ministry of research and education from 2001 to 2010 45 and a project on agroforestry in khorezm and karakalpakstan funded by the german robert bosch foundation 2009 2015 the fergana province is a key partner of the sic icwc the fergana valley is a focus region of the international center for agricultural research in the dry areas icarda in ca 4 2 rs data usage landsat and modis systems clearly lead the list of data sources with 26 and 24 publications for each sensor respectively data utilization from rapideye stands third in the list with nine studies other sensors include quickbird irs spot aster noaa avhrr and meris with six five four three two and one publication respectively few studies integrated higher level products derived from modis and avhrr data such as global data on net primary production or evapotranspiration or ndvi datasets e g gimms about 25 studies were based on rs data from one sensor only whereas the rest of the studies utilized multiple data sources table 2 presents the results for rs data sources at various scales the results show that landsat and other fine spatial resolution data were utilized at the farm scale whereas modis data was selected at the province and state scales landsat data was also extensively used at the province scale but mostly in support of modis for validation of results at finer resolutions 4 3 validation with in situ data and integration of secondary data the usage of in situ data is an integral part of any rs based study due to its relevance for calibration and validation of results almost half of the studies 25 utilized in situ data collected in field campaigns while two studies fully relied on google maps as a supplier for validation data the remaining studies 22 did not utilize any in situ or secondary data for validation purposes a total of 24 studies integrated geodata from other external sources including twelve studies using meteorological data meteorological data is essential for assessing the usage of irrigation water in particular for modelling evapotranspiration biomass and crop yields 10 secondary data is a key feature for driver analyses targeting e g spatial patterns of land degradation e g soil salinization or cropping pattern analysis 5 remote sensing based results 5 1 land use remote sensing based analyses allowed the monitoring of agricultural system development in the asb mainly after 1991 chen et al 20 found a decline of irrigated cropland between 1990 and 2000 i e the early transformation phase after the break up of the soviet union su followed by an increase until 2009 this increasing trend was also confirmed by dimov et al 33 for 2000 2016 however spatial patterns of cropping intensity i e the number of harvests per year varied among and within the irrigation zones from 2000 to 2012 30 time series analyses of cropland phenology showed that in north afghanistan almost two harvests occurred every year 2000 2012 on the other hand land abandonment and very low land use intensity is widespread especially downstream 66 for the amudarya catchment conrad et al 30 showed that land use intensity varied largely with water supply 2000 2012 however overlaying the maps of cropping intensity and dependency of water supply with land abandonment 66 shows the difficulties in understanding or disentangling the different effects of land degradation or water supply on cropping patterns in the asb for instance farmers in the kazalinsk region stated that some land parcels were only used to fulfil the rice production plan and were never included in existing cadaster systems of the su pers communication with aibek samakov university of tübingen germany july 2018 thus missing socio economic information may mislead interpretations of land abandonment as a sign of increasing land degradation in solely rs based studies in the asb crop rotations dominated by cotton were very typical during the su era from 1924 to 1991 13 every year more than 60 of the cropland was used for cotton production statistical information e g 41 and socio economic studies e g 1 16 reported a diversification of these cotton monoculture systems by the introduction of winter wheat in turkmenistan and uzbekistan after 1991 44 regional rs based analyses confirm this development e g 33 49 15 the wuemoca online tool c f section 8 offers a map of leading crop types derived from modis time series aggregated to 5 km 5 km grids fig 3 cotton wheat and rice sectors dominated in the period 2000 2018 orchards characterized upstream regions of uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan and hotspots of fodder crop production alfalfa occurred e g in kazakhstan studies about the large scale irrigation systems in fergana valley and khorezm demonstrated ongoing crop diversification in uzbekistan 29 31 by integrating further geodata it could be shown that increased crop diversity mainly occurred in vicinity of settlements whilst monoculture coincided mainly with low population density and soils of reduced quality meaning that these two modes of cotton cultivation monocultures and rotation are often linked to practical management decisions of the farmers mono cropping of cotton and rice prevailed in the irrigation systems of the kazakh part of the asb cotton in the south rice in the north 33 this can be attributed to both privatization by large scale agribusiness companies 6 and the fact that wheat is cultivated in the steppe ecosystem in the north of the country reduced diversity e g in the amudarya delta the provinces of tashauz turkmenistan and karakalpakstan uzbekistan and in kyzyl orda in kazakhstan 33 often coincide with reduced cropping intensity 30 and land abandonment 61 66 crop maps at farm level derived from high resolution data spatial resolution 30 m of the fergana valley in 2010 and khorezm in 2009 both uzbekistan revealed area shares of cotton wheat of 34 7 32 and 34 8 24 6 respectively 25 26 this is in line with an 11 year average 2004 2014 derived from synthetic landsat time series for the fergana valley 65 in the lebab province of turkmenistan thevs et al 83 measured an area share of cotton wheat of 34 7 47 using landsat data of 2009 and 2010 for the uzbek kashkadarya province edlinger et al 40 observed from landsat time series that winter wheat in 1998 59 of 350 000 ha had more than doubled in comparison to 1987 5 2 soil and vegetation secondary salinization is the main cause of wide spread land degradation in the asb 75 however soil salinity assessments challenge rs applications first soil salinity mainly occurs below the soil surface it is highly dynamic in the vertical dimension of the soil profile and thus largely invisible for rs sensors 5 second crop cover blurs the signals of rs systems for soil analyses accordingly only five mainly methodological articles were published on soil salinity in the asb between 2008 and 2019 rukhovich et al 78 applied expert knowledge and visual interpretation of aerial photographs aps and landsat data at the farm level in the golodnaya steppe i e hungry steppe in uzbekistan to estimate the sodium concentration in the first meter of the soil column over a period of 20 years soil salinity in the soil column expressed as electrical conductivity was modelled with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 48 by integrating landsat data at the farm and district levels in khorezm 3 4 these studies demonstrated the necessity of integrating further data on groundwater soil and terrain parameters into the modelling framework using optical rs data however multi temporal rs data could replace some secondary data when modeling bulk soil salinity r2 values of 0 36 to 0 50 at the end of the cropping season 81 cropland degradation in the asb largely refers to soil degradation and was addressed by extracting negative trends in time series of vegetation indices available through moderate to coarse resolution rs data such as modis or avhrr spatial resolutions of 250 to 8 000 m dubovyk et al 35 identified one third of the khorezm province to be affected by land degradation multiple logistic regression revealed that groundwater levels and salinity as well as soil salinity control these vegetation declines over time dubovyk et al 36 further integrated these negative trends in vegetation cover with ecological knowledge and identified priority sites for potential improvements recommending e g the replacement of crops with tree plantations time series analysis of vegetation indices and thermal information revealed high land surface dynamics in turkmenistan and kazakhstan from 2000 to 2013 de beurs et al 15 attributed this to changes in irrigated cropping systems in these countries kariyeva and van leeuwen 50 found reduced phenological variations in the cropping zones of the asb in rs based time series of vegetation cover for the time period of 1981 to 2006 only in the amudarya delta a sharp decline in land use occurred after the collapse of the su in 1991 due to ecological problems time series from rs data e g vegetation and thermal data or etact also allow the identification of effects of irrigation system change on climate 54 and of climate impacts on irrigation systems 55 5 3 crop production achieving sustainable crop yields in agriculture will challenge science and practice during the next decades and is against the background of a still increasing rural population of paramount importance in the asb 45 this review showed that despite the enormous potential of rs to provide data on crop production or identify areas that require improvements 57 only a small number of peer reviewed articles on rs based modeling of crop yields biophysical parameters or influencing factors here locust habitat modeling were applied at the farm scale platonov et al 74 empirically modelled crop yields of lint cotton average of field data 1 23 t ha 1 for the year 2006 using a vegetation index derived from landsat data r2 of 0 82 for two farms in uzbekistan cai et al 18 modelled crop yields of cotton r2 of 0 7 and wheat r2 of 0 67 based on in situ data of 2006 and 2007 and irs liss data spatial resolution of 23 5 m the average yields of lint cotton and wheat observed in the field amounted to 2 11 t ha 1 and approximately 3 5 t ha 1 respectively mariotto et al 67 identified high r2 0 9 using regression analyses for modelling crop yields of maize wheat rice alfalfa and cotton using data of the explorative hyperspectral hyperion system but without reporting any crop yield levels a semi empirical light use efficiency lue model was applied to multi temporal high resolution rs data 30 m for assessing crop yields in the fergana valley 64 for the period from 2010 to 2012 and 2014 cotton wheat and rice yields averaged to 3 06 t ha 1 average area 182 000 ha 4 53 t ha 1 144 240 ha and 2 97 t ha 1 16 872 ha respectively correlation of the results for all crops with the official statistics at the district level yielded an r2 of 0 71 the same approach applied to rs data of 2004 2014 returned yield levels of cotton wheat amounting to 3 04 t ha 1 4 65 t ha 1 and a value of r2 of 0 81 65 table 3 presents a summary of crop yields gleaned from various studies and a global comparison by averaging crop yields for the period of 2010 2012 and 2014 löw et al 2017a derived a map of crop productivity for the fergana valley the enormous variability of estimated yields underlined the impact of agricultural land and water management driver analysis integrating 23 environmental and socio economic indicators showed that e g cropping diversity significantly impacted crop productivity in addition distance analyses underlined that yield gaps increased with increasing distance from settlements the only regional map addressing crop productivity was derived from the modis npp 500 m data product 33 where npp is used as an indicator for yield levels under the assumption that cropping patterns resemble each other in all regions and all the years theoretically a lue model could be applied to the entire region but uncertainty is hard to quantify without sufficient in situ yield observations this in situ information is also relevant for the assessment of the harvest index i e the factor for converting npp to crop yield 5 4 irrigation water use crop water demands based on meteorological data and derived from temporal aggregation of etcrop for cotton wheat and rice e g 83 in a few provinces of the asb range around 900 mm 550 mm and 1 050 mm table 4 these values were found to be quite high compared to global averages for instance howell et al 47 reported 617 mm of actual water usage for cotton in california usa dong et al 34 reported 465 mm of actual water use for rice in china zwart 91 reported location specific results of actual water usage for wheat in various regions of the world including egypt usa mexico china and pakistan of 355 mm 395 mm 403 mm 380 436 mm and 467 mm respectively modelled information on water consumption seasonal etact in lebab province turkmenistan ranged clearly below water demand in 2010 2011 table 4 thevs et al 83 interpreted this result as a consequence of high water usage for leaching salts from the fields and potential systematic underestimations by the etact model applied conrad et al 24 modelled spatially distributed relative et etrel etact etcrop which indicates the efficacy of water supply for crop production and found both water oversupply etact etcrop and undersupply for the khorezm province in 2005 a water rich year in the amudarya basin www cawater info net it should be noted that values for etrel below 0 75 indicate critical production conditions due to water scarcity 77 awan et al 8 and conrad et al 24 analyzed irrigation performance based on water balances at farm and province levels in khorezm by modeling etact from landsat and modis data combining hydrological measurements of the components of the water balance supplemented by etact from rs based models depleted water yielded irrigation water use efficiencies of approximately 0 4 at both scales this indicator describes the use of water in relation to the provision of irrigation water to the system 9 the biggest challenge faced by water managers today is to produce more crop per drop of water use 87 this is becoming increasingly difficult with decreasing shares of fresh water for agriculture thus putting food security at stake 90 in such situations sustaining or increasing crop production in irrigation systems requires either increasing land and water resource consumption or increasing crop water productivity however differences in agricultural management water use salinity and climate change have led to variable crop productivity on local and regional scales according to platonov et al 74 water productivity of cotton derived from the combination of spatially distributed crop yield and etact based on landsat data at farm level in the syrdarya province uzbekistan showed great variability i e 0 kg m 3 0 54 kg m 3 about 87 of the farm land exhibited a crop water productivity of less than 0 30 kg m 3 on 11 of the area values ranged between 0 30 kg m 3 0 36 kg m 3 and only on 2 of the area showed a crop water productivity greater than 0 36 kg m 3 similar results were reported by cai et al 18 who modelled cotton crop water productivity for the same farm crop yield information was extracted from quickbird and irs liss data whilst etact resulted from thermal information provided by landsat numbers for the crop water productivity of maize winter wheat and rice were not given löw et al 65 showed potential improvements of crop productivities in the fergana valley which can amount to 1 t ha 1 and 1 4 t ha 1 for cotton and wheat respectively these gains are possible by addressing the effects of local geographical factors on crop yield including geographical field location irrigation system distribution and field position relative to infrastructure by analysing multi annual landsat and modis based estimations of water productivity at field level in the fergana valley löw et al 65 identified potentials to increase yields of cotton and wheat by 25 when reducing water stress in affected sectors of the irrigation system 6 discussion and research gaps despite the fact that the major part of rs based studies conducted in the asb has a methodological focus only 45 or is spatially limited to parts of the basin farms provinces or single time steps they contribute valuable information about the status of land and water use in the irrigated croplands results show that rs based information was rarely linked to ecological and socio economic data this is particularly interesting as such integrative assessments are considered essential for planning and managing future sustainable developments e g 76 data collection in the region requires local knowledge communication skill and official permissions thus many studies between 2008 and 2019 utilizing geodata integration e g driver analyses of land abandonment or cropping intensity 30 66 are available at the regional or provincial levels where ready to use and accessible generic information from the carewib database could be integrated in this context the collection of further environmental data e g groundwater recharge soil properties biodiversity socio economic data e g farm management parameters such as degree of mechanization chemical input etc digital legacy data on infrastructure data on water administration boundaries as well as the organization and management of data is urgently required 2 suitable data may originate from national monitoring programs and project reports of regional institutions but are often hard to access or unusable for external users e g due to missing metadata expanding ground based data collection in irrigation systems to other provinces e g in the upstream countries of the asb or in turkmenistan may complete the picture increased availability of digital secondary data would also allow for soil salinity assessments at larger scales a rs application that is still in its experimental stage 81 the review showed numerous assessments of cropland use in the asb however analyses of minor crops or plantations e g fruit orchards that typically exhibit intercropping 26 or private gardens are absent orchards and private gardens are essential components in irrigation management for example in uzbekistan private gardens are officially prioritized in irrigation water distribution hence in drought situations to better understand the complexity of irrigation water management and to gain knowledge on how rs can support herein both orchard types require more attention especially in view of food and water security or rural livelihoods for a more complete picture of the land use system integrative studies showing the interaction of land and water uses with biodiversity and natural ecosystems e g 72 28 are of high interest as already pointed out in a review about agriculture in ca by hamidov et al 45 one option for fostering regional assessments in the asb is the use of globally existing rs products e g modis npp or et products provided by nasa e g 33 in situ data in combination with modelling approaches at farm or province level may help evaluate the quality of such global products fritsch et al 43 showed for instance a systematic overestimation of global modis fpar products an important input to the modis npp product 84 in comparison to in situ data statistically upscaled to the khorezm province using rapideye data however such global datasets have an enormous potential for deriving indicators such as proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture and change in water use efficiency over time in the framework of the united nation s sustainable developments goals 2 zero hunger and 6 clean water and sanitation one shortcoming and a potential reason for the limited number of publications in the categories crop production and irrigation water use is seen in the absence of in situ data for validation the usefulness of validating rs studies with secondary data e g crop yields at the district level is questionable as rs based models mainly operate at the level of cells i e pixels rather than spatial aggregation in addition the credibility of official data is often debatable which makes their use comparisons impractical however such validation approaches at least indicate the plausibility of the results 56 regarding actual evapotranspiration etact validation of the approaches applied in the asb rely on the general validity of the models proven in other parts of the world 74 18 plausibility analysis of input parameters class a pan measurements 21 or other project reports 65 comparisons with eddy covariance and bowen ratio data often used for validation of etact 11 have been not reported as such data lacks for the asb but plausibility analyses would already benefit from an increased access to meteorological data from the region technically the integration of sar data in rs based applications is unexplored in the asb this technology may improve the separation of spectrally similar crop types such as cotton and maize 42 the monitoring of soil moisture and irrigation requirements and crop biomass 69 untapped potential can also be seen in the utilization of high resolution time series with data fusion as shown e g for landsat and modis 65 and in the use of thermal information for irrigated cropland monitoring 73 so far no rs study in the asb utilized the european sentinel systems 7 integration of remote sensing data into databases robust trustworthy data to support informed scientific decision making is essential for developing policies 32 this review underpins the potential of rs based analyses to supplement datasets and databases on land use land productivity crop production and irrigation water use e g as shown by dimov et al 33 recently the online web service wuemoca water use efficiency monitor in central asia https wuemoca geo uni halle de app started it was developed within the framework of the german initiative water in central asia cawa this tool provides access to numerous indicators approved by the sic icwc to be useful for regional water management in the asb 79 and is based on initial work by conrad et al 30 it integrates regional applications of yield modeling for cotton wheat and rice as well as s sebi based assessments of 10 day and seasonal etact for instance seasonal water consumption by irrigation etact can be aggregated at the district level and the scale of 5 km 5 km spatial grids as shown for the year 2011 in fig 4 a and 4b however the use of tools such as wuemoca as database or decision support instrumentin the land and water sectors in the asb is challenging but possible as indicated by abdullaev and rakhmatullaev 2 such databases and integrative tools can be seen as a first step towards digitization of irrigated agriculture and understanding of geodata integration in the asb experiences with wuemoca show that a transfer of the tool to regional stakeholders has to meet some requirements i e sustaining data integration and utilizing the information over project runtimes in a daily workflow further requirements include a clear definition of a limited number of target groups trust in rs based results and understanding of uncertainties common specifications of national and regional water administration authorities while considering differences among them and an awareness of the strong political top down approaches in ca to increase the acceptance and usage of the tool wuemoca for instance was designed for regional water distribution in the asb with a strong focus on 13 basin irrigation system administrations bisa in uzbekistan which were involved in the specification and development process as well as through information days and trainings however the fact that rs is yet not well integrated in the university system of ca as indicated by the low number of publications by authors from the region cf section 3 may reduce further development and communication of the tool and its potential strengthening digital technologies in research and education is thus an essential task for the can countries to adopt the digital technology in the land and water sectors 88 8 conclusions and recommendations against the background of a high and pressing demand for increasing sustainability of land and water use in the irrigation systems in the asb 49 peer reviewed journal articles that apply rs technology were investigated all focused on land use soil and vegetation status crop production and water use for irrigation regional assessments predominantly conducted with 250 m to 1000 m resolution data from modis showed the big picture of irrigated land use systems in the asb from 2000 to date rs based monitoring approaches at the national scale are rarely published and information at province or farm level show examples only these were mainly investigated using rs data with spatial resolutions of less than 30 m up to 250 m i e rapideye landsat and modis crop production and irrigation water use were mainly investigated at the farm and province levels many of these studies remained at an experimental stage only however these insights into the asb allow the tracking of the enormous water demands and water consumption for achieving intermediate crop yield levels in comparison to other irrigated crop production systems globally data integration into irrigation performance assessments at the system and farm levels may help to reorganize the distribution of water and subsequently to increase water use efficiency this was shown for the khorezm region in uzbekistan where most of the reviewed rs based analyses were conducted the limited availability of in situ information for validation particularly regarding crop yields and evapotranspiration underpins the necessity of setting a focus on linking field and rs based research it further stresses the need for national monitoring of the vegetation soil atmosphere complex in the asb one recommendation refers to the installation and instrumentation of validation sites e g by following the joint experiment for crop assessment and monitoring www jecam org an activity within the geoss network by nasa due to the fact that almost all of the rs based studies included in this review originated from international research strengthening cooperation between the international rs community and scientific institutions in the region is recommended this could help to provide workflows and tools for national monitoring systems in the irrigation sector of ca countries and afghanistan and to mosaic collected information e g for the carewib portal the latter is also assumed to increase the accessibility of secondary data this is important for analyzing the socio economic setting in the region and assessing risks e g of extreme situations and climate change from 2008 to 2019 the different rs methods at farm to province levels have increasingly been upscaled to regional applications they come with an enormous potential to fill gaps in databases e g with indicators as shown by the example of the wuemoca tool in turn these databases are assumed to contribute to indicator systems and to supplement the indicator system within the framework of the united nation s sustainable development goals however experiences show that the inclusion of wuemoca in the workflows of the target groupsis difficult participation of the policy level in the development process is necessary to increase awareness and promote acceptance of rs results in the land water and environmental sectors of the asb further rs studies and practical implementation of rs based

20137,icy mountains with their surface ice in glaciers and subsurface ice in permafrost constitute important water towers relating to multiple human needs for water security vanishing of their ice as a consequence of global warming affects this function in a predominantly negative way key impacts are 1 the formation of new lakes with new options for use but also changing risk conditions related to decreasing stability of surrounding frozen peaks at local scales of source regions 2 shifts in seasonality and higher inter annual variability of runoff which may affect water supply at regional to continental scales including the surrounding lowlands and 3 rising sea level at global scale long term effects over decades centuries and even millennia are involved making serious impacts inevitable already now and irreversible for generations to come sustainable adaptation requires comprehensive systems analyses including dynamic socio economic aspects keywords mountains glaciers permafrost lakes water supply flood hazard sea level rise 1 introduction mountains with glaciers and permafrost here for simplicity called icy mountains are important water towers for large surrounding lowlands 1 in addition to catching precipitation through general orograpghic effects on atmospheric circulation they also exert strong spatiotemporal storage functions in the water cycle with their snow and ice continued global warming causes an increasing reduction of snow occurrence in space and time as well as long term cumulative losses in surface and subsurface ice glaciers permafrost of icy mountains 2 these losses increasingly affect water security at local to regional continental and global scales 3 in many mid and low latitude high mountains glaciers and permafrost areas fig 1 are close to humans with their needs and infrastructure such aspects must be seen in the context of questions relating to supply and demand extremes droughts and floods and related risks the present short overview understands water security as the reliable availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health livelihoods and production coupled with an acceptable level of water related risks 4 the focus here is on the most important impacts related to vanishing mountain ice and the resulting consequences to be faced with conditions of a warming world the basic role of mountain ice in the seasonal water cycle and its fundamental importance for water supply is described in a first part current and likely future glacier and permafrost changes are then outlined in a second part the third part points to key effects from on going and probable future ice loss on water security at local to global scales this review concludes with a short outlook and recommendations concerning key aspects of ice related research and planning with respect to both water as a resource and water related risks 2 mountain ice and the seasonal water cycle the role of icy mountains for the water supply in adjacent forelands is undisputed today and has been quantified in several global studies viviroli et al 55 already showed that more than 50 of mountain areas have an essential or supportive role for water supply in downstream regions in this context the cryosphere i e snow and ice plays a fundamental role e g barnett et al 56 thereby research about the hydrological aspects of subsurface ice in mountain permafrost only recently started to develop 5 6 this long neglected component of cold mountain hydrology needs refined treatment at regional scales and over extended future time periods 3 huss et al 7 determined the contribution of snow and glacier melt to total runoff and the share of glacier melt in total melt for the world s largest basins which have their source area in ice clad mountains fig 2 the proportion of combined snow and glacier melt in the total runoff of river basins originating in the himalayas asia is especially high but the supporting function of the cryosphere in the north american and european river basins under consideration is also important in south america the cryosphere contribution to the total runoff is rather small but varies greatly from river basin to river basin the contribution of glacier melt to total melt is very small in asia north america and europe while glacier melt often dominates in south america can we conclude from fig 2 that with the exception of south america glaciers are only of secondary importance in the water balance in comparison with snow melt this question largely depends on the involved scale as the proportion of glacier area decreases with increasing catchment area the share of glacial runoff in total runoff in most cases also decreases however the conditions in the middle and lower reaches of glacierized catchment areas are particularly relevant because often more people live there than in the upper reaches and thus changes in runoff have a particularly large impact in the following we discuss the significance of glacial influences using the example of the rhone basin fig 3 which is around 5200 km2 and 11 of it is glacierized the valleys of this inner alpine catchment are dry with annual precipitation between 500 and 600 mm a around 350 000 people live there the climatic water balance results from the difference between precipitation p and actual evapotranspiration et it describes the average monthly flow quantities that theoretically would run off and clearly shows that in summer jjas much less water would be available causing a potential for summer droughts fig 3 the runoff observed for the rhone catchment however essentially deviates from such theoretical considerations this is primarily due to the effects of snow and glaciers i e the intermediate storage of precipitation as snow in winter the melting of snow in may and june and melting ablation of glacier ice from july to september although the contribution of glacier melt with around 15 of total runoff is much smaller than the contribution of snow melt with around 50 its timing is optimal glacier melt is at its maximum when the basin is particularly prone to drought and the contribution of snow melt to runoff has strongly decreased this glacier effect is particularly relevant in summers with low precipitation fig 4 the role of glaciers is supported by the fact that the runoff yield of heavily glacierized catchments is rather high i e heavily glacierized catchments glacier cover 20 produce the highest mean annual runoff above 1800 mm a in the alps 8 and in august during the intensive phase of glacier ablation runoff is as high as 400 500 mm month a further important feature of ice containing mountainous catchments is the similarity of the flow regimes from year to year fig 5 top thus the retention and depletion of snow and ice have a strongly stabilizing effect in the hydrological system the low year to year variability in flow patterns leads to optimal conditions from a water management perspective as it has a very positive effect on water security the year to year variability can be quantitatively described with the coefficient of variation standard deviation divided by mean value the smaller this coefficient is the smaller is the year to year variability fig 5 bottom compares the coefficients of variation in a glacierized catchment with one without glaciers both located within the swiss alps it depicts the stabilising effect of glacier melt in summer as a transient phenomenon this stabilising effect is even enhanced by climate change through excessive melting at still extended glacier surfaces as glaciers become smaller over time however their influence on runoff decreases and the conditions approach those of glacier free basins i e the flow regimes of single years are more and more determined by the interaction of precipitation and evaporation as a consequence summer runoff becomes more variable and water security with respect to water supply decreases global warming will markedly change the cryosphere thus under the rcp 8 5 scenario the glacier area in the rhone catchment is estimated to decrease from 11 today to 6 by 2060 and to 3 by 2085 median 9 this will result in a marked decrease in summer runoff as a result and reinforced by the increase in winter precipitation winter runoff will increase fig 6 at the same time as summer runoff will decrease water use will increase substantially as shown by brunner et al 10 these authors calculated the present and future water shortage surplus for approximately 40 sub catchments of the rhone until lake geneva by comparing annual runoff and water use today sub catchments with water surplus are the normal case by far at the end of this century however water shortage will dominate due to the changes in summer when glacial runoff will be reduced or even missing and water use will increase substantially especially due to the strongly increasing need for irrigation water in the dry inner alpine setting in addition the summer drought will be intensified by the expected decrease in summer precipitation 11 global warming leads to a seasonal redistribution of runoff but annual runoff volumes will not change significantly i e water storage in the wetter seasons is an interesting water management option three general aspects concerning the importance of glaciers for water security in comparable cases can be deduced from the alpine case study of the rhone cf 12 1 despite their comparatively small relative contribution to melt runoff and total runoff glaciers exert a substantial influence on runoff behaviour in summer 2 with the reduction in glacier area due to global warming the supporting effect of glaciers for summer runoff is decreasing thus global warming has a negative impact on year round water supply and water security through decreasing summer flows and increasing year to year variability 3 water security can of course not solely be attributed to the available water resources a complex interplay between changing water availability and increasing water demand growing cities globalized agriculture etc must be considered the extent to which such impacts from vanishing mountain ice affect downstream water supply and water security over extended distances greatly varies over space and time depending on many factors e g the glacial runoff contribution to total runoff varies within the rhine basin from 15 for the aare an important tributary to the rhine at the inflow into lake brienz 550 km2 to 2 for the rhine at basel 36 000 km2 and to 1 for the rhine at the german dutch border 160 000 km2 13 in a regional point of view severe consequences are foreseeable in regions like the subtropical andes with a pronounced dry season and rapidly shrinking mountain glaciers while minor effects are expected where precipitation primarily occurs during the warm season of melt water production as it is the case under monsoon conditions along rivers melt water mixes with various other water pathways such as shallow subsurface runoff groundwater fed base flow or water from wetlands all of which can have different transit times and buffering capacities in the example illustrated by fig 3 for instance the snow and glacier contributions together roughly make two thirds of the total observed runoff in july august and hence play a crucial role at this time of the year for many far downstream cases the relative contribution of ice melt to water use can however be limited 3 vanishing high mountain ice surface ice in glaciers as well as subsurface ice in permafrost characterize cold high mountain regions fig 1 the accessibility history of scientific research and availability of quantitative information however is largely contrasting between these two components glacier science started in high mountain regions such as the alps already in the 18th and 19th century 14 while systematic investigation of mountain permafrost was only initiated during the late 20th century 15 changes in both glaciers and permafrost are now monitored as terrestrial components within the global climate observing system gcos glaciers as surface ice are accessible through direct visual observation information about their occurrence and evolution in time is therefore much richer than the corresponding information on subsurface ice in permafrost which must be explored using technically logistically and financially demanding technologies temperate glaciers with ice at melting temperatures predominate in humid regions fig 7 while under dry continental climatic conditions periglacial permafrost with striking creep phenomena rock glaciers fig 8 in ice rich frozen materials like talus or moraines can be widespread worldwide volumes of mountain ice contained in viscous flow features rock glaciers of perennially frozen ground have been estimated to be smaller by about two orders of magnitude than those in glaciers 16 this first quantitative estimate may have to be expanded and refined because permafrost is far more widespread than such inventoried viscous flow features and because the thickness of perennially frozen

frozen ground as indicated by active layer thickening and terrain subsidence characteristically are in the range of a few centimetres per year and hence one to two orders of magnitude smaller than glacier thickness losses numerically modelled scenarios clearly show further shrinking of glaciers during the first half of the 21st century depending on policy aspects and corresponding climate scenarios this development will continue during the second half of the century either in a decelerating mode with fast and strong mitigation or leading to a more or less complete loss of glacier cover in many mountain ranges without mitigation fig 11 a large amount of glacier mass loss during at least the coming decades needs to be considered inevitable 21 due to the inertia related to heat diffusion processes at depth and the retarding effect of latent heat exchange induced by melting of subsurface ice the degradation and disappearance of mountain permafrost inside slopes is likely to take centuries or even millennia rather than decades 22 this means that permafrost in icy mountains is likely to continue existing even though in conditions of strong and increasing thermal imbalance after many glaciers will long have disappeared in the european alps for instance the amount of surface ice in glaciers is likely to fall below the amount of subsurface ice in permafrost around mid century already 23 melt water volumes from slowly thawing ice rich mountain permafrost however will only remain substantial in specific regions central asia 24 and at local scales large rock glaciers

security in connection with new lakes in de glaciating mountain regions must therefore be part of integrated and participatory planning with due consideration of the supply as well as the demand side 41 at regional to continental scales the most important challenge with respect to water security relates to the general shift in seasonality and to the increasing inter annual variability of water supply in rivers of large catchments and in extended lowlands surrounding still ice clad mountains with their water tower function the extent to which this impacts water supply and water security depends strongly on relative and absolute contributions of melt water to water resources at locations of their use as well as on the interaction with other processes characteristic spatial scales are tens to hundreds of kilometres with a clear tendency of ice melt effects to be diluted by other effects over growing down river distances primary impacts are due to increasing losses of water perennially stored as glacier ice especially severe problems develop where the ice melt season is dry cf figs 3 4 and 6 like for instance in central asia or around the subtropical andes with the likely disappearance of small glaciers above la paz bolivia the supply of glacier water to the city is expected to decrease by 12 at annual scale and by 24 during the dry season 42 cf 43 the seasonal shift from summer to spring of essential water resources for agriculture and irrigation around icy mid latitude mountains 44 can have important socio economic implications 45 transient additional melt water discharge from shrinking glaciers has already now passed its maximum the so called peak flow in catchments with small to medium size glaciers declining melt water input after peak flow will also be reached in catchments with large glaciers during the coming decades 46 only small amounts of water are expected to continue flowing for centuries to come from slowly thawing ice rich permafrost 16 reduced depths and velocities of river flow during warm seasons causing increased evaporation losses and river bed clogging have adverse effects on groundwater recharge moreover they tend to enhance temperature rise in river water and to negatively affect water quality with impacts on aquatic eco systems groundwater quality or cooling of nuclear power plants etc critical conditions develop where competing demands exceed the supply of usable water the comprehensive and comparative analysis by immerzeel et al 1 assessed the water tower function based on cryospheric precipitation and socio

but again the scale effect has to be considered the water tower function as described by immerzeel et al 1 refers only to the large river basins in small catchment areas however the importance of glaciers increases with the degree of glacierization especially in summer dry climates water volumes of new lakes in de glaciating mountains are small roughly around 1 percent of the presently remaining glacier volume and can only to a small part be made available using technical construction dams artificial reservoirs 39 which require careful consideration of hazards risk competing

loops on river morphology and related flood protection 2 the rate of sea level rise has now reached about 3 6 mm per year the fastest rate in the past about 6 000 years 47 thereby rapid melting of mountain glaciers and ice caps presently provides nearly 1 mm year and is likely to continue representing a primary source of sea level rise far into the 21st century 48 together with the contribution from ice sheets glacier melting now causes roughly half of the total to on going sea level rise with the other half being due to thermal water expansion in the ocean and minor other terrestrial sources the total potential sea level equivalent of the presently still existing glacier ice above sea level is estimated at a few tens of centimetres 49 most important sources are the large glaciers

mountains at various spatial scales is severely and negatively affected by long term impacts from global warming rapid losses in glacier cover during coming decades contribute to sea level rise and reduce the reliability of water supply for extended lowland areas during a critical time of the year when snow melt is essentially over evaporation losses dominate over precipitation and demands for water supply are high thawing of perennially frozen materials is much slower will continue to provide small amounts of water for centuries but over the same time scales also reduces the stability of

20137,icy mountains with their surface ice in glaciers and subsurface ice in permafrost constitute important water towers relating to multiple human needs for water security vanishing of their ice as a consequence of global warming affects this function in a predominantly negative way key impacts are 1 the formation of new lakes with new options for use but also changing risk conditions related to decreasing stability of surrounding frozen peaks at local scales of source regions 2 shifts in seasonality and higher inter annual variability of runoff which may affect water supply at regional to continental scales including the surrounding lowlands and 3 rising sea level at global scale long term effects over decades centuries and even millennia are involved making serious impacts inevitable already now and irreversible for generations to come sustainable adaptation requires comprehensive systems analyses including dynamic socio economic aspects keywords mountains glaciers permafrost lakes water supply flood hazard sea level rise 1 introduction mountains with glaciers and permafrost here for simplicity called icy mountains are important water towers for large surrounding lowlands 1 in addition to catching precipitation through general orograpghic effects on atmospheric circulation they also exert strong spatiotemporal storage functions in the water cycle with their snow and ice continued global warming causes an increasing reduction of snow occurrence in space and time as well as long term cumulative losses in surface and subsurface ice glaciers permafrost of icy mountains 2 these losses increasingly affect water security at local to regional continental and global scales 3 in many mid and low latitude high mountains glaciers and permafrost areas fig 1 are close to humans with their needs and infrastructure such aspects must be seen in the context of questions relating to supply and demand extremes droughts and floods and related risks the present short overview understands water security as the reliable availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health livelihoods and production coupled with an acceptable level of water related risks 4 the focus here is on the most important impacts related to vanishing mountain ice and the resulting consequences to be faced with conditions of a warming world the basic role of mountain ice in the seasonal water cycle and its fundamental importance for water supply is described in a first part current and likely future glacier and permafrost changes are then outlined in a second part the third part points to key effects from on going and probable future ice loss on water security at local to global scales this review concludes with a short outlook and recommendations concerning key aspects of ice related research and planning with respect to both water as a resource and water related risks 2 mountain ice and the seasonal water cycle the role of icy mountains for the water supply in adjacent forelands is undisputed today and has been quantified in several global studies viviroli et al 55 already showed that more than 50 of mountain areas have an essential or supportive role for water supply in downstream regions in this context the cryosphere i e snow and ice plays a fundamental role e g barnett et al 56 thereby research about the hydrological aspects of subsurface ice in mountain permafrost only recently started to develop 5 6 this long neglected component of cold mountain hydrology needs refined treatment at regional scales and over extended future time periods 3 huss et al 7 determined the contribution of snow and glacier melt to total runoff and the share of glacier melt in total melt for the world s largest basins which have their source area in ice clad mountains fig 2 the proportion of combined snow and glacier melt in the total runoff of river basins originating in the himalayas asia is especially high but the supporting function of the cryosphere in the north american and european river basins under consideration is also important in south america the cryosphere contribution to the total runoff is rather small but varies greatly from river basin to river basin the contribution of glacier melt to total melt is very small in asia north america and europe while glacier melt often dominates in south america can we conclude from fig 2 that with the exception of south america glaciers are only of secondary importance in the water balance in comparison with snow melt this question largely depends on the involved scale as the proportion of glacier area decreases with increasing catchment area the share of glacial runoff in total runoff in most cases also decreases however the conditions in the middle and lower reaches of glacierized catchment areas are particularly relevant because often more people live there than in the upper reaches and thus changes in runoff have a particularly large impact in the following we discuss the significance of glacial influences using the example of the rhone basin fig 3 which is around 5200 km2 and 11 of it is glacierized the valleys of this inner alpine catchment are dry with annual precipitation between 500 and 600 mm a around 350 000 people live there the climatic water balance results from the difference between precipitation p and actual evapotranspiration et it describes the average monthly flow quantities that theoretically would run off and clearly shows that in summer jjas much less water would be available causing a potential for summer droughts fig 3 the runoff observed for the rhone catchment however essentially deviates from such theoretical considerations this is primarily due to the effects of snow and glaciers i e the intermediate storage of precipitation as snow in winter the melting of snow in may and june and melting ablation of glacier ice from july to september although the contribution of glacier melt with around 15 of total runoff is much smaller than the contribution of snow melt with around 50 its timing is optimal glacier melt is at its maximum when the basin is particularly prone to drought and the contribution of snow melt to runoff has strongly decreased this glacier effect is particularly relevant in summers with low precipitation fig 4 the role of glaciers is supported by the fact that the runoff yield of heavily glacierized catchments is rather high i e heavily glacierized catchments glacier cover 20 produce the highest mean annual runoff above 1800 mm a in the alps 8 and in august during the intensive phase of glacier ablation runoff is as high as 400 500 mm month a further important feature of ice containing mountainous catchments is the similarity of the flow regimes from year to year fig 5 top thus the retention and depletion of snow and ice have a strongly stabilizing effect in the hydrological system the low year to year variability in flow patterns leads to optimal conditions from a water management perspective as it has a very positive effect on water security the year to year variability can be quantitatively described with the coefficient of variation standard deviation divided by mean value the smaller this coefficient is the smaller is the year to year variability fig 5 bottom compares the coefficients of variation in a glacierized catchment with one without glaciers both located within the swiss alps it depicts the stabilising effect of glacier melt in summer as a transient phenomenon this stabilising effect is even enhanced by climate change through excessive melting at still extended glacier surfaces as glaciers become smaller over time however their influence on runoff decreases and the conditions approach those of glacier free basins i e the flow regimes of single years are more and more determined by the interaction of precipitation and evaporation as a consequence summer runoff becomes more variable and water security with respect to water supply decreases global warming will markedly change the cryosphere thus under the rcp 8 5 scenario the glacier area in the rhone catchment is estimated to decrease from 11 today to 6 by 2060 and to 3 by 2085 median 9 this will result in a marked decrease in summer runoff as a result and reinforced by the increase in winter precipitation winter runoff will increase fig 6 at the same time as summer runoff will decrease water use will increase substantially as shown by brunner et al 10 these authors calculated the present and future water shortage surplus for approximately 40 sub catchments of the rhone until lake geneva by comparing annual runoff and water use today sub catchments with water surplus are the normal case by far at the end of this century however water shortage will dominate due to the changes in summer when glacial runoff will be reduced or even missing and water use will increase substantially especially due to the strongly increasing need for irrigation water in the dry inner alpine setting in addition the summer drought will be intensified by the expected decrease in summer precipitation 11 global warming leads to a seasonal redistribution of runoff but annual runoff volumes will not change significantly i e water storage in the wetter seasons is an interesting water management option three general aspects concerning the importance of glaciers for water security in comparable cases can be deduced from the alpine case study of the rhone cf 12 1 despite their comparatively small relative contribution to melt runoff and total runoff glaciers exert a substantial influence on runoff behaviour in summer 2 with the reduction in glacier area due to global warming the supporting effect of glaciers for summer runoff is decreasing thus global warming has a negative impact on year round water supply and water security through decreasing summer flows and increasing year to year variability 3 water security can of course not solely be attributed to the available water resources a complex interplay between changing water availability and increasing water demand growing cities globalized agriculture etc must be considered the extent to which such impacts from vanishing mountain ice affect downstream water supply and water security over extended distances greatly varies over space and time depending on many factors e g the glacial runoff contribution to total runoff varies within the rhine basin from 15 for the aare an important tributary to the rhine at the inflow into lake brienz 550 km2 to 2 for the rhine at basel 36 000 km2 and to 1 for the rhine at the german dutch border 160 000 km2 13 in a regional point of view severe consequences are foreseeable in regions like the subtropical andes with a pronounced dry season and rapidly shrinking mountain glaciers while minor effects are expected where precipitation primarily occurs during the warm season of melt water production as it is the case under monsoon conditions along rivers melt water mixes with various other water pathways such as shallow subsurface runoff groundwater fed base flow or water from wetlands all of which can have different transit times and buffering capacities in the example illustrated by fig 3 for instance the snow and glacier contributions together roughly make two thirds of the total observed runoff in july august and hence play a crucial role at this time of the year for many far downstream cases the relative contribution of ice melt to water use can however be limited 3 vanishing high mountain ice surface ice in glaciers as well as subsurface ice in permafrost characterize cold high mountain regions fig 1 the accessibility history of scientific research and availability of quantitative information however is largely contrasting between these two components glacier science started in high mountain regions such as the alps already in the 18th and 19th century 14 while systematic investigation of mountain permafrost was only initiated during the late 20th century 15 changes in both glaciers and permafrost are now monitored as terrestrial components within the global climate observing system gcos glaciers as surface ice are accessible through direct visual observation information about their occurrence and evolution in time is therefore much richer than the corresponding information on subsurface ice in permafrost which must be explored using technically logistically and financially demanding technologies temperate glaciers with ice at melting temperatures predominate in humid regions fig 7 while under dry continental climatic conditions periglacial permafrost with striking creep phenomena rock glaciers fig 8 in ice rich frozen materials like talus or moraines can be widespread worldwide volumes of mountain ice contained in viscous flow features rock glaciers of perennially frozen ground have been estimated to be smaller by about two orders of magnitude than those in glaciers 16 this first quantitative estimate may have to be expanded and refined because permafrost is far more widespread than such inventoried viscous flow features and because the thickness of perennially frozen

regional to global levels 53 this requires difficult agreements to be reached in complex local to regional national and global systems and subsystems a corresponding paradigm shift is urgently needed

20138,most research on hydrological risks focuses either on flood risk or drought risk whilst floods and droughts are two extremes of the same hydrological cycle to better design disaster risk reduction drr measures and strategies it is important to consider interactions between these closely linked phenomena we show examples of a how flood or drought drr measures can have unintended positive or negative impacts on risk of the opposite hazard and b how flood or drought drr measures can be negatively impacted by the opposite hazard we focus on dikes and levees dams stormwater control and upstream measures subsurface storage migration agricultural practices and vulnerability and preparedness we identify key challenges for moving towards a more holistic risk management approach keywords floods droughts disaster risk reduction risk 1 introduction worldwide floods and droughts are estimated to have affected 2 3 billion and 1 1 billion people respectively over the period 1995 2015 144 moreover their negative impacts have increased over the past century and are projected to increase in the future due to climate change population growth and economic growth see 164 and references therein clearly there is an urgent need to reduce the negative impacts of floods and droughts by implementing disaster risk reduction drr measures and strategies aimed at reducing both current and future risk this is recognised at the global level in the u n sendai framework for disaster risk reduction and the last decade has seen a shift from managing flood and drought hazards towards managing risk notwithstanding this progress most research on hydrological risks tends to focus on either flood risk or drought risk whilst floods and droughts are two extremes of the same hydrological cycle krysanova et al 78 show that many major river basins have had to cope with both recent flood and drought events there are myriad examples of interactions between major flood and drought episodes for example after a five year record breaking drought between 2012 and 2017 california received large amounts of rainfall causing major damage to the spillway of the oroville dam fearing its collapse authorities evacuated nearly 200 000 people 150 australia s infamous millennium drought 1997 2009 which severely affected the environment and economy of a large region 1 also ended with destructive floods 154 that led to the failure of levees along the murray riverbank 149 after this devastating event the continent returned to a state of severe drought while the underlying mechanisms that cause rapid changes from major droughts into destructive floods or vice versa are not fully understood they are often linked to large scale circulation patterns such as the el niño southern oscillation enso e g 170 climate change impacts including higher precipitation variability changes in snow water equivalent and rapid snowmelt can also contribute to rapid drought flood cycles e g 62 especially in snow dominated regions for example afghanistan experienced a snow drought in winter 2017 2018 that added to the existing multi year drought 63 by september 2018 the drought contributed to the estimated 9 8 million people or 44 of the rural population facing food insecurity 39 40 in march april 2019 heavy rainfall and rapid snowmelt then caused floods that resulted in 65 fatalities and affected over 200 000 people 65 on the other hand the natural interplay between floods and droughts is vital for many landscapes and ecosystems for example the morphological development of ridge trough pairs in the brazos delta texas is dependent on the natural cycle of floods and droughts associated with enso 47 also in the amazon basin floods and droughts alternate naturally resulting in seasonally flooded forest and communities adapted to this variability 112 in order to better design drr measures and strategies it is therefore important to consider interactions between these closely linked phenomena that are parts of the same hydrological cycle however in reality drr measures and strategies usually focus on either floods or droughts therefore actions taken to decrease risk from one hydrological extreme e g flood may unintentionally lead to an increase in risk from another hydrological extreme e g drought this issue was discussed in a recent paper by di baldassarre et al 28 mainly in the context of reservoir operations however there is still a broad lack of understanding on this issue therefore in this paper we carry out a literature review to examine examples of a how flood or drought risk reduction measures can have unintended positive or negative impacts on the risk of the opposite hazard i e flood drr measures impacting drought risk or drought drr measures impacting flood risk and b how flood or drought drr measures can be negatively impacted by the opposite hazard i e flood drr measures impacted by drought hazard or drought drr measures impacted by flood hazard note that this paper focuses on inland flooding although linkages may also exist between coastal flooding and drought risk this qualitative research is carried out in the context of a collaborative effort between the international association of hydrological sciences iahs panta rhei working groups on changes in flood risk and drought in the anthropocene the paper does not intend to provide an exhaustive review of all studies on this topic but brings together clear examples of these issues in an attempt to demonstrate its relevance for drr and drr science the review is presented in section 2 with knowledge gaps and challenges discussed in section 3 2 review first we review measures that are intended to reduce the potential drought or flood hazard followed by measures that are intended to reduce the potential exposure and or vulnerability in table 1 we summarise the findings for flood drr measures showing how they can positively or negatively impact on drought hazard exposure and vulnerability and how they can be impacted by drought table 2 provides a similar summary for drought drr measures fig 1 gives an example of some of the ways in which the drr measures mentioned in this paper can lead to a change in hazard exposure and or vulnerability and as a result flood drought impacts and risk it serves both as a a reading guide showing the numbers of the sections in which each type of drr measure is addressed and b a demonstration of the complex feedback loops that can exist between measures flood drought hazard exposure and vulnerability it should be noted that neither the figure nor the tables are intended to be exhaustive 2 1 hazard reducing measures structural measures such as dikes levees embankments and dams have been used for millennia to reduce the potential hazard also subsurface storage has been harnessed historically as a buffer against both flood and drought hazards in this section we investigate how such hazard reducing measures can impact and are impacted by the opposite hazard 2 1 1 dikes and levees dikes and levees have been built along large sections of the world s river systems and coastlines to reduce the flood hazard 98 163 here we provide examples of how flood levees and dikes can impact drought risk and how droughts can increase the chance of their failure 2 1 1 1 unintended impacts of measures on risk from the opposite hazard the failure of levees and dikes can exacerbate drought hazard for example vicuña et al 158 simulated economic damages associated with potential levee failure in the sacramento san joaquin delta on californian farmers they found that levee failures could lead to the halting of pumping operations thereby decreasing water supplies leading to land fallowing and declines in farm profitability and gross revenue for up to three years they also found that this could have knock on effects in terms of shortage costs for urban water users even without levee failure the entrainment of rivers within dikes and levees can lead to lower infiltration and groundwater recharge see section 2 1 4 this is discussed for example in opperman et al 107 who state that reconnecting rivers to their floodplains could increase agricultural productivity and lower the need to draw down reservoirs upstream thereby increasing opportunities for water supply hydropower and recreation during dry periods dikes and levees are sometimes wettened to reduce failure probability meaning that less water is available for other uses for example van lanen et al 155 report that during the summer of 2015 dutch water boards had to frequently inspect around 3500 km of drought sensitive peat dikes and that these needed to be wetted in cases where cracks were detected the dutch water act sets out a priority of surface water uses during dry periods 99 with the highest priority being the provision of safety and prevention of irreversible damage including ensuring the stability of dikes and levees the construction of dikes and levees can lead to increased development in the areas protected by dikes and thereby increased flood risk known as the levee effect 168 29 however this increase in exposure and socioeconomic activity can also place stress on available water resources therefore also increasing drought risk due to an increased number of water users exposure and their vulnerability 2 1 1 2 negative impacts of opposite hazard on measures there are many examples of dikes and levees that have failed due to drought conditions van baars and van kempen 152 state that drought was the cause of 5 of dike failures in the netherlands between 1134 and 2006 a well known example is the dike failure at wilnis in 2003 which led to 600 flooded houses and the evacuation of 2000 people 151 the failure was caused by the lower weight of the peat dike due to drought compared to the resulting water force which resulted in horizontal sliding 151 152 several examples also exist in australia during the millennium drought 1997 2011 hubble and de carli 61 report 68 failures of alluvial riverbanks on the lower murray river resulting from lowered river water levels and banks underlain by soft clay 61 channel widening 69 and extensive cracking examples from the usa include levee breaches and embankment failures in northern california when the 2012 2017 drought ended with a series of extreme rainfall events 149 150 2 1 2 dams dams and reservoirs can fulfill many purposes including storing water to reduce flood hazard and providing water in times of potential drought risk most dams have different functions throughout the year or even during one season of the currently existing dams 30 have multiple purposes 8 5 are used primarily for flood control and 17 are used for water supply or reducing drought hazard 84 2 1 2 1 unintended impacts of measures on risk from the opposite hazard the fact that dams serve so many different purposes makes them difficult to manage and conflicting interests and priorities could lead to unintended impacts flood protection favours low water storage in the reservoir thus reducing drought preparedness on the other hand drought protection tends to favour high water storage which makes dams more susceptible to overtopping or failure in the event of extreme rainfall where reservoirs serve functions of both flood and drought protection their management can be adjusted to prepare for each hazard for example 40 of the capacity of the folsom reservoir in california must be assigned to flood control 147 this can increase drought risk in the case of slow or absent replenishment such as in 1997 a drought following the 2018 kerala floods in india was worsened because reservoirs had been drawn down in preparation for the floods 81 dams play a key role in flood management by reducing high flows and flooding downstream 140 dams with gated spillways have greater levels of water conservation and flood abatement than those with a fixed crest spillway but are more susceptible to operational failure which can increase flood hazard downstream for small floods dam safety is of less concern for dam managers since dams are designed to withstand floods of a certain magnitude safely when there is a possibility of larger floods dam safety becomes a priority this problem is exacerbated when flash floods occur between drought periods due to a false perception of security 95 it has also been shown that the building of dams to create large reservoirs may lead to considerable volumes of water being lost to evaporation 15 increasing drought hazards in addition dams can lead to a perception of safety which can lead to increased exposure and vulnerability downstream for example di baldassarre et al 31 state that the presence of dams can lead to supply demand cycles and reservoir effects where increased demand for water can lead to higher levels of extraction and increasing vulnerability to drought due to over reliance on the reservoir a focus on drought management can also have negative consequences for the flood hazard an example relating to the floods in brisbane in 2011 happening after a multi year drought is provided by van den honert and mcaneney 153 they examined the water releases from the dam that serves as brisbane s main water supply according to their analysis dam operations may have been sub optimal due to neglecting forecasts of further rainfall and assuming a no rainfall scenario 2 1 2 2 negative impacts of opposite hazard on measures while dams and reservoirs are effective long term measures that help in reducing both flood and drought hazards they can themselves be negatively impacted by floods and droughts as the flow velocity in reservoirs is reduced sedimentation of suspended sediments takes place in most reservoirs 159 as river sedimentation is dependent on flow velocity floods contribute significantly to this sedimentation thereby reducing water storing capacity for reducing drought hazards vahedifard et al 150 report threats to dams and levees due to excessive sediment and debris flow exacerbated by wildfires during droughts a classic example is the infamous devil s gate dam in southern california which has turned into a large debris basin because of a series of postfire flood events 73 however the sedimentation of suspended solids behind a dam can also be used as a drought mitigation measure by enlarging the local aquifer storage capacity which is the principle of multiple sand dams see section 2 1 4 2 1 3 stormwater control and upstream measures urbanisation impacts the hydrological cycle in many ways for example through increased imperviousness that intensifies runoff formation and accelerates runoff response to precipitation leading to shortened times of concentration and possible effects on downstream flooding or through reduced evapotranspiration infiltration and groundwater recharge which may result in a decline in river baseflow and higher peak discharges in urban areas alterations of the hydrological cycle also include a network of sealed areas flow conveyance and piped drainages in this context stormwater control measures scm 44 are becoming increasingly popular as a supplement to or substitute for sub surface piped systems scm encompass a broad range of technologies that aim at changing the urban water management system to reduce flood hazard or improve pollution management likewise upstream measures intend to retain water in the landscape and reduce flood and drought risk examples of scm at the parcel scale include green roofs rain gardens vertical gardens soakaways and swales while on a larger scale they resemble natural systems with lakes dual profile channels in rivers and dry areas where restrictions benefitting the hydrological cycle are applied such as the dutch room for the river approach 157 room for the river puts new river intervention works into place like dike setback lowering flood plains reconnecting side channels and removal of bank defences 2 1 3 1 unintended impacts of measures on risk from the opposite hazard scm are fairly new and typically only one of the hazards is considered 143 while ashley et al 9 and rauch et al 116 propose theoretical frameworks for comprehensive assessments of scm practical experiences from applications are not provided in this regard rozos et al 125 and voskamp and van de ven 160 have examined the effects of integrated blue green infrastructure approaches in terms of synergies for both flood and drought hazard and suggest that the storage of water provides a source for evaporative cooling during heatwaves and a water source to prevent drought also they mention the increased recreational benefits of spaces intended for stormwater storage during dry spells examples include planting vegetation with retention ponds in the east lents floodplain project in portland oregon usa 59 and multifunctional spaces for surface water storage with examples in new york and phoenix usa and copenhagen denmark 124 there are examples of extensive infiltration leading to local flooding because of substantial recharge of groundwater in perth australia 90 as well as examples where the systems have been indicated to manage floods well in spite of the measures being relatively small such as the scotchman s creek catchment in melbourne australia 92 2 1 3 2 negative impacts of opposite hazard on measures droughts may have negative impacts on scm that use green areas and vegetation for example droughts adversely affect plants and mosses on green roofs by disabling the proper functioning of the water holding capacity nagase and dunnett 103 find that diverse or species rich vegetation on green roofs might be more resistant and resilient to drought they conclude that a diverse plant mix is more advantageous than monoculture in terms of survival rate and visual rating under dry conditions farrell et al 41 evaluated the effects of severe drought on growth water use and survival of five succulent species planted in three different green roof substrates differing in water holding capacity they conclude that green roofs in year round or seasonally hot and dry climates should be planted with species that have high leaf succulence and low water use in substrates with high water holding capacity 2 1 4 subsurface storage besides dikes dams and stormwater control which focus on managing surface water the subsurface is also used for implementing drr measures groundwater naturally acts as a buffer to both floods and droughts 45 for example floods can recharge groundwater levels which can mitigate droughts e g 97 in arid and semi arid areas groundwater is often the most or only reliable source of water with seasonal floodwaters in wadi systems the main mechanism of groundwater recharge in particular extreme floods are of great importance for groundwater recharge in these areas especially because abstraction rates exceed recharge in many of these aquifers implementation of flood control measures and peak discharge capturing measures is therefore important for drought mitigation 50 the subsurface is increasingly actively used for water storage for example with techniques such as sand dams managed aquifer recharge mar and aquifer storage and recovery asr with these techniques water available in abundance during the wet season or wet years is captured and stored in the subsurface in order to be recovered and used during the dry season or dry years subsurface storage is mainly used as a drought mitigation measure but it can also be applied for flood mitigation tackling the dual challenges of seasonal floods and seasonal water scarcity 2 1 4 1 unintended impacts of measures on risk from the opposite hazard substituting the use of surface water with groundwater can lead to unintended consequences for flood hazards for example continued pumping of groundwater during dry periods can lead to overdraft and lowering of the water table which in turn can lead to land subsidence due to the compaction of unconsolidated aquifer systems 130 the subsidence is often incremental but can sometimes be dramatic such as during california s drought in 2008 2010 where subsidence reached up to 270 mm per year in some places 42 the subsidence itself and the reduction in storage space can lead to an increase in flood risk for example when hurricane harvey hit houston in 2017 areas with the highest subsidence experienced the worst flooding 98 an innovative approach at the river basin scale to co manage floods and groundwater depletion is underground taming of floods for irrigation utfi which was piloted in south asia 68 this involves targeted recharging of excess wet season flows in aquifers to protect lives and assets downstream and boosting agricultural productivity in the region an evaluation to capture flood flows for direct groundwater recharge on private farmlands in the kings river basin california shows that flood flow capture when integrated with irrigation is more cost effective than groundwater pumping 10 areas with high inter or intra annual rainfall variability can use mar to capture and store water from extreme flood events and pump this water to supplement rain water harvested to mitigate the impact of drought events on agriculture 117 in the chao phraya river basin in thailand this technique is used to capture peak flows which can significantly reduce flood impacts and generate extra earnings for farmers who can grow high water demanding crops even in dry years 110 also in the mediterranean region and the south west of the usa managed aquifer recharge is seen as a water resources management technique able to mitigate water crises 133 10 maliva and missimer 94 note that it is important that mar systems designed to increase infiltration and water availability during drought do not cause unintended flooding in low lying areas which happened for example in mexico when infiltrated wastewater flooded agricultural fields 70 also unmanaged aquifer recharge such as recharge from urban irrigation during drought can cause flooding of basements 5 sand dams are rainwater harvesting structures used to store water in sandy riverbeds improving water availability during dry times for example in kitui kenya 500 of such sand dams were built over the last 10 years leading to more than 100 000 people with better access to water through a relatively low cost measure 82 however the positive effects on water safety are compromised when scoop holes are used as an access point causing pollution and resulting in water scarcity of good quality water 2 1 4 2 negative impacts of opposite hazard on measures droughts can make the subsurface less suitable for storing floodwater for example due to subsidence and compaction and by increasing surface runoff since subsidence permanently reduces storage space it also increases flood risks as has been demonstrated in san jose california and the houston galveston area of texas among other places 130 on the other hand flooding can damage the mar infrastructure 88 and cause clogging of infiltration ponds 94 which can impede infiltration into the aquifer more frequent flooding increases risks to groundwater pollution as overflowing latrines and surface flows can transport contaminants to the groundwater for example a devastating flood in alberta canada in 2013 caused contamination of drinking water wells with e coli along the floodways and flood fringes 37 a study of ramachandran et al 115 in india showed that a flood event of the contaminated adyar river negatively influenced the groundwater quality of the region this pollution of groundwater can result in increased water scarcity when quality standards are not met 2 2 exposure and vulnerability measures 2 2 1 migration the movement of people away from their usual place of residence is a common response to natural hazards the largest increases in displacement of people due to natural hazards are related to sudden onset climate related hazards and floods in particular 66 migration is generally seen as an increasingly important measure to reduce natural hazard risks 14 18 migration as a drr measure can either be part of a government planned relocation occur due to individual voluntary decisions or take place as forced displacement 14 100 migration can increase and decrease natural hazard risk as discussed in this section 2 2 1 1 unintended impacts of measures on risk from the opposite hazard migrants following unplanned forced displacement processes often face a lower socioeconomic status and higher vulnerability 14 162 these migrants are vulnerable due to their precarious socioeconomic status limited resources and lack of access to job opportunities and social security moreover the vulnerability of migrants can stem from a lack of knowledge and information on extreme events due to language barriers and distrust of authorities 35 for instance while studying migrants perceptions and personal experiences of typhoon hazards in shanghai wang et al 162 observed that they had a much lower risk perception compared to non migrants another source of vulnerability is the characteristics of locations in which migrants settle floodplains often have favourable conditions for human settlements and economic development but are also prone to flood hazards increasing urbanisation and migration pressure lead to an expansion of cities in more hazard prone areas such as mega deltas or water insecure areas with limited access to services 80 migrants when poor often end up in less favourable areas and slums 13 for example in senegal people populated the outskirts of dakar when escaping droughts and poverty conditions in rural areas 132 the world bank reports that 40 of new migrants arriving in dakar senegal between 1998 and 2008 have moved to zones with high flood potential 46 and currently the peri urban areas in dakar face serious flooding almost every wet season at the same time moving away from floods can also increase drought risk for example in 2000 mozambique suffered its worst flood in 50 years one measure taken after the floods was to relocate people to new settlements over 40 000 families were resettled from the hardest hit areas to less flood prone but more drought prone upland areas 168 for agriculture these upland areas are extremely poor and crop yields are low and here farmers are more prone to drought events 16 for farmers who resettled into flood safe areas and later suffered from water scarcity and drought the droughts were perceived to be more catastrophic than floods this often led farmers to return to the lowlands where they were again exposed to floods 16 another factor that makes migrants more vulnerable to hazards is the extensive urbanisation of the areas to which they move of the 17 million people at risk of being displaced by floods each year more than 80 live in urban and peri urban areas 64 the urban sprawl with increased impermeable surfaces can increase surface water runoff and erosion and therefore lead to more regular floods extensive urbanisation can also put excessive strain on local resources and infrastructure leading to water shortages or human induced drought e g 26 as a result migrants in search of land resources jobs and livelihoods may increase their vulnerability to recurring hydrological extremes an example of these dynamics can be found in athens greece where uncontrolled and unplanned urbanisation mainly resulted from the entry of thousands of refugees during the asia minor migration in 1922 and from internal migration after world war ii urbanisation resulted in a substantial reduction of water infiltration and led to increased runoff and erosion which has contributed to increased flooding in the city for the last 100 years 83 2 2 1 2 negative impacts of opposite hazard on measures there are also ways in which flood or drought hazards themselves can have negative impacts on migration as an effective drr measure vulnerable populations exposed to a natural hazard may face significant barriers to migration as they either do not have the means to migrate or the means to migrate as far as they would prefer 13 for example being exposed to a drought event was found to reduce migration flows in several contexts such as a reduction of international migrants from burkina faso 58 and female internal migrants in ethiopia 52 moreover when populations migrate as a result of being exposed to a flood or drought event hazard migration will become more disruptive as the migrants tend to be poorer and the migration is unplanned 11 2 2 2 agricultural practices and land use changes extreme floods and droughts have large impacts on agriculture which is also one of the human activities that consumes the most water given the close linkage between the agricultural sector and the water cycle many drr measures are used to reduce agricultural drought and flood risk e g structural measures to protect cropland from floods dams and reservoirs to increase agricultural water supply in field water harvesting flood and drought resistant crops crop or livestock insurance 35 67 some of these measures include those discussed in other sections of this paper such as dikes and levees section 2 1 1 dams and reservoirs section 2 1 2 subsurface storage section 2 1 4 and migration section 2 2 in this section we refer to other examples that are not described in the aforementioned sections 2 2 2 1 unintended impacts of measures on risk from the opposite hazard to reduce drought and flood impacts on agriculture some water stressed countries have developed water and soil conservation methods including water harvesting and waste water reuse in agriculture for example in brazil successive dams of stone have been built to create micro basins for soil moisture conservation involving local communities 54 this resulted in over 3000 successive dams being built during the period 2001 2009 which created microclimates that provided increased forestation recovered riverine vegetation recovered degraded areas increased biodiversity and decreased drought risk these small dams could also be favourable for flood mitigation e g 104 measures to enhance rainfall infiltration in the soil are often used to reduce agricultural drought risk an example is cross slope barriers which can pose problems during heavy rainfall as the reduction in drainage capacity can result in waterlogging of crops and reduced yields 88 93 this effect has also been observed when conservation agriculture is applied 31 water harvesting interventions are often integrated in headwater catchments of rural semi arid and arid regions to reduce runoff increase infiltration and reduce flood risk downstream these interventions may be used for restoration of the productivity of land with insufficient precipitation increasing productivity of rainfed agriculture and minimising the risk of drought and desertification 113 al seekh and mohammed 4 showed that runoff in the west bank is reduced by 65 85 with stone terraces and semi circle bunds compared to a control site the major advantages of water harvesting interventions are that they are simple cheap replicable efficient and adaptable 121 however wrongly implemented or upscaled interventions may result in increased topsoil erosion and gully formation and therefore increased sedimentation and flood risk downstream more water efficient irrigation technologies have a high potential to reduce water demand thereby reducing agricultural drought risk drip or micro sprinkler irrigation systems are more efficient than pivot or flood irrigation spate irrigation is an ancient irrigation technique that harnesses seasonal floods of rivers and streams to fill irrigation channels and is especially common in arid and semi arid regions as such applying spate irrigation combines drought mitigation with flood mitigation 50 another measure to reduce agricultural drought risk is the extensification of agriculture antwi agyei et al 7 discuss potential negative effects of this measure based on a study in northern ghana for example the conversion of natural forest land to agriculture could lead to a decrease in ecosystem services such as flood prevention the associated deforestation and stream bank cultivation can increase erosion leading to the sedimentation of rivers thereby increasing the probability of flooding for example in niger land degradation with increased river runoff soil erosion and sedimentation in the niger river enhances flood risk at niamey and also negatively impacts food production as irrigation water abstraction has become more complicated due to sediment deposition at pumping station inlets and in irrigation canals in the floodplains 141 126 the use of different crops and cropping practices can be used as a drought or flood risk measure leading to complex interactions for example reducing agricultural irrigation demands by changing to crops with higher water use efficiency could increase flood risk due to low evaporative losses producing more runoff during periods of intense rainfall 38 in flood prone areas farmers take the flood regime and susceptibility of crops to floods into account when selecting crops for cultivation 75 farmers in sub saharan africa for example plant short duration crops and have changed the timing of planting and harvesting to avoid intense rainfall periods 129 or dry spells 105 re or afforestation sometimes called eco drr of degraded land is also viewed as a viable flood mitigation measure for drr and climate change adaptation 40 in many agricultural areas however in dry periods the higher evapotranspiration and reduced groundwater recharge of plantations can significantly reduce dry season flow and cause water shortages in fiji establishment of plantation forests on degraded grassland caused reductions in dry season flows causing shortages to the urban water supply 165 in argentina establishment of eucalypt plantations caused a decrease of 50 in groundwater recharge days and an average decline of the groundwater level by 0 38 m 71 soil infiltration conditions play an important role in the impact of reforestation on dry season minimum flows 17 similar to observations by van meerveld et al 156 where higher infiltration capacities in the forested area favoured subsurface flow generation ogden et al 106 observed higher baseflow in a forested catchment in comparison to disturbed catchments in panama and attributed this to higher infiltration rates in the forest catchment and lower peak flow runoff in the wet season early warning systems ews allow farmers to adjust their cropping and harvesting practices when a particularly dry or wet season is expected seasonal forecasts have proven to be of high value especially in tropical and subtropical regions where a number of seasonal rainfall forecasts are currently operational 101 local trust in seasonal forecasts and in the organisations and governments that provide them takes time to develop 110 142 and the impacts of wrong forecasts e g farmers being hit by a flood event when having prepared for a drought season can lead to major losses and mistrust 21 101 traditional forecast methods have been important in farming communities that lack or have limited access to scientific forecasts 119 however an increasing exposure to erratic and more frequent severe extreme events has led to a decline in accuracy and reliability of some indicators that the farmers have used e g rain onset causing adverse consequences on crop production 120 2 2 2 2 negative impacts of opposite hazard on measures farmers in rainfed production systems have to choose their crop planting dates at the onset of the rainy season a false start to the season increases the risk of crop failure if it remains too dry sowing later in the season might be a good drought risk reduction measure however heavy rainfall and flooding at the onset of the season can result in leaching of nutrients out of the root zone thereby jeopardising its effectiveness 19 furthermore conscious crop selection can reduce agricultural impacts 75 for example farmers in areas facing reduced precipitation in sub saharan africa have switched from high to low water requirement crops 129 this entails the risk of lower harvests during unpredicted higher precipitation and flood periods 109 in terms of re or afforestation drought and heat are known to amplify tree mortality through increased fire and pest hazards 3 for example in the philippines fire has been identified as the major risk to the success of reforestation projects 6 forest fires have caused significant postfire increases in runoff peak flows and erosion leading to damaging floods and debris flows 23 in this sense droughts may affect the impact of forestation measures as a means to reduce flood risks 2 2 3 socioeconomic vulnerability and preparedness socioeconomic vulnerability can cascade from one drought or flood event to the next 48 for example drought induced unemployment can result in increased financial struggles during floods 122 and flood induced migration leads to increases in drought vulnerability through social marginalisation see section 2 2 1 measures aimed at reducing this socioeconomic vulnerability to one type of hazard can influence the risk to another type 33 however most scientific papers look at all hazards together the assumption is that measures to reduce socioeconomic vulnerability are beneficial for all hazards or can be regarded as no regret i e measures to reduce vulnerability to flood are also beneficial for drought and vice versa e g 33 167 measures that increase overall socioeconomic development do indeed seem to reduce vulnerability to natural hazards in general e g improving infrastructure 72 health care and hygiene 43 food and water security 111 diversification of agricultural activities or drinking water supply 57 access to markets 12 urban planning 60 and insurance 141 measures to increase preparedness awareness education or information early warning systems can also be beneficial for both extremes e g 56 but these do not always result in vulnerability reducing actions for example due to a lack of agency of the most vulnerable groups in society 104 128 some of these measures can however also lead to maladaptation unintentionally increasing vulnerability to floods and or droughts 2 2 3 1 unintended impacts of measures on risk from the opposite hazard the preparedness of a society is defined by undrr as the knowledge and capacity to respond to and recover from the impacts of disasters and is affected by risk perception risk perception relates to how people and institutions perceive the severity and likelihood of a hazard event 148 scolobig et al 133 explain that one of the reasons for inadequate preparedness to natural hazards is low awareness societies risk perception might differ from reality due to biases in risk information trust in weather services people s memory and risk adversity 91 a focus on preparedness for one hazard can therefore decrease the preparedness to another hazard and thereby increase its risk conversely preparedness for one particular hazard can increase the general hazard awareness irrespective of the type of hazard and thus positively influence the risk of another hazard 138 the media plays an important role in influencing risk perception after a systematic analysis of daily news for a period of 25 years of the most popular newspaper in catalonia ne spain llasat et al 87 show that the largest number of news items were related to droughts and forest fires followed by floods and heavy rainfalls although floods are also a major risk in this region this can lead to a false perception of low flood risk that affects individual and societal behaviour flood early warning systems suffer from uncertainties and false alarms that could result in considerable costs for example information from a flood early warning could prompt reservoir managers to release water but if the predicted flood does not come or is less severe than predicted this might result in water shortage 123 insurance micro credit schemes and diversification of agriculture have been found to reduce incentive for taking measures and undermine investment 120 136 141 and disaster relief projects by donors and ngos can increase vulnerability by creating dependency and undermining local initiatives 91 127 132 another example of where such vulnerability reduction measures aimed at one hazard can increase vulnerability to the other hazard can be taken from mexico city where residents of illegal settlements who do not have access to piped water can buy water from water trucks this can lead to increased poverty and a reduced ability to cope with flooding 36 several examples relating to water policy and governance also exist for example during the 2001 2008 millennium drought in southeast queensland australia the state government initiated major changes in water governance including a centralisation of authority replacing more cooperative models for water management this led to high levels of distrust and conflict amongst stakeholders the centralised system could not prevent building in the floodplain which increased flood exposure and during the 2010 flood event 57 2 2 3 2 negative impacts of opposite hazard on measures because most vulnerability reducing measures are intangible they are often not directly affected by an event there are indirect effects for example related to preparedness awareness perceptions and distribution of limited resources during a flood or drought event crisis management takes away attention resources and priority from other water related issues potentially increasing the risk of the other extreme it can be expected that flood memory decays more rapidly during a multi year drought as is exemplified by this quote of a local government representative in australia you forget because of 10 years of drought that land floods 14 3 knowledge gaps and challenges despite the fact that floods and droughts are two extremes of the same hydrological cycle measures and strategies for their risk reduction usually focus either on flooding or on droughts to some extent this may be explained by the fact that their typical temporal and spatial scales are generally different as a result of these scale differences as well as the complexity of different hydrological extremes researchers and practitioners often specialise in one extreme or the other moreover because many hydrological studies have focused on the catchment scale linkages between hydrological extremes across larger spatial scales are less well studied 53 a more holistic risk management approach that addresses both extremes would allow us to better address tradeoffs and synergies between hazards measures decision objectives and different temporal and spatial scales in this regard an important question is who wins and who loses for example who benefits from the construction of a levee and or dam and which parts of the population may face detrimental impacts how do benefits from structural measures change from the short term towards the distant future in terms of scm many of the technologies are based on very local measures but what is their influence on the hydrological cycle and floods and droughts outside the area in which they are taken in terms of migration what are the benefits and problems faced by migrants and the inhabitants of the areas facing in and out migration how will these change in the future how are these benefits and problems related to socioeconomic factors such as wealth gender age and so forth we need to develop methods to explicitly examine these kinds of questions from a holistic perspective to achieve this drr research and practice must be closely linked with climate change adaptation since both of these are essential for achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs the urgent need to integrate drr climate change adaptation and sustainable development is reiterated in the undrr s guidance note on using climate and disaster risk management to help build resilient societies 145 in this section we reflect on some key challenges for achieving this holistic approach that are specifically related to interactions between floods and droughts and their respective drr measures more basic research is required on interactions between physical climate processes that can ameliorate or aggravate floods and droughts dettinger 27 examined the role of atmospheric rivers as drought busters in the usa and huning and aghakouchak 62 discuss how changes in snow water equivalent and rapid snowmelt can contribute to rapid drought flood cycles however such research is scarce and an increased focus could improve our understanding of these interactions indeed the last five years have seen an increased attention for so called compound climate events defined by zscheischler et al 172 as the combination of multiple drivers and or hazards that contributes to societal or environmental risk initiatives such as the cost action damocles understanding and modeling compound climate and weather events are identifying key processes and combinations of variables that contribute to compound events developing new statistical and dynamic modelling approaches to better simulate compound events and developing a framework to improve their assessment much of this knowledge could be applied to improve our understanding of interactions between flood and drought risk moreover an increased understanding is needed of how interactions between physical climate processes will change in the future some regions may see an increase in both flood and drought hazard whilst others may see an increase in one hazard and a decrease in the other 8 in this regard a major challenge is knowing how climate change will affect the frequency and severity of both floods and droughts and importantly the likelihood of consecutive compound and concurrent flood and drought events e g 2 24 161 171 this has major implications for some of the drr measures discussed in this paper for example future climate change introduces a large uncertainty in delimiting safe areas for natural hazard related migration some local areas will become increasingly marginal as places to live in or in which to maintain livelihoods in such cases migration and displacement could become permanent and could introduce new pressures in areas of relocation 49 increasingly climate studies are focusing on trying to capture the correct combinations of variables in large ensemble probabilistic climate modelling studies however the uncertainty remains large and so other methods are also being developed that could be harnessed to improve the understanding and assessment of flood and drought interactions an example is the storyline approach in which studies try to develop descriptive storylines narratives or tales of plausible future climates instead of trying to quantify probabilities 135 this approach should be applied not only to single hazards but also to compound drought flood events beyond these physical processes it is of utmost importance to better understand complex human decision making processes and how they are influenced by interactions and feedbacks between hazard exposure and vulnerability in natural hazard risk assessments dynamic feedbacks between these components are very poorly represented 51 by improving this understanding we will be better able to understand potential implications of future changes in extremes and water availability around the world 29 agent based models provide a potential opportunity to assess these aspects such as that employed by haer et al 55 to assess flood risk at the european scale a key aspect with regards to human behaviour is risk perception trust and uncertainty for example migrating from a flood prone area to a drought prone area or planting drought resilient crops in a period of heavy rains 109 are faced with large uncertainties these uncertainties affect both trust in the usefulness of measures and risk perception and these aspects remain less well studied increasing our understanding of these processes would not only contribute to improved flood and drought risk management but also to the growing field of multi hazards and multi risk studies more broadly e g 22 24 48 we need to enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of measures themselves for example whilst there is already some understanding of the mechanisms that lead to drought induced dike and levee failure within the engineering discipline there is a lack of understanding of how these mechanisms can influence overall flood and drought risk at local and regional scales 69 with vahedifard et al 149 suggesting that there is a need to develop a framework for integrating drought and climate change risk in dike engineering design in terms of scms there is a lack of understanding of how the underlying technologies interact with other components of the urban and natural water cycle and quantitative knowledge is often scattered and site specific 137 despite the importance of groundwater groundwater management is often neglected especially in unmonitored areas often the population is fully dependent on groundwater resources for their livelihood but there is little awareness of the need for protection of recharge areas and groundwater management we must also improve our understanding of interactions and feedbacks between drm measures this paper shows many examples of how drr measures designed to reduce one of the risk drivers i e hazard exposure and vulnerability can unintentionally lead to an increase in one of the other risk drivers a particular challenge is quantifying how drr measures designed for one specific hazard e g floods can increase risk from another hazard e g droughts termed asynergies by de ruiter et al 25 these asynergies have been assessed in a handful of studies for various hazards e g 23 25 74 85 169 which could provide a starting point for studies specifically relating to flood and drought interactions this could allow decision makers and policy makers to make more informed decisions that consider optimal measures and combinations of measures across multiple hazard types when resources are limited drr planning often prioritises one extreme although maladaptation and unintended effects on risks from other hazards might outweigh the positive effects of the investment kreibich et al 76 suggest an integrated cost assessment cycle in risk management of multiple natural hazards it involves the continuous monitoring of all associated costs thus enabling the early detection of inefficient risk mitigation strategies kull et al 79 discuss how the use of a cost benefit analysis cba in drr could be used to account for these disbenefits thereby decreasing the likelihood of maladaptation as always a key to improving our understanding is good data based on reliable monitoring and observation systems this includes data on physical and socioeconomic aspects e g climate soil moisture river discharge groundwater population wealth vulnerability etc as well as ecological aspects and the effectiveness of measures as a complementary approach to available monitoring kreibich et al 77 suggest to collect a large number of paired event case studies of floods and droughts i e collecting data and information about various hazard exposure vulnerability and impact characteristics in the same region and how these changed between two consecutive events this panta rhei benchmark dataset looks at paired flood and drought events separately but could be extended to include flood drought and drought flood event pairs additionally we need to also devise other new ways to monitor changes in the effectiveness of measures over time for example the performance of scms is likely to change over time with periods of drought being detrimental for the intended performance there is little long term empirical analysis that tests the effectiveness of small scale water harvesting interventions such as sand dams during droughts therefore continued observations are essential but importantly data need to be made available for use in research if we are to improve our understanding for example most reservoir operating data are not publicly available which hampers the development of new knowledge when it comes to understanding human responses to flood and drought hazards the availability of such data would allow us to better quantify the economic social and ecological damage caused by floods and droughts as well as the pros and cons of drr measures to achieve a more holistic multi hazard approach to floods and droughts changes in governance structures will be required a framework for multi risk governance has been developed by scolobig et al 134 which includes decision making processes related to all phases of drr in its development the authors describe several institutional barriers faced by practitioners namely single risk centred regulation and institutional framework different goals and priorities of the agencies in charge of hazard management unsatisfactory public private partnerships different responsibilities for risk reduction at household level lack of interagency communication and lack of capacities at the local level many of these considerations are pertinent for the management of floods and droughts and their interactions for example flood and drought risk management practices are often part of separate government departments 57 and whilst the european union has developed a flood directive there is no specific european directive on droughts raikes et al 114 argue that flood risk management focuses on land use and urban planning and is increasingly risk oriented and proactive whereas drought management focuses on water supply and agriculture and often mostly still consists of emergency responses interaction between the institutions involved in flood and drought management may lead to mutual gains for both hazards addressing these knowledge gaps and challenges requires interdisciplinary research and collaboration between science and practice various frameworks networks and partnerships are developing to address this at international levels such as the undrr global risk assessment framework graf the knowledge action network on emergent risks and extreme events risk kan and the newly launched european geosciences union multi hazards subdivision guidelines are also being developed to help train water managers to take a more integrated approach to flood and drought risk management 146 the research leading to this paper is a collaboration between flood and drought related panta rhei working groups of the iahs working groups on changes in flood risk and drought in the anthropocene respectively demonstrating that there is now increasing impetus to move water related disaster risk management towards a more holistic multi risk approach the findings in this paper serve to illuminate the relevance of more explicitly examining flood and drought

20138,most research on hydrological risks focuses either on flood risk or drought risk whilst floods and droughts are two extremes of the same hydrological cycle to better design disaster risk reduction drr measures and strategies it is important to consider interactions between these closely linked phenomena we show examples of a how flood or drought drr measures can have unintended positive or negative impacts on risk of the opposite hazard and b how flood or drought drr measures can be negatively impacted by the opposite hazard we focus on dikes and levees dams stormwater control and upstream measures subsurface storage migration agricultural practices and vulnerability and preparedness we identify key challenges for moving towards a more holistic risk management approach keywords floods droughts disaster risk reduction risk 1 introduction worldwide floods and droughts are estimated to have affected 2 3 billion and 1 1 billion people respectively over the period 1995 2015 144 moreover their negative impacts have increased over the past century and are projected to increase in the future due to climate change population growth and economic growth see 164 and references therein clearly there is an urgent need to reduce the negative impacts of floods and droughts by implementing disaster risk reduction drr measures and strategies aimed at reducing both current and future risk this is recognised at the global level in the u n sendai framework for disaster risk reduction and the last decade has seen a shift from managing flood and drought hazards towards managing risk notwithstanding this progress most research on hydrological risks tends to focus on either flood risk or drought risk whilst floods and droughts are two extremes of the same hydrological cycle krysanova et al 78 show that many major river basins have had to cope with both recent flood and drought events there are myriad examples of interactions between major flood and drought episodes for example after a five year record breaking drought between 2012 and 2017 california received large amounts of rainfall causing major damage to the spillway of the oroville dam fearing its collapse authorities evacuated nearly 200 000 people 150 australia s infamous millennium drought 1997 2009 which severely affected the environment and economy of a large region 1 also ended with destructive floods 154 that led to the failure of levees along the murray riverbank 149 after this devastating event the continent returned to a state of severe drought while the underlying mechanisms that cause rapid changes from major droughts into destructive floods or vice versa are not fully understood they are often linked to large scale circulation patterns such as the el niño southern oscillation enso e g 170 climate change impacts including higher precipitation variability changes in snow water equivalent and rapid snowmelt can also contribute to rapid drought flood cycles e g 62 especially in snow dominated regions for example afghanistan experienced a snow drought in winter 2017 2018 that added to the existing multi year drought 63 by september 2018 the drought contributed to the estimated 9 8 million people or 44 of the rural population facing food insecurity 39 40 in march april 2019 heavy rainfall and rapid snowmelt then caused floods that resulted in 65 fatalities and affected over 200 000 people 65 on the other hand the natural interplay between floods and droughts is vital for many landscapes and ecosystems for example the morphological development of ridge trough pairs in the brazos delta texas is dependent on the natural cycle of floods and droughts associated with enso 47 also in the amazon basin floods and droughts alternate naturally resulting in seasonally flooded forest and communities adapted to this variability 112 in order to better design drr measures and strategies it is therefore important to consider interactions between these closely linked phenomena that are parts of the same hydrological cycle however in reality drr measures and strategies usually focus on either floods or droughts therefore actions taken to decrease risk from one hydrological extreme e g flood may unintentionally lead to an increase in risk from another hydrological extreme e g drought this issue was discussed in a recent paper by di baldassarre et al 28 mainly in the context of reservoir operations however there is still a broad lack of understanding on this issue therefore in this paper we carry out a literature review to examine examples of a how flood or drought risk reduction measures can have unintended positive or negative impacts on the risk of the opposite hazard i e flood drr measures impacting drought risk or drought drr measures impacting flood risk and b how flood or drought drr measures can be negatively impacted by the opposite hazard i e flood drr measures impacted by drought hazard or drought drr measures impacted by flood hazard note that this paper focuses on inland flooding although linkages may also exist between coastal flooding and drought risk this qualitative research is carried out in the context of a collaborative effort between the international association of hydrological sciences iahs panta rhei working groups on changes in flood risk and drought in the anthropocene the paper does not intend to provide an exhaustive review of all studies on this topic but brings together clear examples of these issues in an attempt to demonstrate its relevance for drr and drr science the review is presented in section 2 with knowledge gaps and challenges discussed in section 3 2 review first we review measures that are intended to reduce the potential drought or flood hazard followed by measures that are intended to reduce the potential exposure and or vulnerability in table 1 we summarise the findings for flood drr measures showing how they can positively or negatively impact on drought hazard exposure and vulnerability and how they can be impacted by drought table 2 provides a similar summary for drought drr measures fig 1 gives an example of some of the ways in which the drr measures mentioned in this paper can lead to a change in hazard exposure and or vulnerability and as a result flood drought impacts and risk it serves both as a a reading guide showing the numbers of the sections in which each type of drr measure is addressed and b a demonstration of the complex feedback loops that can exist between measures flood drought hazard exposure and vulnerability it should be noted that neither the figure nor the tables are intended to be exhaustive 2 1 hazard reducing measures structural measures such as dikes levees embankments and dams have been used for millennia to reduce the potential hazard also subsurface storage has been harnessed historically as a buffer against both flood and drought hazards in this section we investigate how such hazard reducing measures can impact and are impacted by the opposite hazard 2 1 1 dikes and levees dikes and levees have been built along large sections of the world s river systems and coastlines to reduce the flood hazard 98 163 here we provide examples of how flood levees and dikes can impact drought risk and how droughts can increase the chance of their failure 2 1 1 1 unintended impacts of measures on risk from the opposite hazard the failure of levees and dikes can exacerbate drought hazard for example vicuña et al 158 simulated economic damages associated with potential levee failure in the sacramento san joaquin delta on californian farmers they found that levee failures could lead to the halting of pumping operations thereby decreasing water supplies leading to land fallowing and declines in farm profitability and gross revenue for up to three years they also found that this could have knock on effects in terms of shortage costs for urban water users even without levee failure the entrainment of rivers within dikes and levees can lead to lower infiltration and groundwater recharge see section 2 1 4 this is discussed for example in opperman et al 107 who state that reconnecting rivers to their floodplains could increase agricultural productivity and lower the need to draw down reservoirs upstream thereby increasing opportunities for water supply hydropower and recreation during dry periods dikes and levees are sometimes wettened to reduce failure probability meaning that less water is available for other uses for example van lanen et al 155 report that during the summer of 2015 dutch water boards had to frequently inspect around 3500 km of drought sensitive peat dikes and that these needed to be wetted in cases where cracks were detected the dutch water act sets out a priority of surface water uses during dry periods 99 with the highest priority being the provision of safety and prevention of irreversible damage including ensuring the stability of dikes and levees the construction of dikes and levees can lead to increased development in the areas protected by dikes and thereby increased flood risk known as the levee effect 168 29 however this increase in exposure and socioeconomic activity can also place stress on available water resources therefore also increasing drought risk due to an increased number of water users exposure and their vulnerability 2 1 1 2 negative impacts of opposite hazard on measures there are many examples of dikes and levees that have failed due to drought conditions van baars and van kempen 152 state that drought was the cause of 5 of dike failures in the netherlands between 1134 and 2006 a well known example is the dike failure at wilnis in 2003 which led to 600 flooded houses and the evacuation of 2000 people 151 the failure was caused by the lower weight of the peat dike due to drought compared to the resulting water force which resulted in horizontal sliding 151 152 several examples also exist in australia during the millennium drought 1997 2011 hubble and de carli 61 report 68 failures of alluvial riverbanks on the lower murray river resulting from lowered river water levels and banks underlain by soft clay 61 channel widening 69 and extensive cracking examples from the usa include levee breaches and embankment failures in northern california when the 2012 2017 drought ended with a series of extreme rainfall events 149 150 2 1 2 dams dams and reservoirs can fulfill many purposes including storing water to reduce flood hazard and providing water in times of potential drought risk most dams have different functions throughout the year or even during one season of the currently existing dams 30 have multiple purposes 8 5 are used primarily for flood control and 17 are used for water supply or reducing drought hazard 84 2 1 2 1 unintended impacts of measures on risk from the opposite hazard the fact that dams serve so many different purposes makes them difficult to manage and conflicting interests and priorities could lead to unintended impacts flood protection favours low water storage in the reservoir thus reducing drought preparedness on the other hand drought protection tends to favour high water storage which makes dams more susceptible to overtopping or failure in the event of extreme rainfall where reservoirs serve functions of both flood and drought protection their management can be adjusted to prepare for each hazard for example 40 of the capacity of the folsom reservoir in california must be assigned to flood control 147 this can increase drought risk in the case of slow or absent replenishment such as in 1997 a drought following the 2018 kerala floods in india was worsened because reservoirs had been drawn down in preparation for the floods 81 dams play a key role in flood management by reducing high flows and flooding downstream 140 dams with gated spillways have greater levels of water conservation and flood abatement than those with a fixed crest spillway but are more susceptible to operational failure which can increase flood hazard downstream for small floods dam safety is of less concern for dam managers since dams are designed to withstand floods of a certain magnitude safely when there is a possibility of larger floods dam safety becomes a priority this problem is exacerbated when flash floods occur between drought periods due to a false perception of security 95 it has also been shown that the building of dams to create large reservoirs may lead to considerable volumes of water being lost to evaporation 15 increasing drought hazards in addition dams can lead to a perception of safety which can lead to increased exposure and vulnerability downstream for example di baldassarre et al 31 state that the presence of dams can lead to supply demand cycles and reservoir effects where increased demand for water can lead to higher levels of extraction and increasing vulnerability to drought due to over reliance on the reservoir a focus on drought management can also have negative consequences for the flood hazard an example relating to the floods in brisbane in 2011 happening after a multi year drought is provided by van den honert and mcaneney 153 they examined the water releases from the dam that serves as brisbane s main water supply according to their analysis dam operations may have been sub optimal due to neglecting forecasts of further rainfall and assuming a no rainfall scenario 2 1 2 2 negative impacts of opposite hazard on measures while dams and reservoirs are effective long term measures that help in reducing both flood and drought hazards they can themselves be negatively impacted by floods and droughts as the flow velocity in reservoirs is reduced sedimentation of suspended sediments takes place in most reservoirs 159 as river sedimentation is dependent on flow velocity floods contribute significantly to this sedimentation thereby reducing water storing capacity for reducing drought hazards vahedifard et al 150 report threats to dams and levees due to excessive sediment and debris flow exacerbated by wildfires during droughts a classic example is the infamous devil s gate dam in southern california which has turned into a large debris basin because of a series of postfire flood events 73 however the sedimentation of suspended solids behind a dam can also be used as a drought mitigation measure by enlarging the local aquifer storage capacity which is the principle of multiple sand dams see section 2 1 4 2 1 3 stormwater control and upstream measures urbanisation impacts the hydrological cycle in many ways for example through increased imperviousness that intensifies runoff formation and accelerates runoff response to precipitation leading to shortened times of concentration and possible effects on downstream flooding or through reduced evapotranspiration infiltration and groundwater recharge which may result in a decline in river baseflow and higher peak discharges in urban areas alterations of the hydrological cycle also include a network of sealed areas flow conveyance and piped drainages in this context stormwater control measures scm 44 are becoming increasingly popular as a supplement to or substitute for sub surface piped systems scm encompass a broad range of technologies that aim at changing the urban water management system to reduce flood hazard or improve pollution management likewise upstream measures intend to retain water in the landscape and reduce flood and drought risk examples of scm at the parcel scale include green roofs rain gardens vertical gardens soakaways and swales while on a larger scale they resemble natural systems with lakes dual profile channels in rivers and dry areas where restrictions benefitting the hydrological cycle are applied such as the dutch room for the river approach 157 room for the river puts new river intervention works into place like dike setback lowering flood plains reconnecting side channels and removal of bank defences 2 1 3 1 unintended impacts of measures on risk from the opposite hazard scm are fairly new and typically only one of the hazards is considered 143 while ashley et al 9 and rauch et al 116 propose theoretical frameworks for comprehensive assessments of scm practical experiences from applications are not provided in this regard rozos et al 125 and voskamp and van de ven 160 have examined the effects of integrated blue green infrastructure approaches in terms of synergies for both flood and drought hazard and suggest that the storage of water provides a source for evaporative cooling during heatwaves and a water source to prevent drought also they mention the increased recreational benefits of spaces intended for stormwater storage during dry spells examples include planting vegetation with retention ponds in the east lents floodplain project in portland oregon usa 59 and multifunctional spaces for surface water storage with examples in new york and phoenix usa and copenhagen denmark 124 there are examples of extensive infiltration leading to local flooding because of substantial recharge of groundwater in perth australia 90 as well as examples where the systems have been indicated to manage floods well in spite of the measures being relatively small such as the scotchman s creek catchment in melbourne australia 92 2 1 3 2 negative impacts of opposite hazard on measures droughts may have negative impacts on scm that use green areas and vegetation for example droughts adversely affect plants and mosses on green roofs by disabling the proper functioning of the water holding capacity nagase and dunnett 103 find that diverse or species rich vegetation on green roofs might be more resistant and resilient to drought they conclude that a diverse plant mix is more advantageous than monoculture in terms of survival rate and visual rating under dry conditions farrell et al 41 evaluated the effects of severe drought on growth water use and survival of five succulent species planted in three different green roof substrates differing in water holding capacity they conclude that green roofs in year round or seasonally hot and dry climates should be planted with species that have high leaf succulence and low water use in substrates with high water holding capacity 2 1 4 subsurface storage besides dikes dams and stormwater control which focus on managing surface water the subsurface is also used for implementing drr measures groundwater naturally acts as a buffer to both floods and droughts 45 for example floods can recharge groundwater levels which can mitigate droughts e g 97 in arid and semi arid areas groundwater is often the most or only reliable source of water with seasonal floodwaters in wadi systems the main mechanism of groundwater recharge in particular extreme floods are of great importance for groundwater recharge in these areas especially because abstraction rates exceed recharge in many of these aquifers implementation of flood control measures and peak discharge capturing measures is therefore important for drought mitigation 50 the subsurface is increasingly actively used for water storage for example with techniques such as sand dams managed aquifer recharge mar and aquifer storage and recovery asr with these techniques water available in abundance during the wet season or wet years is captured and stored in the subsurface in order to be recovered and used during the dry season or dry years subsurface storage is mainly used as a drought mitigation measure but it can also be applied for flood mitigation tackling the dual challenges of seasonal floods and seasonal water scarcity 2 1 4 1 unintended impacts of measures on risk from the opposite hazard substituting the use of surface water with groundwater can lead to unintended consequences for flood hazards for example continued pumping of groundwater during dry periods can lead to overdraft and lowering of the water table which in turn can lead to land subsidence due to the compaction of unconsolidated aquifer systems 130 the subsidence is often incremental but can sometimes be dramatic such as during california s drought in 2008 2010 where subsidence reached up to 270 mm per year in some places 42 the subsidence itself and the reduction in storage space can lead to an increase in flood risk for example when hurricane harvey hit houston in 2017 areas with the highest subsidence experienced the worst flooding 98 an innovative approach at the river basin scale to co manage floods and groundwater depletion is underground taming of floods for irrigation utfi which was piloted in south asia 68 this involves targeted recharging of excess wet season flows in aquifers to protect lives and assets downstream and boosting agricultural productivity in the region an evaluation to capture flood flows for direct groundwater recharge on private farmlands in the kings river basin california shows that flood flow capture when integrated with irrigation is more cost effective than groundwater pumping 10 areas with high inter or intra annual rainfall variability can use mar to capture and store water from extreme flood events and pump this water to supplement rain water harvested to mitigate the impact of drought events on agriculture 117 in the chao phraya river basin in thailand this technique is used to capture peak flows which can significantly reduce flood impacts and generate extra earnings for farmers who can grow high water demanding crops even in dry years 110 also in the mediterranean region and the south west of the usa managed aquifer recharge is seen as a water resources management technique able to mitigate water crises 133 10 maliva and missimer 94 note that it is important that mar systems designed to increase infiltration and water availability during drought do not cause unintended flooding in low lying areas which happened for example in mexico when infiltrated wastewater flooded agricultural fields 70 also unmanaged aquifer recharge such as recharge from urban irrigation during drought can cause flooding of basements 5 sand dams are rainwater harvesting structures used to store water in sandy riverbeds improving water availability during dry times for example in kitui kenya 500 of such sand dams were built over the last 10 years leading to more than 100 000 people with better access to water through a relatively low cost measure 82 however the positive effects on water safety are compromised when scoop holes are used as an access point causing pollution and resulting in water scarcity of good quality water 2 1 4 2 negative impacts of opposite hazard on measures droughts can make the subsurface less suitable for storing floodwater for example due to subsidence and compaction and by increasing surface runoff since subsidence permanently reduces storage space it also increases flood risks as has been demonstrated in san jose california and the houston galveston area of texas among other places 130 on the other hand flooding can damage the mar infrastructure 88 and cause clogging of infiltration ponds 94 which can impede infiltration into the aquifer more frequent flooding increases risks to groundwater pollution as overflowing latrines and surface flows can transport contaminants to the groundwater for example a devastating flood in alberta canada in 2013 caused contamination of drinking water wells with e coli along the floodways and flood fringes 37 a study of ramachandran et al 115 in india showed that a flood event of the contaminated adyar river negatively influenced the groundwater quality of the region this pollution of groundwater can result in increased water scarcity when quality standards are not met 2 2 exposure and vulnerability measures 2 2 1 migration the movement of people away from their usual place of residence is a common response to natural hazards the largest increases in displacement of people due to natural hazards are related to sudden onset climate related hazards and floods in particular 66 migration is generally seen as an increasingly important measure to reduce natural hazard risks 14 18 migration as a drr measure can either be part of a government planned relocation occur due to individual voluntary decisions or take place as forced displacement 14 100 migration can increase and decrease natural hazard risk as discussed in this section 2 2 1 1 unintended impacts of measures on risk from the opposite hazard migrants following unplanned forced displacement processes often face a lower socioeconomic status and higher vulnerability 14 162 these migrants are vulnerable due to their precarious socioeconomic status limited resources and lack of access to job opportunities and social security moreover the vulnerability of migrants can stem from a lack of knowledge and information on extreme events due to language barriers and distrust of authorities 35 for instance while studying migrants perceptions and personal experiences of typhoon hazards in shanghai wang et al 162 observed that they had a much lower risk perception compared to non migrants another source of vulnerability is the characteristics of locations in which migrants settle floodplains often have favourable conditions for human settlements and economic development but are also prone to flood hazards increasing urbanisation and migration pressure lead to an expansion of cities in more hazard prone areas such as mega deltas or water insecure areas with limited access to services 80 migrants when poor often end up in less favourable areas and slums 13 for example in senegal people populated the outskirts of dakar when escaping droughts and poverty conditions in rural areas 132 the world bank reports that 40 of new migrants arriving in dakar senegal between 1998 and 2008 have moved to zones with high flood potential 46 and currently the peri urban areas in dakar face serious flooding almost every wet season at the same time moving away from floods can also increase drought risk for example in 2000 mozambique suffered its worst flood in 50 years one measure taken after the floods was to relocate people to new settlements over 40 000 families were resettled from the hardest hit areas to less flood prone but more drought prone upland areas 168 for agriculture these upland areas are extremely poor and crop yields are low and here farmers are more prone to drought events 16 for farmers who resettled into flood safe areas and later suffered from water scarcity and drought the droughts were perceived to be more catastrophic than floods this often led farmers to return to the lowlands where they were again exposed to floods 16 another factor that makes migrants more vulnerable to hazards is the extensive urbanisation of the areas to which they move of the 17 million people at risk of being displaced by floods each year more than 80 live in urban and peri urban areas 64 the urban sprawl with increased impermeable surfaces can increase surface water runoff and erosion and therefore lead to more regular floods extensive urbanisation can also put excessive strain on local resources and infrastructure leading to water shortages or human induced drought e g 26 as a result migrants in search of land resources jobs and livelihoods may increase their vulnerability to recurring hydrological extremes an example of these dynamics can be found in athens greece where uncontrolled and unplanned urbanisation mainly resulted from the entry of thousands of refugees during the asia minor migration in 1922 and from internal migration after world war ii urbanisation resulted in a substantial reduction of water infiltration and led to increased runoff and erosion which has contributed to increased flooding in the city for the last 100 years 83 2 2 1 2 negative impacts of opposite hazard on measures there are also ways in which flood or drought hazards themselves can have negative impacts on migration as an effective drr measure vulnerable populations exposed to a natural hazard may face significant barriers to migration as they either do not have the means to migrate or the means to migrate as far as they would prefer 13 for example being exposed to a drought event was found to reduce migration flows in several contexts such as a reduction of international migrants from burkina faso 58 and female internal migrants in ethiopia 52 moreover when populations migrate as a result of being exposed to a flood or drought event hazard migration will become more disruptive as the migrants tend to be poorer and the migration is unplanned 11 2 2 2 agricultural practices and land use changes extreme floods and droughts have large impacts on agriculture which is also one of the human activities that consumes the most water given the close linkage between the agricultural sector and the water cycle many drr measures are used to reduce agricultural drought and flood risk e g structural measures to protect cropland from floods dams and reservoirs to increase agricultural water supply in field water harvesting flood and drought resistant crops crop or livestock insurance 35 67 some of these measures include those discussed in other sections of this paper such as dikes and levees section 2 1 1 dams and reservoirs section 2 1 2 subsurface storage section 2 1 4 and migration section 2 2 in this section we refer to other examples that are not described in the aforementioned sections 2 2 2 1 unintended impacts of measures on risk from the opposite hazard to reduce drought and flood impacts on agriculture some water stressed countries have developed water and soil conservation methods including water harvesting and waste water reuse in agriculture for example in brazil successive dams of stone have been built to create micro basins for soil moisture conservation involving local communities 54 this resulted in over 3000 successive dams being built during the period 2001 2009 which created microclimates that provided increased forestation recovered riverine vegetation recovered degraded areas increased biodiversity and decreased drought risk these small dams could also be favourable for flood mitigation e g 104 measures to enhance rainfall infiltration in the soil are often used to reduce agricultural drought risk an example is cross slope barriers which can pose problems during heavy rainfall as the reduction in drainage capacity can result in waterlogging of crops and reduced yields 88 93 this effect has also been observed when conservation agriculture is applied 31 water harvesting interventions are often integrated in headwater catchments of rural semi arid and arid regions to reduce runoff increase infiltration and reduce flood risk downstream these interventions may be used for restoration of the productivity of land with insufficient precipitation increasing productivity of rainfed agriculture and minimising the risk of drought and desertification 113 al seekh and mohammed 4 showed that runoff in the west bank is reduced by 65 85 with stone terraces and semi circle bunds compared to a control site the major advantages of water harvesting interventions are that they are simple cheap replicable efficient and adaptable 121 however wrongly implemented or upscaled interventions may result in increased topsoil erosion and gully formation and therefore increased sedimentation and flood risk downstream more water efficient irrigation technologies have a high potential to reduce water demand thereby reducing agricultural drought risk drip or micro sprinkler irrigation systems are more efficient than pivot or flood irrigation spate irrigation is an ancient irrigation technique that harnesses seasonal floods of rivers and streams to fill irrigation channels and is especially common in arid and semi arid regions as such applying spate irrigation combines drought mitigation with flood mitigation 50 another measure to reduce agricultural drought risk is the extensification of agriculture antwi agyei et al 7 discuss potential negative effects of this measure based on a study in northern ghana for example the conversion of natural forest land to agriculture could lead to a decrease in ecosystem services such as flood prevention the associated deforestation and stream bank cultivation can increase erosion leading to the sedimentation of rivers thereby increasing the probability of flooding for example in niger land degradation with increased river runoff soil erosion and sedimentation in the niger river enhances flood risk at niamey and also negatively impacts food production as irrigation water abstraction has become more complicated due to sediment deposition at pumping station inlets and in irrigation canals in the floodplains 141 126 the use of different crops and cropping practices can be used as a drought or flood risk measure leading to complex interactions for example reducing agricultural irrigation demands by changing to crops with higher water use efficiency could increase flood risk due to low evaporative losses producing more runoff during periods of intense rainfall 38 in flood prone areas farmers take the flood regime and susceptibility of crops to floods into account when selecting crops for cultivation 75 farmers in sub saharan africa for example plant short duration crops and have changed the timing of planting and harvesting to avoid intense rainfall periods 129 or dry spells 105 re or afforestation sometimes called eco drr of degraded land is also viewed as a viable flood mitigation measure for drr and climate change adaptation 40 in many agricultural areas however in dry periods the higher evapotranspiration and reduced groundwater recharge of plantations can significantly reduce dry season flow and cause water shortages in fiji establishment of plantation forests on degraded grassland caused reductions in dry season flows causing shortages to the urban water supply 165 in argentina establishment of eucalypt plantations caused a decrease of 50 in groundwater recharge days and an average decline of the groundwater level by 0 38 m 71 soil infiltration conditions play an important role in the impact of reforestation on dry season minimum flows 17 similar to observations by van meerveld et al 156 where higher infiltration capacities in the forested area favoured subsurface flow generation ogden et al 106 observed higher baseflow in a forested catchment in comparison to disturbed catchments in panama and attributed this to higher infiltration rates in the forest catchment and lower peak flow runoff in the wet season early warning systems ews allow farmers to adjust their cropping and harvesting practices when a particularly dry or wet season is expected seasonal forecasts have proven to be of high value especially in tropical and subtropical regions where a number of seasonal rainfall forecasts are currently operational 101 local trust in seasonal forecasts and in the organisations and governments that provide them takes time to develop 110 142 and the impacts of wrong forecasts e g farmers being hit by a flood event when having prepared for a drought season can lead to major losses and mistrust 21 101 traditional forecast methods have been important in farming communities that lack or have limited access to scientific forecasts 119 however an increasing exposure to erratic and more frequent severe extreme events has led to a decline in accuracy and reliability of some indicators that the farmers have used e g rain onset causing adverse consequences on crop production 120 2 2 2 2 negative impacts of opposite hazard on measures farmers in rainfed production systems have to choose their crop planting dates at the onset of the rainy season a false start to the season increases the risk of crop failure if it remains too dry sowing later in the season might be a good drought risk reduction measure however heavy rainfall and flooding at the onset of the season can result in leaching of nutrients out of the root zone thereby jeopardising its effectiveness 19 furthermore conscious crop selection can reduce agricultural impacts 75 for example farmers in areas facing reduced precipitation in sub saharan africa have switched from high to low water requirement crops 129 this entails the risk of lower harvests during unpredicted higher precipitation and flood periods 109 in terms of re or afforestation drought and heat are known to amplify tree mortality through increased fire and pest hazards 3 for example in the philippines fire has been identified as the major risk to the success of reforestation projects 6 forest fires have caused significant postfire increases in runoff peak flows and erosion leading to damaging floods and debris flows 23 in this sense droughts may affect the impact of forestation measures as a means to reduce flood risks 2 2 3 socioeconomic vulnerability and preparedness socioeconomic vulnerability can cascade from one drought or flood event to the next 48 for example drought induced unemployment can result in increased financial struggles during floods 122 and flood induced migration leads to increases in drought vulnerability through social marginalisation see section 2 2 1 measures aimed at reducing this socioeconomic vulnerability to one type of hazard can influence the risk to another type 33 however most scientific papers look at all hazards together the assumption is that measures to reduce socioeconomic vulnerability are beneficial for all hazards or can be regarded as no regret i e measures to reduce vulnerability to flood are also beneficial for drought and vice versa e g 33 167 measures that increase overall socioeconomic development do indeed seem to reduce vulnerability to natural hazards in general e g improving infrastructure 72 health care and hygiene 43 food and water security 111 diversification of agricultural activities or drinking water supply 57 access to markets 12 urban planning 60 and insurance 141 measures to increase preparedness awareness education or information early warning systems can also be beneficial for both extremes e g 56 but these do not always result in vulnerability reducing actions for example due to a lack of agency of the most vulnerable groups in society 104 128 some of these measures can however also lead to maladaptation unintentionally increasing vulnerability to floods and or droughts 2 2 3 1 unintended impacts of measures on risk from the opposite hazard the preparedness of a society is defined by undrr as the knowledge and capacity to respond to and recover from the impacts of disasters and is affected by risk perception risk perception relates to how people and institutions perceive the severity and likelihood of a hazard event 148 scolobig et al 133 explain that one of the reasons for inadequate preparedness to natural hazards is low awareness societies risk perception might differ from reality due to biases in risk information trust in weather services people s memory and risk adversity 91 a focus on preparedness for one hazard can therefore decrease the preparedness to another hazard and thereby increase its risk conversely preparedness for one particular hazard can increase the general hazard awareness irrespective of the type of hazard and thus positively influence the risk of another hazard 138 the media plays an important role in influencing risk perception after a systematic analysis of daily news for a period of 25 years of the most popular newspaper in catalonia ne spain llasat et al 87 show that the largest number of news items were related to droughts and forest fires followed by floods and heavy rainfalls although floods are also a major risk in this region this can lead to a false perception of low flood risk that affects individual and societal behaviour flood early warning systems suffer from uncertainties and false alarms that could result in considerable costs for example information from a flood early warning could prompt reservoir managers to release water but if the predicted flood does not come or is less severe than predicted this might result in water shortage 123 insurance micro credit schemes and diversification of agriculture have been found to reduce incentive for taking measures and undermine investment 120 136 141 and disaster relief projects by donors and ngos can increase vulnerability by creating dependency and undermining local initiatives 91 127 132 another example of where such vulnerability reduction measures aimed at one hazard can increase vulnerability to the other hazard can be taken from mexico city where residents of illegal settlements who do not have access to piped water can buy water from water trucks this can lead to increased poverty and a reduced ability to cope with flooding 36 several examples relating to water policy and governance also exist for example during the 2001 2008 millennium drought in southeast queensland australia the state government initiated major changes in water governance including a centralisation of authority replacing more cooperative models for water management this led to high levels of distrust and conflict amongst stakeholders the centralised system could not prevent building in the floodplain which increased flood exposure and during the 2010 flood event 57 2 2 3 2 negative impacts of opposite hazard on measures because most vulnerability reducing measures are intangible they are often not directly affected by an event there are indirect effects for example related to preparedness awareness perceptions and distribution of limited resources during a flood or drought event crisis management takes away attention resources and priority from other water related issues potentially increasing the risk of the other extreme it can be expected that flood memory decays more rapidly during a multi year drought as is exemplified by this quote of a local government representative in australia you forget because of 10 years of drought that land floods 14 3 knowledge gaps and challenges despite the fact that floods and droughts are two extremes of the same hydrological cycle measures and strategies for their risk reduction usually focus either on flooding or on droughts to some extent this may be explained by the fact that their typical temporal and spatial scales are generally different as a result of these scale differences as well as the complexity of different hydrological extremes researchers and practitioners often specialise in one extreme or the other moreover because many hydrological studies have focused on the catchment scale linkages between hydrological extremes across larger spatial scales are less well studied 53 a more holistic risk management approach that addresses both extremes would allow us to better address tradeoffs and synergies between hazards measures decision objectives and different temporal and spatial scales in this regard an important question is who wins and who loses for example who benefits from the construction of a levee and or dam and which parts of the population may face detrimental impacts how do benefits from structural measures change from the short term towards the distant future in terms of scm many of the technologies are based on very local measures but what is their influence on the hydrological cycle and floods and droughts outside the area in which they are taken in terms of migration what are the benefits and problems faced by migrants and the inhabitants of the areas facing in and out migration how will these change in the future how are these benefits and problems related to socioeconomic factors such as wealth gender age and so forth we need to develop methods to explicitly examine these kinds of questions from a holistic perspective to achieve this drr research and practice must be closely linked with climate change adaptation since both of these are essential for achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs the urgent need to integrate drr climate change adaptation and sustainable development is reiterated in the undrr s guidance note on using climate and disaster risk management to help build resilient societies 145 in this section we reflect on some key challenges for achieving this holistic approach that are specifically related to interactions between floods and droughts and their respective drr measures more basic research is required on interactions between physical climate processes that can ameliorate or aggravate floods and droughts dettinger 27 examined the role of atmospheric rivers as drought busters in the usa and huning and aghakouchak 62 discuss how changes in snow water equivalent and rapid snowmelt can contribute to rapid drought flood cycles however such research is scarce and an increased focus could improve our understanding of these interactions indeed the last five years have seen an increased attention for so called compound climate events defined by zscheischler et al 172 as the combination of multiple drivers and or hazards that contributes to societal or environmental risk initiatives such as the cost action damocles understanding and modeling compound climate and weather events are identifying key processes and combinations of variables that contribute to compound events developing new statistical and dynamic modelling approaches to better simulate compound events and developing a framework to improve their assessment much of this knowledge could be applied to improve our understanding of interactions between flood and drought risk moreover an increased understanding is needed of how interactions between physical climate processes will change in the future some regions may see an increase in both flood and drought hazard whilst others may see an increase in one hazard and a decrease in the other 8 in this regard a major challenge is knowing how climate change will affect the frequency and severity of both floods and droughts and importantly the likelihood of consecutive compound and concurrent flood and drought events e g 2 24 161 171 this has major implications for some of the drr measures discussed in this paper for example future climate change introduces a large uncertainty in delimiting safe areas for natural hazard related migration some local areas will become increasingly marginal as places to live in or in which to maintain livelihoods in such cases migration and displacement could become permanent and could introduce new pressures in areas of relocation 49 increasingly climate studies are focusing on trying to capture the correct combinations of variables in large ensemble probabilistic climate modelling studies however the uncertainty remains large and so other methods are also being developed that could be harnessed to improve the understanding and assessment of flood and drought interactions an example is the storyline approach in which studies try to develop descriptive storylines narratives or tales of plausible future climates instead of trying to quantify probabilities 135 this approach should be applied not only to single hazards but also to compound drought flood events beyond these physical processes it is of utmost importance to better understand complex human decision making processes and how they are influenced by interactions and feedbacks between hazard exposure and vulnerability in natural hazard risk assessments dynamic feedbacks between these components are very poorly represented 51 by improving this understanding we will be better able to understand potential implications of future changes in extremes and water availability around the world 29 agent based models provide a potential opportunity to assess these aspects such as that employed by haer et al 55 to assess flood risk at the european scale a key aspect with regards to human behaviour is risk perception trust and uncertainty for example migrating from a flood prone area to a drought prone area or planting drought resilient crops in a period of heavy rains 109 are faced with large uncertainties these uncertainties affect both trust in the usefulness of measures and risk perception and these aspects remain less well studied increasing our understanding of these processes would not only contribute to improved flood and drought risk management but also to the growing field of multi hazards and multi risk studies more broadly e g 22 24 48 we need to enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of measures themselves for example whilst there is already some understanding of the mechanisms that lead to drought induced dike and levee failure within the engineering discipline there is a lack of understanding of how these mechanisms can influence overall flood and drought risk at local and regional scales 69 with vahedifard et al 149 suggesting that there is a need to develop a framework for integrating drought and climate change risk in dike engineering design in terms of scms there is a lack of understanding of how the underlying technologies interact with other components of the urban and natural water cycle and quantitative knowledge is often scattered and site specific 137 despite the importance of groundwater groundwater management is often neglected especially in unmonitored areas often the population is fully dependent on groundwater resources for their livelihood but there is little awareness of the need for protection of recharge areas and groundwater management we must also improve our understanding of interactions and feedbacks between drm measures this paper shows many examples of how drr measures designed to reduce one of the risk drivers i e hazard exposure and vulnerability can unintentionally lead to an increase in one of the other risk drivers a particular challenge is quantifying how drr measures designed for one specific hazard e g floods can increase risk from another hazard e g droughts termed asynergies by de ruiter et al 25 these asynergies have been assessed in a handful of studies for various hazards e g 23 25 74 85 169 which could provide a starting point for studies specifically relating to flood and drought interactions this could allow decision makers and policy makers to make more informed decisions that consider optimal measures and combinations of measures across multiple hazard types when resources are limited drr planning often prioritises one extreme although maladaptation and unintended effects on risks from other hazards might outweigh the positive effects of the investment kreibich et al 76 suggest an integrated cost assessment cycle in risk management of multiple natural hazards it involves the continuous monitoring of all associated costs thus enabling the early detection of inefficient risk mitigation strategies kull et al 79 discuss how the use of a cost benefit analysis cba in drr could be used to account for these disbenefits thereby decreasing the likelihood of maladaptation as always a key to improving our understanding is good data based on reliable monitoring and observation systems this includes data on physical and socioeconomic aspects e g climate soil moisture river discharge groundwater population wealth vulnerability etc as well as ecological aspects and the effectiveness of measures as a complementary approach to available monitoring kreibich et al 77 suggest to collect a large number of paired event case studies of floods and droughts i e collecting data and information about various hazard exposure vulnerability and impact characteristics in the same region and how these changed between two consecutive events this panta rhei benchmark dataset looks at paired flood and drought events separately but could be extended to include flood drought and drought flood event pairs additionally we need to also devise other new ways to monitor changes in the effectiveness of measures over time for example the performance of scms is likely to change over time with periods of drought being detrimental for the intended performance there is little long term empirical analysis that tests the effectiveness of small scale water harvesting interventions such as sand dams during droughts therefore continued observations are essential but importantly data need to be made available for use in research if we are to improve our understanding for example most reservoir operating data are not publicly available which hampers the development of new knowledge when it comes to understanding human responses to flood and drought hazards the availability of such data would allow us to better quantify the economic social and ecological damage caused by floods and droughts as well as the pros and cons of drr measures to achieve a more holistic multi hazard approach to floods and droughts changes in governance structures will be required a framework for multi risk governance has been developed by scolobig et al 134 which includes decision making processes related to all phases of drr in its development the authors describe several institutional barriers faced by practitioners namely single risk centred regulation and institutional framework different goals and priorities of the agencies in charge of hazard management unsatisfactory public private partnerships different responsibilities for risk reduction at household level lack of interagency communication and lack of capacities at the local level many of these considerations are pertinent for the management of floods and droughts and their interactions for example flood and drought risk management practices are often part of separate government departments 57 and whilst the european union has developed a flood directive there is no specific european directive on droughts raikes et al 114 argue that flood risk management focuses on land use and urban planning and is increasingly risk oriented and proactive whereas drought management focuses on water supply and agriculture and often mostly still consists of emergency responses interaction between the institutions involved in flood and drought management may lead to mutual gains for both hazards addressing these knowledge gaps and challenges requires interdisciplinary research and collaboration between science and practice various frameworks networks and partnerships are developing to address this at international levels such as the undrr global risk assessment framework graf the knowledge action network on emergent risks and extreme events risk kan and the newly launched european geosciences union multi hazards subdivision guidelines are also being developed to help train water managers to take a more integrated approach to flood and drought risk management 146 the research leading to this paper is a collaboration between flood and drought related panta rhei working groups of the iahs working groups on changes in flood risk and drought in the anthropocene respectively demonstrating that there is now increasing impetus to move water related disaster risk management towards a more holistic multi risk approach the findings in this paper serve to illuminate the relevance of more explicitly examining flood and drought interactions in drr and drr science by taking this more holistic approach more explicit links could be made with reducing the impacts of climate change and addressing global development issues thereby

20139,while globally reported flood losses seem to be increasing the share covered by formal insurance mechanisms seems to be decreasing slightly leaving the world potentially more financially exposed as great as the need to improve the management of flood risk is today it promises to be even greater in the near future due to global warming and sea level rise numerical models that estimate the potential impacts of future flood events are some of the most important tools we have to manage price and transfer risks but being fairly new they show significant dispersion in their results understanding validating and ultimately internalizing these models requires the re insurance industry to recurrently engage in extensive research campaigns we provide a brief description of the usual anatomy and characteristics of flood risk models in the industry glimpses of their historical evolution and a perspective on the most common types of diagnostics used to scrutinize them keywords flood risk catastrophe models insurance reinsurance 1 introduction the re insurance industry uses numerical simulation models to quantify manage and trade catastrophic risks these models leverage the scientific and engineering knowledge at our disposal to provide loss estimates that guide stakeholders involved in the risk transfer chain these models are sometimes developed in house within re insurers but most typically they are licensed from specialized third party commercial cat catastrophe modeling software companies the introduction of cat models in the industry dates back to the 1980s their premise was that catastrophic events are rare and historical experience alone does not provide a sufficiently strong basis to estimate and manage their potential impacts 1 3 in the roughly forty years of history of cat modeling the number of providers of models and analytical solutions has increased from just three dominant entities risk management solutions air worldwide and eqecat now part of corelogic to more than a dozen actively growing companies these include long standing consulting organizations with risk expertise that have only recently developed a formal cat modeling offering such as jba consulting startups that originated in the industry like katrisk spinouts from academic institutions like fathom and syndicated industry platforms like the oasis loss modeling framework it has been flood risk as a matter of fact a domain to which new entrants have flocked due to the rising importance of the peril and to the scant offerings that existed to tackle this particular risk until the early 2000s fig 1 shows the growth in flood risk models released by commercial vendors brokers and reinsurers based on publicly available press releases in the sector note the evident increase of flood risk models available in the industry during the last decade although flood events can involve a multitude of physical processes 4 most flood risk models released for use within the re insurance industry focus on river and coastal flooding caused by atmospheric hazards with rainfall and storm surge as the primordial causes this newly found emphasis on flood risk models follows a commercial opportunity stemming from the recognition of urgency in the improvement of flood risk management globally reported flood losses seem to be growing according to some estimates they amounted to usd 40 billion in 2015 the insured share of these losses rather than increase with time appeared to have declined from 21 between 2005 and 2009 to 15 between 2010 and 2014 5 large portions of the insured losses are picked up by the public through pooling mechanisms or subsidized insurance schemes such as the national flood insurance program nfip managed by the federal emergency management agency fema in the u s under the national flood insurance act of 1968 the nfip was designed to provide coverage at subsidized rates for structures already in existence in high risk zones while imposing actuarially sound rates on new structures participation in the program is voluntary and it took the implementation of several amendments over the years in order to increase its adoption rate the nfip is a large publicly subsidized program that was forced to borrow us 18 billion and us 7 billion to pay claims arising from hurricanes katrina in 2005 and sandy in 2012 respectively 6 in recent years the nfip started to seek financial protection from reinsurance and the capital markets amounting today to about us 1 7 billion in coverage www fema gov nfip reinsurance program other initiatives are taking place to bring private and public entities into collaborations that foster the financial transfer of flood risk most notably the flood re program set in motion in the uk in 2016 aims to increase flood coverage using a pooling mechanism that insurers can leverage to discharge a portion of their flood risk in exchange for paying a levy flood re itself obtains reinsurance in excess of gbp 2 billion to protect the accumulated levies www floodre co uk when public sector entities or private re insurance companies transact flood risk in such large volumes it is necessary that there exists a common understanding of probable maximum loss pml and of how frequently certain levels of loss can occur a common currency of risk this is made tangible in the form of cat models that all parties trust through the analysis of their assumptions and limitations insurers have walked a long path towards building trust in these numerical tools since some of the first simulation results entered the florida market in the mid 1980s the estimates then received with skepticism indicated the potential for higher hurricane losses than were commonly expected mainly due to the fact that urbanization along the coast had taken place at a very rapid pace and historical loss estimates were no longer representative of the exposure a reckoning for the florida market arrived in 1992 after hurricane andrew caused the bankruptcy of several insurance companies 7 and the models were proven right this transformative event in the industry led to a progressive adoption of cat models which by the year 2000 had become well engrained in insurance operations as the industry increased its reliance on models it implicitly acquired a greater responsibility to understand them and justify their usage this realization was brought forth by regulatory entities that increasingly saw the dominance of models in risk management decisions as a potential source of systemic risk a drive for more scrutiny materialized through initiatives such as solvency ii in europe 8 or orsa own risk solvency assessment in the u s 9 2 characteristics of current flood risk models a commercial flood risk model is usually built through the concatenation of the five components shown in fig 2 the first block in the diagram the event catalog consists of a set of synthetic events typically the product of a monte carlo simulation that considers rainfall patterns topography and other data helpful to carry out a hydrological analysis catalogs are constructed with the aim of reflecting low probability occurrences often down to annual exceedance rates of 10 4 or 10 5 return periods of 10 000 or 100 000 years the hazard intensity component produces a set of local intensity metrics for each event in the catalog and for every geographical point of interest the most common example of an output generated by this module is a scalar field of flood depths associated with each simulated event the exposure data consists of user defined inputs that describe the properties contained in a re insurer s portfolio these descriptions typically include location and characteristics of the asset total insured value and insurance policy details such as deductibles and limits the vulnerability module encompasses a set of damage functions or fragility curves that associate different levels of local hazard intensity values to corresponding levels of physical damage for each of the assets described in the exposure data a distribution of ground up losses is obtained at the end of this computational chain for every property depicted in the exposure data the financial module then applies the contractual mechanisms expressed in re insurance agreements to the losses for each property and for each event this results in what is referred to as gross loss which depicts the fraction of the ground up loss for which an insurer would be liable after the application of deductibles and limits in their policies if the results are computed in such a manner that the benefit of reinsurance insurance for the insurer is taken into account these are referred to as net loss the model generates probabilistic distributions for all required loss perspectives expressed in exceedance probability curves that associate a probability of exceedance to each level of loss of interest even though models are quite consistent in their structure discrepancies in results across vendors and versions can be considerable observe in fig 3 for instance the quotient between average annual flood losses in florida counties estimated by two commercial models currently in use by the industry based on these results a company providing insurance in gulf county would conclude that the premium they should charge can differ by an astronomically large factor of x20 depending on model choice these large differences which are commonplace in the business may be due to our lack of complete knowledge epistemic uncertainty or they may be a sign of poorly implemented representations of physical processes if due to the former these differences can be interpreted to be of benefit to the industry as divergent models help reveal the underlying uncertainty ascertaining whether large model differences are technically justifiable is a profoundly daunting task for companies due to the heterogeneity of commercial models their complexity and often their lack of transparency facing fierce competition in the early years of cat modeling vendors displayed tendency towards opacity of their most fundamental assumptions and methods even though most of their sources of research data were public this lack of transparency has not made it easy to scrutinize model assumptions over the history of cat modeling but fortunately it is slowly abating recognizing the demand for further openness new vendors have started to offer total academic transparency in their products which is an important feature to many clients especially those in the public sector anecdotally as a consequence of this reality we are forced to omit specifics about the origination of some of the data in the illustrative examples of this paper in order to protect vendors intellectual property we attempt to do so without detracting from the points we wish to illustrate 3 common diagnostics in model evaluation frameworks with the objective of assessing the reasonability or suitability of the model for the specific intended usage the industry routinely resorts to technical tests these are currently not prescribed or standardized with the exception of the diagnostics required by the florida commission on hurricane loss projection methodology the florida commission for acceptance of a particular cat model in the state s insurance industry see box insert the general argument expressed by regulators who oppose widely applicable standards is that model evaluation frameworks should neither stifle competition nor induce herd mentality which would lead to systemic risk but that instead they should demonstrate a responsible usage of risk management tools in harmony with the materiality of the risks involved that is how relevant they are to the organization s ability to maintain commitments to its customers 10 box insert 1 florida commission on hurricane loss projection methodology fchlpm the florida commission as it is commonly referred to is an exceptional public effort created in 1995 to evaluate and subject to approval models that aspire to be used for insurance management operations in the state of florida in the u s the framework managed by a panel of experts consists of a series of diagnostics classified according to general meteorological hydrological statistical vulnerability actuarial and computer standards 11 a series of standard forms need to be submitted by each model vendor with specific results as applied to particular portfolios designed by the fchlpm and addressing normalized questions the purpose of establishing this commission was to assure rates are neither excessive nor inadequate which illustrates the degree to which model outputs engrained within the systems of insurance companies affect the price policyholders pay for their coverage model diagnostics vary in protocol and philosophy but typically fall into the three categories that we describe in the following sections 1 sensitivity testing 2 loss validation and 3 scientific appraisal 3 1 sensitivity testing this type of test investigates the variability of model results to variability in input data such as exposure types and location it can also be extended to investigating variability of loss output due to changes in model assumptions although this is far less common as the architecture of most commercial models does not currently allow the user to alter internal model parameters often the first motivation behind the execution of these tests is to explore the impact of data quality insurance companies typically lack detailed data precise location building characteristics etc of the assets they are insuring the absence of this information increases the uncertainty in the modeling process as more assumptions need to be made in order to provide a quantitative risk assessment in order to understand the assumptions used by the model to overcome this lack of data it is important to measure the effect of different input parameters if a particular parameter has little influence on the model results the data acquisition investment may not be justified a second motivation for this kind of testing is to scrutinize the internal consistency of the model testing for instance the model results for buildings of different heights or materials reveals patterns and internal assumptions in the model that may or may not align with user expectations a typical cat model accepts four main descriptors to classify exposures these are sometimes referred to as primary modifiers or characteristics and include 1 construction typology and material 2 occupancy or usage class 3 building age and 4 building height or number of stories models presumably use these data in the hazard intensity and vulnerability components to estimate financial losses more accurately however the treatment that models make of these characteristics can be dramatically different even if all models use a common body of research as their foundation observe in fig 4 how two well regarded models in the insurance industry treat the specification of a type of building in germany the building is originally classified as unknown meaning we lack detailed information about its characteristics in a second model run the building is either classified as general residential or the more specific single family house the figure shows the relative change between these two latter classifications versus the original unknown represented by the horizontal baseline at 1 the comparison shows losses expected at different return periods along the horizontal axis we can see how the trends suggested by model a and model b not only differ in magnitude but in their qualitative interpretation model a suggests that the vulnerability of a general residential building or a single family house is slightly higher at that location than that of a building that lacks any description this may be interpreted in the context of a conditional distribution to suggest that in average most of the buildings at that location are generally less vulnerable than those two classes that would explain why specifying those particular characteristics increases the vulnerability versus the general average of unknown model b in contrast heavily penalizes the lack of information denoted by unknown specifying the more detailed class of general residential or single family house reduces the expected loss at most return periods by about 15 20 only by querying the model developers is it possible for re insurance companies to ascertain whether this drastically antithetical pattern of building performance is derived from justified engineering assumptions or otherwise discovering the relative importance of different risk characteristics helps insurers improve their exposure data strategy guiding data collection efforts towards those characteristics that drive their results it is also important that the user develops a critical opinion about the patterns that emerge from such testing 3 2 loss validation commercial models tend to be calibrated to losses for large distributed portfolios of assets and are intended to represent loss faithfully in the aggregate however insurance and reinsurance companies differ in size and geographic spread depending on whether they operate regionally nationally or internationally yet the same models typically packaged at national or multi national scales are offered to the market as a whole the geographic scope and resolution of the model needs to be considered carefully as using models to estimate losses at a resolution not in harmony with their development and calibration may result in perilous conclusions models that avoid calibration to observed loss such as in quinn et al 12 may be more robust when extrapolated beyond the calibration range it is therefore a good practice to execute a series of loss validation analyses that compare the losses produced by the model for historical events for which the user may also have some experiential data in order to identify whether systematic biases are present this task is more complicated than it may seem because exposure and loss data are rarely comparable between model and experience for example a user may have loss records of an event that occurred in the past but they may not have a detailed description of what exposure they had at the time that makes the comparison through a contemporaneous modeling exercise challenging as it is difficult to conclude whether differences arise from model shortcomings or from inconsistencies in the input data additionally the treatment of different policy conditions and claims handling for instance often have the potential to bias calibrations insurance companies may add to the loss records other related expenses such as loss adjustment expenses or inflation of the repair costs due to demand surge after an event as these losses are not really the target of the calibration or evaluation exercise the data has to be surgically cleaned to ensure the dataset represents a loss in harmony with the model output 3 3 scientific appraisal one of the persistent views in the industry is that models should first and foremost provide probabilistic distributions of loss that make sense from a historical perspective with less regard for the physical assumptions underlying the simulation this empiricist argument was as discussed above implicitly responsible for the insurance bankruptcies in florida in 1992 note that were we to accept this argument there would be no fault in a model that satisfies the user from a loss perspective while overstating or understating model components that eventually compensate one another for instance a model may assume too high a hazard intensity and too low a vulnerability so that eventually the loss results seem reasonable although based on flawed assumptions this view coexists with another on the opposite end of the spectrum namely that models should give primordial importance to the faithful physical simulation of the process regardless of what loss outcomes are obtained this can be interpreted as a somewhat arrogant technical argument that underestimates the influence of the enormous uncertainty that plagues model assumptions we believe that models that simulate physical phenomena should aim to capture these processes with a degree of fidelity commensurate with our state of knowledge and displaying results somewhat in harmony with experience embracing beven s 13 view of pragmatic realism the evaluation strategies we discuss in this section consist of benchmarking the scientific assumptions made in cat models with other independent datasets often provided by research institutions and academic groups the aim of these comparisons is to provide an assessment of both the alignment of the model with the current state of knowledge and a view of the existing uncertainty this type of framework is valuable for the industry due to its efficiency being amenable to mechanical systematic implementation and potential automation without requiring deep expertise in all aspects of the science and engineering embedded in models otherwise impossible to muster on demand for most companies in the sector aspects of models that cannot be easily compared with any prior measurements or research naturally pose a challenge for evaluation within this framework and should be treated separately 3 3 1 frequency vs severity testing the relationship between event frequency and severity is common for many perils for which a well established definition of severity exists in the domain of seismology for instance the gutenberg richter distribution depicts the expected decreasing frequency of earthquakes with increasing magnitude in the realm of flood several definitions of flood severity have been proposed such as the four tiered u s national oceanographic atmospheric administration s noaa national weather service flood severity scale the watershed based flood severity score 14 and the flash flood indices from davis 15 smith 16 and schroeder et al 17 however in the re insurance industry there is not yet a common standard metric to describe the severity of a flood event in an ongoing collaboration with dr andrew smith and colleagues at fathom in the uk we have investigated the possibility of using inundated area as a proxy for flood severity each event s inundated area is associated with a return period in order to build a frequency severity curve suitable to use as a benchmark for model evaluation while not perfect this metric has the advantage that it can be directly derived from the results from a stochastic flood risk model for actual historical events the return period is obtained from gauge data and the inundated area from satellite imagery the gauge data are used to obtain annual peak discharge associated with the events of interest a generalized extreme value gev distribution is then fitted to the gauge station time series to obtain a relationship between the annual peak discharge and return period from which the return periods of the events are calculated the normalized difference water index ndwi methodology is applied to satellite images covering flood events to extract inundated areas 18 the methodology is best applied to areas with high occurrence of fluvial flooding and gauge stations with time series that cover several recent events with an inundated area and a return period for each event a power law is fitted to obtain a relationship that can be extrapolated to higher return periods the results of this methodology for the st louis area in the u s within longitudes 91 2 and 90 0 and latitudes 38 0 and 39 6 are shown in fig 5 together with an equivalent curve derived from a commercial catastrophe model the benchmark has been extrapolated up to a return period of 1000 years as the commercial model curve is within the uncertainty range from the benchmark curve this represents an instance in which the model is validated successfully this type of test is still in development and needs further definition and testing if proven technically sound its mechanic simplicity would make it a valid and relatively easily implementable test in flood risk model evaluation systems 3 3 2 flood depth by return period each flood event in the catalog is associated with a distribution of flood depths across the region affected these flood depths hazard intensities are used to estimate damages within the vulnerability module of the cat model therefore the frequency of experiencing a certain level of flooding at a particular location greatly impacts the probabilistic distribution of loss a commonly used strategy to ascertain whether the hazard intensity and frequency relationships assumed in the model are in line with the state of knowledge is to benchmark them against independent datasets derived from existing gauge data when these data are not directly available which is frequent the benchmarking may consist of the comparison of the commercial flood risk model of interest against academic hydrological models that offer alternative representations of these relationships fig 6 illustrates this pursuit the plots show mean flood depth frequency relationships for different locations extracted from three different commercial models the mean values of these relationships display a certain degree of uncertainty represented by the dark shaded areas in the plots the benchmark datasets obtained for this example from sampson et al 19 are represented by the hatched areas on the plots conveying their uncertainty it is common that these tests show a misalignment between the two datasets model b s plot indicates that the model assumption is in range within the uncertainty threshold reflected in the benchmark dataset even if it can be argued that the model understates the existing uncertainty cases of overestimation as in model a or underestimation as in model c do not automatically result in a negative assessment of the model but they certainly point at the need for further scrutiny to simplify the argument we have discussed the comparison of a model with one independent dataset however whenever possible the benchmarking exercise should involve an ensemble of comparison references as those references themselves may involve significant uncertainties 3 3 3 vulnerability functions the vulnerability component of a model associates the hazard intensity at a given site with physical damage these relationships are described by damage functions or fragility curves and they vary by the type of exposure considered a recent literature review by gerl et al 20 identified nearly a thousand vulnerability relationships across 47 models in 23 countries all but 6 of these relationships use water depth as the fundamental intensity parameter about half of the vulnerability functions identified were not supported by any validation exercise at the time of their publication a reminder of the great uncertainty that underlies many of these published curves wing et al 21 recently showed that commonly made assumptions among these models that damage monotonically increases with depth do not align well with existing data large uncertainties in vulnerability relationships are not a peculiarity of flood risk models they have also been reported for instance in wind vulnerability models 22 fig 7 shows two examples of vulnerability benchmarking exercises typically conducted in the industry which rely on academic literature as well as on experience data the plot on the left shows a vulnerability function that expresses damage in terms of a damage ratio by level of water depth in meters for a type of exposure for which there is very little reference data available the commercial model represented by the thick curve can only be benchmarked against four other vulnerability functions for a restricted domain of water depths the plot on the right shows a similar exercise for a vulnerability function describing a type of exposure for which there are ample reference data at our disposal constructing these conceptually simple plots requires overcoming the challenge of aggregating multiple datasets often scattered in different formats across the literature the much harder challenge however consists of judging the performance of the model once the existing uncertainty is revealed the outcome may vary from user to user in the re insurance industry for instance a company for which these exposures do not represent a high materiality they do not drive their capital needs may be contented by seeing that in general both models a and b fall within the envelope of the references available however this may be different for a company whose sole business is to provide flood insurance and whose operation is strongly sensitive to model results in those circumstances the company might see the apparent extrapolation of model a and the potential overestimation bias of model b as items that require closer inspection the uncertainty reflected in these plots is currently inescapable 4 conclusions commercial flood risk models are essential for the re insurance industry to respond to a growing demand for risk transfer solutions while they showcase exciting applications of scientific and engineering advances they are still fairly new and riddled with uncertainties and discrepancies which often pose an enormous challenge for companies to adopt them responsibly we have presented a few selected diagnostics of common usage in the industry that help assess the quality of assumptions underlying these models testing each of the model components in a framework that leverages independent datasets helps increase confidence and understanding although the inadequacy or incompleteness of reference data often complicates this proposition companies in the re insurance industry can systematically tackle the complex decision of accepting modifying or rejecting a particular model by collecting these diagnostics progressively and in harmony with their needs once diagnostics are available there still remains the challenge of aggregating results of disparate tests that address different components of the model such as hazard sensitivity and vulnerability quantification frameworks such as that proposed by li 23 based on the work by cooke 24 can be helpful in this pursuit while there are ongoing efforts in the industry to streamline rationalize and automate the model evaluation workflows in line with the principles established above or similar ones 25 26 this process still necessitates expert judgement and insight into nuances not easily quantified the treatment of levees for instance typically requires tailored testing because different approaches are followed in different models model evaluation remains a costly burden within the re insurance industry often further hindered by the lack of transparency in commercial applications stakes are high and this requires that the industry continues instigating the development of robust benchmarks that are credible and easily implemented that do not require to be reinvented by each company in each model update cycle that do not stifle innovation and that avoid introducing systemic

perspectives 
20139,while globally reported flood losses seem to be increasing the share covered by formal insurance mechanisms seems to be decreasing slightly leaving the world potentially more financially exposed as great as the need to improve the management of flood risk is today it promises to be even greater in the near future due to global warming and sea level rise numerical models that estimate the potential impacts of future flood events are some of the most important tools we have to manage price and transfer risks but being fairly new they show significant dispersion in their results understanding validating and ultimately internalizing these models requires the re insurance industry to recurrently engage in extensive research campaigns we provide a brief description of the usual anatomy and characteristics of flood risk models in the industry glimpses of their historical evolution and a perspective on the most common types of diagnostics used to scrutinize them keywords flood risk catastrophe models insurance reinsurance 1 introduction the re insurance industry uses numerical simulation models to quantify manage and trade catastrophic risks these models leverage the scientific and engineering knowledge at our disposal to provide loss estimates that guide stakeholders involved in the risk transfer chain these models are sometimes developed in house within re insurers but most typically they are licensed from specialized third party commercial cat catastrophe modeling software companies the introduction of cat models in the industry dates back to the 1980s their premise was that catastrophic events are rare and historical experience alone does not provide a sufficiently strong basis to estimate and manage their potential impacts 1 3 in the roughly forty years of history of cat modeling the number of providers of models and analytical solutions has increased from just three dominant entities risk management solutions air worldwide and eqecat now part of corelogic to more than a dozen actively growing companies these include long standing consulting organizations with risk expertise that have only recently developed a formal cat modeling offering such as jba consulting startups that originated in the industry like katrisk spinouts from academic institutions like fathom and syndicated industry platforms like the oasis loss modeling framework it has been flood risk as a matter of fact a domain to which new entrants have flocked due to the rising importance of the peril and to the scant offerings that existed to tackle this particular risk until the early 2000s fig 1 shows the growth in flood risk models released by commercial vendors brokers and reinsurers based on publicly available press releases in the sector note the evident increase of flood risk models available in the industry during the last decade although flood events can involve a multitude of physical processes 4 most flood risk models released for use within the re insurance industry focus on river and coastal flooding caused by atmospheric hazards with rainfall and storm surge as the primordial causes this newly found emphasis on flood risk models follows a commercial opportunity stemming from the recognition of urgency in the improvement of flood risk management globally reported flood losses seem to be growing according to some estimates they amounted to usd 40 billion in 2015 the insured share of these losses rather than increase with time appeared to have declined from 21 between 2005 and 2009 to 15 between 2010 and 2014 5 large portions of the insured losses are picked up by the public through pooling mechanisms or subsidized insurance schemes such as the national flood insurance program nfip managed by the federal emergency management agency fema in the u s under the national flood insurance act of 1968 the nfip was designed to provide coverage at subsidized rates for structures already in existence in high risk zones while imposing actuarially sound rates on new structures participation in the program is voluntary and it took the implementation of several amendments over the years in order to increase its adoption rate the nfip is a large publicly subsidized program that was forced to borrow us 18 billion and us 7 billion to pay claims arising from hurricanes katrina in 2005 and sandy in 2012 respectively 6 in recent years the nfip started to seek financial protection from reinsurance and the capital markets amounting today to about us 1 7 billion in coverage www fema gov nfip reinsurance program other initiatives are taking place to bring private and public entities into collaborations that foster the financial transfer of flood risk most notably the flood re program set in motion in the uk in 2016 aims to increase flood coverage using a pooling mechanism that insurers can leverage to discharge a portion of their flood risk in exchange for paying a levy flood re itself obtains reinsurance in excess of gbp 2 billion to protect the accumulated levies www floodre co uk when public sector entities or private re insurance companies transact flood risk in such large volumes it is necessary that there exists a common understanding of probable maximum loss pml and of how frequently certain levels of loss can occur a common currency of risk this is made tangible in the form of cat models that all parties trust through the analysis of their assumptions and limitations insurers have walked a long path towards building trust in these numerical tools since some of the first simulation results entered the florida market in the mid 1980s the estimates then received with skepticism indicated the potential for higher hurricane losses than were commonly expected mainly due to the fact that urbanization along the coast had taken place at a very rapid pace and historical loss estimates were no longer representative of the exposure a reckoning for the florida market arrived in 1992 after hurricane andrew caused the bankruptcy of several insurance companies 7 and the models were proven right this transformative event in the industry led to a progressive adoption of cat models which by the year 2000 had become well engrained in insurance operations as the industry increased its reliance on models it implicitly acquired a greater responsibility to understand them and justify their usage this realization was brought forth by regulatory entities that increasingly saw the dominance of models in risk management decisions as a potential source of systemic risk a drive for more scrutiny materialized through initiatives such as solvency ii in europe 8 or orsa own risk solvency assessment in the u s 9 2 characteristics of current flood risk models a commercial flood risk model is usually built through the concatenation of the five components shown in fig 2 the first block in the diagram the event catalog consists of a set of synthetic events typically the product of a monte carlo simulation that considers rainfall patterns topography and other data helpful to carry out a hydrological analysis catalogs are constructed with the aim of reflecting low probability occurrences often down to annual exceedance rates of 10 4 or 10 5 return periods of 10 000 or 100 000 years the hazard intensity component produces a set of local intensity metrics for each event in the catalog and for every geographical point of interest the most common example of an output generated by this module is a scalar field of flood depths associated with each simulated event the exposure data consists of user defined inputs that describe the properties contained in a re insurer s portfolio these descriptions typically include location and characteristics of the asset total insured value and insurance policy details such as deductibles and limits the vulnerability module encompasses a set of damage functions or fragility curves that associate different levels of local hazard intensity values to corresponding levels of physical damage for each of the assets described in the exposure data a distribution of ground up losses is obtained at the end of this computational chain for every property depicted in the exposure data the financial module then applies the contractual mechanisms expressed in re insurance agreements to the losses for each property and for each event this results in what is referred to as gross loss which depicts the fraction of the ground up loss for which an insurer would be liable after the application of deductibles and limits in their policies if the results are computed in such a manner that the benefit of reinsurance insurance for the insurer is taken into account these are referred to as net loss the model generates probabilistic distributions for all required loss perspectives expressed in exceedance probability curves that associate a probability of exceedance to each level of loss of interest even though models are quite consistent in their structure discrepancies in results across vendors and versions can be considerable observe in fig 3 for instance the quotient between average annual flood losses in florida counties estimated by two commercial models currently in use by the industry based on these results a company providing insurance in gulf county would conclude that the premium they should charge can differ by an astronomically large factor of x20 depending on model choice these large differences which are commonplace in the business may be due to our lack of complete knowledge epistemic uncertainty or they may be a sign of poorly implemented representations of physical processes if due to the former these differences can be interpreted to be of benefit to the industry as divergent models help reveal the underlying uncertainty ascertaining whether large model differences are technically justifiable is a profoundly daunting task for companies due to the heterogeneity of commercial models their complexity and often their lack of transparency facing fierce competition in the early years of cat modeling vendors displayed tendency towards opacity of their most fundamental assumptions and methods even though most of their sources of research data were public this lack of transparency has not made it easy to scrutinize model assumptions over the history of cat modeling but fortunately it is slowly abating recognizing the demand for further openness new vendors have started to offer total academic transparency in their products which is an important feature to many clients especially those in the public sector anecdotally as a consequence of this reality we are forced to omit specifics about the origination of some of the data in the illustrative examples of this paper in order to protect vendors intellectual property we attempt to do so without detracting from the points we wish to illustrate 3 common diagnostics in model evaluation frameworks with the objective of assessing the reasonability or suitability of the model for the specific intended usage the industry routinely resorts to technical tests these are currently not prescribed or standardized with the exception of the diagnostics required by the florida commission on hurricane loss projection methodology the florida commission for acceptance of a particular cat model in the state s insurance industry see box insert the general argument expressed by regulators who oppose widely applicable standards is that model evaluation frameworks should neither stifle competition nor induce herd mentality which would lead to systemic risk but that instead they should demonstrate a responsible usage of risk management tools in harmony with the materiality of the risks involved that is how relevant they are to the organization s ability to maintain commitments to its customers 10 box insert 1 florida commission on hurricane loss projection methodology fchlpm the florida commission as it is commonly referred to is an exceptional public effort created in 1995 to evaluate and subject to approval models that aspire to be used for insurance management operations in the state of florida in the u s the framework managed by a panel of experts consists of a series of diagnostics classified according to general meteorological hydrological statistical vulnerability actuarial and computer standards 11 a series of standard forms need to be submitted by each model vendor with specific results as applied to particular portfolios designed by the fchlpm and addressing normalized questions the purpose of establishing this commission was to assure rates are neither excessive nor inadequate which illustrates the degree to which model outputs engrained within the systems of insurance companies affect the price policyholders pay for their coverage model diagnostics vary in protocol and philosophy but typically fall into the three categories that we describe in the following sections 1 sensitivity testing 2 loss validation and 3 scientific appraisal 3 1 sensitivity testing this type of test investigates the variability of model results to variability in input data such as exposure types and location it can also be extended to investigating variability of loss output due to changes in model assumptions although this is far less common as the architecture of most commercial models does not currently allow the user to alter internal model parameters often the first motivation behind the execution of these tests is to explore the impact of data quality insurance companies typically lack detailed data precise location building characteristics etc of the assets they are insuring the absence of this information increases the uncertainty in the modeling process as more assumptions need to be made in order to provide a quantitative risk assessment in order to understand the assumptions used by the model to overcome this lack of data it is important to measure the effect of different input parameters if a particular parameter has little influence on the model results the data acquisition investment may not be justified a second motivation for this kind of testing is to scrutinize the internal consistency of the model testing for instance the model results for buildings of different heights or materials reveals patterns and internal assumptions in the model that may or may not align with user expectations a typical cat model accepts four main descriptors to classify exposures these are sometimes referred to as primary modifiers or characteristics and include 1 construction typology and material 2 occupancy or usage class 3 building age and 4 building height or number of stories models presumably use these data in the hazard intensity and vulnerability components to estimate financial losses more accurately however the treatment that models make of these characteristics can be dramatically different even if all models use a common body of research as their foundation observe in fig 4 how two well regarded models in the insurance industry treat the specification of a type of building in germany the building is originally classified as unknown meaning we lack detailed information about its characteristics in a second model run the building is either classified as general residential or the more specific single family house the

characteristics increases the vulnerability versus the general average of unknown model b in contrast heavily penalizes the lack of information denoted by unknown specifying the more detailed class of general residential or single family house reduces the expected loss at most return periods by about 15 20 only by querying the model developers is it possible for re insurance companies to ascertain whether this drastically antithetical pattern of building performance is derived from justified engineering assumptions or otherwise discovering the relative importance of different risk characteristics helps insurers improve their exposure data strategy guiding data collection efforts towards those characteristics that drive their results it is also important that the user develops a critical opinion about the patterns that emerge from such testing 3 2 loss validation commercial models tend to be calibrated to losses for large distributed portfolios of assets and are intended to represent loss faithfully in the aggregate however insurance and reinsurance companies differ in size and geographic spread depending on whether they operate regionally nationally or internationally yet the same models typically packaged at national or multi national scales are offered to the market as a whole the geographic scope and resolution of the model needs to be considered carefully as

of scientific and engineering advances they are still fairly new and riddled with uncertainties and discrepancies which often pose an enormous challenge for companies to adopt them responsibly we have presented a few selected diagnostics of common usage in the industry that help assess the quality of assumptions underlying these models testing each of the model components in a framework that leverages independent datasets helps increase confidence and understanding although the inadequacy or incompleteness of reference data often complicates this proposition companies in the re insurance industry can systematically tackle the complex decision of accepting modifying or rejecting a particular model by collecting these diagnostics progressively and in harmony with their needs once diagnostics are available there still remains the challenge of aggregating results of disparate tests that address different components of the model such as hazard sensitivity and vulnerability quantification frameworks such as that proposed by li 23 based on the work by cooke 24 can be helpful in this pursuit while there are ongoing efforts in the industry to streamline rationalize and automate the model evaluation workflows in line with the principles established above or similar ones 25 26 this process still necessitates expert judgement and insight into nuances not easily quantified the treatment of levees for instance typically requires tailored testing because different approaches are followed in different models model evaluation remains a costly burden within the re insurance industry often further hindered by the lack of transparency in commercial applications stakes are high and this requires that the industry continues instigating the development of robust benchmarks that are credible and easily implemented that do not require to be reinvented by each company in each model update cycle that do not stifle innovation and that avoid introducing systemic risks declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements we wish to express our thanks to dr paul bates for his helpful review and suggestions and to our company guy carpenter for its support towards the publication of these
