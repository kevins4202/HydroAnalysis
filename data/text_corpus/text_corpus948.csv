4740,climate driven temperature variations manipulate the snowmelt process and affect various aspects of aquatic and terrestrial life the objective of this study is to evaluate the impacts of sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature on the quantity and spatial distribution of macro scale snowmelt simulations i e over macro scale basins and monthly or annual temporal scales a macro scale snow accumulation and ablation model was developed to account for sub daily temperature fluctuations unlike other existing macro scale models that rely upon a single daily average temperature the new model incorporates minimum and maximum temperatures and their occurrence timing within the day in a hybrid temperature index method htim the model was applied to the missouri river basin mrb to simulate grid based snowmelt for water years 2011 and 2012 and compared with the monthly snowmelt data from the snow data assimilation system snodas which is a physically based energy and mass balance snow model also the htim was compared with a standard tim in which only a daily average temperature was used for snowmelt simulations although the htim provided simulations comparable to the snodas snowmelt data r2 0 9 overall results indicated that the tim slightly outperformed the htim when minimum temperatures fluctuated around the freezing temperature htim underestimated the snowmelt over the mrb however htim showed a better performance particularly in the months when maximum temperatures fluctuated around the freezing temperature results suggested that the role of refreezing in the generation of snowmelt was overestimated by htim which led to a more significant discrepancy between the snodas and htim snowmelt values in specific months the findings from this study highlight the influence of sub daily temperature fluctuations on macro scale snowmelt simulations keywords snowmelt sub daily temperature fluctuations macro scale modeling missouri river basin 1 introduction the fourth national climate assessment report nca4 confirmed that the climate driven changes in the united states are already tangible in different aspects of aquatic and terrestrial life usgcrp 2018 in the northern great plains for example the fast springtime warming has led to earlier snowmelt events usgcrp 2018 among the numerous impacts of snowmelt on aquatic life and biodiversity snowmelt can significantly disturb communities by contributing to spring floods for example parts of the missouri river basin mrb and red river of the north basin rrb in dakotas and minnesota underwent a record breaking snowfall during water year 2009 followed by a historical flood in march and april of 2009 in which 48 record stages were logged at the u s geological survey streamflow gauging stations in both basins macek rowland and gross 2011 fortunately no flooding related death was reported however the costs of flooding related damages and flood fighting efforts solely in the rrb were estimated at 55 million u s dollars noaa water resource services 2009 the snow accumulation and ablation processes significantly affect the hydrologic response by storing and releasing water throughout the year jansson et al 2003 in the cold climate basins in the western united states and canada for instance snowmelt is a significant contributor to streamflow feeding 50 to 80 of the total streamflow stewart et al 2004 throughout the past decades different models have been developed to simulate snow accumulation and ablation processes these models have been honed over time by the addition of cold climate processes such as refreezing sublimation and snow on rain traditionally snowmelt models are categorized based on the use of 1 energy balance methods ebms or 2 temperature index methods tims leavesley 1989 ebms solve the energy balance equation to estimate the available energy for snowmelt generation an ebm in its original form requires a variety of meteorological data such as solar radiation temperature vapor pressure and wind speed which might or might not be available depending on the locations of study areas due to the data intensive nature of ebms a variety of modified simplified methods have been developed in which different energy balance terms are estimated based on certain simplifying assumptions and empirical relationships e g fuka et al 2012 in contrast tims simulate the amount of snowmelt on a given time step solely based on daily average temperature and a melting factor in tims the lumped melt factor relates air temperature and its influences on different energy balance fluxes to snowmelt hock 2005 leavesley 1989 hock 2005 provided a comprehensive review of ebms and tims and suggested that due to the availability of air temperature data tims will remain the most widely used method to estimate snowmelt for different purposes simplicity and practicality of the tims are the main reasons for their frequent use in several macro scale hydrologic models such as spatial processes in hydrology sphy terink et al 2015 hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv bergström 1992 hydrological predictions for the environment hype lindström et al 2010 water global assessment and prognosis watergap alcamo et al 2003 and macro scale hydrologic processes simulator macro hypros tahmasebi nasab and chu 2020 tims have been subject to various improvements to ensure reliable snowmelt simulations for regions with different hydroclimatic characteristics the majority of these improvements have been achieved by employing two approaches 1 modifying the melting factor to account for spatial and temporal variations and 2 adding the lumped effects of other energy balance terms to the original tims several studies employed the first approach to enhance snowmelt simulations hock 2003 reviewed the tim snowmelt modeling and different attempts to account for the spatiotemporal variations of the melting factor and concluded that the majority of modifications to the tim were mainly targeted to the seasonal variations of the melting factor for example rango and martinec 1995 developed the seasonally variable melting factor which led to the development of snowmelt routines accounting for the seasonal variability of the melting factor based on maximum and minimum melting factors fontaine et al 2002 singh et al 2005 adjusted the melting factor to include the impacts of both near surface soil temperature and air temperature on the snowmelt process many other studies employed the second approach for example zuzel and cox 1975 highlighted the importance of other energy balance terms they evaluated the relative significance of different meteorological variables in the snowmelt process and found that the addition of vapor pressure net radiation and wind in the tims improved snowmelt simulations by 13 in comparison with the single temperature index method also brubaker et al 1996 and hock 1999 included a radiation term in the original tim to improve snowmelt simulations specifically hock 1999 developed a grid based spatially distributed model to capture the diurnal snowmelt cycles by including potential clear sky direct solar radiation which has the advantage of requiring the same input data as the original tim i e only temperature data and a digital elevation model of the study area macro scale hydrologic models are customarily associated with regional continental or even global scales chu et al 2019 and are used to investigate the impacts of climate driven changes on hydrologic processes reasonably macro scale hydrologic models cannot take advantage of the methods that are specific to point or micro scale modeling hence before selecting a simulation method different aspects of macro scale modeling such as input data requirements and flexibility in resolution need to be considered tahmasebi nasab and chu 2020 the fact that tims provide comparable results to ebms at a macro scale wmo 1986 allows macro scale hydrologic models to incorporate different versions of tims without significant loss of information zuzel and cox 1975 the temporal resolution adopted in tims is of equal importance in the snowmelt simulation several studies have indicated that the performance of tims significantly decreases when finer temporal resolutions smaller than a couple of days are used hock 2005 1999 for example rango and martinec 1995 suggested that tims provide reliable simulations of snowmelt when they are used for weekly to seasonal time steps however they also can be used for daily simulations when linked to hydrologic models rango and martinec 1995 one of the critical simplifying assumptions behind tims that restricts their use for daily simulations is that each time step is represented by a single temperature i e the daily average temperature this assumption is reasonable when sub daily temperatures are all either above or below the freezing temperature however when sub daily temperatures fluctuate above or below the freezing temperature the single temperature tim cannot provide realistic snowmelt simulations hock 1999 žaknić ćatović et al 2018 different attempts have been made to capture the sub daily snowmelt fluctuations at point scale or subbasin scale e g dunn and colohan 1999 tobin et al 2013 žaknić ćatović et al 2018 tobin et al 2013 developed a modified tim that utilized the difference between the daily maximum and minimum temperatures to account for the diurnal snowmelt cycles at the cotton creek experimental watershed ccew in british columbia canada which had an area of 17 km2 specifically they proposed a new method to compute a time varying melting factor using a quasi sinusoidal function assuming that the daily cycle of incoming radiation can be represented by the temperature amplitude tobin et al 2013 the simulations from the original and modified tims were evaluated for both point and subbasin scales and the results indicated that the modified tim significantly improved the sub daily variability of snowmelt tobin et al 2013 moreover to account for the impacts of temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature žaknić ćatović et al 2018 proposed a modified tim that shifted the reliance of snowmelt simulations away from one temperature towards maximum and minimum temperatures the performance of the modified tim was evaluated using the observed temperature data from two weather stations in alberta and toronto canada žaknić ćatović et al 2018 the evaluation results confirmed that considering temperature variations around the freezing temperature improved the physical representation of snowmelt at a point scale i e at the weather stations žaknić ćatović et al 2018 simoni et al 2011 modified the standard tim taking into account both daily and hourly average temperatures in snowmelt simulations the modified tim was tested in a small 20 km2 snowmelt dominated alpine basin of the swiss alps indicating that while the volume of snowmelt was highly correlated to the daily average temperature hourly average temperatures were responsible for the shape of the snowmelt waves simoni et al 2011 in another effort to capture diurnal variations of snowmelt simulations webb et al 2017 utilized a two parameter beta distribution function to imitate the diurnal snowmelt variations the model was tested by using eight snow telemetry snotel stations and the results fitted the diurnal snowmelt pattern with a root mean square error of 0 008 webb et al 2017 despite prior efforts to show better snowmelt simulations by incorporating sub daily temperatures into the tim at a point scale and or small basin scale few studies have addressed challenges associated with snowmelt simulations in macro scale basins having an area of greater than a few thousand km2 the vast area covered by macro scale basins brings about diverse hydro climatic topographic and land cover characteristics each of which can alter different hydrologic processes including snow accumulation and ablation process tahmasebi nasab and chu 2020 however since the majority of existing macro scale models run at daily weekly monthly annual timesteps gudmundsson et al 2012 kauffeldt et al 2016 sood and smakhtin 2015 the impacts of sub daily temperature variations around the freezing temperature on snowmelt simulations at coarser spatio temporal scales remain unknown incorporating sub daily temperature variations into macro scale hydrologic models sows the seeds for investigating specific questions such as do sub daily temperature variations improve the simulations in comparison to standard tims in macro scale basins what are the impacts of sub daily temperature variations on snowmelt in wet and dry years should sub daily temperature variations be incorporated into macro scale models consequently this study uses a macro scale approach to incorporate sub daily temperature fluctuations into the standard tim to investigate the influences of sub daily temperature variations on the snowmelt simulations over large spatiotemporal scales i e monthly or annual scales in macro scale basins the main objective of this study is to evaluate the adoption of sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature on macro scale snowmelt simulations to accomplish this objective a new macro scale snow accumulation and ablation model msm is developed in which sub daily temperature variations around the freezing temperature are included by incorporating maximum and minimum temperatures and their occurrence timing in a hybrid tim htim htim has the advantage of retaining the simplicity of the standard tim by using widely available temperature datasets in addition to temperature datasets the developed msm utilizes only eight parameters that are defined based on the specific characteristics of different study areas which can be easily incorporated into macro scale hydrologic models for simulations in areas with limited data the model is applied to the mrb and the simulation results are compared with the snowmelt data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national operational hydrologic remote sensing center nohrsc snow data assimilation system snodas moreover the modeling results are compared with those simulated by a standard tim to identify potential similarities and differences between htim and tim 2 study area stretching from western montana to st louis mo the mrb fig 1 a has a drainage area of 1 37 m km2 covering parts of 10 u s states 98 of the mrb s drainage area and 2 canadian provinces the mrb is an important global agricultural region and produces nearly half 46 of the u s wheat mehta et al 2013 according to the cropland data layer cdl classifications boryan et al 2011 grassland pasture and cropland are the dominant land use types fig 1b and corn and soybeans are the two leading crops in the mrb also different types of forests i e evergreen and deciduous are mostly scattered on the western side of the basin fig 1b accounting for 10 of the basin s land the mrb encompasses a wide variety of hydroclimatic geologic and topographic conditions for example the basin has an elevation drop of more than 4 km from the western side to the eastern side of the basin fig 1c several studies have highlighted the current and future hydroclimatic variations of the mrb caused by climate driven changes livneh et al 2016 u s bureau of reclamation 2016 wise et al 2018 the 2016 secure water act report projected a 2 78 c to 3 34 c increase in mrb s temperature throughout the 21st century u s bureau of reclamation 2016 by prompting earlier snowmelt and reducing streamflow during summer months this warming trend impacts many aspects of the basin such as biodiversity agriculture and navigation wise et al 2018 since temperature is projected to continue its increasing trend throughout the 21st century u s bureau of reclamation 2016 understanding the snowmelt process and improving its representation in hydrologic models can lead to more realistic modeling results for the mrb the 2011 record breaking flood in the mrb which was immediately followed by the 2012 drought is a typical example of expected hydroclimatic variations in the basin the extents of wetness and dryness of these representative years i e 2011 and 2012 are more evident when they are compared to the long term annual precipitation and temperature fig 2 a h the average 30 year 1981 2010 precipitation in the basin is 538 mm with southern parts of the basin receiving more precipitation than high elevation northern and western parts of the basin fig 2a the annual precipitation in 2011 was 623 mm which is approximately 15 higher than the 30 year average comparing fig 2a with fig 2b reveals that the majority of the increase in precipitation in 2011 took place in the high elevation parts of the basin in which precipitation is in the form of snowfall the cold season precipitation in the upper mrb increased by 36 7 relative to the basin s normal climatic condition badger et al 2018 which led to a historic flood across the basin specifically the area that experienced a precipitation amount of 400 600 mm and 600 900 mm grew by 6 8 and 14 8 respectively fig 2a and fig 2b in sharp contrast the annual precipitation in 2012 was only 403 mm which is about 25 lower than the 30 year normal precipitation the spatial analysis of precipitation in 2012 also indicates that the area of the basin experiencing precipitation of 400 600 mm shrunk by 19 2 fig 2a and fig 2c notably the changes in the amount of precipitation were more pronounced in the high elevation parts of the basin fig 2a c to pinpoint the specific changes in precipitation from 2011 to 2012 fig 2d depicts the spatial distribution of the discrepancy ratio of precipitation i e precipitation in 2011 divided by precipitation in 2012 over the basin the results from discrepancy ratio analysis showed that in 72 8 and 23 9 of the basin s area in 2011 precipitation was 1 2 times and 2 times larger than the amount of precipitation in 2012 respectively fig 2d in addition to precipitation temperature variations played an important role in the extent of wetness and dryness of 2011 and 2012 fig 2e 2h although the 30 year normal and 2011 temperature variations followed similar spatial trends fig 2e and fig 2f fig 2g shows that the year 2012 was significantly warmer than the 30 year normal condition and 2011 the average temperatures over the basin in 2011 and 2012 were 7 4 c and 9 5 c respectively having standard deviations of 2 8 c and 2 9 c particularly the temperature rise in upper mrb is evident where the area of the basin having temperatures between 4 and 8 c decreased to from 51 9 in 2011 to 25 2 in 2012 fig 2f and fig 2g and was substituted by higher temperatures a point by point comparison between temperatures in 2012 and 2011 showed that 100 of mrb accounted for higher temperatures in 2012 fig 2h with an average increase of 2 0 c fig 2h also reveals that 11 9 of the basin i e areas indicated by red in fig 2h experienced a significant temperature rise of more than 2 5 c from 2011 to 2012 therefore as a combined result of higher temperatures and lower precipitation than 30 year normal the 2012 drought occurred and highly stressed the food producing regions of the mrb fuchs et al 2012 3 methodology 3 1 design of the study and data acquisition the msm is used to simulate snow accumulation and ablation processes in the mrb for consecutive wys 2011 and 2012 731 days from october 1st 2010 to september 30th 2012 as previously mentioned wys 2011 and 2012 are characterized by their wet and dry hydroclimatic conditions where wy 2011 represents a wet year and wy 2012 represents a dry year the study area is discretized into 54 144 grids of 5 5 km2 and snow accumulation and ablation processes are simulated separately for each cell the msm uses eight pre defined model parameters to simulate different snow accumulation and ablation processes these modeling parameters and their values are listed in table 1 since the spatially distributed macro scale measured snowmelt data are not available the simulated snowmelt results from the htim are compared with the snowmelt data from the noaa s national operational hydrologic remote sensing center nohrsc snow data assimilation system snodas hereafter snodas data nohrsc 2004 snodas is a modeling system that provides estimates of snow related variables for hydrologic modeling and analysis snodas employs physically based spatially distributed energy and mass balance methods to assimilate satellite derived airborne and ground based observations of snow covered areas and snow water equivalent barrett 2003 the simulation results from the htim are further compared with those from the tim to underline the impacts of sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature on the macro scale snowmelt modeling the spatiotemporal results from htim and tim are compared against the snodas data to provide a holistic picture of snowmelt variations over mrb for example the coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias are two statistics that are used to determine the goodness of fit and the average tendency of the simulations to overestimate pbias 0 or underestimate pbias 0 snowmelt the performance of the models was additionally evaluated by using the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which facilitates the assessment of different components of the model s performance such as timing magnitude and variability the kge is given by gupta et al 2009 1 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between the simulated and observed values α is the ratio between the standard deviation values of the simulated and observed data to measure the relative variability of the simulations and β is the ratio between the mean values of the simulated and observed data to represent the bias of the simulations the kge ranges from to 1 in which kge 1 0 represents the perfect match following rogelis et al 2016 the model performance can be categorized into three classes poor kge 0 intermediate 0 5 kge 0 75 and good kge 0 75 table 2 lists the sources of data used in the msm the snodas snowmelt data provide the estimates of snowmelt for hydrologic modeling and analysis nohrsc 2004 the snodas digital images were first clipped to the boundaries of the mrb and then resampled from the original 1 km resolution to 5 km resolution digital images to facilitate the comparison between the simulated snowmelt and the snodas snowmelt data the land use and land cover dataset was downloaded from the cdl dataset boryan et al 2011 and was clipped to the boundaries of the study area the precipitation data for the study area were obtained from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism climate group 2004 that generates grid based estimates of annual monthly and daily climatic data such as precipitation by incorporating point scale weather station observations the digital elevation model dem of the basin and other spatial datasets daly et al 1994 since there have been concerns about the potential biases in the prism temperature products oyler et al 2015b wise et al 2018 the grid based maximum and minimum temperatures tmin and tmax data were retrieved from the topography weather topowx dataset oyler et al 2015a and the daily average temperature was computed by using tmin and tmax in addition to incorporating the weather station observations and topographic variables topowx uses atmospheric reanalysis data and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land skin temperature to provide 800 m resolution gridded datasets of daily minimum and maximum air temperatures oyler et al 2015a both the prism precipitation data and the topowx temperatures were resampled to 5 km resolution grids to be incorporated in the msm to find the time of occurrence of tmin and tmax i e tmin and tmax the mrb was divided into 58 noaa climate divisions fig 3 a within each climate division a weather station was selected and hourly temperature variations were obtained from the national climatic data center ncdc local climatological data lcd for all 58 selected stations ncdc 2018 based on the hourly temperature variations tmin and tmax were extracted for each day and used to calculate the average monthly tmin and tmax from october 2010 to september 2012 all grids within each climate division share the same tmin and tmax assuming similar monthly variations of tmin and tmax the analysis of hourly temperature variations showed that tmin and tmax followed an expected general trend indicating that tmin occurred around sunrise and tmax took place right after midday it was observed that the northern stations showed a higher degree of variability in tmin and tmax between warm and cold months than the southern stations for example fig 3b and fig 3c show the seasonal variations of tmin and tmax for two selected stations in southern and northern mrb station 1 and station 2 respectively station 1 tends to show less variability in tmin and tmax fig 3b whereas station 2 shows significant variability between warm and cold months fig 3c fig 3d depicts the average tmin and tmax and their ranges for all 58 stations in which the variability between cold and warm months is evident the average monthly values of times of occurrence of tmin and tmax i e tmin and tmax are used because daily tmax and tmin values only represent variations of one specific point over the basin at best every climate station depicted in fig 3a represents temperature variations of one 5x5 km2 grid it could be assumed that all grids within a climate division share the same daily temperature variations however each climate division in mrb covers a vast area and contains roughly 1 000 grids of 5x5 km2 with various physiographic conditions that can affect their temperature variations using monthly average values in the climate divisions would be a better representative of the division since it portrays an average condition for a climate station in addition one of the main reasons for the popularity of tims is their applicability in data sparse basins this advantage is even more pronounced in macro scale basins where the area of a basin is larger than a few thousand square kilometers although finding the hourly temperature variations for 58 stations in this study was possible for a 2 year simulation in the highly gauged mrb there are not many basins within the us and around the world having the luxury of long term reliable hourly distributed temperature data therefore since one of the goals of htim is to maintain the data requirements of tims at a macro scale monthly average tmax and tmin values are considered reasonably when multiple climate stations are available within a climate division hourly temperatures can be used to eliminate the lumped monthly consideration of tmin and tmax 3 2 standard vs hybrid temperature index method a standard tim is commonly expressed as 2 m c m t ave δ t t ave 0 0 t ave 0 where m is the snowmelt mm cm is the melting factor mm c 1 day 1 and tave is the average temperature oc during time step δt day despite its popularity the standard tim has the potential to underestimate or overestimate daily snowmelt noticeably fig 4 a depicts hourly temperature variations for two hypothetical consecutive days which reveal how the tim can miscalculate snowmelt the daily average temperatures for day 1 and day 2 in fig 4a are 0 8 c and 1 6 c respectively according to the tim day 1 does not generate any snowmelt since its average temperature is less than the assumed freezing temperature i e 0 c however nearly half of day 1 has greater than 0 c temperatures fig 4a in other words the tim does not yield any snowmelt even though half of day 1 can potentially generate snowmelt the case illustrated in fig 4a occurs only when sub daily temperatures fluctuate around the freezing temperature and it is not the case when temperatures are all above below the freezing temperature day 2 in fig 4a to alleviate this issue a hybrid tim is used to take advantage of the standard tim and meanwhile consider daily maximum and minimum temperatures at known occurrence times žaknić ćatović et al 2018 this hybrid approach provides sub daily simulations of snowmelt and refreezing and also is simple enough to be incorporated into macro scale hydrologic models for example tahmasebi nasab and chu 2020 incorporated an htim in the snow band of macro hypros macro scale hydrologic processes simulator to simulate the variations of different hydrologic processes in the red river basin the htim incorporates the daily minimum and maximum temperatures i e tmin and tmax respectively for simulating snowmelt when tmin is lower than 0 c and tmax is higher than 0 c fig 4b calculating snowmelt and refreezing using the htim requires sub daily temperature variations either measured or synthetic sub daily temperatures can be utilized to obtain these variations for example žaknić ćatović et al 2018 tested two approaches to estimate hourly temperature variations based on 1 a linear relationship and 2 a double cosine trigonometric relationship between tmin and tmax in this study a simple geometric method was used to approximate the sub daily defacto melting and freezing periods based on the area of two triangles fig 4b the htim establishes a linear relationship between tmin and tmax at their known times of occurrence to simulate the sub daily snowmelt and refreezing processes fig 4b in this method snowmelt and refreezing are calculated for a fraction of the day with temperatures higher and lower than 0 c respectively for the days in which tmin is lower than 0 c and tmax is higher than 0 c snowmelt and refreezing are approximated using the two triangles representing melt and refreeze processes fig 4b the linear relationship between tmin and tmax for each day is written as 3 t a t b where t is the temperature oc at time t hour and a and b are the slope and the intercept of the line respectively these two coefficients i e a and b are calculated for each day based on the following general forms 4 a t max t min t max t min 5 b t min t max t max t min t max t min in which tmax and tmin are the occurrence times of tmax and tmin respectively that determine the location of the triangles in fig 4b within each day if tmax occurs earlier than tmin in a day the order of the triangles in fig 3b switches in this case the same set of equations are applicable but the slope of the line in eq 2 becomes negative although every day in a year may have different tmax and tmin tmax mostly occurs after midday and tmin occurs shortly after sunrise guo et al 2014 izquierdo et al 2002 the time series of average monthly tmax and tmin are utilized as the model input data to account for the monthly variations of tmax and tmin for all grids within a climate division δtmlt and δtrfr are the bases of the two triangles in fig 4b and are calculated based on the time intercept of the line between tmin and tmax with 0 c equation 2 eventually snowmelt and refreezing for each day are computed using the areas of the two triangles the htim also incorporates the standard tim for days in which both tmin and tmax are above below 0 c according to the htim the snowmelt and refreezing for different tmin and tmax values are written as 6 m c m t ave δ t t min 0 t max 0 c m t max 2 δ t mlt t min 0 t max 0 7 r c f t ave δ t t min 0 t max 0 c f t min 2 δ t rfr t min 0 t max 0 where r is the potential refrozen meltwater mm cf is a freezing factor mm oc 1 day 1 and δtmlt and δtrfr represent the defacto melting and freezing periods day the δtmlt and δtrfr required to compute snowmelt for a sample day with fluctuations in tmin and tmax on either side of 0 c are depicted in fig 4b it is worth mentioning that although different studies have suggested a strong correlation between snowmelt and air temperature e g braithwaite and olesen 1989 snowmelt is also a function of other terms in the energy balance equation leavesley 1989 ohmura 2001 for example snowpack temperature can play an essential role in the generation of snowmelt however different tims do not explicitly account for snowpack temperature it should also be noted that the snowmelt and refreezing processes do not start and end respectively precisely at 0 c and they might fluctuate around 0 c based on other factors such as altitude wind humidity etc anderson 2006 neither the standard tim nor the modified versions including htim account for factors other than the air temperature all other energy balance terms are lumped into a melting freezing factor that in this study changes with regard to space and time thus studies suggest that simulations from the family of tims should be interpreted for average conditions hock 2005 3 3 development of a macro scale snow accumulation and ablation model a macro scale snow model msm is developed to simulate the dynamics of snow accumulation and ablation the msm is a grid based daily model that discretizes the land surface into user defined square grids the model utilizes a user defined transitional temperature range ttr to distinguish three different precipitation forms i e rainfall snowfall and mixed rainfall and snowfall the ttr is determined based on manual calibration and provides the flexibility of selecting a proper temperature range based on the characteristics of specific regions when tave is lower than or equal to the lower bound of the ttr ttmin precipitation is assumed to be snowfall when tave is higher than or equal to the upper bound of the ttr ttmax precipitation is considered in the form of rainfall if tave falls within the ttr a mixed form of rainfall and snowfall is considered assuming that snowfall decreases linearly from ttmin to ttmax fig 5 shows the flowchart of the msm and the three different precipitation forms the msm simulates dynamic snowpack storage snowmelt rain on snow and refrozen meltwater if precipitation is in the form of snowfall or a combination of rainfall and snowfall the snowpack water equivalent is updated based on the forest canopy snow interception snowfall accumulation and melting refreezing processes fig 5 if precipitation is solely in the form of rainfall the simulated processes vary depending on the availability of snowpack on the ground fig 5 snowpack water equivalent is updated based on the amount of snow reaching the ground surface snos mm actual snowmelt and snowpack water equivalent of the previous time step 8 s w e t g s w e t 1 g m a t 1 g c sn sno s t g where t is the time step g is the grid number swe mm is the snowpack water equivalent ma is the actual snowmelt mm and csn is a snowfall correction factor and accounts for the losses from sublimation and redistribution anderson 2006 csn can be ignored for cold climate regions with a significant amount of snow and multiple snowfall events however it cannot be neglected for areas with a small number of snowfall events since the losses for these regions are typically higher anderson 2006 csn is suggested to vary between 0 7 and 1 6 anderson 2002 the actual snowmelt ma mm is calculated based on the available water for melt awm mm and a maximum snowpack water retention storage sprmx 9 m a t g a w m t g spr mx t g a w m t g spr mx t g 0 a w m t g spr mx t g in which sprmx acts as a threshold for the snowmelt generation process the snowpack water retention storage spr retains meltwater until reaching sprmx in other words sprmx is a threshold to delay the generation of snowmelt the water stored in spr can refreeze when the temperature is below 0 c and the amount of sprmx is simulated as a fraction of swe 10 spr mx t g c wr s w e t g where cwr is the coefficient of water retention storage generally equal to 0 1 suggested

incorporating a simple tim liston et al 2006 assuming that the amount of refreezing is negligible 14 m f t g c fm t ave t g t ave 0 0 t ave 0 where cfm is the forest melting factor cfm it should be noted that since the snowmelt from the forest canopy is much lower than the surface snowmelt the original tim was used for simulating snowmelt from the forest canopy the amount of meltwater from a rain on snow event mr mm is calculated when precipitation is in the form of rainfall and there is snowpack on the ground assuming that the rainfall temperature is equal to tave and the snow surface temperature is 0 c the amount of mr is simulated by using the following equation qi et al 2017 in which rnf is rainfall mm 15 m r t g 0 0126 t ave t g r n f t g as discussed in the previous section

late spring cmx is of greater importance while cmx and cmn are both equally important in the areas with frequent snowmelt events during winter anderson 2006 in addition to the temporal variations of cm the spatial distribution of cm for different grids is taken into account based on the land use types the values of the maximum and minimum melting factors for different land use types are listed in table 3 it is notable that forest covers typically have a small melting factor whereas urban areas have larger melting factors table 3 4 results 4 1 temporal analysis of htim and tim simulations vs snodas snowmelt the snowmelt results simulated by the htim and tim are compared with the snodas snowmelt data to ensure that both methods provide acceptable simulations fig 6 a c depict the monthly annual snowmelt over the mrb as well as a monthly graphical comparison between the htim and tim simulations and the snodas snowmelt data fig 6a highlights an extreme hydroclimatic discrepancy between wys 2011 and 2012 wy 2011 as a wet year accounted for higher snowmelt peaks and a longer extended snowmelt period whereas wy 2012 as a dry year had smaller peaks and a shorter snowmelt period reasonably the magnitude of snowmelt peaks in both wys highly depends on the amount of winter precipitation fig 6a indicates that the snowmelt peaks for both wys occurred in march and april however as a direct result of higher winter precipitation in wy 2011 snowmelt peaks in march and april of wy 2011 were 1 7 and 2 0 times larger than those in wy 2012 respectively comparing the simulation results by htim and tim in fig 6a reveals that both methods followed a similar simulation pattern due to their temperature fluctuations different months played important roles in the variations of snowmelt in the mrb for example the results showed that the average snowmelt over the basin simulated by htim in december 2010 i e 7 2 mm which is closer to the snodas estimate of 7 6 mm was 1 9 times higher than the snowmelt simulated by tim i e 3 8 mm the yearly comparison depicted in fig 6b shows that the mrb in wy 2012 had an average snowmelt value of 87 69 mm which is roughly half of the average snowmelt in wy 2011 162 45 mm although htim and tim demonstrated certain discrepancies in the monthly results the differences between their annual averages were 1 2 mm3 and 23 011 m3 in wy 2011 and wy 2012 respectively corresponding to less than one millimeter of water over the basin area overall fig 6a and 6b indicate that htim and tim snowmelt simulations are comparable to the snodas snowmelt estimates the annual comparison also shows that the absolute errors between the simulated average snowmelt over the mrb and the snodas data in wys 2011 and 2012 are less than 12 specifically the error percentages for the htim and tim were 11 03 and 11 11 in wy2011 and 7 42 and 7 44 in wy2012 respectively the graphical comparison between the snodas and simulated snowmelt fig 6c indicates that when snowmelt was less than 10 mm both methods slightly overestimated the snowmelt on the other hand when snowmelt was greater than 10 mm htim and tim underestimated the snowmelt statistical analyses of the simulated results showed that the coefficient of determination r2 for the monthly comparison was higher than 0 90 for both methods i e htim r2 0 902 and tim r2 0 912 indicating a good agreement between the simulated snowmelt by htim and tim and the snodas data in addition to r2 the pbias analyses of the htim and tim simulations against the snodas data revealed that both methods have an average tendency to generate smaller snowmelt values than the corresponding snodas values that is both htim and tim had negative pbias values 9 77 and 9 78 respectively in other words both htim and tim underestimated snowmelt in comparison with snodas estimates although r2 and pbias provided insight into how simulations from the two methods differ from snodas they did not reveal significant differences between htim and tim results from the discrepancy analysis in three months of february march and april in 2011 months with highest snowmelt values showed that htim simulations were on average 7 5 smaller than tim simulations in 2012 however results indicated that htim simulations were on average 7 larger than tim simulations in february march and april in addition to r2 and pbias the kge values for htim and tim were 0 82 and 0 88 respectively falling into the good model performance range the kge results for wys 2011 and 2012 suggested that tim simulations are slightly closer to the snodas data than htim simulations the variations between the snodas snowmelt and the simulated snowmelt by using msm can be attributed to the underlying methodologies in formulating snowmelt in the two snow models specifically msm is a simple daily bucket model that only requires eight pre defined parameters while snodas is a multi layered three snow layers and two soil layers spatially distributed energy and mass balance model which simulates snowmelt at hourly time steps based on the thermal dynamics of different layers barrett 2003 in addition to the differences in the methodologies the variations between the snodas and simulated snowmelt values also stem from the inclusion of detailed meteorological datasets such as surface zonal wind surface meridional wind relative humidity solar radiation and many other variables in snodas barrett 2003 whereas htim only utilizes widely available daily temperature datasets fig 7 helps to better understand the similarities and differences between htim and tim over the simulation period fig 7a depicts the relationship between the tave and the actual simulation difference i e htim snowmelt minus tim snowmelt represented by different bubble sizes and colors in fig 7a from fig 7a it can be observed that the discrepancy among simulations from the two models is higher when tave was between 10 c and 10 c quantitively 84 9 of the total difference between the simulated snowmelt by htim and tim stemmed from the months in which tave ranged from 10 c to 10 c specifically out of 241 days in which tmax was greater than 0 c and tmin was less than 0 c 223 days were in months having tave between 10 c and 10 c the number of days in each month in which temperature fluctuated above and below zero is shown in fig 7b although the discrepancies between htim and tim simulations i e htim snowmelt divided by tim snowmelt were higher for the months with a larger number of temperature fluctuating days the highest discrepancy values e g red arrows in fig 7b did not exactly correspond to the months with the highest temperature fluctuating days this can be attributed to the amount of snowfall snowpack and temperature nuances these sample months are further investigated in the next section 4 2 spatial analysis of htim and tim simulations vs snodas snowmelt data in order to pinpoint the differences between htim and tim three sample months were selected for further analyses fig 8 a l the selected months were chosen for their hydroclimatic characteristics as follows december 2010 accounted for the highest discrepancy ratio i e 1 9 between htim and tim simulations over the simulation period in contrast with december 2010 tim simulations were larger than htim simulations in march 2012 the results indicated that tim snowmelt simulations in march 2012 were more than 30 greater than htim simulations april 2011 received the highest amount of snowfall over the simulation period which was 9 1 and 7 higher than snowfall in january and february 2011 respectively these three months also had specific temperature characteristics that make them stand out for further investigation specifically december 2010 march 2012 and april 2011 accounted for 16 11 and 15 days in which the average tmax was greater than 0 c and the average tmin was less than 0 c i e temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature to understand the snowmelt variations over mrb spatially distributed results are presented in three classes i e low moderate and high to facilitate the comparison between the simulated and snodas snowmelt results fig 8a l the classification was performed based on the jenks natural breaks classification method jenks 1967 that finds the best arrangement of values in a given dataset fig 8a c indicate that the spatial distribution of snowmelt classes in htim resembled snodas better than tim results in december 2010 in comparison with tim results htim simulated larger class 2 and class 3 snowmelt in december 2010 which was attributed to the sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature throughout december 2010 when on average 53 25 of the basin experienced tmin 0 and tmax 0 fig 8d specifically the coverage percentage of class 3 i e high snowmelt by htim was 3 5 times larger than the coverage percentage of the class 3 snowmelt by tim which led to the generation of 3 38 mm more snowmelt over the basin specifically in high elevation western parts of mrb although htim simulated more snowmelt in december 2010 tim simulated 32 2 more snowmelt than the htim in march 2012 particularly htim resulted in an average of 16 20 mm of snowmelt over the basin whereas tim simulated 21 42 mm of snowmelt the spatial coverages of three classes of snowmelt in march 2012 fig 8e h show a general resemblance between the htim and tim simulated distributed results however there are nuances in the spatial distributions of snowmelt which are due to the temperature variations on average 88 30 of the basin was covered by areas with tmin 0 and tmax 0 in march 2012 the average tmin over the basin was 2 83 c and the average tmax was 15 98 c which led to different class coverages between htim and tim fig 8h the discrepancy ratios between the two methods for classes 1 2 and 3 in march 2012 were 1 2 0 72 and 0 76 respectively snowmelt results in march 2012 indicated that both the magnitude and distribution of the simulated snowmelt by htim were closer to snodas snowmelt while tim overestimated snowmelt by 17 4 htim underestimated snowmelt only by 11 in march 2012 december 2010 and march 2012 were two months in which the htim results were better than those from tim and closer to the snodas snowmelt data in some months however tim provided better simulations than htim for example the difference between the snodas and tim snowmelt results in april 2011 was only 0 6 mm which is much smaller than that of htim 4 46 mm a closer look at the spatial distribution of the simulated snowmelt in april 2011 by snodas htm and tim reveals that tim simulated more class 3 snowmelt that was more comparable to the snodas data fig 8i l specifically 7 5 3 8 and 8 6 of the basin was covered by class 3 snowmelt simulated by snodas htim and tim respectively the overall monthly results suggest that although there are some differences in both magnitude and spatial coverage of the snowmelt simulated by htim and tim these differences are only pronounced in the months when the majority of the basin experienced temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature fig 9 a h provide a comparison between the spatial distribution of snowmelt in wys 2011 and 2012 by snodas htim and tim fig 9a h highlight the relationship between the topography of the mrb and the snowmelt magnitude notably the western side of the mrb which is characterized by high altitudes fig 1c accounts for a considerable amount of snowmelt in both wet and dry years wy 2011 as a wet year accounted for more snowmelt mainly on the western and eastern sides of the basin fig 9a although the majority of the basin was covered by class 2 snowmelt class 3 covered more than 33 of the basin and directly contributed to high snowmelt specifically in the upper mrb fig 9a both htim and tim followed the general expected pattern of more snowmelt in the western and eastern parts in wy 2011 which is also in accordance with snodas fig 9a c however spatial discrepancies are more pronounced specifically in class 3 snowmelt where the class 3 in snodas results covered 11 more area than htim and tim also fig 9b and fig 9c suggest that there are only marginal differences in the class coverages of snowmelt between the htim and tim which led to less than a millimeter difference in the annual snowmelt between the two methods fig 6b fig 9d depicts the difference percentage between the tim and htim snowmelt simulations from fig 9d it can be observed that both methods resulted in very similar annual results having a difference of less than 1 mostly concentrated in the western parts of the basin in wy 2011 on the other hand wy 2012 as a dry year experienced lower snowmelt than wy 2011 fig 9e g although classes 1 and 2 covered more than 90 of the basin the high altitude western side of the basin was responsible for the majority of the snowmelt throughout the year fig 9e similar to wy 2011 a quantitative comparison of the three snowmelt coverage classes between the htim and tim indicated that the discrepancy in the spatial distributions between the two methods was marginal fig 9f and fig 9g similarly the snowmelt values simulated over the basin by the two methods were close to each other having a difference of less than 1 fig 9h analyzing monthly and yearly snowmelt simulations reveals that sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature play a more prominent role in monthly macro scale snowmelt simulations especially for the months in which a vast majority of the basin experiences tmax 0 c and tmin 0 c however the impacts of sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature are marginal for the annual timescale 5 discussion 5 1 how are temperature fluctuations reflected in htim results in order to investigate the reason behind the discrepancy between htim and tim an analysis of daily temperatures is required fig 10 depicts the variations of tmax tmin and tave throughout the simulation period and two selected months i e december 2010 and april 2011 which were discussed from the snowmelt variation perspective in section 4 2 specifically htim provided simulations closer to the snodas data in december 2010 while tim yielded simulations closer to the snodas data in april 2011 the average tmax and tmin over the basin were respectively greater and smaller than 0 c in 241 days out of 731 days reasonably the majority of these days 74 occurred in the 5 month period from december to april fig 10a fig 10b depicts the temperature variations in december 2010 in which the basin tave was consistently lower than the freezing temperature except for december 9th 2010 the average tmax over the basin however repeatedly fluctuated above and below 0 c 16 days above and 15 days below 0 c as a result the snowmelt simulated by htim in december 2010 was 1 9 times greater than that from tim and both the magnitude and the spatial distribution of the htim simulated snowmelt in the mrb were closer to those of snodas on the other hand while tave in the mrb was higher than 0 c in all days of april 2011 tmin fluctuated around the freezing temperature 15 days above and 15 days below 0 c fig 10c since htim incorporated tmin in its simulations its snowmelt was 13 52 lower than that of tim which provided results closer to snodas in both magnitude and spatial distribution the above analysis indicated that by using tmin htim overestimated the role of refreezing in restricting snowmelt in the mrb one of the possible reasons for overestimating the role of refreezing in htim is the simplistic consideration of the freezing factor cf in equation 7 although many investigations have addressed the spatial and temporal variations of the melting factor e g fontaine et al 2002 rango and martinec 1995 singh et al 2005 zuzel and cox 1975 the freezing factor is commonly considered as a constant terink et al 2015 žaknić ćatović et al 2018 at best the freezing factor is set to change with elevations for example ragettli et al 2015 assumed that 100 of snowmelt refroze at elevations higher than 5500 m in htim the freezing factor was assumed as a constant 0 05 over time and space table 1 as a result the role of refreezing to reduce snowmelt was not accurately represented reasonably similar to the melting factor incorporating a method to adjust the freezing factor spatially and temporally could help enhance the modeling results of the htim to consolidate our analysis of the htim performance december 28th 2010 and march 10th 2012 which possess contrasting temperature attributes were selected to showcase the impacts of sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature on daily snowmelt simulations december 28th 2010 was selected because the majority of the basin had tave 0 c and maximum and minimum temperatures fluctuated around the freezing temperature in 80 4 of the basin on the other hand march 10th 2012 was chosen because the majority of the basin experienced tave 0 c and the maximum and minimum temperatures fluctuated around the freezing temperature in 84 7 of the basin the average temperature for 89 1 of the basin on december 28th 2010 was lower than 0 c whereas the remaining 10 9 of the basin had temperatures higher than 0 c fig 11 a a visual comparison between fig 11b and fig 11c reveals that while snowmelt was solely limited to the areas with tave 0 c in tim the htim generated additional snowmelt in the regions with tave 0 c in other words the htim utilized tmax and tmin to recognize the days in which snowmelt occurred only in a portion of the days in such days the htim had a higher potential to generate snowmelt in comparison to the tim fig 11d specifically the average amount of snowmelt simulated by the htim was 0 44 mm whereas the tim generated only 0 03 mm of snowmelt 93 2 lower than the htim value on december 28th 2010 tave for the majority of the basin on march 10th 2012 was higher than 0 c and only 1 0 of the basin experienced average temperatures lower than 0 c the spatial analysis of tmax and tmin showed that tmax was higher than 0 c and tmin was lower than the freezing temperature in 84 7 of the basin fig 11e a quantitative comparison of the spatial distributions of the snowmelt simulated by the htim and tim shows that the htim generated snowmelt only over 16 33 of the basin fig 11f while the tim generated snowmelt over 24 5 of the basin fig 11g these spatial differences in the snowmelt results directly translate to a difference in the magnitudes of the snowmelt simulated by the two methods fig 11h the tim generated 1 80 mm of snowmelt whereas the htim generated 0 79 mm of snowmelt on march 10 2012 which was 43 9 lower than the tim value unlike december 28th 2010 the discrepancy between the snowmelt values simulated by the two methods for march 10th 2012 was due to the refreezing potential which reduced the snowmelt generation potential over the basin in the htim although the standard tim did not capture these variations in snowmelt and refreezing as the majority of the basin had temperatures higher than 0 c the role of refreezing in htim was overestimated which led to a greater difference between htim and snodas than tim 6 htim contributions and limitations different types of tims have been traditionally compared to ebms to evaluate their performances in hydrologic applications results from different studies indicate that when it comes to the models performance the proper use of a snowmelt model is more significant than the model complexity mutzner et al 2015 results from this study also highlighted that the standard tim and htim both provided snowmelt simulations comparable to snodas in the mrb however rather than incorporating temperature variations at a small scale this study focused on developing an htim tailored for macro scale snowmelt simulations parallel to the results from small scale investigations e g cazorzi and dalla fontana 1996 hock 1999 jost et al 2012 kane et al 1997 simoni et al 2011 tobin et al 2013 webb et al 2017 the results from this study also showed that daily macro scale snowmelt variations could be directly attributed to the sub daily temperature variations similar to the approach used in this study žaknić ćatović et al 2018 developed a modified version of tim that used daily extremes at known times of occurrence by employing two temperature curve generation methods although the simulated snowmelt was not directly compared to the observed snowmelt it was concluded that the modified tim was not a replacement for the standard tim and using a combination of both standard and modified tim based on the temperature variations was recommended žaknić ćatović et al 2018 in this study both tim and htim were compared to the snodas data to provide a better understanding of their performances specifically the comparisons of monthly simulated snowmelt by htim and tim revealed that htim could generate either more or less snowmelt than the standard tim depending on the tmax and tmin distributions for certain months the comparison between the annual htim and tim simulations however revealed that both methods resulted in nearly identical snowmelt simulations webb et al 2017 suggested utilizing soil moisture sensor data to evaluate the timing of snowmelt from the base of the snowpack and correct the inherent measurement errors since the snodas used as a benchmark in this study is also model simulated data it would be beneficial to further compare tim and htim with the observed soil moisture data to assess the timing of snowmelt generated by the two models a question that can be approached is which method provided more accurate macro scale snowmelt results the daily snowmelt analysis demonstrated that the htim is able to capture the temperature fluctuations and their impacts on the snowmelt and refreezing processes based on tmax and tmin however the snowmelt process is a complex process that in addition to temperature is subject to other terms of the energy balance equation and spatial variations hock 2003 1999 although the addition of tmax and tmin to the standard tim can assist in capturing the sub daily temperature variations it does not necessarily result in more realistic snowmelt simulations than the original tim therefore since the extreme air temperatures i e tmax and tmin are the only factors considered in htim it can potentially overestimate or underestimate snowmelt depending on the temperature distribution of the study area over the simulation period as other studies also suggest e g webb et al 2017 the addition of other factors such as radiation can provide a controlling factor and further improve the htim results the monthly results suggested that tim slightly overperformed htim kge 0 88 for tim kge 0 82 for htim over the simulation period in wys 2011 and 2012 in the mrb although htim provided snowmelt magnitude and distribution closer to snodas in the months when tmax fluctuated around 0 c e g december 2010 it underestimated snowmelt in the months when tmin fluctuated around 0 c e g april 2011 this can be attributed to the simplistic representation of the freezing factor i e constant over time and space in the set of equations used to simulate snowmelt and refreezing incorporating approaches to adjust the freezing factor in htim over time and space could help improve the htim performance bengtsson 1982 by considering the sub daily temperature variations htim provides the foundation for further studies on other basins with different hydro topographical characteristics to extend and solidify the findings of this study and improve the potential shortcomings of htim 7 summary and conclusions the objective of this study was to assess the impacts of sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature on the quantity and spatial distribution of macro scale snowmelt simulations a new daily macro scale grid based snow model was developed to simulate the dynamics of snow accumulation and ablation processes unlike other macro scale models that rely upon a single daily average temperature the developed model takes into account sub daily temperature fluctuations by considering minimum and maximum temperatures and their occurrence timing the model was applied to the missouri river basin for water years 2011 and 2012 which represent two contrasting wet and dry years respectively the results were compared with those from the snodas snowmelt data to ensure that the htim provided comparable snowmelt results further the htim snowmelt simulations were compared with those from a standard tim to highlight the significance of the sub daily temperature variations in macro scale snowmelt simulations monthly tim and htim snowmelt results were in good agreement with the snodas data having the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 912 and 0 902 and the percent bias pbias of 9 78 and 9 77 respectively the kling gupta efficiency kge statistic evaluated the timing magnitude and variability of the monthly simulations versus the snodas data and revealed that although both tim and htim fell into the range of good model performance i e kge 0 75 tim kge 0 88 slightly overperformed htim kge 0 82 in the mrb the difference between the tim and htim annual snowmelt results and the snodas were 11 11 and 11 03 in wy 2011 and 7 44 and 7 42 in wy 2012 respectively it was found that the average annual snowmelt results were not susceptible to the sub daily temperature variations the difference between the annual average snowmelt values in wys 2011 and 2012 simulated by the htim and tim was less than 1 indicating the relative insensitivity of the annual results to sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature in the mrb over the simulation period analyzing the maximum minimum and average temperatures over the mrb indicated that temperatures fluctuated around the freezing temperature in almost two thirds of the days in a five month period from december to april although tim resulted in better overall simulations in comparison with snodas htim showed a better performance in the months when the majority of the basin experienced temperature fluctuations particularly when maximum temperatures fluctuated around the freezing temperature on the other hand snowmelt analysis revealed that when minimum temperatures fluctuated around the freezing temperature htim underestimated the snowmelt over the mrb overestimating the role of refreezing in the simulation of snowmelt can be attributed to the simplistic representation of the freezing factor suggesting the need for improvements to htim such as the use of a variable freezing factor to account for the impacts of seasonality and land use variations therefore there is an opportunity for future efforts to incorporate available datasets to improve the htim simulations credit authorship contribution statement mohsen tahmasebi nasab conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis

4740,climate driven temperature variations manipulate the snowmelt process and affect various aspects of aquatic and terrestrial life the objective of this study is to evaluate the impacts of sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature on the quantity and spatial distribution of macro scale snowmelt simulations i e over macro scale basins and monthly or annual temporal scales a macro scale snow accumulation and ablation model was developed to account for sub daily temperature fluctuations unlike other existing macro scale models that rely upon a single daily average temperature the new model incorporates minimum and maximum temperatures and their occurrence timing within the day in a hybrid temperature index method htim the model was applied to the missouri river basin mrb to simulate grid based snowmelt for water years 2011 and 2012 and compared with the monthly snowmelt data from the snow data assimilation system snodas which is a physically based energy and mass balance snow model also the htim was compared with a standard tim in which only a daily average temperature was used for snowmelt simulations although the htim provided simulations comparable to the snodas snowmelt data r2 0 9 overall results indicated that the tim slightly outperformed the htim when minimum temperatures fluctuated around the freezing temperature htim underestimated the snowmelt over the mrb however htim showed a better performance particularly in the months when maximum temperatures fluctuated around the freezing temperature results suggested that the role of refreezing in the generation of snowmelt was overestimated by htim which led to a more significant discrepancy between the snodas and htim snowmelt values in specific months the findings from this study highlight the influence of sub daily temperature fluctuations on macro scale snowmelt simulations keywords snowmelt sub daily temperature fluctuations macro scale modeling missouri river basin 1 introduction the fourth national climate assessment report nca4 confirmed that the climate driven changes in the united states are already tangible in different aspects of aquatic and terrestrial life usgcrp 2018 in the northern great plains for example the fast springtime warming has led to earlier snowmelt events usgcrp 2018 among the numerous impacts of snowmelt on aquatic life and biodiversity snowmelt can significantly disturb communities by contributing to spring floods for example parts of the missouri river basin mrb and red river of the north basin rrb in dakotas and minnesota underwent a record breaking snowfall during water year 2009 followed by a historical flood in march and april of 2009 in which 48 record stages were logged at the u s geological survey streamflow gauging stations in both basins macek rowland and gross 2011 fortunately no flooding related death was reported however the costs of flooding related damages and flood fighting efforts solely in the rrb were estimated at 55 million u s dollars noaa water resource services 2009 the snow accumulation and ablation processes significantly affect the hydrologic response by storing and releasing water throughout the year jansson et al 2003 in the cold climate basins in the western united states and canada for instance snowmelt is a significant contributor to streamflow feeding 50 to 80 of the total streamflow stewart et al 2004 throughout the past decades different models have been developed to simulate snow accumulation and ablation processes these models have been honed over time by the addition of cold climate processes such as refreezing sublimation and snow on rain traditionally snowmelt models are categorized based on the use of 1 energy balance methods ebms or 2 temperature index methods tims leavesley 1989 ebms solve the energy balance equation to estimate the available energy for snowmelt generation an ebm in its original form requires a variety of meteorological data such as solar radiation temperature vapor pressure and wind speed which might or might not be available depending on the locations of study areas due to the data intensive nature of ebms a variety of modified simplified methods have been developed in which different energy balance terms are estimated based on certain simplifying assumptions and empirical relationships e g fuka et al 2012 in contrast tims simulate the amount of snowmelt on a given time step solely based on daily average temperature and a melting factor in tims the lumped melt factor relates air temperature and its influences on different energy balance fluxes to snowmelt hock 2005 leavesley 1989 hock 2005 provided a comprehensive review of ebms and tims and suggested that due to the availability of air temperature data tims will remain the most widely used method to estimate snowmelt for different purposes simplicity and practicality of the tims are the main reasons for their frequent use in several macro scale hydrologic models such as spatial processes in hydrology sphy terink et al 2015 hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv bergström 1992 hydrological predictions for the environment hype lindström et al 2010 water global assessment and prognosis watergap alcamo et al 2003 and macro scale hydrologic processes simulator macro hypros tahmasebi nasab and chu 2020 tims have been subject to various improvements to ensure reliable snowmelt simulations for regions with different hydroclimatic characteristics the majority of these improvements have been achieved by employing two approaches 1 modifying the melting factor to account for spatial and temporal variations and 2 adding the lumped effects of other energy balance terms to the original tims several studies employed the first approach to enhance snowmelt simulations hock 2003 reviewed the tim snowmelt modeling and different attempts to account for the spatiotemporal variations of the melting factor and concluded that the majority of modifications to the tim were mainly targeted to the seasonal variations of the melting factor for example rango and martinec 1995 developed the seasonally variable melting factor which led to the development of snowmelt routines accounting for the seasonal variability of the melting factor based on maximum and minimum melting factors fontaine et al 2002 singh et al 2005 adjusted the melting factor to include the impacts of both near surface soil temperature and air temperature on the snowmelt process many other studies employed the second approach for example zuzel and cox 1975 highlighted the importance of other energy balance terms they evaluated the relative significance of different meteorological variables in the snowmelt process and found that the addition of vapor pressure net radiation and wind in the tims improved snowmelt simulations by 13 in comparison with the single temperature index method also brubaker et al 1996 and hock 1999 included a radiation term in the original tim to improve snowmelt simulations specifically hock 1999 developed a grid based spatially distributed model to capture the diurnal snowmelt cycles by including potential clear sky direct solar radiation which has the advantage of requiring the same input data as the original tim i e only temperature data and a digital elevation model of the study area macro scale hydrologic models are customarily associated with regional continental or even global scales chu et al 2019 and are used to investigate the impacts of climate driven changes on hydrologic processes reasonably macro scale hydrologic models cannot take advantage of the methods that are specific to point or micro scale modeling hence before selecting a simulation method different aspects of macro scale modeling such as input data requirements and flexibility in resolution need to be considered tahmasebi nasab and chu 2020 the fact that tims provide comparable results to ebms at a macro scale wmo 1986 allows macro scale hydrologic models to incorporate different versions of tims without significant loss of information zuzel and cox 1975 the temporal resolution adopted in tims is of equal importance in the snowmelt simulation several studies have indicated that the performance of tims significantly decreases when finer temporal resolutions smaller than a couple of days are used hock 2005 1999 for example rango and martinec 1995 suggested that tims provide reliable simulations of snowmelt when they are used for weekly to seasonal time steps however they also can be used for daily simulations when linked to hydrologic models rango and martinec 1995 one of the critical simplifying assumptions behind tims that restricts their use for daily simulations is that each time step is represented by a single temperature i e the daily average temperature this assumption is reasonable when sub daily temperatures are all either above or below the freezing temperature however when sub daily temperatures fluctuate above or below the freezing temperature the single temperature tim cannot provide realistic snowmelt simulations hock 1999 žaknić ćatović et al 2018 different attempts have been made to capture the sub daily snowmelt fluctuations at point scale or subbasin scale e g dunn and colohan 1999 tobin et al 2013 žaknić ćatović et al 2018 tobin et al 2013 developed a modified tim that utilized the difference between the daily maximum and minimum temperatures to account for the diurnal snowmelt cycles at the cotton creek experimental watershed ccew in british columbia canada which had an area of 17 km2 specifically they proposed a new method to compute a time varying melting factor using a quasi sinusoidal function assuming that the daily cycle of incoming radiation can be represented by the temperature amplitude tobin et al 2013 the simulations from the original and modified tims were evaluated for both point and subbasin scales and the results indicated that the modified tim significantly improved the sub daily variability of snowmelt tobin et al 2013 moreover to account for the impacts of temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature žaknić ćatović et al 2018 proposed a modified tim that shifted the reliance of snowmelt simulations away from one temperature towards maximum and minimum temperatures the performance of the modified tim was evaluated using the observed temperature data from two weather stations in alberta and toronto canada žaknić ćatović et al 2018 the evaluation results confirmed that considering temperature variations around the freezing temperature improved the physical representation of snowmelt at a point scale i e at the weather stations žaknić ćatović et al 2018 simoni et al 2011 modified the standard tim taking into account both daily and hourly average temperatures in snowmelt simulations the modified tim was tested in a small 20 km2 snowmelt dominated alpine basin of the swiss alps indicating that while the volume of snowmelt was highly correlated to the daily average temperature hourly average temperatures were responsible for the shape of the snowmelt waves simoni et al 2011 in another effort to capture diurnal variations of snowmelt simulations webb et al 2017 utilized a two parameter beta distribution function to imitate the diurnal snowmelt variations the model was tested by using eight snow telemetry snotel stations and the results fitted the diurnal snowmelt pattern with a root mean square error of 0 008 webb et al 2017 despite prior efforts to show better snowmelt simulations by incorporating sub daily temperatures into the tim at a point scale and or small basin scale few studies have addressed challenges associated with snowmelt simulations in macro scale basins having an area of greater than a few thousand km2 the vast area covered by macro scale basins brings about diverse hydro climatic topographic and land cover characteristics each of which can alter different hydrologic processes including snow accumulation and ablation process tahmasebi nasab and chu 2020 however since the majority of existing macro scale models run at daily weekly monthly annual timesteps gudmundsson et al 2012 kauffeldt et al 2016 sood and smakhtin 2015 the impacts of sub daily temperature variations around the freezing temperature on snowmelt simulations at coarser spatio temporal scales remain unknown incorporating sub daily temperature variations into macro scale hydrologic models sows the seeds for investigating specific questions such as do sub daily temperature variations improve the simulations in comparison to standard tims in macro scale basins what are the impacts of sub daily temperature variations on snowmelt in wet and dry years should sub daily temperature variations be incorporated into macro scale models consequently this study uses a macro scale approach to incorporate sub daily temperature fluctuations into the standard tim to investigate the influences of sub daily temperature variations on the snowmelt simulations over large spatiotemporal scales i e monthly or annual scales in macro scale basins the main objective of this study is to evaluate the adoption of sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature on macro scale snowmelt simulations to accomplish this objective a new macro scale snow accumulation and ablation model msm is developed in which sub daily temperature variations around the freezing temperature are included by incorporating maximum and minimum temperatures and their occurrence timing in a hybrid tim htim htim has the advantage of retaining the simplicity of the standard tim by using widely available temperature datasets in addition to temperature datasets the developed msm utilizes only eight parameters that are defined based on the specific characteristics of different study areas which can be easily incorporated into macro scale hydrologic models for simulations in areas with limited data the model is applied to the mrb and the simulation results are compared with the snowmelt data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national operational hydrologic remote sensing center nohrsc snow data assimilation system snodas moreover the modeling results are compared with those simulated by a standard tim to identify potential similarities and differences between htim and tim 2 study area stretching from western montana to st louis mo the mrb fig 1 a has a drainage area of 1 37 m km2 covering parts of 10 u s states 98 of the mrb s drainage area and 2 canadian provinces the mrb is an important global agricultural region and produces nearly half 46 of the u s wheat mehta et al 2013 according to the cropland data layer cdl classifications boryan et al 2011 grassland pasture and cropland are the dominant land use types fig 1b and corn and soybeans are the two leading crops in the mrb also different types of forests i e evergreen and deciduous are mostly scattered on the western side of the basin fig 1b accounting for 10 of the basin s land the mrb encompasses a wide variety of hydroclimatic geologic and topographic conditions for example the basin has an elevation drop of more than 4 km from the western side to the eastern side of the basin fig 1c several studies have highlighted the current and future hydroclimatic variations of the mrb caused by climate driven changes livneh et al 2016 u s bureau of reclamation 2016 wise et al 2018 the 2016 secure water act report projected a 2 78 c to 3 34 c increase in mrb s temperature throughout the 21st century u s bureau of reclamation 2016 by prompting earlier snowmelt and reducing streamflow during summer months this warming trend impacts many aspects of the basin such as biodiversity agriculture and navigation wise et al 2018 since temperature is projected to continue its increasing trend throughout the 21st century u s bureau of reclamation 2016 understanding the snowmelt process and improving its representation in hydrologic models can lead to more realistic modeling results for the mrb the 2011 record breaking flood in the mrb which was immediately followed by the 2012 drought is a typical example of expected hydroclimatic variations in the basin the extents of wetness and dryness of these representative years i e 2011 and 2012 are more evident when they are compared to the long term annual precipitation and temperature fig 2 a h the average 30 year 1981 2010 precipitation in the basin is 538 mm with southern parts of the basin receiving more precipitation than high elevation northern and western parts of the basin fig 2a the annual precipitation in 2011 was 623 mm which is approximately 15 higher than the 30 year average comparing fig 2a with fig 2b reveals that the majority of the increase in precipitation in 2011 took place in the high elevation parts of the basin in which precipitation is in the form of snowfall the cold season precipitation in the upper mrb increased by 36 7 relative to the basin s normal climatic condition badger et al 2018 which led to a historic flood across the basin specifically the area that experienced a precipitation amount of 400 600 mm and 600 900 mm grew by 6 8 and 14 8 respectively fig 2a and fig 2b in sharp contrast the annual precipitation in 2012 was only 403 mm which is about 25 lower than the 30 year normal precipitation the spatial analysis of precipitation in 2012 also indicates that the area of the basin experiencing precipitation of 400 600 mm shrunk by 19 2 fig 2a and fig 2c notably the changes in the amount of precipitation were more pronounced in the high elevation parts of the basin fig 2a c to pinpoint the specific changes in precipitation from 2011 to 2012 fig 2d depicts the spatial distribution of the discrepancy ratio of precipitation i e precipitation in 2011 divided by precipitation in 2012 over the basin the results from discrepancy ratio analysis showed that in 72 8 and 23 9 of the basin s area in 2011 precipitation was 1 2 times and 2 times larger than the amount of precipitation in 2012 respectively fig 2d in addition to precipitation temperature variations played an important role in the extent of wetness and dryness of 2011 and 2012 fig 2e 2h although the 30 year normal and 2011 temperature variations followed similar spatial trends fig 2e and fig 2f fig 2g shows that the year 2012 was significantly warmer than the 30 year normal condition and 2011 the average temperatures over the basin in 2011 and 2012 were 7 4 c and 9 5 c respectively having standard deviations of 2 8 c and 2 9 c particularly the temperature rise in upper mrb is evident where the area of the basin having temperatures between 4 and 8 c decreased to from 51 9 in 2011 to 25 2 in 2012 fig 2f and fig 2g and was substituted by higher temperatures a point by point comparison between temperatures in 2012 and 2011 showed that 100 of mrb accounted for higher temperatures in 2012 fig 2h with an average increase of 2 0 c fig 2h also reveals that 11 9 of the basin i e areas indicated by red in fig 2h experienced a significant temperature rise of more than 2 5 c from 2011 to 2012 therefore as a combined result of higher temperatures and lower precipitation than 30 year normal the 2012 drought occurred and highly stressed the food producing regions of the mrb fuchs et al 2012 3 methodology 3 1 design of the study and data acquisition the msm is used to simulate snow accumulation and ablation processes in the mrb for consecutive wys 2011 and 2012 731 days from october 1st 2010 to september 30th 2012 as previously mentioned wys 2011 and 2012 are characterized by their wet and dry hydroclimatic conditions where wy 2011 represents a wet year and wy 2012 represents a dry year the study area is discretized into 54 144 grids of 5 5 km2 and snow accumulation and ablation processes are simulated separately for each cell the msm uses eight pre defined model parameters to simulate different snow accumulation and ablation processes these modeling parameters and their values are listed in table 1 since the spatially distributed macro scale measured snowmelt data are not available the simulated snowmelt results from the htim are compared with the snowmelt data from the noaa s national operational hydrologic remote sensing center nohrsc snow data assimilation system snodas hereafter snodas data nohrsc 2004 snodas is a modeling system that provides estimates of snow related variables for hydrologic modeling and analysis snodas employs physically based spatially distributed energy and mass balance methods to assimilate satellite derived airborne and ground based observations of snow covered areas and snow water equivalent barrett 2003 the simulation results from the htim are further compared with those from the tim to underline the impacts of sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature on the macro scale snowmelt modeling the spatiotemporal results from htim and tim are compared against the snodas data to provide a holistic picture of snowmelt variations over mrb for example the coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias are two statistics that are used to determine the goodness of fit and the average tendency of the simulations to overestimate pbias 0 or underestimate pbias 0 snowmelt the performance of the models was additionally evaluated by using the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which facilitates the assessment of different components of the model s performance such as timing magnitude and variability the kge is given by gupta et al 2009 1 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between the simulated and observed values α is the ratio between the standard deviation values of the simulated and observed data to measure the relative variability of the simulations and β is the ratio between the mean values of the simulated and observed data to represent the bias of the simulations the kge ranges from to 1 in which kge 1 0 represents the perfect match following rogelis et al 2016 the model performance can be categorized into three classes poor kge 0 intermediate 0 5 kge 0 75 and good kge 0 75 table 2 lists the sources of data used in the msm the snodas snowmelt data provide the estimates of snowmelt for hydrologic modeling and analysis nohrsc 2004 the snodas digital images were first clipped to the boundaries of the mrb and then resampled from the original 1 km resolution to 5 km resolution digital images to facilitate the comparison between the simulated snowmelt and the snodas snowmelt data the land use and land cover dataset was downloaded from the cdl dataset boryan et al 2011 and was clipped to the boundaries of the study area the precipitation data for the study area were obtained from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism climate group 2004 that generates grid based estimates of annual monthly and daily climatic data such as precipitation by incorporating point scale weather station observations the digital elevation model dem of the basin and other spatial datasets daly et al 1994 since there have been concerns about the potential biases in the prism temperature products oyler et al 2015b wise et al 2018 the grid based maximum and minimum temperatures tmin and tmax data were retrieved from the topography weather topowx dataset oyler et al 2015a and the daily average temperature was computed by using tmin and tmax in addition to incorporating the weather station observations and topographic variables topowx uses atmospheric reanalysis data and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land skin temperature to provide 800 m resolution gridded datasets of daily minimum and maximum air temperatures oyler et al 2015a both the prism precipitation data and the topowx temperatures were resampled to 5 km resolution grids to be incorporated in the msm to find the time of occurrence of tmin and tmax i e tmin and tmax the mrb was divided into 58 noaa climate divisions fig 3 a within each climate division a weather station was selected and hourly temperature variations were obtained from the national climatic data center ncdc local climatological data lcd for all 58 selected stations ncdc 2018 based on the hourly temperature variations tmin and tmax were extracted for each day and used to calculate the average monthly tmin and tmax from october 2010 to september 2012 all grids within each climate division share the same tmin and tmax assuming similar monthly variations of tmin and tmax the analysis of hourly temperature variations showed that tmin and tmax followed an expected general trend indicating that tmin occurred around sunrise and tmax took place right after midday it was observed that the northern stations showed a higher degree of variability in tmin and tmax between warm and cold months than the southern stations for example fig 3b and fig 3c show the seasonal variations of tmin and tmax for two selected stations in southern and northern mrb station 1 and station 2 respectively station 1 tends to show less variability in tmin and tmax fig 3b whereas station 2 shows significant variability between warm and cold months fig 3c fig 3d depicts the average tmin and tmax and their ranges for all 58 stations in which the variability between cold and warm months is evident the average monthly values of times of occurrence of tmin and tmax i e tmin and tmax are used because daily tmax and tmin values only represent variations of one specific point over the basin at best every climate station depicted in fig 3a represents temperature variations of one 5x5 km2 grid it could be assumed that all grids within a climate division share the same daily temperature variations however each climate division in mrb covers a vast area and contains roughly 1 000 grids of 5x5 km2 with various physiographic conditions that can affect their temperature variations using monthly average values in the climate divisions would be a better representative of the division since it portrays an average condition for a climate station in addition one of the main reasons for the popularity of tims is their applicability in data sparse basins this advantage is even more pronounced in macro scale basins where the area of a basin is larger than a few thousand square kilometers although finding the hourly temperature variations for 58 stations in this study was possible for a 2 year simulation in the highly gauged mrb there are not many basins within the us and around the world having the luxury of long term reliable hourly distributed temperature data therefore since one of the goals of htim is to maintain the data requirements of tims at a macro scale monthly average tmax and tmin values are considered reasonably when multiple climate stations are available within a climate division hourly temperatures can be used to eliminate the lumped monthly consideration of tmin and tmax 3 2 standard vs hybrid temperature index method a standard tim is commonly expressed as 2 m c m t ave δ t t ave 0 0 t ave 0 where m is the snowmelt mm cm is the melting factor mm c 1 day 1 and tave is the average temperature oc during time step δt day despite its popularity the standard tim has the potential to underestimate or overestimate daily snowmelt noticeably fig 4 a depicts hourly temperature variations for two hypothetical consecutive days which reveal how the tim can miscalculate snowmelt the daily average temperatures for day 1 and day 2 in fig 4a are 0 8 c and 1 6 c respectively according to the tim day 1 does not generate any snowmelt since its average temperature is less than the assumed freezing temperature i e 0 c however nearly half of day 1 has greater than 0 c temperatures fig 4a in other words the tim does not yield any snowmelt even though half of day 1 can potentially generate snowmelt the case illustrated in fig 4a occurs only when sub daily temperatures fluctuate around the freezing temperature and it is not the case when temperatures are all above below the freezing temperature day 2 in fig 4a to alleviate this issue a hybrid tim is used to take advantage of the standard tim and meanwhile consider daily maximum and minimum temperatures at known occurrence times žaknić ćatović et al 2018 this hybrid approach provides sub daily simulations of snowmelt and refreezing and also is simple enough to be incorporated into macro scale hydrologic models for example tahmasebi nasab and chu 2020 incorporated an htim in the snow band of macro hypros macro scale hydrologic processes simulator to simulate the variations of different hydrologic processes in the red river basin the htim incorporates the daily minimum and maximum temperatures i e tmin and tmax respectively for simulating snowmelt when tmin is lower than 0 c and tmax is higher than 0 c fig 4b calculating snowmelt and refreezing using the htim requires sub daily temperature variations either measured or synthetic sub daily temperatures can be utilized to obtain these variations for example žaknić ćatović et al 2018 tested two approaches to estimate hourly temperature variations based on 1 a linear relationship and 2 a double cosine trigonometric relationship between tmin and tmax in this study a simple geometric method was used to approximate the sub daily defacto melting and freezing periods based on the area of two triangles fig 4b the htim establishes a linear relationship between tmin and tmax at their known times of occurrence to simulate the sub daily snowmelt and refreezing processes fig 4b in this method snowmelt and refreezing are calculated for a fraction of the day with temperatures higher and lower than 0 c respectively for the days in which tmin is lower than 0 c and tmax is higher than 0 c snowmelt and refreezing are approximated using the two triangles representing melt and refreeze processes fig 4b the linear relationship between tmin and tmax for each day is written as 3 t a t b where t is the temperature oc at time t hour and a and b are the slope and the intercept of the line respectively these two coefficients i e a and b are calculated for each day based on the following general forms 4 a t max t min t max t min 5 b t min t max t max t min t max t min in which tmax and tmin are the occurrence times of tmax and tmin respectively that determine the location of the triangles in fig 4b within each day if tmax occurs earlier than tmin in a day the order of the triangles in fig 3b switches in this case the same set of equations are applicable but the slope of the line in eq 2 becomes negative although every day in a year may have different tmax and tmin tmax mostly occurs after midday and tmin occurs shortly after sunrise guo et al 2014 izquierdo et al 2002 the time series of average monthly tmax and tmin are utilized as the model input data to account for the monthly variations of tmax and tmin for all grids within a climate division δtmlt and δtrfr are the bases of the two triangles in fig 4b and are calculated based on the time intercept of the line between tmin and tmax with 0 c equation 2 eventually snowmelt and refreezing for each day are computed using the areas of the two triangles the htim also incorporates the standard tim for days in which both tmin and tmax are above below 0 c according to the htim the snowmelt and refreezing for different tmin and tmax values are written as 6 m c m t ave δ t t min 0 t max 0 c m t max 2 δ t mlt t min 0 t max 0 7 r c f t ave δ t t min 0 t max 0 c f t min 2 δ t rfr t min 0 t max 0 where r is the potential refrozen meltwater mm cf is a freezing factor mm oc 1 day 1 and δtmlt and δtrfr represent the defacto melting and freezing periods day the δtmlt and δtrfr required to compute snowmelt for a sample day with fluctuations in tmin and tmax on either side of 0 c are depicted in fig 4b it is worth mentioning that although different studies have suggested a strong correlation between snowmelt and air temperature e g braithwaite and olesen 1989 snowmelt is also a function of other terms in the energy balance equation leavesley 1989 ohmura 2001 for example snowpack temperature can play an essential role in the generation of snowmelt however different tims do not explicitly account for snowpack temperature it should also be noted that the snowmelt and refreezing processes do not start and end respectively precisely at 0 c and they might fluctuate around 0 c based on other factors such as altitude wind humidity etc anderson 2006 neither the standard tim nor the modified versions including htim account for factors other than the air temperature all other energy balance terms are lumped into a melting freezing factor that in this study changes with regard to space and time thus studies suggest that simulations from the family of tims should be interpreted for average conditions hock 2005 3 3 development of a macro scale snow accumulation and ablation model a macro scale snow model msm is developed to simulate the dynamics of snow accumulation and ablation the msm is a grid based daily model that discretizes the land surface into user defined square grids the model utilizes a user defined transitional temperature range ttr to distinguish three different precipitation forms i e rainfall snowfall and mixed rainfall and snowfall the ttr is determined based on manual calibration and provides the flexibility of selecting a proper temperature range based on the characteristics of specific regions when tave is lower than or equal to the lower bound of the ttr ttmin precipitation is assumed to be snowfall when tave is higher than or equal to the upper bound of the ttr ttmax precipitation is considered in the form of rainfall if tave falls within the ttr a mixed form of rainfall and snowfall is considered assuming that snowfall decreases linearly from ttmin to ttmax fig 5 shows the flowchart of the msm and the three different precipitation forms the msm simulates dynamic snowpack storage snowmelt rain on snow and refrozen meltwater if precipitation is in the form of snowfall or a combination of rainfall and snowfall the snowpack water equivalent is updated based on the forest canopy snow interception snowfall accumulation and melting refreezing processes fig 5 if precipitation is solely in the form of rainfall the simulated processes vary depending on the availability of snowpack on the ground fig 5 snowpack water equivalent is updated based on the amount of snow reaching the ground surface snos mm actual snowmelt and snowpack water equivalent of the previous time step 8 s w e t g s w e t 1 g m a t 1 g c sn sno s t g where t is the time step g is the grid number swe mm is the snowpack water equivalent ma is the actual snowmelt mm and csn is a snowfall correction factor and accounts for the losses from sublimation and redistribution anderson 2006 csn can be ignored for cold climate regions with a significant amount of snow and multiple snowfall events however it cannot be neglected for areas with a small number of snowfall events since the losses for these regions are typically higher anderson 2006 csn is suggested to vary between 0 7 and 1 6 anderson 2002 the actual snowmelt ma mm is calculated based on the available water for melt awm mm and a maximum snowpack water retention storage sprmx 9 m a t g a w m t g spr mx t g a w m t g spr mx t g 0 a w m t g spr mx t g in which sprmx acts as a threshold for the snowmelt generation process the snowpack water retention storage spr retains meltwater until reaching sprmx in other words sprmx is a threshold to delay the generation of snowmelt the water stored in spr can refreeze when the temperature is below 0 c and the amount of sprmx is simulated as a fraction of swe 10 spr mx t g c wr s w e t g where cwr is the coefficient of water retention storage generally equal to 0 1 suggested by bergström 1992 in eq 8 the available water for melt is the summation of meltwater from different sources minus the refrozen meltwater 11 a w m t g m f m r m r where mf is the snowmelt from forest canopy mm mr is the rain on snow melt mm and m and r are the surface snowmelt and refreezing mm described in section 3 2 to calculate the amount of snowmelt from the forest canopy the msm uses a simple bucket approach to estimate snow interception by the forest canopy the amount of snow reaching the ground surface snos mm is calculated by 12 sno s t g s n o t g int sn t g where sno is the total snowfall mm and intsn is the snow canopy interception mm which can be estimated by hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 pomeroy et al 1998 13 int sn t g c cu fcs mx g swe f t 1 g 1 e fvc s n o t g fcs mx g

vegetation cover fcsmx and fvc are estimated by using the leaf area index lai and snow density pomeroy et al 1998 schmidt and gluns 1991 daily snowmelt from the forest canopy mf mm is calculated by incorporating a simple tim liston et al 2006 assuming that the amount of refreezing is negligible 14 m f t g c fm t ave t g t ave 0 0 t ave 0 where cfm is the forest melting factor cfm it should be noted that since the snowmelt from the forest canopy is much lower than the surface snowmelt the original tim was used for simulating snowmelt from the forest canopy the amount of meltwater from a rain on snow event mr mm is calculated when precipitation is in the form of rainfall and there is snowpack on the ground assuming that the rainfall temperature is equal to tave and the snow surface temperature is 0 c the amount of mr is simulated by using the following equation qi et al 2017 in which rnf is rainfall mm 15 m r t g 0 0126 t ave t g r n f t g as discussed in the previous section the msm uses the htim to simulate the surface snowmelt and refreezing processes different studies suggested that the melting factor in eq 6 i e cm varies over time and space e g fontaine et al 2002

mx c mn 2 where cmx is the maximum melting factor cmn is the minimum melting factor and dn is the number of days in the year in cold climate regions where snow accumulation may continue until mid or late spring cmx is of greater importance while cmx and cmn are both equally important in the areas with frequent snowmelt events during winter anderson 2006 in addition to the temporal variations of cm the spatial distribution of cm for different grids is taken into account based on the land use types the values of the maximum and minimum melting factors for different land use types are listed in table 3 it is notable that forest covers typically have a small melting factor whereas urban areas have larger melting factors table 3 4 results 4 1 temporal analysis of htim and tim simulations vs snodas snowmelt the snowmelt results simulated by the htim and tim are compared with the snodas snowmelt data to ensure that both methods provide acceptable simulations fig 6 a c depict the monthly annual snowmelt over the mrb as well as a monthly graphical comparison between the htim and tim simulations and the snodas snowmelt data fig 6a highlights an extreme hydroclimatic discrepancy between wys 2011 and 2012 wy 2011 as a wet year accounted for higher snowmelt peaks and a longer extended snowmelt period whereas wy 2012 as a dry year had smaller peaks and a shorter snowmelt period reasonably the magnitude of snowmelt peaks in both wys highly depends on the amount of winter precipitation fig 6a indicates that the snowmelt peaks for both wys occurred in march and april however as a direct result of higher winter precipitation in wy 2011 snowmelt peaks in march and april of wy 2011 were 1 7 and 2 0 times larger than those in wy 2012 respectively comparing the simulation results by htim and tim in fig 6a reveals that both methods followed a similar simulation pattern due to their temperature fluctuations different months played important roles in the variations of snowmelt in the mrb for example the results showed that the average snowmelt over the basin simulated by htim in december 2010 i e 7 2 mm which is closer to the snodas estimate of 7 6 mm was 1 9 times higher than the snowmelt simulated by tim i e 3 8 mm the yearly comparison depicted in fig 6b shows that the mrb in wy 2012 had an average snowmelt value of 87 69 mm which is roughly half of the average snowmelt in wy 2011 162 45 mm although htim and tim demonstrated certain discrepancies in the monthly results the differences between their annual averages were 1 2 mm3 and 23 011 m3 in wy 2011 and wy 2012 respectively corresponding to less than one millimeter of water over the basin area overall fig 6a and 6b indicate that htim and tim snowmelt simulations are comparable to the snodas snowmelt estimates the annual comparison also shows that the absolute errors between the simulated average snowmelt over the mrb and the snodas data in wys 2011 and 2012 are less than 12 specifically the error percentages for the htim and tim were 11 03 and 11 11 in wy2011 and 7 42 and 7 44 in wy2012 respectively the graphical comparison between the snodas and simulated snowmelt fig 6c indicates that when snowmelt was less than 10 mm both methods slightly overestimated the snowmelt on the other hand when snowmelt was greater than 10 mm htim and tim underestimated the snowmelt statistical analyses of the simulated results showed that the coefficient of determination r2 for the monthly comparison was higher than 0 90 for both methods i e htim r2 0 902 and tim r2 0 912 indicating a good agreement between the simulated snowmelt by htim and tim and the snodas data in addition to r2 the pbias analyses of the htim and tim simulations against the snodas data revealed that both methods have an average tendency to generate smaller snowmelt values than the corresponding snodas values that is both htim and tim had negative pbias values 9 77 and 9 78 respectively in other words both htim and tim underestimated snowmelt in comparison with snodas estimates although r2 and pbias provided insight into how simulations from the two methods differ from snodas they did not reveal significant differences between htim and tim results from the discrepancy analysis in three months of february march and april in 2011 months with highest snowmelt values showed that htim simulations were on average 7 5 smaller than tim simulations in 2012 however results indicated that htim simulations were on average 7 larger than tim simulations in february march and april in addition to r2 and pbias the kge values for htim and tim were 0 82 and 0 88 respectively falling into the good model performance range the kge results for wys 2011 and 2012 suggested that tim simulations are slightly closer to the snodas data than htim simulations the variations between the snodas snowmelt and the simulated snowmelt by using msm can be attributed to the underlying methodologies in formulating snowmelt in the two snow models specifically msm is a simple daily bucket model that only requires eight pre defined parameters while snodas is a multi layered three snow layers and two soil layers spatially distributed energy and mass balance model which simulates snowmelt at hourly time steps based on the thermal dynamics of different layers barrett 2003 in addition to the differences in the methodologies the variations between the snodas and simulated snowmelt values also stem from the inclusion of detailed meteorological datasets such as surface zonal wind surface meridional wind relative humidity solar radiation and many other variables in snodas barrett 2003 whereas htim only utilizes widely available daily temperature datasets fig 7 helps to better understand the similarities and differences between htim and tim over the simulation period fig 7a depicts the relationship between the tave and the actual simulation difference i e htim snowmelt minus tim snowmelt represented by different bubble sizes and colors in fig 7a from fig 7a it can be observed that the discrepancy among simulations from the two models is higher when tave was between 10 c and 10 c quantitively 84 9 of the total difference between the simulated snowmelt by htim and tim stemmed from the months in which tave ranged from 10 c to 10 c specifically out of 241 days in which tmax was greater than 0 c and tmin was less than 0 c 223 days were in months having tave between 10 c and 10 c the number of days in each month in which temperature fluctuated above and below zero is shown in fig 7b although the discrepancies between htim and tim simulations i e htim snowmelt divided by tim snowmelt were higher for the months with a larger number of temperature fluctuating days the highest discrepancy values e g red arrows in fig 7b did not exactly correspond to the months with the highest temperature fluctuating days this can be attributed to the amount of snowfall snowpack and temperature nuances these sample months are further investigated in the next section 4 2 spatial analysis of htim and tim simulations vs snodas snowmelt data in order to pinpoint the differences between htim and tim three sample months were selected for further analyses fig 8 a l the selected months were chosen for their hydroclimatic characteristics as follows december 2010 accounted for the highest discrepancy ratio i e 1 9 between htim and tim simulations over the simulation period in contrast with december 2010 tim simulations were larger than htim simulations in march 2012 the results indicated that tim snowmelt simulations in march 2012 were more than 30 greater than htim simulations april 2011 received the highest amount of snowfall over the simulation period which was 9 1 and 7 higher than snowfall in january and february 2011 respectively these three months also had specific temperature characteristics that make them stand out for further investigation specifically december 2010 march 2012 and april 2011 accounted for 16 11 and 15 days in which the average tmax was greater than 0 c and the average tmin was less than 0 c i e temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature to understand the snowmelt variations over mrb spatially distributed results are presented in three classes i e low moderate and high to facilitate the comparison between the simulated and snodas snowmelt results fig 8a l the classification was performed based on the jenks natural breaks classification method jenks 1967 that finds the best arrangement of values in a given dataset fig 8a c indicate that the spatial distribution of snowmelt classes in htim resembled snodas better than tim results in december 2010 in comparison with tim results htim simulated larger class 2 and class 3 snowmelt in december 2010 which was attributed to the sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature throughout december 2010 when on average 53 25 of the basin experienced tmin 0 and tmax 0 fig 8d specifically the coverage percentage of class 3 i e high snowmelt by htim was 3 5 times larger than the coverage percentage of the class 3 snowmelt by tim which led to the generation of 3 38 mm more snowmelt over the basin specifically in high elevation western parts of mrb although htim simulated more snowmelt in december 2010 tim simulated 32 2 more snowmelt than the htim in march 2012 particularly htim resulted in an average of 16 20 mm of snowmelt over the basin whereas tim simulated 21 42 mm of snowmelt the spatial coverages of three classes of snowmelt in march 2012 fig 8e h show a general resemblance between the htim and tim simulated distributed results however there are nuances in the spatial distributions of snowmelt which are due to the temperature variations on average 88 30 of the basin was covered by areas with tmin 0 and tmax 0 in march 2012 the average tmin over the basin was 2 83 c and the average tmax was 15 98 c which led to different class coverages between htim and tim fig 8h the discrepancy ratios between the two methods for classes 1 2 and 3 in march 2012 were 1 2 0 72 and 0 76 respectively snowmelt results in march 2012 indicated that both the magnitude and distribution of the simulated snowmelt by htim were closer to snodas snowmelt while tim overestimated snowmelt by 17 4 htim underestimated snowmelt only by 11 in march 2012 december 2010 and march 2012 were two months in which the htim results were better than those from tim and closer to the snodas snowmelt data in some months however tim provided better simulations than htim for example the difference between the snodas and tim snowmelt results in april 2011 was only 0 6 mm which is much smaller than that of htim 4 46 mm a closer look at the spatial distribution of the simulated snowmelt in april 2011 by snodas htm and tim reveals that tim simulated more class 3 snowmelt that was more comparable to the snodas data fig 8i l specifically 7 5 3 8 and 8 6 of the basin was covered by class 3 snowmelt simulated by snodas htim and tim respectively the overall monthly results suggest that although there are some differences in both magnitude and spatial coverage of the snowmelt simulated by htim and tim these differences are only pronounced in the months when the majority of the basin experienced temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature fig 9 a h provide a comparison between the spatial distribution of snowmelt in wys 2011 and 2012 by snodas htim and tim fig 9a h highlight the relationship between the topography of the mrb and the snowmelt magnitude notably the western side of the mrb which is characterized by high altitudes fig 1c accounts for a considerable amount of snowmelt in both wet and dry years wy 2011 as a wet year accounted for more snowmelt mainly on the western and eastern sides of the basin fig 9a although the majority of the basin was covered by class 2 snowmelt class 3 covered more than 33 of the basin and directly contributed to high snowmelt specifically in the upper mrb fig 9a both htim and tim followed the general expected pattern of more snowmelt in the western and eastern parts in wy 2011 which is also in accordance with snodas fig 9a c however spatial discrepancies are more pronounced specifically in class 3 snowmelt where the class 3 in snodas results covered 11 more area than htim and tim also fig 9b and fig 9c suggest that there are only marginal differences in the class coverages of snowmelt between the htim and tim which led to less than a millimeter difference in the annual snowmelt between the two methods fig 6b fig 9d depicts the difference percentage between the tim and htim snowmelt simulations from fig 9d it can be observed that both methods resulted in very similar annual results having a difference of less than 1 mostly concentrated in the western parts of the basin in wy 2011 on the other hand wy 2012 as a dry year experienced lower snowmelt than wy 2011 fig 9e g although classes 1 and 2 covered more than 90 of the basin the high altitude western side of the basin was responsible for the majority of the snowmelt throughout the year fig 9e similar to wy 2011 a quantitative comparison of the three snowmelt coverage classes between the htim and tim indicated that the discrepancy in the spatial distributions between the two methods was marginal fig 9f and fig 9g similarly the snowmelt values simulated over the basin by the two methods were close to each other having a difference of less than 1 fig 9h analyzing monthly and yearly snowmelt simulations reveals that sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature play a more prominent role in monthly macro scale snowmelt simulations especially for the months in which a vast majority of the basin experiences tmax 0 c and tmin 0 c however the impacts of sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature are marginal for the annual timescale 5 discussion 5 1 how are temperature fluctuations reflected in htim results in order to investigate the reason behind the discrepancy between htim and tim an analysis of daily temperatures is required fig 10 depicts the variations of tmax tmin and tave throughout the simulation period and two selected months i e december 2010 and april 2011 which were discussed from the snowmelt variation perspective in section 4 2 specifically htim provided simulations closer to the snodas data in december 2010 while tim yielded simulations closer to the snodas data in april 2011 the average tmax and tmin over the basin were respectively greater and smaller than 0 c in 241 days out of 731 days reasonably the majority of these days 74 occurred in the 5 month period from december to april fig 10a fig 10b depicts the temperature variations in december 2010 in which the basin tave was consistently lower than the freezing temperature except for december 9th 2010 the average tmax over the basin however repeatedly fluctuated above and below 0 c 16 days above and 15 days below 0 c as a result the snowmelt simulated by htim in december 2010 was 1 9 times greater than that from tim and both the magnitude and the spatial distribution of the htim simulated snowmelt in the mrb were closer to those of snodas on the other hand while tave in the mrb was higher than 0 c in all days of april 2011 tmin fluctuated around the freezing temperature 15 days above and 15 days below 0 c fig 10c since htim incorporated tmin in its simulations its snowmelt was 13 52 lower than that of tim which provided results closer to snodas in both magnitude and spatial distribution the above analysis indicated that by using tmin htim overestimated the role of refreezing in restricting snowmelt in the mrb one of the possible reasons for overestimating the role of refreezing in htim is the simplistic consideration of the freezing factor cf in equation 7 although many investigations have addressed the spatial and temporal variations of the melting factor e g fontaine et al 2002 rango and martinec 1995 singh et al 2005 zuzel and cox 1975 the freezing factor is commonly considered as a constant terink et al 2015 žaknić ćatović et al 2018 at best the freezing factor is set to change with elevations for example ragettli et al 2015 assumed that 100 of snowmelt refroze at elevations higher than 5500 m in htim the freezing factor was assumed as a constant 0 05 over time and space table 1 as a result the role of refreezing to reduce snowmelt was not accurately represented reasonably similar to the melting factor incorporating a method to adjust the freezing factor spatially and temporally could help enhance the modeling results of the htim to consolidate our analysis of the htim performance december 28th 2010 and march 10th 2012 which possess contrasting temperature attributes were selected to showcase the impacts of sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature on daily snowmelt simulations december 28th 2010 was selected because the majority of the basin had tave 0 c and maximum and minimum temperatures fluctuated around the freezing temperature in 80 4 of the basin on the other hand march 10th 2012 was chosen because the majority of the basin experienced tave 0 c and the maximum and minimum temperatures fluctuated around the freezing temperature in 84 7 of the basin the average temperature for 89 1 of the basin on december 28th 2010 was lower than 0 c whereas the remaining 10 9 of the basin had temperatures higher than 0 c fig 11 a a visual comparison between fig 11b and fig 11c reveals that while snowmelt was solely limited to the areas with tave 0 c in tim the htim generated additional snowmelt in the regions with tave 0 c in other words the htim utilized tmax and tmin to recognize the days in which snowmelt occurred only in a portion of the days in such days the htim had a higher potential to generate snowmelt in comparison to the tim fig 11d specifically the average amount of snowmelt simulated by the htim was 0 44 mm whereas the tim generated only 0 03 mm of snowmelt 93 2 lower than the htim value on december 28th 2010 tave for the majority of the basin on march 10th 2012 was higher than 0 c and only 1 0 of the basin experienced average temperatures lower than 0 c the spatial analysis of tmax and tmin showed that tmax was higher than 0 c and tmin was lower than the freezing temperature in 84 7 of the basin fig 11e a quantitative comparison of the spatial distributions of the snowmelt simulated by the htim and tim shows that the htim generated snowmelt only over 16 33 of the basin fig 11f while the tim generated snowmelt over 24 5 of the basin fig 11g these spatial differences in the snowmelt results directly translate to a difference in the magnitudes of the snowmelt simulated by the two methods fig 11h the tim generated 1 80 mm of snowmelt whereas the htim generated 0 79 mm of snowmelt on march 10 2012 which was 43 9 lower than the tim value unlike december 28th 2010 the discrepancy between the snowmelt values simulated by the two methods for march 10th 2012 was due to the refreezing potential which reduced the snowmelt generation potential over the basin in the htim although the standard tim did not capture these variations in snowmelt and refreezing as the majority of the basin had temperatures higher than 0 c the role of refreezing in htim was overestimated which led to a greater difference between htim and snodas than tim 6 htim contributions and limitations different types of tims have been traditionally compared to ebms to evaluate their performances in hydrologic applications results from different studies indicate that when it comes to the models performance the proper use of a snowmelt model is more significant than the model complexity mutzner et al 2015 results from this study also highlighted that the standard tim and htim both provided snowmelt simulations comparable to snodas in the mrb however rather than incorporating temperature variations at a small scale this study focused on developing an htim tailored for macro scale snowmelt simulations parallel to the results from small scale investigations e g cazorzi and dalla fontana 1996 hock 1999 jost et al 2012 kane et al 1997 simoni et al 2011 tobin et al 2013 webb et al 2017 the results from this study also showed that daily macro scale snowmelt variations could be directly attributed to the sub daily temperature variations similar to the approach used in this study žaknić ćatović et al 2018 developed a modified version of tim that used daily extremes at known times of occurrence by employing two temperature curve generation methods although the simulated snowmelt was not directly compared to the observed snowmelt it was concluded that the modified tim was not a replacement for the standard tim and using a combination of both standard and modified tim based on the temperature variations was recommended žaknić ćatović et al 2018 in this study both tim and htim were compared to the snodas data to provide a better understanding of their performances specifically the comparisons of monthly simulated snowmelt by htim and tim revealed that htim could generate either more or less snowmelt than the standard tim depending on the tmax and tmin distributions for certain months the comparison between the annual htim and tim simulations however revealed that both methods resulted in nearly identical snowmelt simulations webb et al 2017 suggested utilizing soil moisture sensor data to evaluate the timing of snowmelt from the base of the snowpack and correct the inherent measurement errors since the snodas used as a benchmark in this study is also model simulated data it would be beneficial to further compare tim and htim with the observed soil moisture data to assess the timing of snowmelt generated by the two models a question that can be approached is which method provided more accurate macro scale snowmelt results the daily snowmelt analysis demonstrated that the htim is able to capture the temperature fluctuations and their impacts on the snowmelt and refreezing processes based on tmax and tmin however the snowmelt process is a complex process that in addition to temperature is subject to other terms of the energy balance equation and spatial variations hock 2003 1999 although the addition of tmax and tmin to the standard tim can assist in capturing the sub daily temperature variations it does not necessarily result in more realistic snowmelt simulations than the original tim therefore since the extreme air temperatures i e tmax and tmin are the only factors considered in htim it can potentially overestimate or underestimate snowmelt depending on the temperature distribution of the study area over the simulation period as other studies also suggest e g webb et al 2017 the addition of other factors such as radiation can provide a controlling factor and further improve the htim results the monthly results suggested that tim slightly overperformed htim kge 0 88 for tim kge 0 82 for htim over the simulation period in wys 2011 and 2012 in the mrb although htim provided snowmelt magnitude and distribution closer to snodas in the months when tmax fluctuated around 0 c e g december 2010 it underestimated snowmelt in the months when tmin fluctuated around 0 c e g april 2011 this can be attributed to the simplistic representation of the freezing factor i e constant over time and space in the set of equations used to simulate snowmelt and refreezing incorporating approaches to adjust the freezing factor in htim over time and space could help improve the htim performance bengtsson 1982 by considering the sub daily temperature variations htim provides the foundation for further studies on other basins with different hydro topographical characteristics to extend and solidify the findings of this study and improve the potential shortcomings of htim 7 summary and conclusions the objective of this study was to assess the impacts of sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature on the quantity and spatial distribution of macro scale snowmelt simulations a new daily macro scale grid based snow model was developed to simulate the dynamics of snow accumulation and ablation processes unlike other macro scale models that rely upon a single daily average temperature the developed model takes into account sub daily temperature fluctuations by considering minimum and maximum temperatures and their occurrence timing the model was applied to the missouri river basin for water years 2011 and 2012 which represent two contrasting wet and dry years respectively the results were compared with those from the snodas snowmelt data to ensure that the htim provided comparable snowmelt results further the htim snowmelt simulations were compared with those from a standard tim to highlight the significance of the sub daily temperature variations in macro scale snowmelt simulations monthly tim and htim snowmelt results were in good agreement with the snodas data having the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 912 and 0 902 and the percent bias pbias of 9 78 and 9 77 respectively the kling gupta efficiency kge statistic evaluated the timing magnitude and variability of the monthly simulations versus the snodas data and revealed that although both tim and htim fell into the range of good model performance i e kge 0 75 tim kge 0 88 slightly overperformed htim kge 0 82 in the mrb the difference between the tim and htim annual snowmelt results and the snodas were 11 11 and 11 03 in wy 2011 and 7 44 and 7 42 in wy 2012 respectively it was found that the average annual snowmelt results were not susceptible to the sub daily temperature variations the difference between the annual average snowmelt values in wys 2011 and 2012 simulated by the htim and tim was less than 1 indicating the relative insensitivity of the annual results to sub daily temperature fluctuations around the freezing temperature in the mrb over the simulation period analyzing the maximum minimum and average temperatures over the mrb indicated that temperatures fluctuated around the freezing temperature in almost two thirds of the days in a five month period from december to april although tim resulted in better overall simulations in comparison with snodas htim showed a better performance in the months when the majority of the basin experienced temperature fluctuations particularly when maximum temperatures fluctuated around the freezing temperature on the other hand snowmelt analysis revealed that when minimum temperatures fluctuated around the freezing temperature htim underestimated the snowmelt over the mrb overestimating the role of refreezing in the simulation of snowmelt can be attributed to the simplistic representation of the freezing factor suggesting the need for improvements to htim such as the use of a variable freezing factor to account for the impacts of seasonality and land use variations therefore there is an opportunity for future efforts to incorporate available datasets to improve the htim simulations credit authorship contribution statement mohsen tahmasebi nasab conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis

4741,hydrological extremes such as droughts and floods are recognized as environmental disasters causing several negative effects especially on the agricultural section these phenomena and their proper management have attracted the attention of hydrologists and agricultural scientists this paper evaluates the climate change effects on hydrological extremes based on the standardized precipitation index spi in the north western part of crete greece for the period of 1960 2019 this area is considered to be one of the most important agricultural regions in the mediterranean dominated by tree cultivations the climate trend line for spi values shows slight decrease indicating more intense dry periods for the next decades especially for semi mountainous areas a notable result of this analysis is that more frequent dry and wet spells have appeared in the last three decades in addition a fuzzy based gis modeling approach for estimating both droughts and floods prone areas named spisers is developed incorporating the special distribution of long term time period standardized precipitation index spis evapotranspiration runoff accumulation and soil available water capacity the proposed methodology was validated for several flood and drought affected areas that have been historically recorded in the study area according to the results 24 67 of the total tree crops parcels in the study region is prone to hydrological extremes droughts or floods finally for adapting to the inevitable adverse effects of climate change water saving and flood protection measures for mediterranean tree crops areas are proposed keywords hydroclimatic extremes spi olive citrus and avocado trees gis adaptability to climate change 1 introduction climate change has intensified the hydrological cycle increasing the globally average precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration huntington 2006 undrr 2019 the consequences of climate change on agriculture differ significantly between the climatic zones the mediterranean areas are among the most arid regions in the world particularly prone to climate change tsakiris 2017 kourgialas et al 2018a 2018b water shortage is already becoming an increasingly key limitation to society for the mediterranean countries where beyond 50 percent of the world water poor population lives due to the high proportion of agriculture in their economies the adverse effects of climate change are more evident more water scarcity and extreme weather events including flash droughts floods are expected to result in lower agricultural production or the abandonment of climate disadvantaged parcels martínez mena et al 2020 flash droughts which are a recently recognized type of extreme event as well as flash floods are distinguished by sudden onset and rapid intensification with severe impacts particularly in agriculture pendergrass et al 2020 a characteristic example of this is the island of crete where climate change over the last few decades has been causing significant flash drought flood events specifically 2018 was an extremely drought year for crete leading to very low agricultural yield while the next one was one of the wettest years that caused extended floods and soil erosion phenomena in agricultural areas water resources department of the region of crete 2019 generally extreme droughts and floods are natural disasters that cause many environmental economic and social problems worldwide the identification quantification and monitoring of such hydrological extremes is a difficult task since they are complex to predict phenomena loukas and vasiliades 2004 kourgialas et al 2015 various methodologies have been proposed for assessing hydrological extremes which can be separated into two main categories tsakiris and pangalou 2009 maochuan et al 2017 a empirical methodologies which provide evidence on the effects of drought and flood and b mathematical methodologies which can be expressed with simulation routines or indicators and their combinations hydrological extremes can be identified on the basis of spi which is a widely used index adopted by the world meteorological organization wmo for drought monitoring wmo 2009 it can be used to detect drought over a variety of time scales and can distinguish regions with persistent or emerging hydrological extremes wmo 2012 mckee et al 1993 proposed the spi as an ideal tool for performing risk analysis as spi calculates the probability of precipitation occurrence and can identify non normal dry and wet periods more accurately than other indices until now many other hydrological anomalies indicators have been developed among them being the palmer drought severity index pdsi which has been extensively used in the usa the china z index czi used by the national meteorological center of china the crop moisture index cmi and the surface water supply index swsi which has been adopted by several usa states today on a global scale one of the most widely used hydroclimatic indicator is the standardized precipitation index spi cancelliere and bonaccorso 2009 karavitis et al 2011 abu hajar et al 2019 also keyantash and dracup 2002 tested the robustness of 18 different hydroclimatic indices by means of statistical metrics and concluded that spi is the best climatic index for the identification of hydrological extremes spi integrates the following characteristics vidal and wade 2009 a it is flexible as it can be used to identify and assess both wet and dry periods b the computation uses only precipitation the same efficiency for solid or liquid precipitation a parameter that is easily available in most cases c it can be calculated under different time scales depending on the utility the short timescales 1 2 3 or 6 month fit better in meteorological and agricultural drought while the longer 12 24 or 48 months are applied in hydrology many researchers who advise on avoiding the use of small time steps in low precipitation climates argue that the spi offers reliable results only up to 24 month periods hayes et al 1999 champagne et al 2011 d it is recommended at least 30 years of data sets be used and it has been successfully tested in many regions with different climate conditions ntale and gan 2003 vicente serrano et al 2010 abu hajar et al 2019 investigating the past variability of the hydrological extremes is doubtlessly the most common approach exploiting the spi anshuka et al 2019 moreover in the recent years different techniques and methodologies to support the better spatial representation of the spi are of high priority for studying continental or country wide vulnerability and risk to hydrological extremes various spi interpolation approaches have been used in gis environment batisani 2011 karavitis et al 2011 mansouri daneshvar et al 2013 zin et al 2013 tsakiris et al 2016 in addition on a regional scale different methods to assess the spatial characteristics and the frequency of the drought using spi have been developed for instance the severity areal extent frequency saf method by loukas and vasiliades 2004 the spatially normalized standardized precipitation index sn spi by koutroulis et al 2011 the areal drought magnitude adm method by liu et al 2012 the regional standardized precipitation index rspi by hannaford et al 2011 while recently mansouri daneshvar et al 2013 suggested the drought hazard index dhi produced by summing up the spatial representation of the spi values over an area furthermore spi has been combined with remote sensing products stochastic techniques or artificial neural network methods to predict and monitor drought and flood risk dutta et al 2013 sohn et al 2013 keskin et al 2011 liu et al 2011 keskin et al 2009 and keskin et al 2011 found a good potential of fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks methods to predict the regional meteorological drought using the 12 month spi values despite the simplicity and flexibility of the spi it has some weaknesses a it uses a single meteorological element for describing a complex event despite that the precipitation is the major driver so it cannot predict the impact of other important variables such as evapotranspiration or soil available water capacity b it provides uncertain results in regions with multiple zero precipitation months c it cannot differentiate the regions in relation with their proneness to droughts or floods as a consequence of its normal distribution the index values occur with similar frequencies at any location d validating the results of the spi special distribution in many cases is a very difficult task which is not always addressed in publications the terrestrial branch of the hydrological cycle is an essential production factor in agriculture contributing to the spatial heterogeneity of available water for crops growth the terrestrial branch of runoff accumulation evapotranspiration precipitation in terms of spi and soil available water capacity can catalytically affect the crop sector kumaret al 2016 specifically the amount of water stored in the soil is fundamentally important to agriculture and has influence on the rate of actual evaporation groundwater recharge and generation of runoff in addition runoff accumulation based on its amount can negatively or positively affect the agricultural productivity the rate of evapotranspiration from the land surface is essentially driven by meteorological controls referring to the characteristics of plants and soils and forced by the amount of water available also precipitation represented by spi is the main driver of variability in the water balance over space and time having vital implications for agriculture the major impact of an intensification of the hydrologic cycle on agriculture is highly regionally specific and related to the consequences of droughts and floods tabari 2020 so incorporating the terrestrial branch of the hydrological cycle in order to develop an easy to use gis decision making tool for early assessment of hydrological extremes droughts and floods is a challenge for water resources management in the mediterranean agro environment sbai and benhachmi 2020 one of the main purposes of this study was to face these challenges specifically in the most productive tree crops area of crete this paper highlights a a spi temporal analysis based on 60 year historical meteorological data giving remarkable conclusions about the hydroclimatic variability and the potential effect in agricultural and tourist sectors of this mediterranean region b an integrated modeling approach for estimating both drought and flood prone areas incorporating apart from the special destitution of long term time period spi spis extra inputs such as evapotranspiration runoff accumulation as well as the soil s available water capacity these inputs representing the main hydrological components affecting the generation of drought or flood phenomena along the water pathways of the hydrological cycle are combined in a gis fuzzy modeling approach this modeling approach incorporates all information necessary to reduce the level of uncertainty in the results indicating both drought and flood prone areas the proposed methodology was validated for several drought and flood affected areas that have been historically recorded in the study area this validation procedure is an essential requirement to hydrological extremes prone areas assessment ensuring the reliability of the final results c the unique challenges faced by vulnerable stakeholders who have less time to prepare and act against sudden onset flash flood drought adverse effects by knowing beforehand the areas prone to these hydrological extremes and d water saving and flood protection measures for mediterranean tree crops areas to enhance resistance under hydrological extremes 2 study area and data the study area is located in the western part of crete in chania fig 1 a the area is about 270 km2 with an elevation range from zero to 800 m msl the study area is the most important agricultural region of chania dominated by cultivations of olive citrus and avocado trees fig 1b specifically the agricultural land in the study area reaches up to 62 pasture and natural vegetation about 20 while urban structures touristic units cover the rest of 18 olive trees cover 75 of the total agricultural area following by citrus and avocado trees with 9 and 5 respectively opekepe 2017 many olive tree parcels are cultivated in semi mountainous areas with high slopes up to 40 the climate of the studied region is sub humid mediterranean winters are relatively cold and rainy while summers are dry and warm seven meteorological stations are located in the study area so that they fully cover the spatial temporal variation of rainfall versus topography the meteorological data that was used in this study covers a period of about 60 years from 1960 to 2019 table 1 describes the name the absolute altitude and the mean yearly rainfall of the studied meteorological stations while fig 1a illustrates the spatial distribution of them from the hydrological cycle point of view about 65 of the total yearly precipitation is lost in the form of evapotranspiration 28 becomes surface runoff and only 7 contributes to subsurface recharge kourgialas and karatzas 2016 according to table 1 and knowing that the low zone is between 0 and 200 m absolute altitude while the semi mountainous zone is from 200 m to 800 m absolute altitude it becomes obvious that from the studied meteorological stations three are located in the semi mountainous zone m1 m2 m3 while the other four m4 m5 m6 m7 are located in lowland taking into consideration that many flash drought and flood phenomena appear from time to time in the study area while the impacts of climate change seem to be more severe in mediterranean regions with intense competition for water resources between agriculture and touristic sectors such as our case the development of an easy to use decision making tool for determining both drought and flood prone areas could be of high importance this tool can assist policymakers for adapting tree cultivations to climate change effects or allocate crops ensuring the sustainability of agriculture and tourism 3 methodology the nature of the spi allows the identification of hydrological extremes in any region and at any time spi is based on precipitation data for a certain period of time and the longer this period is the more reliable the spi results are cancelliere and bonaccorso 2009 according to mckee et al 1993 this period should be at least 30 years mathematically spi is computed by fitting historical precipitation data to a gamma probability distribution function for a specific time period and location following the gamma distribution is transformed to normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1 the spi is a dimensionless index where positive values indicate rainfall higher than 50 of the observations and respectively negative values indicate lower rainfall of the observations by 50 this normalization of spi has an advantage that the wetter and drier events can be represented in the same way table 2 shows the classification values of spi a hydrological extreme event begins in case of drought when the spi takes a value less than or equal to 1 5 while in case of flood the spi index takes a value higher than or equal to 1 5 agnew 2000 jain et al 2010 for determining spi daily rainfall values for the studied meteorological stations were used fig 1a these data collected by hellenic agricultural organization nagref national agricultural research foundation and were recorded for the period of 1960 2019 to ensure the final quality of the data in spi analysis the homogeneity of each precipitation time series was checked using the standard normal homogeneity test alexandersson 1986 studying the temporal extents of hydrological extremes as well as the potential effect of climate variability in tree cultivations spi is used in this study the monthly time series of precipitation were adjusted to the gamma probability density function mckee et al 1993 1995 detailed descriptions of the probability density function and mathematical formulation of spi can be found in the original publication of mckee et al 1993 and associated publications mansouri daneshvar et al 2013 chang et al 2016 12 month spi values are used in the present study since this time step demonstrates the best performance in detecting extraordinary droughts because shorter time steps are sensitive to short term precipitation moreover 12 month spi is a good indicator of the cumulative effects of prior precipitation variability a fact that plays a catalytic role in the generation of hydrological extremes sergio and vicente 2006 additionally having almost 60 years of precipitation data the 12 month spi values was preferred for this paper since annual inputs and outputs in the hydrological budget are more suited for water resources management purposes estimating hydrological extreme prone areas hayes et al 1999 komuscu 1999 koutroulis et al 2011 there are many statistical metrics available for trend analysis each method having its own advantages and drawbacks wmo 2012 in this paper the mann kendall mk test kendall 1975 mann 1945 suggested by the world meteorological organization wmo 2012 is used to study the hydroclimatic trends of spi in each precipitation station and for each year a unique value of spi was calculated in order to determine the spi variability in terms of spatial distribution raster map rainfall values for the 7 precipitation stations that cover the study area were used based on the inverse distance squared weighted idw interpolation method in gis environment this method was chosen among different spatial interpolation procedures as it is more appropriate for spatial analysis of spi ali et al 2011 it is noteworthy to mention according to marc girons lopez et al 2015 that the density of 7 meteorological stations per 270 km2 can be considered very satisfying for an accurate estimation of precipitation spatial variability for lowland and semi mountainous areas the spatial destitution of spi values for each studied year depicts the effect of spi separately for each year the integration of all spi maps is necessary in order to obtain the overall map of the whole time period so a summation spi assessment using python in gis environment needs to be able to fully reflect the multiple features of spi for each year in this model the annual values of spi are categorized into five levels prone to flood including extremely to severely wet values of table 2 moderately wet near normal moderately dry and prone to drought including extremely to severely dry values of table 2 then the summation of yearly spi maps yields the final map of spis for the whole time period according to the following equation mansouri daneshvar et al 2013 1 s p i s i 1 n x i where spis is the long term time period spi produced by sum overlaying of the spi thematic maps xi for a time period of n 59 years 1960 2019 in most cases the generation of hydrological extremes such as droughts and floods are the result of the intensified hydrological cycle the terrestrial branch of the hydrological cycle is the balance among total precipitation evaportaspiration runoff and soil available water capacity the spatial variability of the above main hydrological components branches can affect the assessed hydrological extreme prone areas douville et al 2002 these areas cannot be accurately estimated by considering the effect of each branch separately even if this branch is the major driver such as in the case of precipitation so the spatial integration of the above main hydrological components is necessary in order to obtain the overall map of hydrological extreme prone areas since all components do not have the same degree of influence a fuzzy evaluation method in gis environment was performed fuzzy logic is a mathematical description of the uncertainty related to the absence of a generally acceptable delineation of a notion in which the natural language is transferred into a mathematical context voskoglou 2015 a fuzzy set is considered by a membership function which gives each element a grade of involvement ranging between zero and one zadeh 1965 as a mathematical representation in classical set theory if the object is the member of a set it takes the membership value of 1 otherwise it takes the membership value of 0 however in fuzzy logic objects could have membership degrees between 0 and 1 based on this more reliable results can be obtained by a fuzzy approachthan the classical logic klai et al 2020 in this paper the determination of the membership function is performed in gis environment wherein thematic maps are produced for every component factor fuzzy membership and fuzzy overlay tools were performed respectively for fuzzification of the spatial data and the proper combination of these with the use of different functions based on the fuzzy membership tool the input data are reclassified to a 0 to 1 scale accordingly to the possibility of being a member of a specified set locations or cells that are definitely a member of the specified flood set the 0 is assigned while to those values that are definitely a member of the specified drought set the 1 is assigned for the entire range of possibilities between 0 and 1 the smaller the number the lower the possibility to be a member of the drought set and vice versa regarding the flood set esri 2019 the selection of the appropriate membership function in each case is based on the objective the data and the phenomenon being modeled subbotin and bilotskii 2014 in turn based on the set theory analysis and using the fuzzy overlay functions the data is combined as mentioned above the spis map integrates the probability occurrence the amount as well as the space and time distribution of precipitation during the whole studied time period thus spis could be considered as an excellent index representing a holistic approach of precipitation based on this spis evapotranspiration runoff accumulation and soil available water capacity factors were fuzzified and then overlayed to achieve the final hydrological extremes prone areas map analytically for each of the involved factor 3 1 spis the spis raster map was produced based on equation 1 the fuzzification function fuzzy linear was used for spis factor fuzzy linear is a function that assigns a score of membership equal to 0 to the minimum value and a score of membership equal to 1 to the maximum value while the intermediate values are linearly decreasing or increasing depending on the gradient esri 2019 small values of spis can lead to drought phenomena while high values to extreme wet condition and flood events the spis map was categorized into five groups as shown in table 4 and the raster map was fuzzified with the use of the linear function the smaller the spis values the greater the vulnerability for drought occurrence therefore the minimum degree of membership was assigned to the maximum group value and the maximum degree of membership was assigned to the minimum group value 3 2 evapotranspiration crop evapotranspiration represents the key factor of hydrological losses in mediterranean climate high values of crop evapotranspiration can lead to water shortage especially in cases of limited water supplies in this study the blaney criddle method was used for estimating crop evapotranspiration within the gis framework the reference evapotranspiration was calculated using temperature data from 7 studied meteorological stations for the same period as the rainfall data in turn using the inverse distance method the data was interpolated depicting the special distribution of the reference evapotranspiration the opekepe s spatial database of recorded tree crop farms was incorporated with the corine land cover database eea 2019 http www eea europa eu to derive the detailed land use parcels map for the study area based on this farm scale land uses map the crop coefficient map was created and multiplied by the reference evapotranspiration map through the gis raster calculator to determine the crop evapotranspiration map next the crop evapotranspiration map was fuzzified via the fuzzy large function the fuzzy large function was chosen due to the fact that in case of evapotranspiration and during drought conditions the larger input values evapotranspiration are more likely to be a member of the set drought detailed descriptions of the mathematical formulation of this function can be found in the esri 2019 3 3 soil available water capacity small values of soil available water capacity the amount of water that can be stored in a soil profile can lead to drought especially in the agricultural sector in contrast high values of soil available water capacity contribute to flood generation as surface runoff is increased while soil infiltration process is decreased the thematic map of available soil water capacity for the study area was obtained from detailed previous field studies micheli et al 2008 opekepe 2015 the soil available water capacity was categorized into four groups as shown in table 4 and the raster map was fuzzified with the use of the linear function during the fuzzification process the smaller value is defined to have the maximum degree of membership to the drought set while the greater value is defined to have the minimum degree of membership 3 4 runoff accumulation runoff accumulation the identification of the water accumulation points is calculated in the 3d analyst tool of gis using the digital elevation model dem spatial resolution of 20 m 20 m esri 2018 the runoff accumulation map indicates five classes the larger group value represents the region with the highest accumulation while the smaller group value represents the lower accumulation in the region the larger the amount of accumulated water the smaller the vulnerability of drought to occur in a particular region thus the greatest group value is given with the maximum degree of membership to the drought set while the smallest group value is assigned with the minimum degree of membership through the use of the fuzzy linear function the final map spisers for estimating extreme hydrological prone areas was produced using the fuzzy gamma function which is calculated as follows 2 μ x 1 i 1 n 1 μ i γ i 1 n μ i 1 γ where μ i is the fuzzy membership function for the ith map i 1 2 3 n maps to be combined μ χ is the membership function of the fuzzy set x in this paper the fuzzy logic gamma function was used to integrate the factors affecting extreme hydrological prone areas this method was chosen because it is similar to human reasoning its rapidity operation and its high precision klai et al 2020 the fuzzy gamma function is an algebraic product of fuzzy product and fuzzy sum which are both raised to the power of gamma which ranges between 1 and 0 if the power of gamma is 1 the output is as equal as fuzzy sum if gamma is 0 the output is the same as fuzzy product values in between permit to combine evidence between these two extremes esri 2019 the fundamental advantage of the fuzzy gamma function is that it connects premises softer than maximum and minimum connectives thus users have the option of a more flexible interpretation and evaluation of the logical combination esri 2019 the overallproposed methodologyis presented in theflowchartof fig 2 4 results and discussion annual spi values were determined in order to estimate the hydrological extreme years within the baseline period 1960 2019 useful remarks were obtained regarding trend line and the occurrence of extreme hydrological phenomena both in lowland and the semi mountainous tree crops area fig 3 illustrates the annual variation of spi for each of the studied meteorological station the annual spi hydroclimatic trends for all stations were calculated using the mann kendall test table 3 trend for stations with p 0 05 was considered as not significant while the trend is considered as statistically significant at the 5 level p 0 05 positive kendall s τ values represent increasing trend wetting conditions while negative values depict decreasing trend drying conditions rahman and dawood 2016 chang et al 2016 rahman et al 2018 as is observed in table 3 all stations showed a negative trend but only in the case of m1 m2 and m3 stations located at semi mountainous areas significant decreased trends were observed indicating more intense dry periods for the next decades regarding stations m4 m5 m6 and m7 located at lowland areas no evidence of significant trend in annual precipitation for the baseline period was recorded in any of them fig 3 describes the spi variability and the climate change effects for all studied stations during the period from 1960 to 2019 based on this figure and table 2 the hydrological years were classified from extremely dry negative spi values to extremely wet positive spi values it is also remarkable that almost for all stations during the first 30 years period from 1960 to 1989 hydrological years classified between near normal to moderate wet dry while for the period from 1990 to 2019 hydrological years appear to have more often severe or extreme spi values positive or negative another important observation is that more frequent dry and wet spells appear in the last three decades especially in the semi mountainous areas furthermore in the case of semi mountainous areas a notably increasing frequency of droughts is observed this evidence enhances the theory that climate change appears to be more severe in mediterranean regions with more intense hydrological extreme phenomena next for demonstration reasons the climate change effects in two stations located one at semi mountainous area station m1 and one at low land station m4 will be analyzed it should be noted that similar hydroclimatic behavior was observed for the rest of the stations located at semi mountainous and low land areas respectively specifically as observed form fig 3 at station m1 during the period 1960 1990 only one severe drought event occurred while during the last period of the 30 years seven extreme or severe events took place for station m1 1969 and 2003 were severe wet years while 2019 was an extreme wet year with many and significant floods to be recorded on the other hand 2014 was a severely dry year while 1990 1995 2016 and 2018 were characterized as extreme dry years with reduced tree crop yields and seriouswater shortages for station m4 during the period 1960 1990 four drought or flood events occurred three severe and one extreme while during the last period of the 30 years three extreme and three severe hydrological events took place specifically for this station 1969 1982 and 2003 were severely wet years while 1977 and 2019 were the most two extremely wet years during the baseline period causing significant flood damages in the agricultural sector regarding the drought events at station m4 the years 1981 2016 and 2018 were characterized as severely dry while 1990 and 1994 were the most extremely dry years during the studied time period the resulting map for each of the four factors affecting extreme hydrological prone areas in the study area are presented in fig 4 a b fig 4a a shows the spatial distribution of the total spis factor map calculated over the entire study area this factor integrates the effect of each yearly spi map during the time period 1960 2019 it is indicated that drought vulnerability due to spis map is high on the western part of the region while in the central parts high flood vulnerability is noted on the other hand drought prone areas due to the factor of evapotranspiration fig 4a b are found mainly on the coastal and eastern parts of the region while flood prone areas are located on the southern part of it according to flow accumulation map fig 4b c reveals that apart from the primary and secondary rivers and their floodplains almost the rest part of the region is considered as vulnerable to drought based on the soil available water capacity map fig 4b d the drought prone areas are located in the southern semi mountainous region as well as in some spots of it where the soil is characterized by high infiltration rates on the contrary some areas in northern parts with high values of soil available water capacity are vulnerable to floods table 4 presents the fuzzy categorization the domain of effect descriptive level group value function and grade is used as well as membership function value for each of the four factors affecting hydrological extremes based on the final hydrological extreme map pixel by pixel basis of 20 20 m that combines the four aforementioned factors fig 5 the brown color describes the drought prone areas while the dark blue color represents the flood prone areas the majority of the drought prone areas are located in the southern and central regions while flood prone areas are gathered mainly in the coastal north central and western areas as well as in specific spots closed to river lines from the total area of 270 km2 of the study area 41 16 km2 are characterized as drought prone areas corresponding to 15 24 of the total area in addition 52 63 km2 of the total area are characterized as flood prone region corresponding to 19 49 of the total area concerning the tree crop areas prone to hydrological extremes and overlaying the detailed spatial database of recorded tree crops parcels fig 6 6 70 of the total olive trees located in drought prone area while 1 32 and 0 24 of the total citrus and avocado crops are concentrated in drought prone region respectively approximately 16 of the total flood prone area was concentrated in tree crops specifically 15 30 was concentrated in olive trees 0 53 in citrus and 0 14 in avocado crop areas these results indicate that olive trees in a total of 22 are located in areas prone to hydrological extremes concerning the citrus and avocado crops in total 1 85 and 0 38 are located respectively in areas prone to hydrological extremes table 5 represents the total area and the corresponding presentence for each tree crop located in regions prone to hydrological extremes based on the proposed final map to verify the final hydrological extreme map it was compared against historical data for drought and flood affected areas regarding the flood prone areas map a review of the last 60 years historical flooded events in the study area was used water resources department of the prefecture of crete 2019 fig 7 a depicts the total 22 recorded and reported historical flooded points during the last sixty yeas which are marked with red stars the next step of the validation process was the connection between historical flooded points and the proposed flood prone areas which was achieved using extract by mask tool in gis environment fig 7a indicates that all the recorded reported historical floods are located in the flood prone areas of the proposed method in the case of drought prone areas fig 7b depicts the total of communities in the study area as well as the drought affected communities that were reported by local authorities during the last six decades specifically in fig 7b according to the data that was provided by the hellenic agricultural insurance organization elga and civil protection services of crete the red color lines represent the communities that were affected during extreme dry years in these historical drought affected communities an important reduction more than 45 of a normal hydrological year was recorded regarding the available water supplies while significant damages in tree crops production were reported due to the lack of irrigation water overlaying the reported drought affected communities fig 7b with the proposed drought prone areas map a close match is observed generally there are three main techniques usually applied to validate hydrological extreme prone areas maps the choice of the technique to be implemented depends mainly on the availability of data for validation the first technique involves the comparison between model results and observed reported or recorded data the second concerns the comparison among other validated models and the last one the involvement of expert judgement the first approach indicates the most robust validation process in comparison with the other two in case of course that the validation reported recorded data sets used represent different conditions adequate number time and space distribution ensuring the reliability of the assessment mapping results molinari et al 2019 based on the above in many studies flood drought events locations have been used to validate the extreme prone area maps periyasamy et al 2018 kourgialas et al 2018a 2018b yagoub et al 2020 in our case the recorded reported flood and drought events capture the criteria for a robust validation mapping process as the data events are adequate in number and space distribution considering the study area and reference to an extended time period 60 years so the validation process used in this study indicates the spatial reliability as well as the uniqueness of the parameterization of the proposed methodology for estimating hydrological extremes drought and flood prone areas minimizing the inherent uncertainty of the final results the proposed extreme hydrology prone areas map including map coordinates can be exported by local authorities to any scale this information can be publicized by local authorities in the form of posters maps or leaflets raising awareness and stimulating a wider adoption of measures and practices to prevent or mitigate the negative effects of an oncoming drought or flood event in the context of the resilience to climate change the following measures are proposed to reduce the effects of floods and droughts in agricultural tree crop areas salazar et al 2009 palese et al 2014 xiloyannis et al 2016 kourgialas and karatzas 2016 2017 turner et al 2016 koubouris et al 2017 kourgialas et al 2018a 2018b 4 1 tree crops measures to enhance flood resistance in the semi mountainous regions many studies point out the particularly important role of proper management of agricultural land at both parcel and river basin scale to improve the resilience to floods simple practices in the sloping semi mountainous areas can aid to prevent the flooding of the downstream agriculture areas by increasing soil water storage and reducing surface runoff these practices include the conservation of weeds in the winter period non tillage proper grazing management as well as the introduction of natural barriers terraces at strategically selected locations to minimize soil erosion and improve water retention it is also important to emphasize the need for these practices to be implemented on a large spatial scale catchment level in tree crops there are two types of flood damage a direct damage which is related to the losses of agricultural land and whole trees due to landslides at riverside and sloping areas and b indirect damages which are related to the fact that trees may be covered by flood waters for several days indirect damages can occur in water logged lands with low soil water infiltration rates and or poor soil drainage systems moderate flood tolerant trees such as citrus can survive in flooded conditions for several days but the stress of wet conditions may reduce fruit production plant growth while root disease may result in tree damage or death the above damage is even more pronounced in flood sensitive crops such as avocado and olive trees in these crops and especially in avocado trees conditions of complete soil saturation even for a few days can lead to their death it is noted that the flood sensitivity of the above crops depends on the growing season flooding during the growing season is much more harmful than during the dormant season the age of the plants seedling or over mature trees are generally more susceptible to flooding than mature trees and the rootstocks tolerance to the saturated conditions based on the above in flood prone tree crop areas where water accumulation is favored drainage systems should be installed in crete as well as in many mediterranean areas drainage systems are not so widespread but in the context of climate change for the sustainability of flood sensitive tree crops areas such interventions are one way 4 2 tree crops measures to enhance drought resistance sustainable farming practices that ensure water efficiency in drought prone tree crop areas can be the reduction of evapotranspiration during the summer period by suitable summer pruning the application of mowed weed and pruning residues on the soil surface shredding healthy pruned tree branches and also the application of spray formulations for reducing the overall transpiration on the other hand during the winter period no weed control is recommended for increasing soil water storage also another crucial measure concerns the reduction of water and nutrients losses below the root zone due to deep percolation which can be achieved by increasing the soil organic matter content and using fertigation in the summer period and rational fertilization in the winter period also apart from the annual maintenance of irrigation network the irrigation should be done based on the appropriate meteorological soil moisture data the soil type the age of each tree crop species as well as the time of the previous irrigation application additionally in tree crop areas with limited water supplies the following measures should be investigated a irrigation only at critical stages of plant growth deficit irrigation b reuse of treated water for irrigation based on the applicable legislation in addition in mediterranean agricultural coastal areas where a salt water intrusion is observed salt water irrigation management plan should be proposed based on pumping optimization and the right irrigation dose and time considering the soil type the water chloride concentration as well as the age of each tree crop c the choice of tree crops that are more tolerant to environmental stress or extreme climate conditions for instance heritage tree crop varieties are recommended as more drought or salt resilient crops ensuring yield stability at the same time 5 conclusions the aim of this study was to investigate the extreme hydrology years for the past six decades in one of the most intensive tree cultivation areas of crete in greece this region is considered one of the most essential agricultural and touristic areas of the mediterranean region and at the same time it is one of the most prone to hydrological extremes drought flood regions based on spi analysis which was held for the studied meteorological stations and for the period from 1960 to 2019 useful remarks were obtained regarding the occurrence of extreme hydrological phenomena water defect and floods for the first three decades 1960 1990 the hydrological conditions could be characterized as near normal or moderately wet dry however for the following three decades the droughts as well as flood events were remarkable increasing in magnitude and frequency this remark comes to confirm the many flood events which appeared in the specific period in the study area especially 2019 causing extended damages in agriculture and infrastructures on the other hand in this period significant droughts were observed and led to noteworthy reduction of water resources in several tree crops areas of the study area according to spi analysis for all the studied meteorological stations the hydroclimatic trend line for spi values through the time period from 1960 to 2019 shows slight decrease indicating more intense dry periods for the next decades this fact seems to be more intense in semi mountainous areas which are dominated by olive tree cultivations also in this study an integrated approach named spisers to estimate both drought and food prone areas that considers variables related to the terrestrial branch of the hydrological cycle was presented and validated using historical data from drought and flood affected areas based on the results 8 70 of the studied tree crops area is characterized as prone to drought while 15 97 of the total tree crop region is considered as prone to floods moreover drought vulnerability is more severe in the central and southern part of the region while many coastal and western parts as well as river flood plain zones are significant flood prone areas a notable part of the proposed methodology is the suggestion of tree crop measures to enhance resistance under hydrological extremes this information can act as a demonstrator of tailored solutions raise awareness and stimulate a wider adoption of practices in the agricultural sector in order to mitigate oncoming climate change effects declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
4741,hydrological extremes such as droughts and floods are recognized as environmental disasters causing several negative effects especially on the agricultural section these phenomena and their proper management have attracted the attention of hydrologists and agricultural scientists this paper evaluates the climate change effects on hydrological extremes based on the standardized precipitation index spi in the north western part of crete greece for the period of 1960 2019 this area is considered to be one of the most important agricultural regions in the mediterranean dominated by tree cultivations the climate trend line for spi values shows slight decrease indicating more intense dry periods for the next decades especially for semi mountainous areas a notable result of this analysis is that more frequent dry and wet spells have appeared in the last three decades in addition a fuzzy based gis modeling approach for estimating both droughts and floods prone areas named spisers is developed incorporating the special distribution of long term time period standardized precipitation index spis evapotranspiration runoff accumulation and soil available water capacity the proposed methodology was validated for several flood and drought affected areas that have been historically recorded in the study area according to the results 24 67 of the total tree crops parcels in the study region is prone to hydrological extremes droughts or floods finally for adapting to the inevitable adverse effects of climate change water saving and flood protection measures for mediterranean tree crops areas are proposed keywords hydroclimatic extremes spi olive citrus and avocado trees gis adaptability to climate change 1 introduction climate change has intensified the hydrological cycle increasing the globally average precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration huntington 2006 undrr 2019 the consequences of climate change on agriculture differ significantly between the climatic zones the mediterranean areas are among the most arid regions in the world particularly prone to climate change tsakiris 2017 kourgialas et al 2018a 2018b water shortage is already becoming an increasingly key limitation to society for the mediterranean countries where beyond 50 percent of the world water poor population lives due to the high proportion of agriculture in their economies the adverse effects of climate change are more evident more water scarcity and extreme weather events including flash droughts floods are expected to result in lower agricultural production or the abandonment of climate disadvantaged parcels martínez mena et al 2020 flash droughts which are a recently recognized type of extreme event as well as flash floods are distinguished by sudden onset and rapid intensification with severe impacts particularly in agriculture pendergrass et al 2020 a characteristic example of this is the island of crete where climate change over the last few decades has been causing significant flash drought flood events specifically 2018 was an extremely drought year for crete leading to very low agricultural yield while the next one was one of the wettest years that caused extended floods and soil erosion phenomena in agricultural areas water resources department of the region of crete 2019 generally extreme droughts and floods are natural disasters that cause many environmental economic and social problems worldwide the identification quantification and monitoring of such hydrological extremes is a difficult task since they are complex to predict phenomena loukas and vasiliades 2004 kourgialas et al 2015 various methodologies have been proposed for assessing hydrological extremes which can be separated into two main categories tsakiris and pangalou 2009 maochuan et al 2017 a empirical methodologies which provide evidence on the effects of drought and flood and b mathematical methodologies which can be expressed with simulation routines or indicators and their combinations hydrological extremes can be identified on the basis of spi which is a widely used index adopted by the world meteorological organization wmo for drought monitoring wmo 2009 it can be used to detect drought over a variety of time scales and can distinguish regions with persistent or emerging hydrological extremes wmo 2012 mckee et al 1993 proposed the spi as an ideal tool for performing risk analysis as spi calculates the probability of precipitation occurrence and can identify non normal dry and wet periods more accurately than other indices until now many other hydrological anomalies indicators have been developed among them being the palmer drought severity index pdsi which has been extensively used in the usa the china z index czi used by the national meteorological center of china the crop moisture index cmi and the surface water supply index swsi which has been adopted by several usa states today on a global scale one of the most widely used hydroclimatic indicator is the standardized precipitation index spi cancelliere and bonaccorso 2009 karavitis et al 2011 abu hajar et al 2019 also keyantash and dracup 2002 tested the robustness of 18 different hydroclimatic indices by means of statistical metrics and concluded that spi is the best climatic index for the identification of hydrological extremes spi integrates the following characteristics vidal and wade 2009 a it is flexible as it can be used to identify and assess both wet and dry periods b the computation uses only precipitation the same efficiency for solid or liquid precipitation a parameter that is easily available in most cases c it can be calculated under different time scales depending on the utility the short timescales 1 2 3 or 6 month fit better in meteorological and agricultural drought while the longer 12 24 or 48 months are applied in hydrology many researchers who advise on avoiding the use of small time steps in low precipitation climates argue that the spi offers reliable results only up to 24 month periods hayes et al 1999 champagne et al 2011 d it is recommended at least 30 years of data sets be used and it has been successfully tested in many regions with different climate conditions ntale and gan 2003 vicente serrano et al 2010 abu hajar et al 2019 investigating the past variability of the hydrological extremes is doubtlessly the most common approach exploiting the spi anshuka et al 2019 moreover in the recent years different techniques and methodologies to support the better spatial representation of the spi are of high priority for studying continental or country wide vulnerability and risk to hydrological extremes various spi interpolation approaches have been used in gis environment batisani 2011 karavitis et al 2011 mansouri daneshvar et al 2013 zin et al 2013 tsakiris et al 2016 in addition on a regional scale different methods to assess the spatial characteristics and the frequency of the drought using spi have been developed for instance the severity areal extent frequency saf method by loukas and vasiliades 2004 the spatially normalized standardized precipitation index sn spi by koutroulis et al 2011 the areal drought magnitude adm method by liu et al 2012 the regional standardized precipitation index rspi by hannaford et al 2011 while recently mansouri daneshvar et al 2013 suggested the drought hazard index dhi produced by summing up the spatial representation of the spi values over an area furthermore spi has been combined with remote sensing products stochastic techniques or artificial neural network methods to predict and monitor drought and flood risk dutta et al 2013 sohn et al 2013 keskin et al 2011 liu et al 2011 keskin et al 2009 and keskin et al 2011 found a good potential of fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks methods to predict the regional meteorological drought using the 12 month spi values despite the simplicity and flexibility of the spi it has some weaknesses a it uses a single meteorological element for describing a complex event despite that the precipitation is the major driver so it cannot predict the impact of other important variables such as evapotranspiration or soil available water capacity b it provides uncertain results in regions with multiple zero precipitation months c it cannot differentiate the regions in relation with their proneness to droughts or floods as a consequence of its normal distribution the index values occur with similar frequencies at any location d validating the results of the spi special distribution in many cases is a very difficult task which is not always addressed in publications the terrestrial branch of the hydrological cycle is an essential production factor in agriculture contributing to the spatial heterogeneity of available water for crops growth the terrestrial branch of runoff accumulation evapotranspiration precipitation in terms of spi and soil available water capacity can catalytically affect the crop sector kumaret al 2016 specifically the amount of water stored in the soil is fundamentally important to agriculture and has influence on the rate of actual evaporation groundwater recharge and generation of runoff in addition runoff accumulation based on its amount can negatively or positively affect the agricultural productivity the rate of evapotranspiration from the land surface is essentially driven by meteorological controls referring to the characteristics of plants and soils and forced by the amount of water available also precipitation represented by spi is the main driver of variability in the water balance over space and time having vital implications for agriculture the major impact of an intensification of the hydrologic cycle on agriculture is highly regionally specific and related to the consequences of droughts and floods tabari 2020 so incorporating the terrestrial branch of the hydrological cycle in order to develop an easy to use gis decision making tool for early assessment of hydrological extremes droughts and floods is a challenge for water resources management in the mediterranean agro environment sbai and benhachmi 2020 one of the main purposes of this study was to face these challenges specifically in the most productive tree crops area of crete this paper highlights a a spi temporal analysis based on 60 year historical meteorological data giving remarkable conclusions about the hydroclimatic variability and the potential effect in agricultural and tourist sectors of this mediterranean region b an integrated modeling approach for estimating both drought and flood prone areas incorporating apart from the special destitution of long term time period spi spis extra inputs such as evapotranspiration runoff accumulation as well as the soil s available water capacity these inputs representing the main hydrological components affecting the generation of drought or flood phenomena along the water pathways of the hydrological cycle are combined in a gis fuzzy modeling approach this modeling approach incorporates all information necessary to reduce the level of uncertainty in the results indicating both drought and flood prone areas the proposed methodology was validated for several drought and flood affected areas that have been historically recorded in the study area this validation procedure is an essential requirement to hydrological extremes prone areas assessment ensuring the reliability of the final results c the unique challenges faced by vulnerable stakeholders who have less time to prepare and act against sudden onset flash flood drought adverse effects by knowing beforehand the areas prone to these hydrological extremes and d water saving and flood protection measures for mediterranean tree crops areas to enhance resistance under hydrological extremes 2 study area and data the study area is located in the western part of crete in chania fig 1 a the area is about 270 km2 with an elevation range from zero to 800 m msl the study area is the most important agricultural region of chania dominated by cultivations of olive citrus and avocado trees fig 1b specifically the agricultural land in the study area reaches up to 62 pasture and natural vegetation about 20 while urban structures touristic units cover the rest of 18 olive trees cover 75 of the total agricultural area following by citrus and avocado trees with 9 and 5 respectively opekepe 2017 many olive tree parcels are cultivated in semi mountainous areas with high slopes up to 40 the climate of the studied region is sub humid mediterranean winters are relatively cold and rainy while summers are dry and warm seven meteorological stations are located in the study area so that they fully cover the spatial temporal variation of rainfall versus topography the meteorological data that was used in this study covers a period of about 60 years from 1960 to 2019 table 1 describes the name the absolute altitude and the mean yearly rainfall of the studied meteorological stations while fig 1a illustrates the spatial distribution of them from the hydrological cycle point of view about 65 of the total yearly precipitation is lost in the form of evapotranspiration 28 becomes surface runoff and only 7 contributes to subsurface recharge kourgialas and karatzas 2016 according to table 1 and knowing that the low zone is between 0 and 200 m absolute altitude while the semi mountainous zone is from 200 m to 800 m absolute altitude it becomes obvious that from the studied meteorological stations three are located in the semi mountainous zone m1 m2 m3 while the other four m4 m5 m6 m7 are located in lowland taking into consideration that many flash drought and flood phenomena appear from time to time in the study area while the impacts of climate change seem to be more severe in mediterranean regions with intense competition for water resources between agriculture and touristic sectors such as our case the development of an easy to use decision making tool for determining both drought and flood prone areas could be of high importance this tool can assist policymakers for adapting tree cultivations to climate change effects or allocate crops ensuring the sustainability of agriculture and tourism 3 methodology the nature of the spi allows the identification of hydrological extremes in any region and at any time spi is based on precipitation data for a certain period of time and the longer this period is the more reliable the spi results are cancelliere and bonaccorso 2009 according to mckee et al 1993 this period should be at least 30 years mathematically spi is computed by fitting historical precipitation data to a gamma probability distribution function for a specific time period and location following the gamma distribution is transformed to normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1 the spi is a dimensionless index where positive values indicate rainfall higher than 50 of the observations and respectively negative values indicate lower rainfall of the observations by 50 this normalization of spi has an advantage that the wetter and drier events can be represented in the same way table 2 shows the classification values of spi a hydrological extreme event begins in case of drought when the spi takes a value less than or equal to 1 5 while in case of flood the spi index takes a value higher than or equal to 1 5 agnew 2000 jain et al 2010 for determining spi daily rainfall values for the studied meteorological stations were used fig 1a these data collected by hellenic agricultural organization nagref national agricultural research foundation and were recorded for the period of 1960 2019 to ensure the final quality of the data in spi analysis the homogeneity of each precipitation time series was checked using the standard normal homogeneity test alexandersson 1986 studying the temporal extents of hydrological extremes as well as the potential effect of climate variability in tree cultivations spi is used in this study the monthly time series of precipitation were adjusted to the gamma probability density function mckee et al 1993 1995 detailed descriptions of the probability density function and mathematical formulation of spi can be found in the original publication of mckee et al 1993 and associated publications mansouri daneshvar et al 2013 chang et al 2016 12 month spi values are used in the present study since this time step demonstrates the best performance in detecting extraordinary droughts because shorter time steps are sensitive to short term precipitation moreover 12 month spi is a good indicator of the cumulative effects of prior precipitation variability a fact that plays a catalytic role in the generation of hydrological extremes sergio and vicente 2006 additionally having almost 60 years of precipitation data the 12 month spi values was preferred for this paper since annual inputs and outputs in the hydrological budget are more suited for water resources management purposes estimating hydrological extreme prone areas hayes et al 1999 komuscu 1999 koutroulis et al 2011 there are many statistical metrics available for trend analysis each method having its own advantages and drawbacks wmo 2012 in this paper the mann kendall mk test kendall 1975 mann 1945 suggested by the world meteorological organization wmo 2012 is used to study the hydroclimatic trends of spi in each precipitation station and for each year a unique value of spi was calculated in order to determine the spi variability in terms of spatial distribution raster map rainfall values for the 7 precipitation stations that cover the study area were used based on the inverse distance squared weighted idw interpolation method in gis environment this method was chosen among different spatial interpolation procedures as it is more appropriate for spatial analysis of spi ali et al 2011 it is noteworthy to mention according to marc girons lopez et al 2015 that the density of 7 meteorological stations per 270 km2 can be considered very satisfying for an accurate estimation of precipitation spatial variability for lowland and semi mountainous areas the spatial destitution of spi values for each studied year depicts the effect of spi separately for each year the integration of all spi maps is necessary in order to obtain the overall map of the whole time period so a summation spi assessment using python in gis environment needs to be able to fully reflect the multiple features of spi for each year in this model the annual values of spi are categorized into five levels prone to flood including extremely to severely wet values of table 2 moderately wet near normal moderately dry and prone to drought including extremely to severely dry values of table 2 then the summation of yearly spi maps yields the final map of spis for the whole time period according to the following equation mansouri daneshvar et al 2013 1 s p i s i 1 n x i where spis is the long term time period spi produced by sum overlaying of the spi thematic maps xi for a time period of n 59 years 1960 2019 in most cases the generation of hydrological extremes such as droughts and floods are the result of the intensified hydrological cycle the terrestrial branch of the hydrological cycle is the balance among total precipitation evaportaspiration runoff and soil available water capacity the spatial variability of the above main hydrological components branches can affect the assessed hydrological extreme prone areas douville et al 2002 these areas cannot be accurately estimated by considering the effect of each branch separately even if this branch is the major driver such as in the case of precipitation so the spatial integration of the above main hydrological components is necessary in order to obtain the overall map of hydrological extreme prone areas since all components do not have the same degree of influence a fuzzy evaluation method in gis environment was performed fuzzy logic is a mathematical description of the uncertainty related to the absence of a generally acceptable delineation of a notion in which the natural language is transferred into a mathematical context voskoglou 2015 a fuzzy set is considered by a membership function which gives each element a grade of involvement ranging between zero and one zadeh 1965 as a mathematical representation in classical set theory if the object is the member of a set it takes the membership value of 1 otherwise it takes the membership value of 0 however in fuzzy logic objects could have membership degrees between 0 and 1 based on this more reliable results can be obtained by a fuzzy approachthan the classical logic klai et al 2020 in this paper the determination of the membership function is performed in gis environment wherein thematic maps are produced for every component factor fuzzy membership and fuzzy overlay tools were performed respectively for fuzzification of the spatial data and the proper combination of these with the use of different functions based on the fuzzy membership tool the input data are reclassified to a 0 to 1 scale accordingly to the possibility of being a member of a specified set locations or cells that are definitely a member of the specified flood set the 0 is assigned while to those values that are definitely a member of the specified drought set the 1 is assigned for the entire range of possibilities between 0 and 1 the smaller the number the lower the possibility to be a member of the drought set and vice versa regarding the flood set esri 2019 the selection of the appropriate membership function in each case is based on the objective the data and the phenomenon being modeled subbotin and bilotskii 2014 in turn based on the set theory analysis and using the fuzzy overlay functions the data is combined as mentioned above the spis map integrates the probability occurrence the amount as well as the space and time distribution of precipitation during the whole studied time period thus spis could be considered as an excellent index representing a holistic approach of precipitation based on this spis evapotranspiration runoff accumulation and soil available water capacity factors were fuzzified and then overlayed to achieve the final hydrological extremes prone areas map analytically for each of the involved factor 3 1 spis the spis raster map was produced based on equation 1 the fuzzification function fuzzy linear was used for spis factor fuzzy linear is a function that assigns a score of membership equal to 0 to the minimum value and a score of membership equal to 1 to the maximum value while the intermediate values are linearly decreasing or increasing depending on the gradient esri 2019 small values of spis can lead to drought phenomena while high values to extreme wet condition and flood events the spis map was categorized into five groups as shown in table 4 and the raster map was fuzzified with the use of the linear function the smaller the spis values the greater the vulnerability for drought occurrence therefore the minimum degree of membership was assigned to the maximum group value and the maximum degree of membership was assigned to the minimum group value 3 2 evapotranspiration crop evapotranspiration represents the key factor of hydrological losses in mediterranean climate high values of crop evapotranspiration can lead to water shortage especially in cases of limited water supplies in this study the blaney criddle method was used for estimating crop evapotranspiration within the gis framework the reference evapotranspiration was calculated using temperature data from 7 studied meteorological stations for the same period as the rainfall data in turn using the inverse distance method the data was interpolated depicting the special distribution of the reference evapotranspiration the opekepe s spatial database of recorded tree crop farms was incorporated with the corine land cover database eea 2019 http www eea europa eu to derive the detailed land use parcels map for the study area based on this farm scale land uses map the crop coefficient map was created and multiplied by the reference evapotranspiration map through the gis raster calculator to determine the crop evapotranspiration map next the crop evapotranspiration map was fuzzified via the fuzzy large function the fuzzy large function was chosen due to the fact that in case of evapotranspiration and during drought conditions the larger input values evapotranspiration are more likely to be a member of the set drought detailed descriptions of the mathematical formulation of this function can be found in the esri 2019 3 3 soil available water capacity small values of soil available water capacity the amount of water that can be stored in a soil profile can lead to drought especially in the agricultural sector in contrast high values of soil available water capacity contribute to flood generation as surface runoff is increased while soil infiltration process is decreased the thematic map of available soil water capacity for the study area was obtained from detailed previous field studies micheli et al 2008 opekepe 2015 the soil available water capacity was categorized into four groups as shown in table 4 and the raster map was fuzzified with the use of the linear function during the fuzzification process the smaller value is defined to have the maximum degree of membership to the drought set while the greater value is defined to have the minimum degree of membership 3 4 runoff accumulation runoff accumulation the identification of the water accumulation points is calculated in the 3d analyst tool of gis using the digital elevation model dem spatial resolution of 20 m 20 m esri 2018 the runoff accumulation map indicates five classes the larger group value represents the region with the highest accumulation while the smaller group value represents the lower accumulation in the region the larger the amount of accumulated water the smaller the vulnerability of drought to occur in a particular region thus the greatest group value is given with the maximum degree of membership to the drought set while the smallest group value is assigned with the minimum degree of membership through the use of the fuzzy linear function the final map spisers for estimating extreme hydrological prone areas was produced using the fuzzy gamma function which is calculated as follows 2 μ x 1 i 1 n 1 μ i γ i 1 n μ i 1 γ where μ i is the fuzzy membership function for the ith map i 1 2 3 n maps to be combined μ χ is the membership function of the fuzzy set x in this paper the fuzzy logic gamma function was used to integrate the factors affecting extreme hydrological prone areas this method was chosen because it is similar to human reasoning its rapidity operation and its high precision klai et al 2020 the fuzzy gamma function is an algebraic product of fuzzy product and fuzzy sum which are both raised to the power of gamma which ranges between 1 and 0 if the power of gamma is 1 the output is as equal as fuzzy sum if gamma is 0 the output is the same as fuzzy product values in between permit to combine evidence between these two extremes esri 2019 the fundamental advantage of the fuzzy gamma function is that it connects premises softer than maximum and minimum connectives thus users have the option of a more flexible interpretation and evaluation of the logical combination esri 2019 the overallproposed methodologyis presented in theflowchartof fig 2 4 results and discussion annual spi values were determined in order to estimate the hydrological extreme years within the baseline period 1960 2019 useful remarks were obtained regarding trend line and the occurrence of extreme hydrological phenomena both in lowland and the semi mountainous tree crops area fig 3 illustrates the annual variation of spi for each of the studied meteorological station the annual spi hydroclimatic trends for all stations were calculated using the mann kendall test table 3 trend for stations with p 0 05 was considered as not significant while the trend is considered as statistically significant at the 5 level p 0 05 positive kendall s τ values represent increasing trend wetting conditions while negative values depict decreasing trend drying conditions rahman and dawood 2016 chang et al 2016 rahman et al 2018 as is observed in table 3 all stations showed a negative trend but only in the case of m1 m2 and m3 stations located at semi mountainous areas significant decreased trends were observed indicating more intense dry periods for the next decades regarding stations m4 m5 m6 and m7 located at lowland areas no evidence of significant trend in annual precipitation for the baseline period was recorded in any of them fig 3 describes the spi variability and the climate change effects for all studied stations during the period from 1960 to 2019 based on this figure and table 2 the hydrological years were classified from extremely dry negative spi values to extremely wet positive spi values it is also remarkable that almost for all stations during the first 30 years period from 1960 to 1989 hydrological years classified between near normal to moderate wet dry while for the period from 1990 to 2019 hydrological years appear to have more often severe or extreme spi values positive or negative another important observation is that more frequent dry and wet spells appear in the last three decades especially in the semi mountainous areas furthermore in the case of semi mountainous areas a notably increasing frequency of droughts is observed this evidence enhances the theory that climate change appears to be more severe in mediterranean regions with more intense hydrological extreme phenomena next for demonstration reasons the climate change effects in two stations located one at semi mountainous area station m1 and one at low land station m4 will be analyzed it should be noted that similar hydroclimatic behavior was observed for the rest of the stations located at semi mountainous and low land areas respectively specifically as observed form fig 3 at station m1 during the period 1960 1990 only one severe drought event occurred while during the last period of the 30 years seven extreme or severe events took place for station m1 1969 and 2003 were severe wet years while 2019 was an extreme wet year with many and significant floods to be recorded on the other hand 2014 was a severely dry year while 1990 1995 2016 and 2018 were characterized as extreme dry years with reduced tree crop yields and seriouswater shortages for station m4 during the period 1960 1990 four drought or flood events occurred three severe and one extreme while during the last period of the 30 years three extreme and three severe hydrological events took place specifically for this station 1969 1982 and 2003 were severely wet years while 1977 and 2019 were the most two extremely wet years during the baseline period causing significant flood damages in the agricultural sector regarding the drought events at station m4 the years 1981 2016 and 2018 were characterized as severely dry while 1990 and 1994 were the most extremely dry years during the studied time period the resulting map for each of the four factors affecting extreme hydrological prone areas in the study area are presented in fig 4 a b fig 4a a shows the spatial distribution of the total spis factor map calculated over the entire study area this factor integrates the effect of each yearly spi map during the time period 1960 2019 it is indicated that drought vulnerability due to spis map is high on the western part of the region while in the central parts high flood vulnerability is noted on the other hand drought prone areas due to the factor of evapotranspiration fig 4a b are found mainly on the coastal and eastern parts of the region while flood prone areas are located on the southern part of it according to flow accumulation map fig 4b c reveals that apart from the primary and secondary rivers and their floodplains almost the rest part of the region is considered as vulnerable to drought based on the soil available water capacity map fig 4b d the drought prone areas are located in the southern semi mountainous region as well as in some spots of it where the soil is characterized by high infiltration rates on the contrary some areas in northern parts with high values of soil available water capacity are vulnerable to floods table 4 presents the fuzzy categorization the domain of effect descriptive level group value function and grade is used as well as membership function value for each of the four factors affecting hydrological extremes based on the final hydrological extreme map pixel by pixel basis of 20 20 m that combines the four aforementioned factors fig 5 the brown color describes the drought prone areas while the dark blue color represents the flood prone areas the majority of the drought prone areas are located in the southern and central regions while flood prone areas are gathered mainly in the coastal north central and western areas as well as in specific spots closed to river lines from the total area of 270 km2 of the study area 41 16 km2 are characterized as drought prone areas corresponding to 15 24 of the total area in addition 52 63 km2 of the total area are characterized as flood prone region corresponding to 19 49 of the total area concerning the tree crop areas prone to hydrological extremes and overlaying the detailed spatial database of recorded tree crops parcels fig 6 6 70 of the total olive trees located in drought prone area while 1 32 and 0 24 of the total citrus and avocado crops are concentrated in drought prone region respectively approximately 16 of the total flood prone area was concentrated in tree crops specifically 15 30 was concentrated in olive trees 0 53 in citrus and 0 14 in avocado crop areas these results indicate that olive trees in a total of 22 are located in areas prone to hydrological extremes concerning the citrus and avocado crops in total 1 85 and 0 38 are located respectively in areas prone to hydrological extremes table 5 represents the total area and the corresponding presentence for each tree crop located in regions prone to hydrological extremes based on the proposed final map to verify the final hydrological extreme map it was compared against historical data for drought and flood affected areas regarding the flood prone areas map a review of the last 60 years historical flooded events in the study area was used water resources department of the prefecture of crete 2019 fig 7 a depicts the total 22 recorded and reported historical flooded points during the last sixty yeas which are marked with red stars the next step of the validation process was the connection between historical flooded points and the proposed flood prone areas which was achieved using extract by mask tool in gis environment fig 7a indicates that all the recorded reported historical floods are located in the flood prone areas of the proposed method in the case of drought prone areas fig 7b depicts the total of communities in the study area as well as the drought affected communities that were reported by local authorities during the last six decades specifically in fig 7b according to the data that was provided by the hellenic agricultural insurance organization elga and civil protection services of crete the red color lines represent the communities that were affected during extreme dry years in these historical drought affected communities an important reduction more than 45 of a normal hydrological year was recorded regarding the available water supplies while significant damages in tree crops production were reported due to the lack of irrigation water overlaying the reported drought affected communities fig 7b with the proposed drought prone areas map a close match is observed generally there are three main techniques usually applied to validate hydrological extreme prone areas maps the choice of the technique to be implemented depends mainly on the availability of data for validation the first technique involves the comparison between model results and observed reported or recorded data the second concerns the comparison among other validated models and the last one the involvement of expert judgement the first approach indicates the most robust validation process in comparison with the other two in case of course that the validation reported recorded data sets used represent different conditions adequate number time and space distribution ensuring the reliability of the assessment mapping results molinari et al 2019 based on the above in many studies flood drought events locations have been used to validate the extreme prone area maps periyasamy et al 2018 kourgialas et al 2018a 2018b yagoub et al 2020 in our case the recorded reported flood and drought events capture the criteria for a robust validation mapping process as the data events are adequate in number and space distribution considering the study area and reference to an extended time period 60 years so the validation process used in this study indicates the spatial reliability as well as the uniqueness of the parameterization of the proposed methodology for estimating hydrological extremes drought and flood prone areas minimizing the inherent uncertainty of the final results the proposed extreme hydrology prone areas map including map coordinates can be exported by local authorities to any scale this information can be publicized by local authorities in the form of posters maps or leaflets raising awareness and stimulating a wider adoption of measures and practices to prevent or mitigate the negative effects of an oncoming drought or flood event in the context of the resilience to climate change the following measures are proposed to reduce the effects of floods and droughts in agricultural tree crop areas salazar et al 2009 palese et al 2014 xiloyannis et al 2016 kourgialas and karatzas 2016 2017 turner et al 2016 koubouris et al 2017 kourgialas et al 2018a 2018b 4 1 tree crops measures to enhance flood resistance in the semi mountainous regions many studies point out the particularly important role of proper management of agricultural land at both parcel and river basin scale to improve the resilience to floods simple practices in the sloping semi mountainous areas can aid to prevent the flooding of the downstream agriculture areas by increasing soil water storage and reducing surface runoff these practices include the conservation of weeds in the winter period non tillage proper grazing management as well as the introduction of natural barriers terraces at strategically selected locations to minimize soil erosion and improve water retention it is also important to emphasize the need for these practices to be implemented on a large spatial scale catchment level in tree crops there are two types of flood damage a direct damage which is related to the losses of agricultural land and whole trees due to landslides at riverside and sloping areas and b indirect damages which are related to the fact that trees may be covered by flood waters for several days indirect damages can occur in water logged lands with low soil water infiltration rates and or poor soil drainage systems moderate flood tolerant trees such as citrus can survive in flooded conditions for several days but the stress of wet conditions may reduce fruit production plant growth while root disease may result in tree damage or death the above damage is even more pronounced in flood sensitive crops such as avocado and olive trees in these crops and especially in avocado trees conditions of complete soil saturation even for a few days can lead to their death it is noted that the flood sensitivity of the above crops depends on the growing season flooding during the growing season is much more harmful than during the dormant season the age of the plants seedling or over mature trees are generally more susceptible to flooding than mature trees and the rootstocks tolerance to the saturated conditions based on the above in flood prone tree crop areas where water accumulation is favored drainage systems should be installed in crete as well as in many mediterranean areas drainage systems are not so widespread but in the context of climate change for the sustainability of flood sensitive tree crops areas such interventions are one way 4 2 tree crops measures to enhance drought resistance sustainable farming practices that ensure water efficiency in drought prone tree crop areas can be the reduction of evapotranspiration during the summer period by suitable summer pruning the application of mowed weed and pruning residues on the soil surface shredding healthy pruned tree branches and also the application of spray formulations for reducing the overall transpiration on the other hand during the winter period no weed control is recommended for increasing soil water storage also another crucial measure concerns the reduction of water and nutrients losses below the root zone due to deep percolation which can be achieved by increasing the soil organic matter content and using fertigation in the summer period and rational fertilization in the winter period also apart from the annual maintenance of irrigation network the irrigation should be done based on the appropriate meteorological soil moisture data the soil type the age of each tree crop species as well as the time of the previous irrigation application additionally in tree crop areas with limited water supplies the following measures should be investigated a irrigation only at critical stages of plant growth deficit irrigation b reuse of treated water for irrigation based on the applicable legislation in addition in mediterranean agricultural coastal areas where a salt water intrusion is observed salt water irrigation management plan should be proposed based on pumping optimization and the right irrigation dose and time considering the soil type the water chloride concentration as well as the age of each tree crop c the choice of tree crops that are more tolerant to environmental stress or extreme climate conditions for instance heritage tree crop varieties are recommended as more drought or salt resilient crops ensuring yield stability at the same time 5 conclusions the aim of this study was to investigate the extreme hydrology years for the past six decades in one of the most intensive tree cultivation areas of crete in greece this region is considered one of the most essential agricultural and touristic areas of the mediterranean region and at the same time it is one of the most prone to hydrological extremes drought flood regions based on spi analysis which was held for the studied meteorological stations and for the period from 1960 to 2019 useful remarks were obtained regarding the occurrence of extreme hydrological phenomena water defect and floods for the first three decades 1960 1990 the hydrological conditions could be characterized as near normal or moderately wet dry however for the following three decades the droughts as well as flood events were remarkable increasing in magnitude and frequency this remark comes to confirm the many flood events which appeared in the specific period in the study area especially 2019 causing extended damages in agriculture and infrastructures on the other hand in this period significant droughts were observed and led to noteworthy reduction of water resources in several tree crops areas of the study area according to spi analysis for all the studied meteorological stations the hydroclimatic trend line for spi values through the time period from 1960 to 2019 shows slight decrease indicating more intense dry periods for the next decades this fact seems to be more intense in semi mountainous areas which are dominated by olive tree cultivations also in this study an integrated approach named spisers to estimate both drought and food prone areas that considers variables related to the terrestrial branch of the hydrological cycle was presented and validated using historical data from drought and flood affected areas based on the results 8 70 of the studied tree crops area is characterized as prone to drought while 15 97 of the total tree crop region is considered as prone to floods moreover drought vulnerability is more severe in the central and southern part of the region while many coastal and western parts as well as river flood plain zones are significant flood prone areas a notable part of the proposed methodology is the suggestion of tree crop measures to enhance resistance under hydrological extremes this information can act as a demonstrator of tailored solutions raise awareness and stimulate a wider adoption of practices in the agricultural sector in order to mitigate oncoming climate change effects declaration of

4742,many studies have used data from climate models such as global climate models gcms and regional climate models rcms to predict the future impact of climate change however a bias exists between simulated climate model data and observed data therefore various bias correction methods have been developed to reduce this imbalance the quantile mapping qm method is one of the most widely used approaches worldwide however the qm method does not account for the relative change in the raw data since bias correction is only performed on observed data to solve this problem the detrended quantile mapping dqm and quantile delta mapping qdm methods were developed to consider the relative changes in the raw data generally the qm method is performed assuming that the statistical characteristics are the same when using cumulative density functions cdfs obtained from climate models and observations however the general qm or qdm method is performed using daily data and thus the outcome may be slightly different from the quantiles of observed data in the statistical analysis of extreme data this difference can lead to distortions when estimating relative changes in rainfall quantiles herein the regional quantile delta mapping rqdm method for bias correction which can solve the problems of the qdm method was proposed additionally evaluations were performed for the rqdm and existing qdm methods using several statistical approaches for a historical period s0 1979 2005 the results revealed that the rqdm method was similarly corrected to the observed results than the qdm method and produced more appropriate outcomes based on statistical evaluations moreover the rqdm method showed a well preserved relative changes in rainfall quantiles of the raw data unlike the qdm method thus it was found that the proposed rqdm method showed more robust results than the conventional qdm method keywords regional climate model bias correction quantile delta mapping regional quantile delta mapping regional frequency analysis 1 introduction climate change presents a monumental challenge that needs to be overcome many studies have shown that natural disasters are influenced by extreme rainfall events caused by climate change fowler and kilsby 2003 guhathakurata et al 2011 wasko and nathan 2019 westra et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 moreover recently there have been yearly occurrences of natural disasters that have caused severe damage around the world ashcroft et al 2019 fiori et al 2014 manton et al 2001 mason et al 1999 merz et al 2014 smit et al 2000 ulbrich et al 2003 vu and mishra 2019 hirabayashi et al 2013 projected changes in flood patterns on a global scale and demonstrated the need for appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies against climate change worldwide additionally hettiarachchi et al 2019 demonstrated that antecedent moisture conditions or initial conditions could significantly impact flood response during storm events even in urban developed catchments south korea has also experienced the havoc and losses incurred annually due to the natural disasters in typhoons and rainy seasons jung et al 2011 kim and jain 2011 kwon et

by extreme rainfall especially in 2013 about 92 of the total was caused by extreme rainfall and the damage in 2013 has 30 of the total 10 year disaster national disaster safety portal http safekorea

lee and park 2017 seo et al 2015 so et al 2017 sung et al 2018 therefore it is vital to understand the changes and impacts of extreme rainfall for river planning policies and infrastructure design for flood protection many researchers have employed computer based numerical simulations to understand and predict hydrological cycles scientifically harding et al 2011 hoffmann et al 2000 rind et al 1992 stassen et al 2019 the hydrological cycle is a crucial component of the global climate system transporting and distributing the water on the earth recently various global climate models gcms also known as general circulation models and regional climate models rcms have been developed to predict the change in future hydrological cycles due to climate change however raw data of climate model gcm or rcm data include systematic bias compared with actual observed data it is not easy to address this bias within the climate model and it should be corrected after the simulation much research has been conducted to overcome this bias and various techniques have been continually developed cannon 2018 cannon et al 2015 christensen et al 2008 grillakis et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2012 guo et al 2019 lakshmanan et al 2015 maraun 2013 maurer and pierce 2014 moon et al 2013 piani et al 2009 srivastav et al 2014 watanabe et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 nowadays bias correction is among the procedures used in climate change research the quantile mapping qm method is one of the most widely used techniques for correcting the bias between simulated and observed data and is employed in an array of methodologies kim et al 2016 maraun 2013 ngai et al 2017 park et al 2012 rajczak et al 2016 reiter et al 2018 ringard et al 2017 thrasher et al 2012 however there are some drawbacks to utilizing the qm method for instance it fails to consider the variability of the raw data that are used in climate change scenarios additionally the simulated data are corrected only for the observational data regardless of the trend or variation implicit in the original data several studies have been conducted to overcome the problems in the qm method bürger et al 2013 cannon 2018 cannon et al 2015 eum and cannon 2017 mehrotra and sharma 2016 um et al 2016 bürger et al 2013 proposed the detrended quantile mapping dqm method as a statistical downscaling technique that can maintain long term trends in simulated data later cannon et al 2015 proposed the quantile delta mapping qdm method which directly reflects the difference between historical and future climate scenario data eum and cannon 2017 presented the spatial disaggregation with quantile delta mapping sdqdm method which combines the qdm method and a spatial disaggregation approach meanwhile mehrotra and sharma 2016 proposed the multivariate recursive quantile nesting bias correction mrqnbc approach with auto and cross dependence attributes across multiple time scales um et al 2016 proposed a hybrid approach based on the qm method with the gamma and generalized extreme value gev distributions they demonstrated that the bias in extreme rainfall data was appropriately corrected for the statistical characteristics of the annual maximum am series kim et al 2019a kim et al 2019b reported that the am data were better than the daily data for bias correction to simulate the statistical characteristics of extreme rainfall quantiles in south korea however when using am data the result of the qm method could be distorted depending on the length of the observational data even if the qm method was directly corrected based on the observational data kim et al 2019a kim et al 2019b presented a review of detailed procedures and approaches for the qm method using am rainfall data additionally srivastav et al 2014 used am rainfall data for bias correction and generated future intensity duration frequency idf curves therefore in the present study am rainfall data were extracted for bias correction and the estimation of rainfall quantiles statistical methods in the field of hydrology have been developed to scientifically overcome major disasters caused by extreme events the frequency analysis method allows the statistical analysis of hydrological data and is applied to determine the design criteria of infrastructure this methodology has been continuously developed including for nonstationary issues each country selects and uses an appropriate methodology to conduct frequency analysis in south korea rainfall quantiles have been estimated using at site frequency analysis gumbel distribution with the probability weighted moments method in the report of the ministry of land transport and maritime affairs mltma 2012 however a project was recently conducted to estimate flood quantiles in south korea as a result of this project the korean ministry of environment moe published the standard guidelines on flood estimation moe 2019 which is now practically used in south korea to estimate rainfall quantile for design flood in this guideline regional frequency analysis rfa was performed by dividing 615 sites into 26 regions the aim of rfa is to estimate the extreme quantile at sites for which little or no hydrological data are available the description of the sub regions and the regional quantile estimation are the two main steps of the rfa wazneh et al 2015 hosking and wallis 1997 presented various methods of cluster analysis for classifying homogeneous regions and hosking 1996 implemented the k means algorithm of hartigan 1975 in the rfa therefore the k means method has been employed for regional classification in many studies kjeldsen et al 2002 saf 2009 yoo et al 2012 furthermore the moe moe 2019 demonstrated the optimal regional classification for extreme precipitation in south korea using the k means method and monte carlo simulation moreover many studies have been conducted to improve the existing clustering method e g han et al 2020 wazneh et al 2015 this study proposes a new quantile mapping method for am rainfall data to overcome the problems that can occur in the current qdm method therefore the regional quantile delta mapping rqdm method was developed for the bias correction of am rainfall data moreover the suitability of the new bias correction method was compared for each projection period by comparing the relative changes of extreme rainfall in raw data between the present and different future periods thereby we examined whether the characteristics of the raw am rainfall data are preserved when bias correction is performed by applying an existing method qdm and a new method rqdm finally we predicted the impact of future climate change on the korean peninsula using the results of the rqdm method the climate change factor ccf was calculated and spatially presented to predict the future change of rainfall quantiles in south korea 2 study area and rainfall data 2 1 study area the korean peninsula is located in east asia at the northeastern tip of the eurasian continent it has four distinct seasons with a cold and warm climate and rainfall is mostly concentrated in summer south korea the research area is situated at longitudes of 124 132 e and latitudes of 33 43 n fig 1 shows the location of the observation sites employed herein and covers the entire area of south korea a total of 26 regions were divided for the estimation of rainfall quantiles using the k means method as shown in fig 1 2 2 observed and simulated rainfall data the observed rainfall data were obtained from 615 sites from the korea meteorological administration kma the korea water resources corporation k water and the moe the record lengths of rainfall data are generally from 1961 to 2017 however they differ for each site the data were obtained from the water resources management information system wamis http www wamis go kr generally the simulation data used in climate change research refer to various climate variables from climate models gcms or rcms which produce the separated grid data by numerical simulations these distinguish gcms from rcms depending on the boundary range global or specific region gcm data are a useful tool for assessing the potential future response of climate variables to changing climatic conditions the gcm typically has a spatial resolution in the range of 100 300 km this spatial resolution is a limiting factor for assessing the impact of climate change on a regional scale rcms have been developed to overcome such shortcomings and many hydrological studies of climate change have been conducted using rcm data for many countries rcms with grid sizes of tens of kilometers provide an opportunity to understand climatic impacts on a regional scale several gcms have been developed by various institutions and researchers around the world to predict climate change additionally many rcms have been developed in consideration of local characteristics selecting the appropriate climate model for analyses is essential and the observed data are used for evaluating simulation performance various types of climate model data can be used to predict the future changes however the future projection has a different result depending on which climate model is selected the purpose of this study is to compare bias correction methods rather than climate models collins et al 2008 confirmed the excellent simulation performance of the hadgem2 ao climate model by comparing the results with those of other similar climate models specifically hadgem2 ao showed outstanding performance in east asia and the pacific rim including the korean peninsula these results were reflected in research on rcms conducted by the kma and the cordex ea coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment east asia group for the future climate change projection based on data from the hadgem2 ao climate model the kma and the national institute of meteorological science nimr used the hadgem3 ra rcm 12 5 km spatial resolution climate model data to simulate the climate variables temperature precipitation humidity wind speed etc using four rcp representative concentration pathways scenarios rcp2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 and the hadgem2 ao gcm 135 km spatial resolution model additionally the kma published a climate change forecast report kma 2018 based on simulations using the hadgem3 ra model according to the 400 year integral experiment for the korean peninsula and south korea meanwhile kim et al 2019a kim et al 2019b reported that the hadgem3 ra model appropriately simulated the statistical characteristics mean variance skewness and kurtosis of am rainfall data by comparison with observed data from 19 climate models the hadgem3 ra climate model which was developed by the kma has been the most commonly used model in south korea since it sufficiently demonstrates the statistical characteristics between simulation and observational data therefore based on the results of kma 2018 and kim et al 2019a kim et al 2019b the hadgem3 ra model was chosen for bias correction in the present study the simulated rainfall data were extracted for 615 sites from the hadgem3 ra climate model provided in the climate information portal http www climate go kr in this study the simulated data were divided into the historical period s0 1979 2005 and future periods s1 2011 2040 s2 2041 2070 and s3 2071 2100 3 methodology 3 1 procedure of methodology because the main objective is the estimation of future rainfall quantile based on climate change scenarios the bias correction was conducted using am data fig 2 represents the procedure of methodology moe 2019 suggested the use of rfa with gev fitted by l moments method for estimation of rainfall quantiles in south korea therefore the same methodology and procedure which was suggested by moe 2019 are adopted in this study for fitting marginal distribution and estimating quantiles the brief description of gev distribution quantile mapping method quantile delta mapping method and regional frequency analysis are presented in following subsections at the last subsection of the current section the regional quantile delta mapping method is described 3 2 generalized extreme value gev distribution the gev distribution is one of most widely used models for frequency analysis the probability density function pdf and cumulative probability function cdf of the gev distribution are given as follows nerc 1975 1 f x 1 α 1 β x x 0 α 1 β 1 e x p 1 β x x 0 α 1 β 2 f x e x p 1 β x x 0 α 1 β where x 0 α and β are the location scale and shape parameters respectively these parameters can be estimated using various estimation techniques such as the maximum likelihood ml method of moments mom and l moments methods wilks 2011 reported that the results of both the ml and l moments methods were often similar for large or medium sample sizes however also found that the l moments method generally resulted in better estimates than the ml method 3 3 quantile mapping method the qm bias correction algorithms are commonly used for the modification of the bias between observational data and climate model output data lee and singh 2018 maraun 2013 the basic concept of the qm method is to use the same cdf for the simulated and observed data sets the general equation of the qm method can be defined as follows 3 x m p t f o h 1 f m h x m p t where x m p t is the model simulated data at time t of the projected period and f m h and f o h 1 are the cdf of the raw data of the rcm model and the inverse cdf of the observed data respectively 3 4 quantile delta mapping method the qdm method was developed to preserve the relative change ratio in the modeled quantiles of variables cannon et al 2015 the basic equation of the qdm method comprises the bias corrected value term obtained from the observational data and the relative change term delta obtained from the model data as defined in eq 4 4 x m p t x o m h p t δ m t 5 x o m h p t f o h 1 f m p t x m p t 6 δ m t x m p t f m h 1 f m p t x m p t where the variable used for bias correction means am data in this study x o m h p t is the bias corrected data for the historical period and δ m t is the relative change in the model data between the historical and future periods thus the bias corrected future projection at time t is given by multiplying the relative change δ m t by the historical bias corrected value x o m h p t is the bias corrected value of the observed data for the historical period s0 and has the same value for the s0 period as defined in eq 3 therefore in this paper the qdm is expressed as qm since the delta term is not applied in the s0 period the relative change term δ m t is defined as x m p t simulated raw data divided by f m h 1 f m p t x m p t percentile value from historical cdf corresponding to the percentile of x m p t this δ m t term preserves the relative change ratio of the simulated raw data in each period s1 s2 and s3 and is an essential element for the qdm method 3 5 regional frequency analysis in frequency analysis the sampling error depends on the length of rainfall data at the observation site and is directly related to the reliability of the frequency analysis result additionally this result is valid only at the site where the data were used for frequency analysis to overcome this limitation rfa was developed for quantile estimation such that it could be representative of an entire region the primary purpose of rfa is to improve the accuracy of the estimated quantiles using the pooled data since the uncertainty decreases as the length of the observational data increases this approach has been widely used worldwide several studies have demonstrated the higher accuracy of rfa compared to at site frequency analysis heo 2016 hosking and wallis 1997 the index flood method ifm is the most representative method used in rfa this method was originally proposed by dalrymple 1960 was revived by wallis 1980 and was then established by hosking and wallis 1997 the procedure of the ifm suggested by hosking and wallis 1997 entails the following four steps to conduct rfa 1 data verification and supplementation using l moments ratio diagram 2 regional classification discordancy and heterogeneity measures 3 selection of an appropriate frequency distribution goodness of fit measure 4 accuracy assessment in the quantile estimation monte carlo simulation herein rfa was applied to estimate the rainfall quantiles and then the estimates of each bias correction method were compared 3 6 regional quantile delta mapping method in this study the rqdm method was developed by combining the qdm method and the ifm approach the method and procedure of the rqdm method are the same as those for the qdm method except that the bias is corrected for each region using rfa in other words the bias corrected value term obtained from the observed data and the delta term obtained from the model data were also determined for each region as defined in eq 7 7 x m p r t x o m h p r t δ m r t 8 x o m h p r t f o h 1 r f m p t r x m p r t x o h t 9 δ m r t x m p r t f m h 1 r f m p t r x m p r t where the variable used for bias correction means am data in this study x m p r t represents the result of the bias corrected data using the rqdm method and the subscript r refers to the regionally pooled data when performing the rqdm method for each region standardized values obtained by dividing the am rainfall data by the mean at each site were used in eq 8 x o m h p r t represents the bias corrected data for the historical period s0 and also represents the rqm as mentioned above x o h t represents the mean value of each site δ m r t is the delta term for future periods s1 s2 and s3 calculated for each region r f o h 1 r represents the inverse cdf of the observed data and f m p t r represents the cdf of the simulated data the rqdm method was performed according to the following steps 1 grouping of sites into a homogeneous region r 2 extraction and indexing of the am data from the observed data and the rcm for rfa 3 application of the regional bias correction method 4 estimation of the regional rainfall quantiles in the first step all the sites were divided into homogeneous regions using proper cluster analysis hosking and wallis 1997 here 615 rainfall sites were divided into 26 homogeneous regions as illustrated in fig 1 moe 2019 in the second step the daily rainfall data were collected from the rcm hadgem3 ra model and observations at all sites from which the am data were then extracted in the rcm model the am data were selected for bias correction as the bias correction obtained from the am data is more appropriate than that obtained from the daily data kim et al 2019a 2019b then the am data at each site in a region were indexed its own mean value for rfa the indexed data r ij k at site j in region k are given by 10 r ij k r ij k r j k where i 1 n j j 1 n k k 1 26 n j is the sample size at site j n k is the number of sites in region k and k is the number of regions in the third step the indexed data were pooled in each region and the rqm for s0 and rqdm for s1 s2 and s3 methods were applied to the data the bias correction and the relative error delta term are performed with pooled data by each region and it could be similar to the concept of the ifm mentioned above the detailed concept is summarized in section 4 1 comparison of each method as an example involved in chapter 4 application and results in the final step the bias corrected data were used for rfa and the regional rainfall quantiles were estimated by applying the same procedure and method as those used in the case of the observed data hosking and wallis 1997 herein the gev distribution was selected as an appropriate probability model based on the l moments method for 26 regions 4 application and results 4 1 comparison of each method as an example fig 3 shows a comparison between the traditional qm method and the rqm method for the historical period s0 fig 3 a depicts the results of the bias correction using the traditional qm method in region 7 the observed data are indicated by the black lines raw data by the green lines and bias corrected data by the blue lines region 7 comprised 27 rainfall sites and the qm method was conducted at each site 27 times as depicted in fig 3 a however the rqm or rqdm method proposed in this study is represented by one set of data red line as depicted in fig 3 b since the pooled data in region 7 were used for bias correction as depicted in fig 3 a outliers may occur in the bias corrected results depending on the statistical characteristics of the observed and model data while performing the qm or qdm method at each site whereas the rqm method exhibits a highly similar cdf particularly for large return periods as an example fig 4 depicts the results of the bias correction at the yangpyeong gun site cheongun myeon office 10074040 which exhibits the largest cdf value in fig 3 a in fig 4 the maximum value of the observed am data is 377 mm mean 173 7 mm and that of the rcm raw data is 334 mm mean 117 5 mm the results of the bias correction using each method reveal that the maximum value of the qm method is 458 0 mm mean 175 1 mm which is approximately 21 5 greater than the observed value in contrast the maximum value of the rqm method is 421 1 mm mean 173 7 mm which is approximately 11 7 greater than the observed value this result indicates that the bias corrected value obtained from the qm method is relatively larger than that obtained from the observed data which may have a significant effect on the frequency analysis 4 2 performance of the rqm method for historical period s0 a statistical evaluation was performed for the results of the observed and model data several commonly used metrics were used to evaluate the performances of the bias correction techniques the correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse rmse observations standard deviation ratio sdr mean absolute error mae mean square error mse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and relative bias rbias these methods and their equations are listed in table 1 the result of the bias correction can be evaluated using the actual observed rainfall data herein the bias correction was performed using the qm and rqm methods for the historical period s0 1979 2005 and the rainfall quantile was estimated and compared using the aforementioned rfa method first we focus on the results of the historical period s0 obtained for all 26 regions in this study table 2 presents the average relative errors of the 615 sites for each return period and the historical period s0 1979 2005 compared to the observed am data the rainfall quantiles obtained using raw am data before quantile mapping for each return period were underestimated by 14 17 33 99 at the 615 sites in this case the average errors decreased as the return period increased this entails that the rainfall quantiles of the raw am data from the hadgem3 ra climate model were smaller than those of the observed data for the 615 sites the qm method was applied and the results showed average errors of 2 11 to 0 70 compared to the observed data on the other hand the rqm method showed average errors of 0 12 0 28 which is much smaller than those from the raw data and the qm method the average errors of the rqm method decreased as the return period surpassed 5 years while the qm method showed contrasting trends fig 5 shows the statistical performances of each bias correction method compared to the observed data for the historical period s0 in fig 5 the green line represents the raw am data before the bias correction and the black line is the result of the at site frequency analysis asfa using the observed data the blue line is the result using the existing qm method while the red line is the result of the rqm method proposed herein note that the delta term which represents the relative change in the raw am data was not taken into account for each bias correction method since this did not need to be considered for the historical period s0 therefore the notations of the qm and rqm for the historical period s0 are the same as those of the qdm and rqdm for the future periods s1 s2 and s3 in fig 5 respectively based on the statistical tests the rqm method generally showed very similar results to the conventional qm method such as the r mae and nse however for the other statistical metrics the results were not similar the rqm method proposed in this paper showed a slightly better performance than the qm method for large return periods based on the means of the rmse and the sdr shown in fig 5 b and c respectively additionally the rbiass of the rqm method were approximately zero while those of the qm method and asfa increased as the return period increased this means that when performing rfa using the results of the rqm method there is relatively low uncertainty compared to other methods 4 3 performance of the bias correction method in cross validation the purpose of cross validation is to generalize the performance evaluation of the model there are several methods to perform cross validation the k fold cross validation method is one of the most commonly used methods for the validation with the data set divided into practice and training nguyen et al 2017 applied the k fold cross validation approach to evaluate the performance of the bias correction method with two indicators mae and rmse in this study four statistics mean standard deviation skewness and kurtosis of the corrected am data were calculated for the entire s0 1979 2005 period which was assumed to be the true value the validation data sets were resampled from the whole data sets and divided the sample data into three parts each data set includes two parts for the training and one part for the validation the mae and rmse between the statistics of am from the whole data and validation data sets were calculated to evaluate the qm and rqm table 3 presents the mae and rmse results of each bias correction method qm and rqm in cross validation as shown in table 3 the rmse and mae values for the rqm method are lower than those for the qm method in particular the rqm method shows better performance for all statistics the mean differences between the qm and rqm methods for rmse and mae were 0 2 and 0 1 respectively moreover for the remaining three statistics standard deviation skewness kurtosis the values for rqm were lower than those for qm this result shows that the rqm method can provide a more stable and robust result than the traditional qm method 4 4 comparison of rainfall quantiles cannon et al 2015 quantitatively analyzed the relative changes in gcm data using the qm dqm and qdm methods they reported that the relative trend of the qm method could be inflated in precipitation extreme indices whereas the dqm and qdm methods were less sensitive in this regard the robustness of the qdm method was demonstrated by the research of cannon et al 2015 in this section we focus on the qdm and rqdm bias correction methods that are conducted for comparison with the bias corrected am rainfall data fig 6 shows bar plots of the regional absolute errors for the 26 regions the figure represents the difference between the relative changes for each period of the raw data by region and the results of each bias correction method the qdm results are presented as blue bar plots and the rqdm results are presented as red bar plots the error of rqdm was lower than that of qdm in the 20 regions in fig 6 a 15 regions in fig 6 b and 22 regions in fig 6 c additionally the rqdm result was lower than the qdm result in the 16 regions in fig 6 d the 16 regions in fig 6 e and the 19 regions in fig 6 f this means that the results of the rqdm were similar to the relative changes of the existing raw data in most of the 26 regions and demonstrated the good preservation of the statistical characteristics of the raw data fig 7 represents the spatial distribution of regional absolute errors as a contour map the contour map was produced using the regional center point in fig 1 the range of the contour map is between 0 green and 12 red the green color represents the case when the bias correction result is similar to the relative changes of the raw data while the red color represents the opposite case thus the green color indicates that the bias correction method successfully preserves the change information in the raw data set while the red color indicates that the bias correction method distorts the change information fig 7 displays the spatial error distribution of the qm method showing significant differences in parts of the southern coast of korea and the rqm method showed that the lower error in spatial distribution than the qm method fig 8 shows box plots of the mean values of the relative changes from the 615 sites for future periods s1 s2 and s3 the columns represent raw data the qdm method and the rqdm method respectively we confirmed that the rqdm method preserves the statistical characteristics of the raw am rainfall data for all future periods and scenarios in particular the qdm method revealed greater relative changes than the rqdm method compared to the raw data especially for period s3 and the rcp 8 5 scenario however it was discovered that these differences were insignificant with respect to the mean relative changes of the rqdm method except in the case of s3 s0 for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in fig 8 c and f 4 5 spatial distribution of climate change factors using the rqdm method for future periods we can predict future climate change and proactively address the associated risks by estimating rainfall quantiles based on climate change scenario data the ccf was calculated using the rainfall quantiles for each period s0 s1 s2 and s3 and the return period t as an example the national hydraulic research institute of malaysia nahrim 2013 used ccf to quantify the effects of future climate change and the ccf is as follows 11 ccf i t r si t r s 0 t where ccf i t represents the ccf for a given return period t and the future period si i 1 2 a n d 3 r s 0 t represent the rainfall quantile for the historical period s0 and r si t is the rainfall quantile for future periods fig 9 represents the ccfs of the 100 year return period for the future periods s1 s2 and s3 compared to the period s0 the rainfall quantiles 100 year return period based on the rqdm method were estimated for each period and fig 9 a b and c represent the rcp 4 5 scenario fig 9 d e and f show the results of the rcp 8 5 scenario for the rcp 4 5 scenario the ccf 1 for the s1 period in fig 9 a slightly increased around the southwestern coastal areas and part of the east coast additionally the remaining areas were possibly similar to or less than the s0 period in fig 9 b the ccf 2 increased in all regions and was expected to increase by 25 30 especially in the southwestern and western coastal areas in fig 9 c the ccf 3 increased by approximately 35 especially in the southwestern area for the rcp 8 5 scenario and s1 period in fig 9 d the ccf 1 increased by approximately 30 in the southwestern coastal areas while the northern area showed a decrease for the s2 period in fig 9 e the ccf 2 increased by approximately 15 similar to that shown in fig 9 a southern area and part of the east coast for the s3 period in fig 9 f the largest increase for all scenarios and periods was 40 45 around the southern coast and southwestern area 5 conclusions herein we proposed a new regional bias correction method rqdm to estimate extreme rainfall quantiles using the rfa method we used simulated data 1979 2100 from the hadgem3 ra climate model to illustrate the performance of the bias correction methods although numerous bias correction methods exist e g cannon et al 2015 eum and cannon 2017 maraun 2013 most methods based on daily data may be inappropriate for estimating extreme rainfall quantiles therefore we suggested a new bias correction method which is applicable to extreme rainfall data for quantile estimation the new rqdm method combines two techniques namely quantile delta mapping and regional frequency analysis the conclusions are summarized as follows a comparison between the qdm and rqdm methods showed that the bias correction error of the rqm method was smaller than that of the qm method for the historical period s0 in particular the rqm method proposed herein showed a slightly better performance than the qm method for large return periods in the results of the rmse and rsd additionally the rbias of the rqm method was approximately zero which means that this method has relatively low uncertainty compared to other methods furthermore with the rqdm method the relative changes of raw for the future periods s1 s2 and s3 were more well preserved than with the qdm method in particular when comparing the relative changes of the raw data using regional absolute errors the rqdm method obtained average regional absolute errors of 0 3846 s1 s0 0 7658 s2 s0 and 0 6008 s3 s0 in the rcp 4 5 scenario while the qdm method achieved values of 1 1492 s1 s0 1 2380 s2 s0 and 1 6271 s3 s0 for the future periods moreover in the rcp 8 5 scenario the rqdm method obtained average errors of 0 6637 s1 s0 0 6625 s2 s0 and 0 9321 s3 s0 which are superior to those achieved using the qdm method finally it was found that the rqdm method proposed herein generally showed more robust results than the conventional qdm method additionally we applied the rqdm method to calculate the ccf for the future periods s1 s2 and s3 in south korea as a result of estimating rainfall quantiles using rfa it was found that the largest increase approximately 45 occurred in the southwestern area for the s3 2071 2100 period and the rcp 8 5 scenario the remaining scenarios and periods were also shown to increase mainly in the southwestern area and part of the east coast finally the rqdm method is a new method to supplement for problems that may occur when performing the qdm method using am data for each site when the length of observation data is too short or there are outliers problems that may occur in the quantile mapping process can be improved by bias correction using regional cdf values furthermore the rqdm method shows a robust result in estimating extreme rainfall than the conventional qdm method credit authorship

4742,many studies have used data from climate models such as global climate models gcms and regional climate models rcms to predict the future impact of climate change however a bias exists between simulated climate model data and observed data therefore various bias correction methods have been developed to reduce this imbalance the quantile mapping qm method is one of the most widely used approaches worldwide however the qm method does not account for the relative change in the raw data since bias correction is only performed on observed data to solve this problem the detrended quantile mapping dqm and quantile delta mapping qdm methods were developed to consider the relative changes in the raw data generally the qm method is performed assuming that the statistical characteristics are the same when using cumulative density functions cdfs obtained from climate models and observations however the general qm or qdm method is performed using daily data and thus the outcome may be slightly different from the quantiles of observed data in the statistical analysis of extreme data this difference can lead to distortions when estimating relative changes in rainfall quantiles herein the regional quantile delta mapping rqdm method for bias correction which can solve the problems of the qdm method was proposed additionally evaluations were performed for the rqdm and existing qdm methods using several statistical approaches for a historical period s0 1979 2005 the results revealed that the rqdm method was similarly corrected to the observed results than the qdm method and produced more appropriate outcomes based on statistical evaluations moreover the rqdm method showed a well preserved relative changes in rainfall quantiles of the raw data unlike the qdm method thus it was found that the proposed rqdm method showed more robust results than the conventional qdm method keywords regional climate model bias correction quantile delta mapping regional quantile delta mapping regional frequency analysis 1 introduction climate change presents a monumental challenge that needs to be overcome many studies have shown that natural disasters are influenced by extreme rainfall events caused by climate change fowler and kilsby 2003 guhathakurata et al 2011 wasko and nathan 2019 westra et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 moreover recently there have been yearly occurrences of natural disasters that have caused severe damage around the world ashcroft et al 2019 fiori et al 2014 manton et al 2001 mason et al 1999 merz et al 2014 smit et al 2000 ulbrich et al 2003 vu and mishra 2019 hirabayashi et al 2013 projected changes in flood patterns on a global scale and demonstrated the need for appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies against climate change worldwide additionally hettiarachchi et al 2019 demonstrated that antecedent moisture conditions or initial conditions could significantly impact flood response during storm events even in urban developed catchments south korea has also experienced the havoc and losses incurred annually due to the natural disasters in typhoons and rainy seasons jung et al 2011 kim and jain 2011 kwon et al 2008 lee et al 2018 extreme rainfall directly causes damage according to disaster statistics in south korea for the last 10 years 2009 2018 approximately 50 of the total disaster damage was caused by extreme rainfall especially in 2013 about 92 of the total was caused by extreme rainfall and the damage in 2013 has 30 of the total 10 year disaster national disaster safety portal http safekorea go kr various studies using climate change scenarios have been conducted to prevent disasters caused by rainfall bae et al 2011 boo et al 2006 2004 kim et al 2007 kwon et al 2019 lee et al 2017 2016 lee and park 2017 seo et al 2015 so et al 2017 sung et al 2018 therefore it is vital to understand the changes and impacts of extreme rainfall for river planning policies and infrastructure design for flood protection many researchers have employed computer based numerical simulations to understand and predict hydrological cycles scientifically harding et al 2011 hoffmann et al 2000 rind et al 1992 stassen et al 2019 the hydrological cycle is a crucial component of the global climate system transporting and distributing the water on the earth recently various global climate models gcms also known as general circulation models and regional climate models rcms have been developed to predict the change in future hydrological cycles due to climate change however raw data of climate model gcm or rcm data include systematic bias compared with actual observed data it is not easy to address this bias within the climate model and it should be corrected after the simulation much research has been conducted to overcome this bias and various techniques have been continually developed cannon 2018 cannon et al 2015 christensen et al 2008 grillakis et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2012 guo et al 2019 lakshmanan et al 2015 maraun 2013 maurer and pierce 2014 moon et al 2013 piani et al 2009 srivastav et al 2014 watanabe et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 nowadays bias correction is among the procedures used in climate change research the quantile mapping qm method is one of the most widely used techniques for correcting the bias between simulated and observed data and is employed in an array of methodologies kim et al 2016 maraun 2013 ngai et al 2017 park et al 2012 rajczak et al 2016 reiter et al 2018 ringard et al 2017 thrasher et al 2012 however there are some drawbacks to utilizing the qm method for instance it fails to consider the variability of the raw data that are used in climate change scenarios additionally the simulated data are corrected only for the observational data regardless of the trend or variation implicit in the original data several studies have been conducted to overcome the problems in the qm method bürger et al 2013 cannon 2018 cannon et al 2015 eum and cannon 2017 mehrotra and sharma 2016 um et al 2016 bürger et al 2013 proposed the detrended quantile mapping dqm method as a statistical downscaling technique that can maintain long term trends in simulated data later cannon et al 2015 proposed the quantile delta mapping qdm method which directly reflects the difference between historical and future climate scenario data eum and cannon 2017 presented the spatial disaggregation with quantile delta mapping sdqdm method which combines the qdm method and a spatial disaggregation approach meanwhile mehrotra and sharma 2016 proposed the multivariate recursive quantile nesting bias correction mrqnbc approach with auto and cross dependence attributes across multiple time scales um et al 2016 proposed a hybrid approach based on the qm method with the gamma and generalized extreme value gev distributions they demonstrated that the bias in extreme rainfall data was appropriately corrected for the statistical characteristics of the annual maximum am series kim et al 2019a kim et al 2019b reported that the am data were better than the daily data for bias correction to simulate the statistical characteristics of extreme rainfall quantiles in south korea however when using am data the result of the qm method could be distorted depending on the length of the observational data even if the qm method was directly corrected based on the observational data kim et al 2019a kim et al 2019b presented a review of detailed procedures and approaches for the qm method using am rainfall data additionally srivastav et al 2014 used am rainfall data for bias correction and generated future intensity duration frequency idf curves therefore in the present study am rainfall data were extracted for bias correction and the estimation of rainfall quantiles statistical methods in the field of hydrology have been developed to scientifically overcome major disasters caused by extreme events the frequency analysis method allows the statistical analysis of hydrological data and is applied to determine the design criteria of infrastructure this methodology has been continuously developed including for nonstationary issues each country selects and uses an appropriate methodology to conduct frequency analysis in south korea rainfall quantiles have been estimated using at site frequency analysis gumbel distribution with the probability weighted moments method in the report of the ministry of land transport and maritime affairs mltma 2012 however a project was recently conducted to estimate flood quantiles in south korea as a result of this project the korean ministry of environment moe published the standard guidelines on flood estimation moe 2019 which is now practically used in south korea to estimate rainfall quantile for design flood in this guideline regional frequency analysis rfa was performed by dividing 615 sites into 26 regions the aim of rfa is to estimate the extreme quantile at sites for which little or no hydrological data are available the description of the sub regions and the regional quantile estimation are the two main steps of the rfa wazneh et al 2015 hosking and wallis 1997 presented various methods of cluster analysis for classifying homogeneous regions and hosking 1996 implemented the k means algorithm of hartigan 1975 in the rfa therefore the k means method has been employed for regional classification in many studies kjeldsen et al 2002 saf 2009 yoo et al 2012 furthermore the moe moe 2019 demonstrated the optimal regional classification for extreme precipitation in south korea using the k means method and monte carlo simulation moreover many studies have been conducted to improve the existing clustering method e g han et al 2020 wazneh et al 2015 this study proposes a new quantile mapping method for am rainfall data to overcome the problems that can occur in the current qdm method therefore the regional quantile delta mapping rqdm method was developed for the bias correction of am rainfall data moreover the suitability of the new bias correction method was compared for each projection period by comparing the relative changes of extreme rainfall in raw data between the present and different future periods thereby we examined whether the characteristics of the raw am rainfall data are preserved when bias correction is performed by applying an existing method qdm and a new method rqdm finally we predicted the impact of future climate change on the korean peninsula using the results of the rqdm method the climate change factor ccf was calculated and spatially presented to predict the future change of rainfall quantiles in south korea 2 study area and rainfall data 2 1 study area the korean peninsula is located in east asia at the northeastern tip of the eurasian continent it has four distinct seasons with a cold and warm climate and rainfall is mostly concentrated in summer south korea the research area is situated at longitudes of 124 132 e and latitudes of 33 43 n fig 1 shows the location of the observation sites employed herein and covers the entire area of south korea a total of 26 regions were divided for the estimation of rainfall quantiles using the k means method as shown in fig 1 2 2 observed and simulated rainfall data the observed rainfall data were obtained from 615 sites from the korea meteorological administration kma the korea water resources corporation k water and the moe the record lengths of rainfall data are generally from 1961 to 2017 however they differ for each site the data were obtained from the water resources management information system wamis http www wamis go kr generally the simulation data used in climate change research refer to various climate variables from climate models gcms or rcms which produce the separated grid data by numerical simulations these distinguish gcms from rcms depending on the boundary range global or specific region gcm data are a useful tool for assessing the potential future response of climate variables to changing climatic conditions the gcm typically has a spatial resolution in the range of 100 300 km this spatial resolution is a limiting factor for assessing the impact of climate change on a regional scale rcms have been developed to overcome such shortcomings and many hydrological studies of climate change have been conducted using rcm data for many countries rcms with grid sizes of tens of kilometers provide an opportunity to understand climatic impacts on a regional scale several gcms have been developed by various institutions and researchers around the world to predict climate change additionally many rcms have been developed in consideration of local characteristics selecting the appropriate climate model for analyses is essential and the observed data are used for evaluating simulation performance various types of climate model data can be used to predict the future changes however the future projection has a different result depending on which climate model is selected the purpose of this study is to compare bias correction methods rather than climate models collins et al 2008 confirmed the excellent simulation performance of the hadgem2 ao climate model by comparing the results with those of other similar climate models specifically hadgem2 ao showed outstanding performance in east asia and the pacific rim including the korean peninsula these results were reflected in research on rcms conducted by the kma and the cordex ea coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment east asia group for the future climate change projection based on data from the hadgem2 ao climate model the kma and the national institute of meteorological science nimr used the hadgem3 ra rcm 12 5 km spatial resolution climate model data to simulate the climate variables temperature precipitation humidity wind speed etc using four rcp representative concentration pathways scenarios rcp2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 and the hadgem2 ao gcm 135 km spatial resolution model additionally the kma published a climate change forecast report kma 2018 based on simulations using the hadgem3 ra model according to the 400 year integral experiment for the korean peninsula and south korea meanwhile kim et al 2019a kim et al 2019b reported that the hadgem3 ra model appropriately simulated the statistical characteristics mean variance skewness and kurtosis of am rainfall data by comparison with observed data from 19 climate models the hadgem3 ra climate model which was developed by the kma has been the most commonly used model in south korea since it sufficiently demonstrates the statistical characteristics between simulation and observational data therefore based on the results of kma 2018 and kim et al 2019a kim et al 2019b the hadgem3 ra model was chosen for bias correction in the present study the simulated rainfall data were extracted for 615 sites from the hadgem3 ra climate model provided in the climate information portal http www climate go kr in this study the simulated data were divided into the historical period s0 1979 2005 and future periods s1 2011 2040 s2 2041 2070 and s3 2071 2100 3 methodology 3 1 procedure of methodology because the main objective is the estimation of future rainfall quantile based on climate change scenarios the bias correction was conducted using am data fig 2 represents the procedure of methodology moe 2019 suggested the use of rfa with gev fitted by l moments method for estimation of rainfall quantiles in south korea therefore the same methodology and procedure which was suggested by moe 2019 are adopted in this study for fitting marginal distribution and estimating quantiles the brief description of gev distribution quantile mapping method quantile delta mapping method and regional frequency analysis are presented in following subsections at the last subsection of the current section the regional quantile delta mapping method is described 3 2 generalized extreme value gev distribution the gev distribution is one of most widely used models for frequency analysis the probability density function pdf and cumulative probability function cdf of the gev distribution are given as follows nerc 1975 1 f x 1 α 1 β x x 0 α 1 β 1 e x p 1 β x x 0 α 1 β 2 f x e x p 1 β x x 0 α 1 β where x 0 α and β are the location scale and shape parameters respectively these parameters can be estimated using various estimation techniques such as the maximum likelihood ml method of moments mom and l moments methods wilks 2011 reported that the results of both the ml and l moments methods were often similar for large or medium sample sizes however also found that the l moments method generally resulted in better estimates than the ml method 3 3 quantile mapping method the qm bias correction algorithms are commonly used for the modification of the bias between observational data and climate model output data lee and singh 2018 maraun 2013 the basic concept of the qm method is to use the same cdf for the simulated and observed data sets the general equation of the qm method can be defined as follows 3 x m p t f o h 1 f m h x m p t where x m p t is the model simulated data at time t of the projected period and f m h and f o h 1 are the cdf of the raw data of the rcm model and the inverse cdf of the observed data respectively 3 4 quantile delta mapping method the qdm method was developed to preserve the relative change ratio in the modeled quantiles of variables cannon et al 2015 the basic equation of the qdm method comprises the bias corrected value term obtained from the observational data and the relative change term delta obtained from the model data as defined in eq 4 4 x m p t x o m h p t δ m t 5 x o m h p t f o h 1 f m p t x m p t 6 δ m t x m p t f m h 1 f m p t x m p t where the variable used for bias correction means am data in this study x o m h p t is the bias corrected data for the historical period and δ m t is the relative change in the model data between the historical and future periods thus the bias corrected future projection at time t is given by multiplying the relative change δ m t by the historical bias corrected value x o m h p t is the bias corrected value of the observed data for the historical period s0 and has the same value for the s0 period as defined in eq 3 therefore in this paper the qdm is expressed as qm since the delta term is not applied in the s0 period the relative change term δ m t is defined as x m p t simulated raw data divided by f m h 1 f m p t x m p t percentile value from historical cdf corresponding to the percentile of x m p t this δ m t term preserves the relative change ratio of the simulated raw data in each period s1 s2 and s3 and is an essential element for the qdm method 3 5 regional frequency analysis in frequency analysis the sampling error depends on the length of rainfall data at the observation site and is directly related to the reliability of the frequency analysis result additionally this result is valid only at the site where the data were used for frequency analysis to overcome this limitation rfa was developed for quantile estimation such that it could be representative of an entire region the primary purpose of rfa is to improve the accuracy of the estimated quantiles using the pooled data since the uncertainty decreases as the length of the observational data increases this approach has been widely used worldwide several studies have demonstrated the higher accuracy of rfa compared to at site frequency analysis heo 2016 hosking and wallis 1997 the index flood method ifm is the most representative method used in rfa this method was originally proposed by dalrymple 1960 was revived by wallis 1980 and was then established by hosking and wallis 1997 the procedure of the ifm suggested by hosking and wallis 1997 entails the following four steps to conduct rfa 1 data verification and supplementation using l moments ratio diagram 2 regional classification discordancy and heterogeneity measures 3 selection of an appropriate frequency distribution goodness of fit measure 4 accuracy assessment in the quantile estimation monte carlo simulation herein rfa was applied to estimate the rainfall quantiles and then the estimates of each bias correction method were compared 3 6 regional quantile delta mapping method in this study the rqdm method was developed by combining the qdm method and the ifm approach the method and procedure of the rqdm method are the same as those for the qdm method except that the bias is corrected for each region using rfa in other words the bias corrected value term obtained from the observed data and the delta term obtained from the model data were also determined for each region as defined in eq 7 7 x m p r t x o m h p r t δ m r t 8 x o m h p r t f o h 1 r f m p t r x m p r t x o h t 9 δ m r t x m p r t f m h 1 r f m p t r x m p r t where the variable used for bias correction means am data in this study x m p r t represents the result of the bias corrected data using the rqdm method and the subscript r refers to the regionally pooled data when performing the rqdm method for each region standardized values obtained by dividing the am rainfall data by the mean at each site were used in eq 8 x o m h p r t represents the bias corrected data for the historical period s0 and also represents the rqm as mentioned above x o h t represents the mean value of each site δ m r t is the delta term for future periods s1 s2 and s3 calculated for each region r f o h 1 r represents the inverse cdf of the observed data and f m p t r represents the cdf of the simulated data the rqdm method was performed according to the following steps 1 grouping of sites into a homogeneous region r 2 extraction and indexing of the am data from the observed data and the rcm for rfa 3 application of the regional bias correction method 4 estimation of the regional rainfall quantiles in the first step all the sites were divided into homogeneous regions using proper cluster analysis hosking and wallis 1997 here 615 rainfall sites were divided into 26 homogeneous regions as illustrated in fig 1 moe 2019 in the second step the daily rainfall data were collected from the rcm hadgem3 ra model and observations at all sites from which the am data were then extracted in the rcm model the am data were selected for bias correction as the bias correction obtained from the am data is more appropriate than that obtained from the daily data kim et al 2019a 2019b then the am data at each site in a region were indexed its own mean value for rfa the indexed data r ij k at site j in region k are given by 10 r ij k r ij k r j k where i 1 n j j 1 n k k 1 26 n j is the sample size at site j n k is the number of sites in region k and k is the number of regions in the third step the indexed data were pooled in each region and the rqm for s0 and rqdm for s1 s2 and s3 methods were applied to the data the bias correction and the relative error delta term are performed with pooled data by each region and it could be similar to the concept of the ifm mentioned above the detailed concept is summarized in section 4 1 comparison of each method as an example involved in chapter 4 application and results in the final step the bias corrected data were used for rfa and the regional rainfall quantiles were estimated by applying the same procedure and method as those used in the case of the observed data hosking and wallis 1997 herein the gev distribution was selected as an appropriate probability model based on the l moments method for 26 regions 4 application and results 4 1 comparison of each method as an example fig 3 shows a comparison between the traditional qm method and the rqm method for the historical period s0 fig 3 a depicts the results of the bias correction using the traditional qm method in region 7 the observed data are indicated by the black lines raw data by the green lines and bias corrected data by the blue lines region 7 comprised 27 rainfall sites and the qm method was conducted at each site 27 times as depicted in fig 3 a however the rqm or rqdm method proposed in this study is represented by one set of data red line as depicted in fig 3 b since the pooled data in region 7 were used for bias correction as depicted in fig 3 a outliers may occur in the bias corrected results depending on the statistical characteristics of the observed and model data while performing the qm or qdm method at each site whereas the rqm method exhibits a highly similar cdf particularly for large return periods as an example fig 4 depicts the results of the bias correction at the yangpyeong gun site cheongun myeon office 10074040 which exhibits the largest cdf value in fig 3 a in fig 4 the maximum value of the observed am data is 377 mm mean 173 7 mm and that of the rcm raw data is 334 mm mean 117 5 mm the results of the bias correction using each method reveal that the maximum value of the qm method is 458 0 mm mean 175 1 mm which is approximately 21 5 greater than the observed value in contrast the maximum value of the rqm method is 421 1 mm mean 173 7 mm which is approximately 11 7 greater than the observed value this result indicates that the bias corrected value obtained from the qm method is relatively larger than that obtained from the observed data which may have a significant effect on the frequency analysis 4 2 performance of the rqm method for historical period s0 a statistical evaluation was performed for the results of the observed and model data several commonly used metrics were used to evaluate the performances of the bias correction techniques the correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse rmse observations standard deviation ratio sdr mean absolute error mae mean square error mse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and relative bias rbias these methods and their equations are listed in table 1 the result of the bias correction can be evaluated using the actual observed rainfall data herein the bias correction was performed using the qm and rqm methods for the historical period s0 1979 2005 and the rainfall quantile was estimated and compared using the aforementioned rfa method first we focus on the results of the historical period s0 obtained for all 26 regions in this study table 2 presents the average relative errors of the 615 sites for each return period and the historical period s0 1979 2005 compared to the observed am data the rainfall quantiles obtained using raw am data before quantile mapping for each return period were underestimated by 14 17 33 99 at the 615 sites in this case the average errors decreased as the return period increased this entails that the rainfall quantiles of the raw am data from the hadgem3 ra climate model were smaller than those of the observed data for the 615 sites the qm method was applied and the results showed average errors of 2 11 to 0 70 compared to the observed data on the other hand the rqm method showed average errors of 0 12 0 28 which is much smaller than those from the raw data and the qm method the average errors of the rqm method decreased as the return period surpassed 5 years while the qm method showed contrasting trends fig 5 shows the statistical performances of each bias correction method compared to the observed data for the historical period s0 in fig 5 the green line represents the raw am data before the bias correction and the black line is the result of the at site frequency analysis asfa using the observed data the blue line is the result using the existing qm method while the red line is the result of the rqm method proposed herein note that the delta term which represents the relative change in the raw am data was not taken into account for each bias correction method since this did not need to be considered for the historical period s0 therefore the notations of the qm and rqm for the historical period s0 are the same as those of the qdm and rqdm for the future periods s1 s2 and s3 in fig 5 respectively based on the statistical tests the rqm method generally showed very similar results to the conventional qm method such as the r mae and nse however for the other statistical metrics the results were not similar the rqm method proposed in this paper showed a slightly better performance than the qm method for large return periods based on the means of the rmse and the sdr shown in fig 5 b and c respectively additionally the rbiass of the rqm method were approximately zero while those of the qm method and asfa increased as the return period increased this means that when performing rfa using the results of the rqm method there is relatively low uncertainty compared to other methods 4 3 performance of the bias correction method in cross validation the purpose of cross validation is to generalize the performance evaluation of the model there are several methods to perform cross validation the k fold cross validation method is one of the most commonly used methods for the validation with the data set divided into practice and training nguyen et al 2017 applied the k fold cross validation approach to evaluate the performance of the bias correction method with two indicators mae and rmse in this study four statistics mean standard deviation skewness and kurtosis of the corrected am data were calculated for the entire s0 1979 2005 period which was assumed to be the true value the validation data sets were resampled from the whole data sets and divided the sample data into three parts each data set includes two parts for the training and one part for the validation the mae and rmse between the statistics of am from the whole data and validation data sets were calculated to evaluate the qm and rqm table 3 presents the mae and rmse results of each bias correction method qm and rqm in cross validation as shown in table 3 the rmse and mae values for the rqm method are lower than those for the qm method in particular the rqm method shows better performance for all statistics the mean differences between the qm and rqm methods for rmse and mae were 0 2 and 0 1 respectively moreover for the remaining three statistics standard deviation skewness kurtosis the values for rqm were lower than those for qm this result shows that the rqm method can provide a more stable and robust result than the traditional qm method 4 4 comparison of rainfall quantiles cannon et al 2015 quantitatively analyzed the relative changes in gcm data using the qm dqm and qdm methods they reported that the relative trend of the qm method could be inflated in precipitation extreme indices whereas the dqm and qdm methods were less sensitive in this regard the robustness of the qdm method was demonstrated by the research of cannon et al 2015 in this section we focus on the qdm and rqdm bias correction methods that are conducted for comparison with the bias corrected am rainfall data fig 6 shows bar plots of the regional absolute errors for the 26 regions the figure represents the difference between the relative changes for each period of the raw data by region and the results of each bias correction method the qdm results are presented as blue bar plots and the rqdm results are presented as red bar plots the error of rqdm was lower than that of qdm in the 20 regions in fig 6 a 15 regions in fig 6 b and 22 regions in fig 6 c additionally the rqdm result was lower than the qdm result in the 16 regions in fig 6 d the 16 regions in fig 6 e and the 19 regions in fig 6 f this means that the results of the rqdm were similar to the relative changes of the existing raw data in most of the 26 regions and demonstrated the good preservation of the statistical characteristics of the raw data fig 7 represents the spatial distribution of regional absolute errors as a contour map the contour map was produced using the regional center point in fig 1 the range of the contour map is between 0 green and 12 red the green color represents the case when the bias correction result is similar to the relative changes of the raw data while the red color represents the opposite case thus the green color indicates that the bias correction method successfully preserves the change information in the raw data set while the red color indicates that the bias correction method distorts the change information fig 7 displays the spatial error distribution of the qm method showing significant differences in parts of the southern coast of korea and the rqm method showed that the lower error in spatial distribution than the qm method fig 8 shows box plots of the mean values of the relative changes from the 615 sites for future periods s1 s2 and s3 the columns represent raw data the qdm method and the rqdm method respectively we confirmed that the rqdm method preserves the statistical characteristics of the raw am rainfall data for all future periods and scenarios in particular the qdm method revealed greater relative changes than the rqdm method compared to the raw data especially for period s3 and the rcp 8 5 scenario however it was discovered that these differences were insignificant with respect to the mean relative changes of the rqdm method except in the case of s3 s0 for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in fig 8 c and f 4 5 spatial distribution of climate change factors using the rqdm method for future periods we can predict future climate change and proactively address the associated risks by estimating rainfall quantiles based on climate change scenario data the ccf was calculated using the rainfall quantiles for each period s0 s1 s2 and s3 and the return period t as an example the national hydraulic research institute of malaysia nahrim 2013 used ccf to quantify the effects of future climate change and the ccf is as follows 11 ccf i t r si t r s 0 t where ccf i t represents the ccf for a given return period t and the future period si i 1 2 a n d 3 r s 0 t represent the rainfall quantile for the historical period s0 and r si t is the rainfall quantile for future periods fig 9 represents the ccfs of the 100 year return period for the future periods s1 s2 and s3 compared to the period s0 the rainfall quantiles 100 year return period based on the rqdm method were estimated for each period and fig 9 a b and c represent the rcp 4 5 scenario fig 9 d e and f show the results of the rcp 8 5 scenario for the rcp 4 5 scenario the ccf 1 for the s1 period in fig 9 a slightly increased around the southwestern coastal areas and part of the east coast additionally the remaining areas were possibly similar to or less than the s0 period in fig 9 b the ccf 2 increased in all regions and was expected to increase by 25 30 especially in the southwestern and western coastal areas in fig 9 c the ccf 3 increased by approximately 35 especially in the southwestern area for the rcp 8 5 scenario and s1 period in fig 9 d the ccf 1 increased by approximately 30 in the southwestern coastal areas while the northern area showed a decrease for the s2 period in fig 9 e the ccf 2 increased by approximately 15 similar to that shown in fig 9 a southern area and part of the east coast for the s3 period in fig 9 f the largest increase for all scenarios and periods was 40 45 around the southern coast and southwestern area 5 conclusions herein we proposed a new regional bias correction method rqdm to estimate extreme rainfall quantiles using the rfa method we used simulated data 1979 2100 from the hadgem3 ra climate model to illustrate the performance of the bias correction methods although numerous bias correction methods exist e g cannon et al 2015 eum and cannon 2017 maraun 2013 most methods based on daily data may be inappropriate for estimating extreme rainfall quantiles therefore we suggested a new bias correction method which is applicable to extreme rainfall data for quantile estimation the new rqdm method combines two techniques namely quantile delta mapping and regional frequency analysis the conclusions are summarized as follows a comparison between the qdm and rqdm methods showed that the bias correction error of the rqm method was smaller than that of the qm method for the historical period s0 in particular the rqm method proposed herein showed a slightly better performance than the qm method for large return periods in the results of the rmse and rsd additionally the rbias of the rqm method was approximately zero which means that this method has relatively low uncertainty compared to other methods furthermore with the rqdm method the relative changes of raw for the future periods s1 s2 and s3 were more well preserved than with the qdm method in particular when comparing the relative changes of the raw data using regional absolute errors the rqdm method obtained average regional absolute errors of 0 3846 s1 s0 0 7658 s2 s0 and 0 6008 s3 s0 in the rcp 4 5 scenario while the qdm method achieved values of 1 1492 s1 s0 1 2380 s2 s0 and 1 6271 s3 s0 for the future periods moreover in the rcp 8 5 scenario the rqdm method obtained average errors of 0 6637 s1 s0 0 6625 s2 s0 and 0 9321 s3 s0 which are superior to those achieved using the qdm method finally it was found that the rqdm method proposed herein generally showed more robust results than the conventional qdm method additionally we applied the rqdm method to calculate the ccf for the future periods s1 s2 and s3 in south korea as a result of estimating rainfall quantiles using rfa it was found that the largest increase approximately 45 occurred in the southwestern area for the s3 2071 2100 period and the rcp 8 5 scenario the remaining scenarios and periods were also shown to increase mainly in the southwestern area and part of the east coast finally the rqdm method is a new method to supplement for problems that may occur when performing the qdm method using am data for each site when the length of observation data is too short or there are outliers problems that may occur in the quantile mapping process can be improved by bias correction using regional cdf values furthermore the rqdm method shows a robust result in estimating extreme rainfall than the conventional qdm method credit authorship

4743,hydraulic conductivity k is a key but problematic parameter in groundwater models particularly those that simulate flow in weak readily deformable media such as peat deposits as a result k represents a critical source of error in models that couple hydrological processes with the carbon balance of peatlands a globally important source for greenhouse gases we therefore conducted mini aquifer tests on two mesoscale bog landforms within the large 1300 km2 red lake peatland of northern minnesota these tests offer the dual advantage of determining the fine scale distribution of k within a large 900 m3 model domain in addition the stress created by a 24 h pumping operation should be capable of mobilizing pools of biogenic gases thoughout a deep peat deposit the pumping results were monitored by 24 to 38 wells in order to calibrate a 3d finite volume groundwater model with the aid of pest parameter estimation analysis high k values were determined at a bog forest 10 5 to 10 6 m s 1 and bog lawn 10 3 to 10 4 m s 1 sites throughout their deep 4 m peat profiles these tests also detected vertically continuous zones of unexpectedly high or low k values in contrast to the horizontal bedding planes and increasing degree of decomposition with depth the vertical k zones are suggestive of three different modes of bubble transport that either locally dilate or partially block the peat pores in addition the tests provided new insights on a conceptual model linking k to the development of all large 20 km2 forested bog complexes in mid continental boreal north america keywords peatlands hydraulic conductivity biogenic gas bubbles mini aquifer test pest parameter estimation analysis 1 introduction among all terrestrial ecosystems peatlands are probably the most closely coupled to hydrological processes e g sjörs 1963 charman 2002 rydin and jeglum 2013 unlike any other terrestrial ecosystem peatlands develop three dimensional landforms that are almost entirely composed of fluids and dead biomass weber 1902 sjörs 1948 these organic landforms create an unusual porous medium in which biotic processes determine the physical fabric of the medium itself while still being under the direct control of hydrological processes on one hand peat only accumulates in hydrogeologic settings that allow saturated soil profiles to persist whereas the differentiation of bogs and fens is determined by the transport of mineral solutes from external sources on the other hand biotic processes determine the composition of the porous medium itself which consists of the incompletely decomposed remains of plant litter furthermore the generation of biogenic gas bubbles can alter the peat fabric creating either secondary porosity or local aquitards this close coupling between the biotic and hydrological processes is most strikingly manifested by the peat landform patterns that characterize the largest peat basins of the boreal zone in north america sjörs 1963 heinselman 1963 glaser et al 1981 2004a the close coupling between biotic and physical processes creates both challenges and opportunities for applying mathematical groundwater models to understand the carbon dynamics and developmental pathways of large peatlands numerical models that attempt to simulate porewater flow through peat deposits rely on measurements of hydraulic conductivity k which can vary by over several orders of magnitude within just a few meters both vertically or horizontally e g ingram 1983 rycroft et al 1975 chason et al 1986 kneale 1987 waddington and roulet 1997 beckwith et al 2003 holden and burt 2003 clymo 2004 lewis et al 2012 rezanezhad et al 2016 the spatially variable nature of k in many peatlands introduces another important source of error for parameterizing groundwater models in peat deposits since the size of the model domain and the size of the cells with which the domain has been discretized is usually greater than the scale at which determinations of the hydraulic parameters are made bromley and robinson 1995 baird et al 1997 hydraulic conductivity k which is a measure of the ease with which water flows through a porous medium is the proportionality coefficient in darcy s law 1 q k h where q is the water flux in units of length per unit time l t k is the hydraulic conductivity of the material l t and h is the hydraulic head l hydraulic properties can be evaluated throughout the model domain by solving the inverse problem in which the distribution of the dependent variable hydraulic head is the best known aspect of the system and the distribution of the independent variable hydraulic conductivity is the least well known in situations in which a large number of measurements need to be collected in order to capture finer scale heterogeneity in a porous medium calibration of the model is subject to several sources of error 1 1 heterogeneity and anisotropy an important source of error in groundwater modeling occurs when the model calibration process seeks to infer a unique parameter set which in all but the most homogenous environments is inherently non unique moore and doherty 2006 according to moore and doherty 2006 errors associated with an ill defined inverse problem can be mitigated by the use of a proper regularization strategy coupled with a sufficient number of monitoring points for parameterization of the model domain as a means of addressing this problem automated calibration undertaken with parameterization from a series of pilot points sensu doherty 2003 and regularized inversion can be used to account for finer scale heterogeneity in the model domain 1 2 scale dependence as a volume averaged parameter the hydraulic conductivity of any porous medium would be expected to be scale sensitive particularly in one as hetergeneous as a peat deposit aquifer pumping tests for example typically yield higher estimates of k at the scale of an aquifer in comparison to slug tests i e borehole or piezometer tests which measure k within a much smaller test volume immediately surrounding a piezometer screen similarly slug tests typically produce higher estimates of k than those derived from permeameter experiments on small 1 m3 samples in the laboratory this relationship has usually been explained by the increasing probability of intersecting a macropore or some other preferred conduit for water transport within larger test volumes e g kiraly 1975 bredehoeft et al 1993 garvin 1986 herzog and morse 1984 carrera 1993 rovey and cherkauer 1995 butler and healey 1998 schulze makuch et al 1999 but see hsieh 1998 ingebritsen et al 2006 conversely gas bubbles produced by methanogenesis in peat deposits can locally dilate the peat fabric glaser et al 2004b or occlude pores creating local aquitards e g reynolds et al 1992 beckwith and baird 2001 rosenberry et al 2003 glaser et al 2004b the hydraulic conductivity of peat deposits would therefore be expected to vary both laterally and vertically given the heterogeneous nature of peat deposits and their increasing degree of decomposition with increasing depth recently mini aquifer tests have been designed to provide estimates of k across a much larger test volume than is possible with lab permeameters or slug tests but at a more manageable scale than that of a regional aquifer mini aquifer tests have the further advantage of yielding fine scale estimates of k over a 3d model domain by utilizing an array of piezometers to measure the drawdown induced by a pumping operation these data can then be used to calibrate a 3d finite volume groundwater model with the aid of pilot points and inverse regularization finally the sustained pumping operation of a mini aquifer test should be capable of creating an hydraulic stress of sufficient strength to mobilize pools of biogenic gases within a deep peat profile 1 3 sampling bias related to study area another challenge is presented by the variable size of peatlands across the northern hemisphere smaller peatlands 20 km2 are preferentially selected for study because of their proximity to roads and local power grids however their size and limited water storage also makes them especially vulnerable to human and climatic perturbations in contrast the immense size 1000 km2 of the major peat basins of north america imposes a considerablle barrier to field work while also conferring an effective buffer to disturbance because of their enormous water storage capacity in addition these large peat basins contain striking mesoscale landform patterns that seem to represent a stable adjustment of the vegetation and across large areas to local changes in water chemistry and water levels the question remains whether these mesoscale landform patterns are also characterized by discrete ranges of k and thus can be interpreted as stages in peatland development sensu glaser et al 1981 glaser et al 2004a the discovery of large pools of greenhouse gases in the deep 2 5 m peat deposits of northern minnesota e g romanowicz 1993 romanowicz et al 1995 chasar et al 2000ab chasar 2002 rosenberry et al 2003 glaser et al 2004b parsekian et al 2010 2011 corbett 2012 corbett et al 2013 2015 reeve et al 2013 raises still further questions whether biogenic gas bubbles are capable of altering the hydraulic properties of these peat landforms we therefore conducted a mini aquifer tests on two distinct bog landforms in the 1300 km2 red lake peatland of northwestern minnsesota fig 1 the objectives of this study were to determine 1 the fine scale 3d distribution of k within two large bog landforms 2 if these distributional patterns of k are related to the botanical stratigraphy or other factors and 3 the reliability of a conceptual model that links the development of these landforms to the accumulation of peat with contrasting hydraulic properties mini aquifer tests offer several important advantages for studying these problems not only do these tests cover a larger test volume than is possible with individual slug tests or lab permeaters but they also apply a perisistent hydrostatic stress across a large test volume that should be sufficient to mobilize any biogenic gas present in the peat profile finally peatlands larger than 1000 km2 offer opportunities to select field sites that lack any evidence of past disturbance from fires or drainage ditches 2 methods 2 1 study sites two mini aquifer tests were conducted in july and august of 2008 on the central bog complex red lake ii in glaser et al 1981 of the 1300 km2 red lake peatland in northern minnesota fig 1 the forested bog crest 48 15 n 94 41 w and non forested bog lawn 48 16 n 94 42 w in this bog complex are typical of all large bogs within the forested bog region delineated by glaser and janssens 1986 and glaser 1992b the bog forest site in the red lake peatland fig a1 and a2 in appendix a is forested with an open stand of black spruce picea mariana and a continuous mat of sphagnum growing over fallen tree trunks and branches the shrub layer under the forest canopy is composed of leatherleaf chamaedaphne calyculata labrador tea rhododendron groenlandicum and other ericaceous shrubs the bog lawn site fig a1 and fig a3 in appendix a in contrast is located 1 8 km downslope in the middle of a broad sphagnum lawn sensu glaser et al 1981 dominated by a continuous carpet of sphagnum and a low stand of the sedge carex oligosperma large pools of biogenic gas have been reported under both of these sites from 1990 through 2008 romanowicz 1993 romanowicz et al 1995 chasar et al 2000ab chasar 2002 parsekian et al 2010 parsekian et al 2011 corbett 2012 corbett et al 2013 2015 reeve et al 2013 2 2 peat stratigraphy the peat stratigraphy across the red lake ii bog complex is based on the analysis of large diameter peat cores the stratigraphy was originally determined by janssens et al 1992 from a transect of long cores recovered from the peat surface to the underlying mineral substratum these data were supplemented by a set of additional cores recovered within 20 30 m of the mini aquifer tests all of the cores were recovered using a modified piston corer equipped with a steel core barrel 10 cm in diameter and a serrated cutting edge wright et al 1984 the entire peat profile was sampled by repeated drives down to the mineral substratum after extrusion from the corer the peat cores were wrapped in plastic and stored in longitudinally split sections of pvc pipe for transport to cold rooms in the laboratory the new cores were first analyzed for wet bulk density by gamma ray attenuation with geotek multi sensor core logger the cores were next split into longitudinal sections and immediately imaged on a digital line scanner at 300 dpi the botanical stratigraphy and degree of decomposition of the peat were subsequently determined according to the troels smith 1955 method by examining small samples dispersed with water in a petri plate loss on ignition analyses were conducted on 1 cm3 sub samples at 5 cm depth intervals for determination of fluid content and dry bulk density 2 3 mini aquifer analysis each mini aquifer analysis comprised three tightly coupled components rhoades 2009 1 field measurements that monitored changes in hydraulic head within a piezometer array during a 24 hour pumping operation 2 multiple calibrations of a transient 3d groundwater model that was parameterized using pest based on inverse regulation and 113 pilot points sensu doherty 2003 2005 distributed evenly over a 940 m3 14 14 4 8 m model domain and 3 statistical analysis to optimize the goodness of fit between the simulated and actual field measurements the model simulations were run multiple times first to determine the optimal size of a model domain that minimized edge effects and then to determine the closest agreement between the simulated and actual field data 2 3 1 piezometer design and arrays the pumping tests were conducted with a single pumping well combined with 24 to 38 monitoring wells i e piezometers at the bog forest and bog lawn sites respectively figs a4 and a5 in appendix a the wells were arranged within a 4 4 m array with the pumping well located at the origin and the monitoring wells radiating outward along two rows 90 from each other with an additional row 45 from the other two figs a4 and a5 in appendix a this systematic array was selected as the most efficient means to cover a 940 m3 test volume that was impacted by a 24 hour pumping operation while minimizing artifacts from adjacent monitoring wells all wells were constructed from polyvinyl chloride pipe with a 5 1 cm diameter for the pumping well and 2 5 cm diameter for the monitoring wells each well was fitted with a plug to prevent clogging during its insertion into the peat and a slotted intake screen the slotted screens of the pumping wells covered its entire length from the peat surface to the installation depth of 2 3 m whereas the monitoring wells each had a 30 cm slotted screen near their base which varied from 0 5 to 4 m depth in the peat profiles to measure hydraulic head all wells were first developed prior to the pump test by surging and scrubbing the intake screens from the inside with a bottle brush and removing the water and debris within the well multiple times a narrow floating boardwalk was constructed to minimize deformations to the peat surface during the well installation and pumping tests a line level was used to determine if the wells moved vertically during the pumping tests 2 3 2 pumping tests a low flow submersible pump was inserted into the pumping well during the pumping operation and the discharge water was routed 60 m downgradient from the piezometer array a constant flow rate was achieved using a flow control valve and rheostat to make small adjustments and achieve much lower constant flow rates then using a rheostat alone these precautions were necessary at the bog forestt site where a low pumping rate is required to avoid dewatering the well the optimal pumping rates were determined prior to the pumping test in order to devise a method by which the flow rate could be continuously monitored the flow rates for the bog forest and bog lawn sites were kept at 3 3 10 6 and 4 8 10 5 m3 sec 1 respectively water levels in the monitoring wells were monitored throughout the 24 hour duration of the pumping tests using a combination of solinst pressure transducers and electric water level indicators measurements were taken throughout the 24 hour duration of the pumping tests using a combination of solinst pressure transducers and manual tape reels all waterlevel measurements were converted to drawdowns by calculating the difference between the initial and each new succeeding water level barologgers used to measure the atmospheric pressure were employed to correct water pressure measurements for changes in atmospheric pressure 2 4 ground water flow modeling we first assumed that the pumping tests created a transient flow field within the saturated peat that was simulated by 2 s c ϑ h ϑ t k h w where sc is the specific storage m 1 which changes from ss saturated specific storage to sy partially saturated specific storage per unit layer thickness when a layer is partially saturated h is hydraulic head m t is time s k is hydraulic conductivity m s 1 and w is the pumping well discharge m3 s 1 eq 2 was coded into a 3d finite volume numerical groundwater model appendix b using fipy an object oriented partial differential equation solver written in python van rossum and drake 2001 the model uses the finite volume method to solve coupled sets of partial differential equations wheeler et al 2007 calibration of the model was undertaken using pest doherty 2005 a nonlinear parameter estimator that facilitates model calibration by automatically adjusting parameters until the fit between model outputs and measured values is optimized by a weighted least squares approach the robustness of these simulations was tested by statistical methods recommended by cooley and naff 1990 and the results compared to botanical composition and scanned images of large diameter peat cores collected adjacent to the sampling area a model domain of 14 14 4 8 m was selected after calibrating various sized domains to identify the optimum size of the model domain that minimizes artifacts introduced by the boundary conditions while remaining computationally efficient the model domain was then discretized to provide higher resolution near the pumping well with the cell size increased by a factor of 1 2 at distances greater than 1 m from the well the domain was further divided into five uniformly thick layers that cumulatively totaled 4 8 m which was slightly larger than the estimated thickness of peat in the study area the square model domain was discretized into an odd number of cubes in order to provide a cell node that lies in the center of the model fig a6 in appendix a this arrangement insures that the cell center was in a location that corresponded with the well cluster locations at the field sites after the model domain was discretized k values were interpolated to the nodes of the mesh from the locations points at which the values are assigned and fixed head constant value boundary conditions were assigned to all exterior model boundaries the top and bottom of the model were assigned the default no flow boundary condition after defining boundary conditions values of hydraulic head and pumping rate were initialized as the model was run the continuous removal of water from the pumping well causes some of the cells to desaturate in the uppermost layer of the model domain these dry cells occur when the calculated head in that cell falls below the base of the cell as noted by doherty 2001 dry cells cause model convergence problems and result in poor performance of nonlinear parameter estimation such as pest to remedy the effects of dry cells a desaturation routine was implemented according to the work of doherty 2001 stepping through time the model solves the transient flow equation eq 2 and updates values of hydraulic head based on k and the pumping rate during each iteration the drawdowns for each monitoring well are calculated and saved to a text file to be used in the model calibration 2 5 model calibration model calibration was accomplished with pest which minimizes the sum of weighted squared discrepancies between model outputs and measured values the optimization algorithm adjusts the values for model parameters to decrease the objective function s value after completion of a model run output files are generated and compared to the corresponding observations using model output instruction files once the model has undergone an iteration the model being run at least as many times as there are adjustable parameters the objective function and jacobian matrix are calculated this process is repeated until the stopping criteria are met figs a7 in appendix a and appendix b pest uses the gauss marquardt levenberg gml method of parameter estimation the levenberg 1944 method which combines the gradient descent and newton s methods of parameter estimation was modified by marquardt 1963 to remedy hemstitching wherein successive parameter improvements result in oscillations across a long and narrow objective function valley instead of reaching the local minima in this valley and proceeding downgradient within this valley doherty and skahill 2006 skahill and doherty 2006 note that the gml method implemented in pest is advantageous because it can be modified by the inclusion of regularization devices to maintain numerical stability 2 6 parameterization model calibration proceeded by varying the parameter values and also the number of points to which parameters are assigned increasing the number of parameters may better represent the heterogeneity of the system but at the cost of increasing the sum of squares errors between calculated and observed values and thus the reliability of the estimated parameters yeh 1986 unfortunately overparameterized systems have a high degree of non uniqueness that can can come at the cost of nonuniqueness of the parameter set moore and doherty 2006 this problem can be avoided by incorporating parameter structure into the estimation process by using either zones of uniform property value or interpolation to the model grid from a set of nodal points located throughout the model in this study we calibrated the hydraulic conductivity parameters in the models using the pilot point approach since the zonation approach is normally used to represent medium to coarse scale variability in hydraulic properties moore and doherty 2006 for the interpolation method we used adjusted hydraulic conductivity values throughout the calibration procedure at 133 pilot points evenly distributed throughout the two model domains fig a6 in appendix a these points are used to interpolate the model parameter to all cells of model domain although the distribution of k is the primary focus of the investigation the transient simulation requires that storage values are also be assigned to the model instead of using previously determined values of specific storage and specific yield these parameters were assigned using the zonation approach with one value representing each of the five model layers provided with initial values and upper and lower bounds that cannot be transgressed values of specific storage in the case of fully saturated material and specific yield in the case of partially saturated material were optimized along with k values a multi quadric radial basis function made available in scipy jones et al 2001 was used with a minimal smoothing parameter to interpolate parameter values from the points to the grid however as noted by doherty 2003 increasing the number of pilot points used to characterize a model domain decreases the dependence of the interpolation process on the variogram selected for this domain and creates a situation in which the location of the pilot points matters less 2 7 regularization to counteract the shortcomings of parameterization we used regularized inversion a regularization strategy is a mathematical technique that provides numerical stability to an overparameterized inverse problem through the introduction of an appropriate constraint on parameter values cristina et al 1994 doherty 2005 doherty and skahill 2006 inversion is the process by which model parameter values are inferred from measurements by matching model outputs to these measurements moore and doherty 2006 where the task of the parameter estimation process is to minimize a global objective function eq 2 the existence of nonequal or nonpreferred parameter values causes the global objective function ϕ g to experience a penalty because pest seeks to minimize the parameter differences thus increasing parameter uniformity across the model domain doherty 2003 2005 we used one of the more widely used regularization schemes that imposes a smoothing constraint where the differences between neighboring parameter values are minimized 3 ϕ g ϕ m μ ϕ r where ϕg is the global objective function ϕm is the measurement objective function μ is the regularization weight factor and ϕr is the regularization objective function according to doherty 2003 2005 imposing regularization in the form of a smoothing constraint removes the necessity to define a zonation scheme in advance of the parameter estimation process so the calibration process itself decides where heterogeneity must exist within the model to provide the best match between model outcomes and field measurements where heterogeneity does not need to exist to provide an optimum fit parameter uniformity will prevail as a result of the regularized parameter estimation process giving a spatial distribution that is more likely to approximate geological reality rather than an artifact forced by the application of zones with uniform hydraulic properties doherty 2003 2005 this procedure provides the benefits of a highly parameterized system without incurring reduced numerical stability and high parameter correlation for each of the 133 pilot points at least one equation was written stating that the difference of the log transformed k values between it and its closest neighbor be zero if possible these regularization functions are included in the parameter estimation process as prior information equations because there are five layers in the model representing the layered structure of the model domain prior information equations were not defined between points located in different horizontal layers in this manner the model domain is preferentially homogeneous in the horizontal direction whereas incorporating parameter structure into the model based on knowledge of the peat stratigraphy allows more heterogeneity in the vertical direction 2 8 model analysis all model simulations were first tested to determine if the simulated dependent variable values fit a valid regression using methods suggested for ground water inverse modeling by cooley and naff 1990 we further assessed this fit by comparing the weighted simulated and observed values to a regression line with a slope equal to 1 0 and an intercept of zero hill 1998 the weighted residuals of these regressions were then analyzed for independence and normality by three levels of statisitical tests normal probability plots probability density functions sokal and rohlf 1996 and shapiro wilks s w tests shapiro and wilks 1965 this latter test is a more powerful test than the kolmogrorov smirnov k s goodness of fit test because k s is more sensitive to extreme values and focuses on extreme departures from the hypothesized distribution while s w focuses on the average departure from the hypothesized distribution 3 results 3 1e peat stratigraphy the bog forest and bog lawn sites are underlain by more than 4 m of peat which completely covers the underlying mineral sediments across the central rlii watershed both sites are characterized by similar peat stratigraphy indicating a common developmental pathway but one that reached different stages in the development of a large bog complex sensu glaser et al 2004a each coring site has a deep upper layer of sphagnum dominated peat that extends downward from 0 to 3 m depth figs 2 and 3 in appendix c this stratigraphic pattern is typical of ombrotrophic raised bogs in the red lake ii bog complex janssens et al 1992 and also northern minnesota glaser and janssens 1986 however the sphagnum stratum at the bog forest site is more compact with a greater abundance of woody material whereas this layer is distinguished by the variable abundance of sedge shoots rootlets and woody elements with variable degrees of decomposition under the bog lawn both sites have a woody fen layer at a depth of about 3 m at the bog fen boundary this boundary is marked by a transition from sphagnum remains above to the remains of minerotrophic mosses e g scorpidium scorpiodes calliergon trifarium and campylium stellatum with sedge shoots these feather mosses are typical of a rich fen forest all the major and minor bedding planes have a consistent horizontal orientation including the bog fen boundary at about 3 m depth although the peat stratigraphy at both coring sites generally becomes more decomposed with increasing depth the degree of decomposition tends to be more variable within in the bog lawn cores in addition the peat tends to be visibly more porous throughout the bog lawn profile except for the more deeply humified woody strata at about 3 m depth overall the water content exceeds 90 of the wet mass appendix c slide 8 whereas the organic content is consistently greater than 90 of the dry mass determined by loss on ignition the base of each core is transitional across a 2 cm depth interval grading into a clayey silty sand and gravel in the underlying mineral deposits appendix c contains detailed lithologic descriptions of the peat cores 3 2 mini aquifer tests measured drawdowns water levels in all the monitoring wells generally fell as a function of time and distance from the pumping well but not always coherently with depth at both sites rhoades 2009 figs a8 a9 in appendix a at the bog lawn site the measured drawndown curves had a similar shape with the most rapid rate of drawdown measured within the first 25 000 s 7 h of the pumping operation after 7 h of pumping the drawdown curves generally became increasingly asymptotic with a much lower rate of declining water level the drawdown curves for the various depth intervals were coherent in most wells at the bog lawn and retained a similar trajectory with increasing distance from the pumping well however the curves for the piezometers at 1 and 2 m depth were consistently inverted in several of the wells despite the steep rate of drawdown recorded in all piezometers within the first 25 000 s the water levels continued to fall as much as 2 cm afterwards by the end of the pumping test about 24 h even in the most distant piezometers but not at 3 m depth at the ends of the transects in contrast two main types of drawdown curves were apparant at the bog forest site drawdown curves were similar in the wells closest to the pumping well corresponding to the general pattern of drawdown measured in all the bog lawn piezometers the principal exceptions were the drawdown curves in the deeper peizometers at increasing distance from the pumping well although there was an initially rapid rate of drawdown for all the bog crest piezometers only those closest to the pumping well became asymptotic after 7 h of pumping in the more distant piezometers water levels continued to fall at a relatively steep rate after 20 000 s i e 5 6 h of pumping although at a slower rate as the pumping operation progressed thereafter some of the drawdown curves for different depth intervals overlapped and were sometimes inverted in several wells along the transects these measurements are indicative of considerable variability in the hydraulic properties of the peat both vertically and horizontally 3 3 groundwater model simulations 3 3 1 bog forest site the numerical model for the bog forest site was run using a timestep of 100 s to reach a total time of 25 000 s approximately 7 h this time interval was selected because it included a the period of most rapid drawdown in the water table in most of the monitoring wells b the greatest number of measurements made both manually and with pressure transducers allowing an estimation of measurment errors 0 5 cm c because of its computational efficiency and d because the hydraulic stress created by this period of pumping was was roughly equivalent to that produced by the steep drops in atmospheric pressure measured at the bog forest site in 1997 sensu glaser et al 2004b calibration targets for the model are the measured drawdowns from the 24 monitoring wells at times of 1000 2000 3000 4000 6000 8000 10 000 15 000 20 000 and 25 000 s only the model cells closest to the pumping well desaturated i e calculated head fell below the base of the cell requiring the desaturation routine as described above the average k values across the model domain remained relatively high ranging from about 7 7 10 5 m s 1 in the uppermost peat to about 4 7 10 6 m s 1 in the deeper peat below 3 m fig 4 the highest and most variable values for k were determined in the upper portion 0 0 5 m of the peat profile whereas the average k values declined at deeper depths and were least variable below 2 4 m the spatial distribution of k varied both laterally and vertically with a prominent plume like zone of lower k values as low as 4 7 10 6 that bulges upward through the center of the domain fig 5 however the overall range of k within the bog domain remained within one order of magnitude of variation specific storage which is the volume of water released from storage per volume of aquifer per unit decline in hydraulic head was variable with depth ranging from 4 0 10 2 to 1 0 10 3 m 1 while the uppermost model layer was calibrated to a specific yield drainable porosity of 0 4 3 3 2 bog lawn site the overall plan for the bog lawn site was similar to that of the bog forest except for the locations and number of the 38 monitoring wells and calibration targets calibration targets for the model are the measured drawdowns from 38 monitoring wells at times of 1000 2000 4000 6000 9000 12000 15 000 18 000 21 000 and 25 000 s the optimized average k values were 2 orders of magnitude higher those determined for the bog crest domain ranging from 3 5 10 4 to 2 6 10 3 m s 1 fig 4 the best fit between measured and modeled drawdowns was achieved using a value of horizontal k kh that was ten times greater than vertical k kv with kh kv 10 this ratio is the same as that determined for the bog crest site and was achieved using the same methods as those described above the bog lawn domain is characterized by a general decline in the average optimzed k values with increasing depth from a depth of 0 5 to 2 4 m below which there is little further variability in average k values however the bog lawn domain is also distinguished by a pronounced degree of heterogeneity with respect to k both vertically and horizontally fig 6 the most striking departures from expected trends were 1 zones of low optimized k values overlying regions of higher k figs 6 and 7 2 conduit like zones of higher k values extending vertically through the entire model domain figs 6 and 7 and 3 plume like zones of low k values at the corners of the domain particularly the nw corner fig 6 similar to the calibration approach for the bog forest site no assumptions were made regarding the depth dependency or value of the initial and subsequently adjusted k values these values were allowed to fluctuate between upper and lower bounds of 1 0 10 1 and 1 0 10 10 m s 1 respectively even though this range exceeded the upper and lower bounds of k values previously reported for all peatlands the other striking departure from expected trends is the occurrence of localized zones of high k under zones of lower k fig 7 specific storage was found be variable with depth ranging from 2 9 10 2 to 7 1 10 3 m 1 while the uppermost model layer took on a specific yield drainable porosity of 0 4 3 4 statistical analysis of the optimized k values three levels of statistical tests were used to analyze the reliability of the model simulations for the bog forest and bog lawn sites we first determined whether the simulated dependent variable values indicate a valid regression using methods suggested for groundwater inverse modeling by cooley and naff 1990 the regression between the measured and modeled k values for the bog forest and bog lawn sites had correlation coefficients of 0 94 and 0 90 respectively indicating a good fit between the simulated and observed data fig 8 however a large range in the magnitudes of weighted observations can obscure trends in the differences between the weighted observations and the weighted simulated values this source of error could be applicable to the results from the bog forest site because the majority of the drawdowns were small and data points deviated from the regression line most noticeably near the origin of the plot despite the tight clustering of data fig 8 in contrast the drawdowns for the bog lawn site are more uniformly spread out and as a result the model more closely matched the measured drawdowns throughout the duration of the pumping test the reliability of the regressions were further tested by determining whether the weighted residuals the difference between weighted measured and weighted modeled drawdowns and weighted modeled values were independent and therefore indicated that the weighted residuals were normally distributed about a value of zero hill 1998 this condition particularly conforms to the results for the bog forest site fig 9 but is less visually conspicuous for the bog lawn fig 10 although the normality of the residuals can be assessed visually from a probability density function pdf a normal probability plot provides a better visual test for independent and normal weighted residuals cooley and naff 1990 hill 1998 figs 9 and 10 we therefore used normal probability plots to determine whether the weighted residuals were normally distributed about a mean of zero and therefore approximated a straight line while deviations from this line can be expected due to regression induced correlation hill and tiedeman 2007 residuals from both the bog forest and bog lawn regressions appear normally distributed and independent the residuals from both the bog forest and bog lawn simulations were further analyzed for normality using a shapiro wilk s w test which yielded w values of 0 98 and 0 96 respectively the p values for these tests were 1 3 10 3 indicating that the residuals from both sites are independent and do not appear to be non normally distributed since w is not substantially less than 1 4 discussion 4 1 k as a problematic parameter parameterizing groundwater models with reliable values for hydraulic conductivity remains problematic due to several sources of error ingebritsen et al 2006 a fundamental problem arises because k cannot be measured directly but must be inferred indirectly from model calibrations based on measurements of hydraulic head or the transport of tracers more serious problems arise from applying a volume averaged parameter such as k e g garvin 1986 to naturally occurring aquifers which are heterogeneous in space and time these problems are confounded by the standard methods used for determining k in the field which measure k over different test volumes i e control or support volumes using different equipment designs e g bear 1972 bredehoeft et al 1993 herzog and morse 1984 bradbury and muldoon 1990 rovey and cherkauer 1995 hsieh 1998 butler 1997 butler and healey 1998 schulze makuch et al 1999 bromley et al 2004 ingebritsen et al 2006 fallico et al 2012 it is therefore not surprising that measurements of k vary by 12 16 orders of magnitude or greater among various types of geologic materials davis 1969 ingebritsen et al 2006 a similar range of up to seven to 10 orders of magnitude has been reported from peatlands in north america and europe e g rycroft et al 1975 chason et al 1986 kneale 1987 lewis et al 2012 cunliffe et al 2013 rezanezhad et al 2016 peat deposits add an additional level of complexity to all determinations of k peat is an inherently weak porous medium as a result of its high water content usually 90 of wet weight in the glap that still retains a high degree of elastic strength because of its plant fibers and buried wood elements e g hobbs 1986 the interconnected pore space can therefore be altered by significant deformations induced by external or internally applied stresses such as surface loadings hemond and goldman 1985 changes in water levels price and schlotzhauer 1999 price 2003 holden and burt 2003 whittington and price 2006 or the transport of methane bubbles fechner levy and hemond 1996 glaser et al 2004b reeve et al 2013 as a result the measurement of k in peat deposits is subject to several problems arising from methodology heterogeneities in the porous media or deformations of the pore space 4 1 1 problems related to sampling method three generally accepted methods exist for determining the hydraulic conductivity of a saturated porous medium aquifer pumping tests slug i e bore hole or piezometer tests and laboratory permeameter experiments bear 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 ingebritsen et al 2006 all three methods determine k values for different test volumes ranging from the scale of regional aquifer down to that of a small laboratory sample not unexpectedly these methods often but not always yield progressively higher values of k as the size and heterogeneity of the test volume increases ingebritsen et al 2006 this general trend has been explained by the higher probability that a larger test volume will intersect a macropore or other preferred conduit for pore water transport in addition larger test volumes are more likely to contain diversionary flow paths around localized flow obstructions however hsieh 1998 and ingebritsen et al 2006 recognize the inherent sampling bias associated with all methods for determining k depending on the synoptic distribution of macropores across all scales and types of porous media 4 1 2 lab permeameters laboratory experiments are limited to small 1 m3 peat samples that are analyzed in the laboratory under conditions of constant falling or rising hydraulic head bear 1972 ingebritsen et al 2006 this method provides the most direct means to measure horizontal k kh and vertical k kv and also the relationship of k to the botanical composition degree of decomposition and bulk density of different peat types however lab permeameters only measure k at the small scale of a lab sample and are also subject to several other sources of error first it is difficult to cut small peat samples without altering the peat fabric because peat is generally fibrous and readily deformable second the peat sample must be sealed within a permeameter in the lab to prevent preferential flow along the inside walls of the vessel finally it is not possible to cut monoliths from deeper portions of a peat profile unless the peatland has been drained and cut to expose a peat face although some of these problems have been partially addressed by using larger peat samples such as 0 5 to 1 m3 cubes of peat hoag and price 1997 beckwith et al 2003 cunliffe et al 2013 this approach still cannot determine the spatial distribution of k on a fine scale over a much larger domain particularly within the deeper portions of pristine non drained peatlands with a high water table 4 1 3 slug tests since the pioneering work of boelter 1965 1969 slug tests have been extensively used to yield a rapid in situ estimate of k in peatlands slug tests determine k by measuring the change in hydraulic head that follows an instantaneous injection or removal of a known volume of water from a piezometer k is then calculated following the hvorslev 1951 or other methods that relax the assumption that the medium under consideration is incompressible homogeneous and isotropic slug tests assume that darcy s law is valid over the model domain so a change in head over time will result in a log linear recovery with k that is proportional to the gradient of the log of normalized head against time hvorslev 1951 butler 1997 darcy s law is commonly assumed to govern pore water flow through peat deposits although apparent deviations may result from the high elastic storativity of the peat e g ingram 1983 hemond and goldman 1985 gafni and brooks 1990 baird and gaffney 1994 holden and burt 2003 beckwith et al 2003 slug tests have the advantage of being quick easy to use in the field and depth specific but are susceptible to errors related to aquifer elasticity and piezometer design bear 1972 butler 1997 surridge et al 2005 the concern that slug tests yield values of k that are too low in peat has been attributed to at least two technique related problems as discussed by surridge et al 2005 a the development of well skins around the intake of the piezometer during slug tests and 2 smearing of peat around the piezometer intake during installation which was not removed due to insufficient development of the piezometer additionally if the piezometer intake is in contact with peat layers of different k as may be the case in a situation of layered heterogeneity the values obtained are likely to represent the higher k layers surridge et al 2005 seo and choe 2001 surridge et al 2005 suggested several modifications for the design of piezemeters to mitigate these sources of error however these design modifications cannot address the broader issue of scale dependency of k in both time and space nor detecting finer scale variations in k between individual sampling points slug tests are also limited by their application of a small instantaneous hydraulic stress over a relatively small test volume determined by the capacity of pore fluids to flow toward a piezometer tube 4 1 4 aquifer pumping tests conventional aquifer pumping tests were developed to determine the hydraulic properties of aquifers averaged over a much larger test volume bear 1972 ingebritsen et al 2006 more recently pumping tests have been applied to a much smaller and more manageable portion of an aquifer or watershed hogan et al 2006 the advantages of these mini aquifer tests are three fold first they use multiple measurements of head from an array of monitoring wells to calibrate a single groundwater flow equation under the application of a persistent hydrostatic stress second they provide improved solutions to the inverse problem of determining k by using a calibration method that uses multiple pilot points and inverse regularization third a persistent pumping operation has sufficient strength to mobilize pools of biogenic gas within a peat profile this method is not directly comparable to the results of slug tests which employ a much lower hydraulic stress over a much smaller model domain hogan et al 2006 van der schaaf 2004 mini aquifer tests are also not comparable to laboratory methods for the reasons outlined above 4 2 distribution of k in the red lake ii bog the mini aquifer tests yielded high values for k within two similar but contrasting bog landforms of the red lake peatland fig 1 figs a1 a3 in appendix a both of these bog landforms are primarily distinguished by the relative abundance of tree and sedge cover despite their similar water chemistry and species assemblages glaser et al 1981 nevertheless the range in k values from the bog forest and bog lawn differed by 2 orders of magnitude fig 2 at the bog forest most k values ranged from 4 to 5 10 5 m s 1 4 to 5 10 3 cm s 1 in the uppermost peat 0 5 1 m and 1 10 5 to 7 10 6 m s 1 in the deeper peat below 2 4 m these values are comparable to those reported for silty sand according to davis 1969 and freeze and cherry 1979 they also fall within the same range as those previously reported by chason et al 1986 for their slug test and lab permeameter measurements from a bog forest in a nearby peatland in contrast the bulk of the calculated k values within the bog lawn site were much higher ranging from 1 to 1 8 10 3 m s 1 for the uppermost peat and 3 to 5 10 4 m s 1 for the peat below 2 4 m comparable to those found in medium to coarse grained sands freeze and cherry 1979 the k values from the two bog sites in the red lake peatland are several orders of magnitude higher than most of those previously reviewed for peat by rycroft et al 1975 and also significantly higher than those reported for deeper peat 1 m depth in recent reviews using a range of different methods from other peatlands e g rycroft et al 1975 lewis et al 2012 clymo 2004 rezanezhad et al 2016 at both of the red lake bog sites k values declined below 2 4 m depth and became less variable with most determinations varying by only a factor of 8 0 6 to 5 10 5 m s 1 under the bog forest site and by a factor of about 6 0 3 to 1 7 10 3 m s 1 under the bog lawn site these ranges in k values support the expectation of a two layered diplotelmic peat profile with respect to its capacity to transport pore fluids e g ingram 1983 although a 3 layered deposit may also be possible at red lake if the highly conductive near surface peat was also included e g morris and waddington 2011 however the optimized k values for the rlii bog indicate that the entire peat profile of both test sites remains highly conductive to the flow of pore fluids in fact the optimized k values for the bog lawn site are very high even in the deeper 1 4 m depth peat strata the mini aquifer tests further indicate that k values do not decline exponentially with increasing depth contrary to the expectations of several coupled hydrophysical ecosystem models e g frolking et al 2001 2010 baird et al 2012 morris et al 2011a 2011b in both the holocene peat model and digibog k values are linked to rates of peat decomposition which decline exponentially with increasing depth an even more striking distinction of the red lake ii tests was the determination of distinctly different patterns of anisotropy with respect to k across the 940 m3 model domain of both test sites 4 3 relationship of k to the botanical composition of the peat fabric as a first approximation the hydraulic conductivity of peat is generally considered to be a function of its botanical composition and degree of decomposition baden and eggelsman 1963 in an early influential review synthesized a large dataset showing that peat composed of sphagnum remains has a lower range of k values than peat derived from sedge biomass for any given degree of decomposition this relationship can be explained because the small leaves of sphagnum once detached from stems can be packed into a tighter configuration under the weight of an accumulating peat mass than the coarser tissue fragments derived from decomposing sedges peat with more variable mixtures of bryophytes sedges and woody biomass becomes more challenging to relate its intrinsic permeability to its botanical composition for example there is considerable disagreement on the role of woody biomass with some authors suggesting that the occurrence of woody peat increases k values chason et al 1986 whereas others report it is responsible for the formation of aquitards rosenberry et al 2003 glaser et al 2004b the hydraulic conductivity of peat deposits has also been closely related to microbial decomposition which breaks down plant structures and decreases the permeability of plant litter according to the 2 layered model of peat deposits sensu ingram 1983 this process is most rapid in the upper aerobic layers of peat deposits acrotelm but continues below at a much slower rate in the deeper anoxic peat of the catotelm both the digibog and holocene peat growth models accept these assumptions incorporating an exponential decay function that increases with depth in the catotelm the occurrence of relatively unhumified bryophyte remains down to 3 m depth in both of the red lake ii profiles therefore implies a very short residence time in the uppermost aerobic strata in which decay rates are most rapid this assumption is consistent with the observation of rapid accretion rates across the forested bog zone proposed by glaser and janssens 1986 and gorham et al 2003 however the mini aquifer tests also determined complex patterns of k values at red lake that deviated from the idealized expectations of both the existing models and the botanical composition of the peat the average k values at both sites remained high comparable to that of a silty to fine to coarse grained sand providing no support for a non conductive deeper zone that could be considered the catotelm sensu ingram 1983 although the k values did decline down to a depth of 2 4 m at both sites the upper zone of declining k values occurred within the upper strata of relatively unhumified sphagnum peat moreover a box plot analysis showed a very narrow range in k values in the catotelm at both sites with no consistent decline with increasing depth despite the marked changes in botanical composition and degree of decomposition figs 2 and 3 and appendix c however the greatest departure from expectations was the localized zones of higher or lower k values that extended vertically through the entire peat profile at both sites 4 4 sources of spatial variability the mini aquifer tests determined that the bog forest and bog lawn domains were characterized by different distributional patterns of k despite their similar peat stratigraphy the most conspicuous departures were plume like zones of low k values that extend vertically through the center of the bog forest domain and upper corners of the bog lawn domain figs 5 7 in addition the bog lawn domain is distinguished by thick ribbon like zones of high k values resembling conduits that extend vertically through the central axis of the domain with arms radiating outward to the margins in an inverted y shaped pattern fig 6 all of these vertically oriented regions of apparently anomalous k values were apparently produced by the pumping operation since they are otherwise inexplicable in relation to the consistently horizontal bedding planes of the peat strata two likely mechanisms for their formation are 1 peat compression induced by dewatering of the peat pores or 2 the mobilization of bubble pools induced by the pumping operation both mechanisms assume that peat is a weak and easily deformable porous medium because of its exceptionally high water content hobbs 1986 price and schlotzhauer 1999 schlotzhauer and price 1999 price 2003 glaser et al 2004b whittington and price 2006 the removal of pore water by either a persistent pumping operation or a localized outward flow from under the weight of observers can lead to peat compression as an increasing fraction of the overburden pressure is transferred from the pore fluids at depth to the solid phase peat matrix hemond and goldman 1985 chow et al 1992 price 2003 whittington and price 2006 fritz et al 2008 this process could reduce the intrinsic permeability of the peat deposit and also lower its specific yield because a more densely packed peat particles will retain more pore water by capillary tension when drained whittington and price 2006 the compression hypothesis is primarily suggested by the location of a plume like zone of low k values directly under the position of the pumping well within the bog forest domain fig 5 however the extraction of pore waters by the pumping well would also substantially decrease the overburden pressure since pore water represents more than 90 of the wet mass of peat e g hobbs 1986 chow et al 1992 glaser et al 2012 slide c7 appendix c in addition no evidence was detected for localized subsidence by the line level measurements at either test site moreover the mini aquifer tests determined high values for specific yield 3 4 10 2 m that are not indicative of compression induced by subsidence finally the pumping well was not located over a similar zone of low k values within the bog lawn domain fig 6 in contrast the bog lawn domain was dominated by conduit like zones of very high k values that extend vertically from the bottom to the top of the domain a more reasonable explanation for the anisotropic distribution of k in both model domains is therefore peat deformations induced by biogenic gas bubbles 4 5 biogenic gas as a determinant of k the fine scale distribution of k in the red lake peatland can best be explained by the storage and release of biogenic gas bubbles within a highly deformable peat matrix the 24 hour pump tests produced an hydraulic stress of 4 8 mb which is equivalent to the stress produced by the steep drops in atmospheric pressure that were measured at the bog forest site in 1997 the three largest of these drops in atmospheric pressure were calculated to release an average of 30 g of ch4 per event glaser et al 2004b further evidence of the existence of free phase gas in the deep portions of the peat profile were observations of gas bubbles erupting from deep bore holes mixtures of gas and pore fluids ejected from deelply installed piezometers and mri magnetic resonance imaginging scans of gas bubbles ejected from large dimater peat cores such high releases of methane are explicable because of the high production rates of ch4 and co2 that have been determined in deep pore waters of the red lake and glacial lake agassiz peatlands corbett 2012 corbett et al 2013 2015 moreover large pools of biogenic gas have been determined across the red lake and adjacent glacial lake agassix peatlands from 1990 through 2008 romanowicz 1993 romanowicz et al 1995 chasar et al 2000a 2000b chasar 2002 rosenberry et al 2003 glaser et al 2004b 2016 parsekian et al 2010 2011 corbett 2012 the transport of bubbles within deep peat deposits is often assumed to be constrained by the rigid geometry of the peat pores e g coulthard et al 2003 rezanezhad et al 2010 wright et al 2018 according to this mechanism bubbles can lower the hydraulic conductivity of peat by occluding the peat pores particularly in near surface strata e g dinel et al 1988 reynolds et al 1992 beckwith and baird 2001 the other mechanism assumes that bubbles have the capacity to push apart the weak peat fabric and create zones of secondary porosity rosenberry et al 2003 glaser et al 2004b secondary porosity can be created if the internal pressures within a bubble exceeds the sum of the resisting forces generated by 1 the overburden pressure and 2 the mechanical strength of the peat skeleton glaser et al 2004b alternatively bubbles can become trapped within more competent peat strata in which woody structures confer greater mechanical strength to the peat fabric rosenberry et al 2003 glaser et al 2004b a sudden drop in the resisting forces could therefore trigger an ebullition event in which swarms of bubbles are released from deep confining strata and rise to the surface en masse creating a plume like stream this mechanism fits the results of the mini aquifer test if the bubbles are small and only partially block the peat pores within zones of low k values overall the distributional patterns of k at the rlii bog sites provide support for the existence of three different modes of bubble transport proposed by fechner levy and hemond 1996 glaser et al 2004b and coulthard et al 2003 the mini aquifer results from the bog forest site for example can best be explained by the transport mode proposed by glaser et al 2004b the wood layer at 3 m depth apparently created an effective trap for small methane bubbles rising from deeper production zones as the bubbles accumulated they partially blocked the peat pores throughout the deeper peat producing a zone of lower k values that is characteristic of this layer the pumping operation triggered a localized release of these bubbles which converged into a spheroidal shaped region marked by lower k values 10 6 m 1 s 1 as they pierced through a zone of weakness in the wood layer figs 5 and 11 the bubble swarm then apparently expanded outward into a plume like stream of small bubbles on its rise to the surface this general model of methane bubble entrapment and escape is analogous to the rise of salt diapirs that deform the sea bed on the floor of the gulf of mexico e g schultz ela et al 1993 dooley et al 2017 dooley and hudec 2017 kramer and shedd 2017 in contrast the much higher k values determined for the bog lawn domain seem to be the result of higher bubble fluxes these k values are 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those determined for the bog forest site fig 4 suggesting a greater capacity for methane bubbles to maintain open passageways as the bubble streams dilate the pore space and vertically push pore waters ahead of them through the peat fig 11 further support for this dilation hypothesis is provided by the core scans figs 2 and 3 appendix c which show a visibly looser and more porous fabric at the bog lawn site particulary in the upper 0 3 m depth layers of sphagnum dominated peat the corresponding sphagnum strata at the bog forest site are not only denser but are also strengthened by more woody structures the fine scale distributional patterns of k at the bog lawn site therefore support a hybrid model of bubble transport that combines 1 episodic and massive releases of bubble swarms from deep confining layers sensu glaser et al 2004b with 2 a more continuous fluxes of bubbles through well defined ribbon like conduits sensu the bubble tracks of fechner levy and hemond 1996 and 3 the more diffuse continuous fluxes through the pore matrix of coulthard et al 2003 ramirez et al 2015 4 6 k as a driver for bog landform development the results of the mini aquifer tests have implications beyond the immediate test sites the red lake bog sites are located on mesoscale peat landforms that are characteristic of all large 20 km2 bog complexes within the forested bog region as mapped by glaser and janssens 1986 and glaser 1992b this region extends across the mid continental portion of north america south of the permafrost belt glaser et al 1981 and later glaser 1992a 1992b proposed that the surface patterns of these large 160 km2 bog complexes of the red lake peatland are indicative of a common developmental sequence they further propose that this sequence is governed by feedbacks among the hydrology vegetation and the material properties of the peat their analysis was based on the assumptions that 1 rising water tables favor the replacement of trees and shrubs by sedges 2 sedge dominated stands e g carex oligosperma produce more permeable peat than that laid down by trees and shrubs and 3 runoff draining from the forested bog crest will be channeled into zones dominated by sedges the feedback system originates at the forested bog crests as surface runoff is progressively channeled into linear zones dominated by sedges bog drains which expand farther downslope into broad non forested lawns dominated by carex oligosperma and sphagnum the mini aquifer tests at the red lake ii bog forest and bog lawn support the basic assumption that sedges lay down more permeable peat than the woody peat under the forested bog crest however these tests also suggest that the actual mechanism driving this feedback system may involve unexpected linkages of biogenic gas bubbles to the hydraulic conductivity of the peat chanton et al 2008 has reported isotopic evidence showing that sedge dominated areas produce more labile doc dissolved organic carbon than areas dominated by woody vegetation these labile organic compounds can then be transported downward into the peat column and stimulate methane production this linkage has been verified by isotopic analysis of ch4 doc and the solid phase peat e g chanton et al 1995 2008 chasar et al 2000a 2000b corbett et al 2013 corbett et al 2015 glaser et al 2016 the mini aquifer tests further suggest that higher rates of methane production can lead to higher k values as bubble streams dilate the peat pores 5 conclusions the mini aquifer method offers several important advantages for determining the 3d distribution of k on a fine scale over a large 940 m3 model domain in peatlands first the tests use multiple monitoring wells and over a hundred pilot points to calibrate a single groundwater flow equation with the aid of pest this method therefore provides a statistically reliable method for determining the fine scale distribution of k in contrast to interpolating discrete scaler values from separate sampling points second a sustained pumping operation is capable of mobilizing biogenic gas pools that may have accumulated in the peat the mini aquifer tests therefore provide a means to determine the capacity of gas bubbles to either dilate or form local obstructions within the interconnected pore space the rlii bog tests also support a 2 layered concept of peat deposits orignally proposed by ingam 1983 composed of a highly permeable upper layer i e acrotelm and a much less permeable deeper layer i e catotelm the principal exceptions to this classic 2 layered concept at the rlii bog sites is the deeper extension of the upper more permeable layer to 2 4 m depth and the still highly permeable deeper peat that extends down to the mineral substratum an even more striking departure from expectations was the highly heterogeneous distribution of k throughout both model domains these distributional patterns seem to be indicative of local peat deformations produced by three different modes of bubble transport 1 swarms of bubbles rising from ruptures in deep confining layers 2 continuous bubble fluxes through ribbon like conduits and 3 background bubble fluxes dispersing through the peat matrix these insights might otherwise be masked by relying on statistical averaged values of k

4743,hydraulic conductivity k is a key but problematic parameter in groundwater models particularly those that simulate flow in weak readily deformable media such as peat deposits as a result k represents a critical source of error in models that couple hydrological processes with the carbon balance of peatlands a globally important source for greenhouse gases we therefore conducted mini aquifer tests on two mesoscale bog landforms within the large 1300 km2 red lake peatland of northern minnesota these tests offer the dual advantage of determining the fine scale distribution of k within a large 900 m3 model domain in addition the stress created by a 24 h pumping operation should be capable of mobilizing pools of biogenic gases thoughout a deep peat deposit the pumping results were monitored by 24 to 38 wells in order to calibrate a 3d finite volume groundwater model with the aid of pest parameter estimation analysis high k values were determined at a bog forest 10 5 to 10 6 m s 1 and bog lawn 10 3 to 10 4 m s 1 sites throughout their deep 4 m peat profiles these tests also detected vertically continuous zones of unexpectedly high or low k values in contrast to the horizontal bedding planes and increasing degree of decomposition with depth the vertical k zones are suggestive of three different modes of bubble transport that either locally dilate or partially block the peat pores in addition the tests provided new insights on a conceptual model linking k to the development of all large 20 km2 forested bog complexes in mid continental boreal north america keywords peatlands hydraulic conductivity biogenic gas bubbles mini aquifer test pest parameter estimation analysis 1 introduction among all terrestrial ecosystems peatlands are probably the most closely coupled to hydrological processes e g sjörs 1963 charman 2002 rydin and jeglum 2013 unlike any other terrestrial ecosystem peatlands develop three dimensional landforms that are almost entirely composed of fluids and dead biomass weber 1902 sjörs 1948 these organic landforms create an unusual porous medium in which biotic processes determine the physical fabric of the medium itself while still being under the direct control of hydrological processes on one hand peat only accumulates in hydrogeologic settings that allow saturated soil profiles to persist whereas the differentiation of bogs and fens is determined by the transport of mineral solutes from external sources on the other hand biotic processes determine the composition of the porous medium itself which consists of the incompletely decomposed remains of plant litter furthermore the generation of biogenic gas bubbles can alter the peat fabric creating either secondary porosity or local aquitards this close coupling between the biotic and hydrological processes is most strikingly manifested by the peat landform patterns that characterize the largest peat basins of the boreal zone in north america sjörs 1963 heinselman 1963 glaser et al 1981 2004a the close coupling between biotic and physical processes creates both challenges and opportunities for applying mathematical groundwater models to understand the carbon dynamics and developmental pathways of large peatlands numerical models that attempt to simulate porewater flow through peat deposits rely on measurements of hydraulic conductivity k which can vary by over several orders of magnitude within just a few meters both vertically or horizontally e g ingram 1983 rycroft et al 1975 chason et al 1986 kneale 1987 waddington and roulet 1997 beckwith et al 2003 holden and burt 2003 clymo 2004 lewis et al 2012 rezanezhad et al 2016 the spatially variable nature of k in many peatlands introduces another important source of error for parameterizing groundwater models in peat deposits since the size of the model domain and the size of the cells with which the domain has been discretized is usually greater than the scale at which determinations of the hydraulic parameters are made bromley and robinson 1995 baird et al 1997 hydraulic conductivity k which is a measure of the ease with which water flows through a porous medium is the proportionality coefficient in darcy s law 1 q k h where q is the water flux in units of length per unit time l t k is the hydraulic conductivity of the material l t and h is the hydraulic head l hydraulic properties can be evaluated throughout the model domain by solving the inverse problem in which the distribution of the dependent variable hydraulic head is the best known aspect of the system and the distribution of the independent variable hydraulic conductivity is the least well known in situations in which a large number of measurements need to be collected in order to capture finer scale heterogeneity in a porous medium calibration of the model is subject to several sources of error 1 1 heterogeneity and anisotropy an important source of error in groundwater modeling occurs when the model calibration process seeks to infer a unique parameter set which in all but the most homogenous environments is inherently non unique moore and doherty 2006 according to moore and doherty 2006 errors associated with an ill defined inverse problem can be mitigated by the use of a proper regularization strategy coupled with a sufficient number of monitoring points for parameterization of the model domain as a means of addressing this problem automated calibration undertaken with parameterization from a series of pilot points sensu doherty 2003 and regularized inversion can be used to account for finer scale heterogeneity in the model domain 1 2 scale dependence as a volume averaged parameter the hydraulic conductivity of any porous medium would be expected to be scale sensitive particularly in one as hetergeneous as a peat deposit aquifer pumping tests for example typically yield higher estimates of k at the scale of an aquifer in comparison to slug tests i e borehole or piezometer tests which measure k within a much smaller test volume immediately surrounding a piezometer screen similarly slug tests typically produce higher estimates of k than those derived from permeameter experiments on small 1 m3 samples in the laboratory this relationship has usually been explained by the increasing probability of intersecting a macropore or some other preferred conduit for water transport within larger test volumes e g kiraly 1975 bredehoeft et al 1993 garvin 1986 herzog and morse 1984 carrera 1993 rovey and cherkauer 1995 butler and healey 1998 schulze makuch et al 1999 but see hsieh 1998 ingebritsen et al 2006 conversely gas bubbles produced by methanogenesis in peat deposits can locally dilate the peat fabric glaser et al 2004b or occlude pores creating local aquitards e g reynolds et al 1992 beckwith and baird 2001 rosenberry et al 2003 glaser et al 2004b the hydraulic conductivity of peat deposits would therefore be expected to vary both laterally and vertically given the heterogeneous nature of peat deposits and their increasing degree of decomposition with increasing depth recently mini aquifer tests have been designed to provide estimates of k across a much larger test volume than is possible with lab permeameters or slug tests but at a more manageable scale than that of a regional aquifer mini aquifer tests have the further advantage of yielding fine scale estimates of k over a 3d model domain by utilizing an array of piezometers to measure the drawdown induced by a pumping operation these data can then be used to calibrate a 3d finite volume groundwater model with the aid of pilot points and inverse regularization finally the sustained pumping operation of a mini aquifer test should be capable of creating an hydraulic stress of sufficient strength to mobilize pools of biogenic gases within a deep peat profile 1 3 sampling bias related to study area another challenge is presented by the variable size of peatlands across the northern hemisphere smaller peatlands 20 km2 are preferentially selected for study because of their proximity to roads and local power grids however their size and limited water storage also makes them especially vulnerable to human and climatic perturbations in contrast the immense size 1000 km2 of the major peat basins of north america imposes a considerablle barrier to field work while also conferring an effective buffer to disturbance because of their enormous water storage capacity in addition these large peat basins contain striking mesoscale landform patterns that seem to represent a stable adjustment of the vegetation and across large areas to local changes in water chemistry and water levels the question remains whether these mesoscale landform patterns are also characterized by discrete ranges of k and thus can be interpreted as stages in peatland development sensu glaser et al 1981 glaser et al 2004a the discovery of large pools of greenhouse gases in the deep 2 5 m peat deposits of northern minnesota e g romanowicz 1993 romanowicz et al 1995 chasar et al 2000ab chasar 2002 rosenberry et al 2003 glaser et al 2004b parsekian et al 2010 2011 corbett 2012 corbett et al 2013 2015 reeve et al 2013 raises still further questions whether biogenic gas bubbles are capable of altering the hydraulic properties of these peat landforms we therefore conducted a mini aquifer tests on two distinct bog landforms in the 1300 km2 red lake peatland of northwestern minnsesota fig 1 the objectives of this study were to determine 1 the fine scale 3d distribution of k within two large bog landforms 2 if these distributional patterns of k are related to the botanical stratigraphy or other factors and 3 the reliability of a conceptual model that links the development of these landforms to the accumulation of peat with contrasting hydraulic properties mini aquifer tests offer several important advantages for studying these problems not only do these tests cover a larger test volume than is possible with individual slug tests or lab permeaters but they also apply a perisistent hydrostatic stress across a large test volume that should be sufficient to mobilize any biogenic gas present in the peat profile finally peatlands larger than 1000 km2 offer opportunities to select field sites that lack any evidence of past disturbance from fires or drainage ditches 2 methods 2 1 study sites two mini aquifer tests were conducted in july and august of 2008 on the central bog complex red lake ii in glaser et al 1981 of the 1300 km2 red lake peatland in northern minnesota fig 1 the forested bog crest 48 15 n 94 41 w and non forested bog lawn 48 16 n 94 42 w in this bog complex are typical of all large bogs within the forested bog region delineated by glaser and janssens 1986 and glaser 1992b the bog forest site in the red lake peatland fig a1 and a2 in appendix a is forested with an open stand of black spruce picea mariana and a continuous mat of sphagnum growing over fallen tree trunks and branches the shrub layer under the forest canopy is composed of leatherleaf chamaedaphne calyculata labrador tea rhododendron groenlandicum and other ericaceous shrubs the bog lawn site fig a1 and fig a3 in appendix a in contrast is located 1 8 km downslope in the middle of a broad sphagnum lawn sensu glaser et al 1981 dominated by a continuous carpet of sphagnum and a low stand of the sedge carex oligosperma large pools of biogenic gas have been reported under both of these sites from 1990 through 2008 romanowicz 1993 romanowicz et al 1995 chasar et al 2000ab chasar 2002 parsekian et al 2010 parsekian et al 2011 corbett 2012 corbett et al 2013 2015 reeve et al 2013 2 2 peat stratigraphy the peat stratigraphy across the red lake ii bog complex is based on the analysis of large diameter peat cores the stratigraphy was originally determined by janssens et al 1992 from a transect of long cores recovered from the peat surface to the underlying mineral substratum these data were supplemented by a set of additional cores recovered within 20 30 m of the mini aquifer tests all of the cores were recovered using a modified piston corer equipped with a steel core barrel 10 cm in diameter and a serrated cutting edge wright et al 1984 the entire peat profile was sampled by repeated drives down to the mineral substratum after extrusion from the corer the peat cores were wrapped in plastic and stored in longitudinally split sections of pvc pipe for transport to cold rooms in the laboratory the new cores were first analyzed for wet bulk density by gamma ray attenuation with geotek multi sensor core logger the cores were next split into longitudinal sections and immediately imaged on a digital line scanner at 300 dpi the botanical stratigraphy and degree of decomposition of the peat were subsequently determined according to the troels smith 1955 method by examining small samples dispersed with water in a petri plate loss on ignition analyses were conducted on 1 cm3 sub samples at 5 cm depth intervals for determination of fluid content and dry bulk density 2 3 mini aquifer analysis each mini aquifer analysis comprised three tightly coupled components rhoades 2009 1 field measurements that monitored changes in hydraulic head within a piezometer array during a 24 hour pumping operation 2 multiple calibrations of a transient 3d groundwater model that was parameterized using pest based on inverse regulation and 113 pilot points sensu doherty 2003 2005 distributed evenly over a 940 m3 14 14 4 8 m model domain and 3 statistical analysis to optimize the goodness of fit between the simulated and actual field measurements the model simulations were run multiple times first to determine the optimal size of a model domain that minimized edge effects and then to determine the closest agreement between the simulated and actual field data 2 3 1 piezometer design and arrays the pumping tests were conducted with a single pumping well combined with 24 to 38 monitoring wells i e piezometers at the bog forest and bog lawn sites respectively figs a4 and a5 in appendix a the wells were arranged within a 4 4 m array with the pumping well located at the origin and the monitoring wells radiating outward along two rows 90 from each other with an additional row 45 from the other two figs a4 and a5 in appendix a this systematic array was selected as the most efficient means to cover a 940 m3 test volume that was impacted by a 24 hour pumping operation while minimizing artifacts from adjacent monitoring wells all wells were constructed from polyvinyl chloride pipe with a 5 1 cm diameter for the pumping well and 2 5 cm diameter for the monitoring wells each well was fitted with a plug to prevent clogging during its insertion into the peat and a slotted intake screen the slotted screens of the pumping wells covered its entire length from the peat surface to the installation depth of 2 3 m whereas the monitoring wells each had a 30 cm slotted screen near their base which varied from 0 5 to 4 m depth in the peat profiles to measure hydraulic head all wells were first developed prior to the pump test by surging and scrubbing the intake screens from the inside with a bottle brush and removing the water and debris within the well multiple times a narrow floating boardwalk was constructed to minimize deformations to the peat surface during the well installation and pumping tests a line level was used to determine if the wells moved vertically during the pumping tests 2 3 2 pumping tests a low flow submersible pump was inserted into the pumping well during the pumping operation and the discharge water was routed 60 m downgradient from the piezometer array a constant flow rate was achieved using a flow control valve and rheostat to make small adjustments and achieve much lower constant flow rates then using a rheostat alone these precautions were necessary at the bog forestt site where a low pumping rate is required to avoid dewatering the well the optimal pumping rates were determined prior to the pumping test in order to devise a method by which the flow rate could be continuously monitored the flow rates for the bog forest and bog lawn sites were kept at 3 3 10 6 and 4 8 10 5 m3 sec 1 respectively water levels in the monitoring wells were monitored throughout the 24 hour duration of the pumping tests using a combination of solinst pressure transducers and electric water level indicators measurements were taken throughout the 24 hour duration of the pumping tests using a combination of solinst pressure transducers and manual tape reels all waterlevel measurements were converted to drawdowns by calculating the difference between the initial and each new succeeding water level barologgers used to measure the atmospheric pressure were employed to correct water pressure measurements for changes in atmospheric pressure 2 4 ground water flow modeling we first assumed that the pumping tests created a transient flow field within the saturated peat that was simulated by 2 s c ϑ h ϑ t k h w where sc is the specific storage m 1 which changes from ss saturated specific storage to sy partially saturated specific storage per unit layer thickness when a layer is partially saturated h is hydraulic head m t is time s k is hydraulic conductivity m s 1 and w is the pumping well discharge m3 s 1 eq 2 was coded into a 3d finite volume numerical groundwater model appendix b using fipy an object oriented partial differential equation solver written in python van rossum and drake 2001 the model uses the finite volume method to solve coupled sets of partial differential equations wheeler et al 2007 calibration of the model was undertaken using pest doherty 2005 a nonlinear parameter estimator that facilitates model calibration by automatically adjusting parameters until the fit between model outputs and measured values is optimized by a weighted least squares approach the robustness of these simulations was tested by statistical methods recommended by cooley and naff 1990 and the results compared to botanical composition and scanned images of large diameter peat cores collected adjacent to the sampling area a model domain of 14 14 4 8 m was selected after calibrating various sized domains to identify the optimum size of the model domain that minimizes artifacts introduced by the boundary conditions while remaining computationally efficient the model domain was then discretized to provide higher resolution near the pumping well with the cell size increased by a factor of 1 2 at distances greater than 1 m from the well the domain was further divided into five uniformly thick layers that cumulatively totaled 4 8 m which was slightly larger than the estimated thickness of peat in the study area the square model domain was discretized into an odd number of cubes in order to provide a cell node that lies in the center of the model fig a6 in appendix a this arrangement insures that the cell center was in a location that corresponded with the well cluster locations at the field sites after the model domain was discretized k values were interpolated to the nodes of the mesh from the locations points at which the values are assigned and fixed head constant value boundary conditions were assigned to all exterior model boundaries the top and bottom of the model were assigned the default no flow boundary condition after defining boundary conditions values of hydraulic head and pumping rate were initialized as the model was run the continuous removal of water from the pumping well causes some of the cells to desaturate in the uppermost layer of the model domain these dry cells occur when the calculated head in that cell falls below the base of the cell as noted by doherty 2001 dry cells cause model convergence problems and result in poor performance of nonlinear parameter estimation such as pest to remedy the effects of dry cells a desaturation routine was implemented according to the work of doherty 2001 stepping through time the model solves the transient flow equation eq 2 and updates values of hydraulic head based on k and the pumping rate during each iteration the drawdowns for each monitoring well are calculated and saved to a text file to be used in the model calibration 2 5 model calibration model calibration was accomplished with pest which minimizes the sum of weighted squared discrepancies between model outputs and measured values the optimization algorithm adjusts the values for model parameters to decrease the objective function s value after completion of a model run output files are generated and compared to the corresponding observations using model output instruction files once the model has undergone an iteration the model being run at least as many times as there are adjustable parameters the objective function and jacobian matrix are calculated this process is repeated until the stopping criteria are met figs a7 in appendix a and appendix b pest uses the gauss marquardt levenberg gml method of parameter estimation the levenberg 1944 method which combines the gradient descent and newton s methods of parameter estimation was modified by marquardt 1963 to remedy hemstitching wherein successive parameter improvements result in oscillations across a long and narrow objective function valley instead of reaching the local minima in this valley and proceeding downgradient within this valley doherty and skahill 2006 skahill and doherty 2006 note that the gml method implemented in pest is advantageous because it can be modified by the inclusion of regularization devices to maintain numerical stability 2 6 parameterization model calibration proceeded by varying the parameter values and also the number of points to which parameters are assigned increasing the number of parameters may better represent the heterogeneity of the system but at the cost of increasing the sum of squares errors between calculated and observed values and thus the reliability of the estimated parameters yeh 1986 unfortunately overparameterized systems have a high degree of non uniqueness that can can come at the cost of nonuniqueness of the parameter set moore and doherty 2006 this problem can be avoided by incorporating parameter structure into the estimation process by using either zones of uniform property value or interpolation to the model grid from a set of nodal points located throughout the model in this study we calibrated the hydraulic conductivity parameters in the models using the pilot point approach since the zonation approach is normally used to represent medium to coarse scale variability in hydraulic properties moore and doherty 2006 for the interpolation method we used adjusted hydraulic conductivity values throughout the calibration procedure at 133 pilot points evenly distributed throughout the two model domains fig a6 in appendix a these points are used to interpolate the model parameter to all cells of model domain although the distribution of k is the primary focus of the investigation the transient simulation requires that storage values are also be assigned to the model instead of using previously determined values of specific storage and specific yield these parameters were assigned using the zonation approach with one value representing each of the five model layers provided with initial values and upper and lower bounds that cannot be transgressed values of specific storage in the case of fully saturated material and specific yield in the case of partially saturated material were optimized along with k values a multi quadric radial basis function made available in scipy jones et al 2001 was used with a minimal smoothing parameter to interpolate parameter values from the points to the grid however as noted by doherty 2003 increasing the number of pilot points used to characterize a model domain decreases the dependence of the interpolation process on the variogram selected for this domain and creates a situation in which the location of the pilot points matters less 2 7 regularization to counteract the shortcomings of parameterization we used regularized inversion a regularization strategy is a mathematical technique that provides numerical stability to an overparameterized inverse problem through the introduction of an appropriate constraint on parameter values cristina et al 1994 doherty 2005 doherty and skahill 2006 inversion is the process by which model parameter values are inferred from measurements by matching model outputs to these measurements moore and doherty 2006 where the task of the parameter estimation process is to minimize a global objective function eq 2 the existence of nonequal or nonpreferred parameter values causes the global objective function ϕ g to experience a penalty because pest seeks to minimize the parameter differences thus increasing parameter uniformity across the model domain doherty 2003 2005 we used one of the more widely used regularization schemes that imposes a smoothing constraint where the differences between neighboring parameter values are minimized 3 ϕ g ϕ m μ ϕ r where ϕg is the global objective function ϕm is the measurement objective function μ is the regularization weight factor and ϕr is the regularization objective function according to doherty 2003 2005 imposing regularization in the form of a smoothing constraint removes the necessity to define a zonation scheme in advance of the parameter estimation process so the calibration process itself decides where heterogeneity must exist within the model to provide the best match between model outcomes and field measurements where heterogeneity does not need to exist to provide an optimum fit parameter uniformity will prevail as a result of the regularized parameter estimation process giving a spatial distribution that is more likely to approximate geological reality rather than an artifact forced by the application of zones with uniform hydraulic properties doherty 2003 2005 this procedure provides the benefits of a highly parameterized system without incurring reduced numerical stability and high parameter correlation for each of the 133 pilot points at least one equation was written stating that the difference of the log transformed k values between it and its closest neighbor be zero if possible these regularization functions are included in the parameter estimation process as prior information equations because there are five layers in the model representing the layered structure of the model domain prior information equations were not defined between points located in different horizontal layers in this manner the model domain is preferentially homogeneous in the horizontal direction whereas incorporating parameter structure into the model based on knowledge of the peat stratigraphy allows more heterogeneity in the vertical direction 2 8 model analysis all model simulations were first tested to determine if the simulated dependent variable values fit a valid regression using methods suggested for ground water inverse modeling by cooley and naff 1990 we further assessed this fit by comparing the weighted simulated and observed values to a regression line with a slope equal to 1 0 and an intercept of zero hill 1998 the weighted residuals of these regressions were then analyzed for independence and normality by three levels of statisitical tests normal probability plots probability density functions sokal and rohlf 1996 and shapiro wilks s w tests shapiro and wilks 1965 this latter test is a more powerful test than the kolmogrorov smirnov k s goodness of fit test because k s is more sensitive to extreme values and focuses on extreme departures from the hypothesized distribution while s w focuses on the average departure from the hypothesized distribution 3 results 3 1e peat stratigraphy the bog forest and bog lawn sites are underlain by more than 4 m of peat which completely covers the underlying mineral sediments across the central rlii watershed both sites are characterized by similar peat stratigraphy indicating a common developmental pathway but one that reached different stages in the development of a large bog complex sensu glaser et al 2004a each coring site has a deep upper layer of sphagnum dominated peat that extends downward from 0 to 3 m depth figs 2 and 3 in appendix c this stratigraphic pattern is typical of ombrotrophic raised bogs in the red lake ii bog complex janssens et al 1992 and also northern minnesota glaser and janssens 1986 however the sphagnum stratum at the bog forest site is more compact with a greater abundance of woody material whereas this layer is distinguished by the variable abundance of sedge shoots rootlets and woody elements with variable degrees of decomposition under the bog lawn both sites have a woody fen layer at a depth of about 3 m at the bog fen boundary this boundary is marked by a transition from sphagnum remains above to the remains of minerotrophic mosses e g scorpidium scorpiodes calliergon trifarium and campylium stellatum with sedge shoots these feather mosses are typical of a rich fen forest all the major and minor bedding planes have a consistent horizontal orientation including the bog fen boundary at about 3 m depth although the peat stratigraphy at both coring sites generally becomes more decomposed with increasing depth the degree of decomposition tends to be more variable within in the bog lawn cores in addition the peat tends to be visibly more porous throughout the bog lawn profile except for the more deeply humified woody strata at about 3 m depth overall the water content exceeds 90 of the wet mass appendix c slide 8 whereas the organic content is consistently greater than 90 of the dry mass determined by loss on ignition the base of each core is transitional across a 2 cm depth interval grading into a clayey silty sand and gravel in the underlying mineral deposits appendix c contains detailed lithologic descriptions of the peat cores 3 2 mini aquifer tests measured drawdowns water levels in all the monitoring wells generally fell as a function of time and distance from the pumping well but not always coherently with depth at both sites rhoades 2009 figs a8 a9 in appendix a at the bog lawn site the measured drawndown curves had a similar shape with the most rapid rate of drawdown measured within the first 25 000 s 7 h of the pumping operation after 7 h of pumping the drawdown curves generally became increasingly asymptotic with a much lower rate of declining water level the drawdown curves for the various depth intervals were coherent in most wells at the bog lawn and retained a similar trajectory with increasing distance from the pumping well however the curves for the piezometers at 1 and 2 m depth were consistently inverted in several of the wells despite the steep rate of drawdown recorded in all piezometers within the first 25 000 s the water levels continued to fall as much as 2 cm afterwards by the end of the pumping test about 24 h even in the most distant piezometers but not at 3 m depth at the ends of the transects in contrast two main types of drawdown curves were apparant at the bog forest site drawdown curves were similar in the wells closest to the pumping well corresponding to the general pattern of drawdown measured in all the bog lawn piezometers the principal exceptions were the drawdown curves in the deeper peizometers at increasing distance from the pumping well although there was an initially rapid rate of drawdown for all the bog crest piezometers only those closest to the pumping well became asymptotic after 7 h of pumping in the more distant piezometers water levels continued to fall at a relatively steep rate after 20 000 s i e 5 6 h of pumping although at a slower rate as the pumping operation progressed thereafter some of the drawdown curves for different depth intervals overlapped and were sometimes inverted in several wells along the transects these measurements are indicative of considerable variability in the hydraulic properties of the peat both vertically and horizontally 3 3 groundwater model simulations 3 3 1 bog forest site the numerical model for the bog forest site was run using a timestep of 100 s to reach a total time of 25 000 s approximately 7 h this time interval was selected because it included a the period of most rapid drawdown in the water table in most of the monitoring wells b the greatest number of measurements made both manually and with pressure transducers allowing an estimation of measurment errors 0 5 cm c because of its computational efficiency and d because the hydraulic stress created by this period of pumping was was roughly equivalent to that produced by the steep drops in atmospheric pressure measured at the bog forest site in 1997 sensu glaser et al 2004b calibration targets for the model are the measured drawdowns from the 24 monitoring wells at times of 1000 2000 3000 4000 6000 8000 10 000 15 000 20 000 and 25 000 s only the model cells closest to the pumping well desaturated i e calculated head fell below the base of the cell requiring the desaturation routine as described above the average k values across the model domain remained relatively high ranging from about 7 7 10 5 m s 1 in the uppermost peat to about 4 7 10 6 m s 1 in the deeper peat below 3 m fig 4 the highest and most variable values for k were determined in the upper portion 0 0 5 m of the peat profile whereas the average k values declined at deeper depths and were least variable below 2 4 m the spatial distribution of k varied both laterally and vertically with a prominent plume like zone of lower k values as low as 4 7 10 6 that bulges upward through the center of the domain fig 5 however the overall range of k within the bog domain remained within one order of magnitude of variation specific storage which is the volume of water released from storage per volume of aquifer per unit decline in hydraulic head was variable with depth ranging from 4 0 10 2 to 1 0 10 3 m 1 while the uppermost model layer was calibrated to a specific yield drainable porosity of 0 4 3 3 2 bog lawn site the overall plan for the bog lawn site was similar to that of the bog forest except for the locations and number of the 38 monitoring wells and calibration targets calibration targets for the model are the measured drawdowns from 38 monitoring wells at times of 1000 2000 4000 6000 9000 12000 15 000 18 000 21 000 and 25 000 s the optimized average k values were 2 orders of magnitude higher those determined for the bog crest domain ranging from 3 5 10 4 to 2 6 10 3 m s 1 fig 4 the best fit between measured and modeled drawdowns was achieved using a value of horizontal k kh that was ten times greater than vertical k kv with kh kv 10 this ratio is the same as that determined for the bog crest site and was achieved using the same methods as those described above the bog lawn domain is characterized by a general decline in the average optimzed k values with increasing depth from a depth of 0 5 to 2 4 m below which there is little further variability in average k values however the bog lawn domain is also distinguished by a pronounced degree of heterogeneity with respect to k both vertically and horizontally fig 6 the most striking departures from expected trends were 1 zones of low optimized k values overlying regions of higher k figs 6 and 7 2 conduit like zones of higher k values extending vertically through the entire model domain figs 6 and 7 and 3 plume like zones of low k values at the corners of the domain particularly the nw corner fig 6 similar to the calibration approach for the bog forest site no assumptions were made regarding the depth dependency or value of the initial and subsequently adjusted k values these values were allowed to fluctuate between upper and lower bounds of 1 0 10 1 and 1 0 10 10 m s 1 respectively even though this range exceeded the upper and lower bounds of k values previously reported for all peatlands the other striking departure from expected trends is the occurrence of localized zones of high k under zones of lower k fig 7 specific storage was found be variable with depth ranging from 2 9 10 2 to 7 1 10 3 m 1 while the uppermost model layer took on a specific yield drainable porosity of 0 4 3 4 statistical analysis of the optimized k values three levels of statistical tests were used to analyze the reliability of the model simulations for the bog forest and bog lawn sites we first determined whether the simulated dependent variable values indicate a valid regression using methods suggested for groundwater inverse modeling by cooley and naff 1990 the regression between the measured and modeled k values for the bog forest and bog lawn sites had correlation coefficients of 0 94 and 0 90 respectively indicating a good fit between the simulated and observed data fig 8 however a large range in the magnitudes of weighted observations can obscure trends in the differences between the weighted observations and the weighted simulated values this source of error could be applicable to the results from the bog forest site because the majority of the drawdowns were small and data points deviated from the regression line most noticeably near the origin of the plot despite the tight clustering of data fig 8 in contrast the drawdowns for the bog lawn site are more uniformly spread out and as a result the model more closely matched the measured drawdowns throughout the duration of the pumping test the reliability of the regressions were further tested by determining whether the weighted residuals the difference between weighted measured and weighted modeled drawdowns and weighted modeled values were independent and therefore indicated that the weighted residuals were normally distributed about a value of zero hill 1998 this condition particularly conforms to the results for the bog forest site fig 9 but is less visually conspicuous for the bog lawn fig 10 although the normality of the residuals can be assessed visually from a probability density function pdf a normal probability plot provides a better visual test for independent and normal weighted residuals cooley and naff 1990 hill 1998 figs 9 and 10 we therefore used normal probability plots to determine whether the weighted residuals were normally distributed about a mean of zero and therefore approximated a straight line while deviations from this line can be expected due to regression induced correlation hill and tiedeman 2007 residuals from both the bog forest and bog lawn regressions appear normally distributed and independent the residuals from both the bog forest and bog lawn simulations were further analyzed for normality using a shapiro wilk s w test which yielded w values of 0 98 and 0 96 respectively the p values for these tests were 1 3 10 3 indicating that the residuals from both sites are independent and do not appear to be non normally distributed since w is not substantially less than 1 4 discussion 4 1 k as a problematic parameter parameterizing groundwater models with reliable values for hydraulic conductivity remains problematic due to several sources of error ingebritsen et al 2006 a fundamental problem arises because k cannot be measured directly but must be inferred indirectly from model calibrations based on measurements of hydraulic head or the transport of tracers more serious problems arise from applying a volume averaged parameter such as k e g garvin 1986 to naturally occurring aquifers which are heterogeneous in space and time these problems are confounded by the standard methods used for determining k in the field which measure k over different test volumes i e control or support volumes using different equipment designs e g bear 1972 bredehoeft et al 1993 herzog and morse 1984 bradbury and muldoon 1990 rovey and cherkauer 1995 hsieh 1998 butler 1997 butler and healey 1998 schulze makuch et al 1999 bromley et al 2004 ingebritsen et al 2006 fallico et al 2012 it is therefore not surprising that measurements of k vary by 12 16 orders of magnitude or greater among various types of geologic materials davis 1969 ingebritsen et al 2006 a similar range of up to seven to 10 orders of magnitude has been reported from peatlands in north america and europe e g rycroft et al 1975 chason et al 1986 kneale 1987 lewis et al 2012 cunliffe et al 2013 rezanezhad et al 2016 peat deposits add an additional level of complexity to all determinations of k peat is an inherently weak porous medium as a result of its high water content usually 90 of wet weight in the glap that still retains a high degree of elastic strength because of its plant fibers and buried wood elements e g hobbs 1986 the interconnected pore space can therefore be altered by significant deformations induced by external or internally applied stresses such as surface loadings hemond and goldman 1985 changes in water levels price and schlotzhauer 1999 price 2003 holden and burt 2003 whittington and price 2006 or the transport of methane bubbles fechner levy and hemond 1996 glaser et al 2004b reeve et al 2013 as a result the measurement of k in peat deposits is subject to several problems arising from methodology heterogeneities in the porous media or deformations of the pore space 4 1 1 problems related to sampling method three generally accepted methods exist for determining the hydraulic conductivity of a saturated porous medium aquifer pumping tests slug i e bore hole or piezometer tests and laboratory permeameter experiments bear 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 ingebritsen et al 2006 all three methods determine k values for different test volumes ranging from the scale of regional aquifer down to that of a small laboratory sample not unexpectedly these methods often but not always yield progressively higher values of k as the size and heterogeneity of the test volume increases ingebritsen et al 2006 this general trend has been explained by the higher probability that a larger test volume will intersect a macropore or other preferred conduit for pore water transport in addition larger test volumes are more likely to contain diversionary flow paths around localized flow obstructions however hsieh 1998 and ingebritsen et al 2006 recognize the inherent sampling bias associated with all methods for determining k depending on the synoptic distribution of macropores across all scales and types of porous media 4 1 2 lab permeameters laboratory experiments are limited to small 1 m3 peat samples that are analyzed in the laboratory under conditions of constant falling or rising hydraulic head bear 1972 ingebritsen et al 2006 this method provides the most direct means to measure horizontal k kh and vertical k kv and also the relationship of k to the botanical composition degree of decomposition and bulk density of different peat types however lab permeameters only measure k at the small scale of a lab sample and are also subject to several other sources of error first it is difficult to cut small peat samples without altering the peat fabric because peat is generally fibrous and readily deformable second the peat sample must be sealed within a permeameter in the lab to prevent preferential flow along the inside walls of the vessel finally it is not possible to cut monoliths from deeper portions of a peat profile unless the peatland has been drained and cut to expose a peat face although some of these problems have been partially addressed by using larger peat samples such as 0 5 to 1 m3 cubes of peat hoag and price 1997 beckwith et al 2003 cunliffe et al 2013 this approach still cannot determine the spatial distribution of k on a fine scale over a much larger domain particularly within the deeper portions of pristine non drained peatlands with a high water table 4 1 3 slug tests since the pioneering work of boelter 1965 1969 slug tests have been extensively used to yield a rapid in situ estimate of k in peatlands slug tests determine k by measuring the change in hydraulic head that follows an instantaneous injection or removal of a known volume of water from a piezometer k is then calculated following the hvorslev 1951 or other methods that relax the assumption that the medium under consideration is incompressible homogeneous and isotropic slug tests assume that darcy s law is valid over the model domain so a change in head over time will result in a log linear recovery with k that is proportional to the gradient of the log of normalized head against time hvorslev 1951 butler 1997 darcy s law is commonly assumed to govern pore water flow through peat deposits although apparent deviations may result from the high elastic storativity of the peat e g ingram 1983 hemond and goldman 1985 gafni and brooks 1990 baird and gaffney 1994 holden and burt 2003 beckwith et al 2003 slug tests have the advantage of being quick easy to use in the field and depth specific but are susceptible to errors related to aquifer elasticity and piezometer design bear 1972 butler 1997 surridge et al 2005 the concern that slug tests yield values of k that are too low in peat has been attributed to at least two technique related problems as discussed by surridge et al 2005 a the development of well skins around the intake of the piezometer during slug tests and 2 smearing of peat around the piezometer intake during installation which was not removed due to insufficient development of the piezometer additionally if the piezometer intake is in contact with peat layers of different k as may be the case in a situation of layered heterogeneity the values obtained are likely to represent the higher k layers surridge et al 2005 seo and choe 2001 surridge et al 2005 suggested several modifications for the design of piezemeters to mitigate these sources of error however these design modifications cannot address the broader issue of scale dependency of k in both time and space nor detecting finer scale variations in k between individual sampling points slug tests are also limited by their application of a small instantaneous hydraulic stress over a relatively small test volume determined by the capacity of pore fluids to flow toward a piezometer tube 4 1 4 aquifer pumping tests conventional aquifer pumping tests were developed to determine the hydraulic properties of aquifers averaged over a much larger test volume bear 1972 ingebritsen et al 2006 more recently pumping tests have been applied to a much smaller and more manageable portion of an aquifer or watershed hogan et al 2006 the advantages of these mini aquifer tests are three fold first they use multiple measurements of head from an array of monitoring wells to calibrate a single groundwater flow equation under the application of a persistent hydrostatic stress second they provide improved solutions to the inverse problem of determining k by using a calibration method that uses multiple pilot points and inverse regularization third a persistent pumping operation has sufficient strength to mobilize pools of biogenic gas within a peat profile this method is not directly comparable to the results of slug tests which employ a much lower hydraulic stress over a much smaller model domain hogan et al 2006 van der schaaf 2004 mini aquifer tests are also not comparable to laboratory methods for the reasons outlined above 4 2 distribution of k in the red lake ii bog the mini aquifer tests yielded high values for k within two similar but contrasting bog landforms of the red lake peatland fig 1 figs a1 a3 in appendix a both of these bog landforms are primarily distinguished by the relative abundance of tree and sedge cover despite their similar water chemistry and species assemblages glaser et al 1981 nevertheless the range in k values from the bog forest and bog lawn differed by 2 orders of magnitude fig 2 at the bog forest most k values ranged from 4 to 5 10 5 m s 1 4 to 5 10 3 cm s 1 in the uppermost peat 0 5 1 m and 1 10 5 to 7 10 6 m s 1 in the deeper peat below 2 4 m these values are comparable to those reported for silty sand according to davis 1969 and freeze and cherry 1979 they also fall within the same range as those previously reported by chason et al 1986 for their slug test and lab permeameter measurements from a bog forest in a nearby peatland in contrast the bulk of the calculated k values within the bog lawn site were much higher ranging from 1 to 1 8 10 3 m s 1 for the uppermost peat and 3 to 5 10 4 m s 1 for the peat below 2 4 m comparable to those found in medium to coarse grained sands freeze and cherry 1979 the k values from the two bog sites in the red lake peatland are several orders of magnitude higher than most of those previously reviewed for peat by rycroft et al 1975 and also significantly higher than those reported for deeper peat 1 m depth in recent reviews using a range of different methods from other peatlands e g rycroft et al 1975 lewis et al 2012 clymo 2004 rezanezhad et al 2016 at both of the red lake bog sites k values declined below 2 4 m depth and became less variable with most determinations varying by only a factor of 8 0 6 to 5 10 5 m s 1 under the bog forest site and by a factor of about 6 0 3 to 1 7 10 3 m s 1 under the bog lawn site these ranges in k values support the expectation of a two layered diplotelmic peat profile with respect to its capacity to transport pore fluids e g ingram 1983 although a 3 layered deposit may also be possible at red lake if the highly conductive near surface peat was also included e g morris and waddington 2011 however the optimized k values for the rlii bog indicate that the entire peat profile of both test sites remains highly conductive to the flow of pore fluids in fact the optimized k values for the bog lawn site are very high even in the deeper 1 4 m depth peat strata the mini aquifer tests further indicate that k values do not decline exponentially with increasing depth contrary to the expectations of several coupled hydrophysical ecosystem models e g frolking et al 2001 2010 baird et al 2012 morris et al 2011a 2011b in both the holocene peat model and digibog k values are linked to rates of peat decomposition which decline exponentially with increasing depth an even more striking distinction of the red lake ii tests was the determination of distinctly different patterns of anisotropy with respect to k across the 940 m3 model domain of both test sites 4 3 relationship of k to the botanical composition of the peat fabric as a first approximation the hydraulic conductivity of peat is generally considered to be a function of its botanical composition and degree of decomposition baden and eggelsman 1963 in an early influential review synthesized a large dataset showing that peat composed of sphagnum remains has a lower range of k values than peat derived from sedge biomass for any given degree of decomposition this relationship can be explained because the small leaves of sphagnum once detached from stems can be packed into a tighter configuration under the weight of an accumulating peat mass than the coarser tissue fragments derived from decomposing sedges peat with more variable mixtures of bryophytes sedges and woody biomass becomes more challenging to relate its intrinsic permeability to its botanical composition for example there is considerable disagreement on the role of woody biomass with some authors suggesting that the occurrence of woody peat increases k values chason et al 1986 whereas others report it is responsible for the formation of aquitards rosenberry et al 2003 glaser et al 2004b the hydraulic conductivity of peat deposits has also been closely related to microbial decomposition which breaks down plant structures and decreases the permeability of plant litter according to the 2 layered model of peat deposits sensu ingram 1983 this process is most rapid in the upper aerobic layers of peat deposits acrotelm but continues below at a much slower rate in the deeper anoxic peat of the catotelm both the digibog and holocene peat growth models accept these assumptions incorporating an exponential decay function that increases with depth in the catotelm the occurrence of relatively unhumified bryophyte remains down to 3 m depth in both of the red lake ii profiles therefore implies a very short residence time in the uppermost aerobic strata in which decay rates are most rapid this assumption is consistent with the observation of rapid accretion rates across the forested bog zone proposed by glaser and janssens 1986 and gorham et al 2003 however the mini aquifer tests also determined complex patterns of k values at red lake that deviated from the idealized expectations of both the existing models and the botanical composition of the peat the average k values at both sites remained high comparable to that of a silty to fine to coarse grained sand providing no support for a non conductive deeper zone that could be considered the catotelm sensu ingram 1983 although the k values did decline down to a depth of 2 4 m at both sites the upper zone of declining k values occurred within the upper strata of relatively unhumified sphagnum peat moreover a box plot analysis showed a very narrow range in k values in the catotelm at both sites with no consistent decline with increasing depth despite the marked changes in botanical composition and degree of decomposition figs 2 and 3 and appendix c however the greatest departure from expectations was the localized zones of higher or lower k values that extended vertically through the entire peat profile at both sites 4 4 sources of spatial variability the mini aquifer tests determined that the bog forest and bog lawn domains were characterized by different distributional patterns of k despite their similar peat stratigraphy the most conspicuous departures were plume like zones of low k values that extend vertically through the center of the bog forest domain and upper corners of the bog lawn domain figs 5 7 in addition the bog lawn domain is distinguished by thick ribbon like zones of high k values resembling conduits that extend vertically through the central axis of the domain with arms radiating outward to the margins in an inverted y shaped pattern fig 6 all of these vertically oriented regions of apparently anomalous k values were apparently produced by the pumping operation since they are otherwise inexplicable in relation to the consistently horizontal bedding planes of the peat strata two likely mechanisms for their formation are 1 peat compression induced by dewatering of the peat pores or 2 the mobilization of bubble pools induced by the pumping operation both mechanisms assume that peat is a weak and easily deformable porous medium because of its exceptionally high water content hobbs 1986 price and schlotzhauer 1999 schlotzhauer and price 1999 price 2003 glaser et al 2004b whittington and price 2006 the removal of pore water by either a persistent pumping operation or a localized outward flow from under the weight of observers can lead to peat compression as an increasing fraction of the overburden pressure is transferred from the pore fluids at depth to the solid phase peat matrix hemond and goldman 1985 chow et al 1992 price 2003 whittington and price 2006 fritz et al 2008 this process could reduce the intrinsic permeability of the peat deposit and also lower its specific yield because a more densely packed peat particles will retain more pore water by capillary tension when drained whittington and price 2006 the compression hypothesis is primarily suggested by the location of a plume like zone of low k values directly under the position of the pumping well within the bog forest domain fig 5 however the extraction of pore waters by the pumping well would also substantially decrease the overburden pressure since pore water represents more than 90 of the wet mass of peat e g hobbs 1986 chow et al 1992 glaser et al 2012 slide c7 appendix c in addition no evidence was detected for localized subsidence by the line level measurements at either test site moreover the mini aquifer tests determined high values for specific yield 3 4 10 2 m that are not indicative of compression induced by subsidence finally the pumping well was not located over a similar zone of low k values within the bog lawn domain fig 6 in contrast the bog lawn domain was dominated by conduit like zones of very high k values that extend vertically from the bottom to the top of the domain a more reasonable explanation for the anisotropic distribution of k in both model domains is therefore peat deformations induced by biogenic gas bubbles 4 5 biogenic gas as a determinant of k the fine scale distribution of k in the red lake peatland can best be explained by the storage and release of biogenic gas bubbles within a highly deformable peat matrix the 24 hour pump tests produced an hydraulic stress of 4 8 mb which is equivalent to the stress produced by the steep drops in atmospheric pressure that were measured at the bog forest site in 1997 the three largest of these drops in atmospheric pressure were calculated to release an average of 30 g of ch4 per event glaser et al 2004b further evidence of the existence of free phase gas in the deep portions of the peat profile were observations of gas bubbles erupting from deep bore holes mixtures of gas and pore fluids ejected from deelply installed piezometers and mri magnetic resonance imaginging scans of gas bubbles ejected from large dimater peat cores such high releases of methane are explicable because of the high production rates of ch4 and co2 that have been determined in deep pore waters of the red lake and glacial lake agassiz peatlands corbett 2012 corbett et al 2013 2015 moreover large pools of biogenic gas have been determined across the red lake and adjacent glacial lake agassix peatlands from 1990 through 2008 romanowicz 1993 romanowicz et al 1995 chasar et al 2000a 2000b chasar 2002 rosenberry et al 2003 glaser et al 2004b 2016 parsekian et al 2010 2011 corbett 2012 the transport of bubbles within deep peat deposits is often assumed to be constrained by the rigid geometry of the peat pores e g coulthard et al 2003 rezanezhad et al 2010 wright et al 2018 according to this mechanism bubbles can lower the hydraulic conductivity of peat by occluding the peat pores particularly in near surface strata e g dinel et al 1988 reynolds et al 1992 beckwith and baird 2001 the other mechanism assumes that bubbles have the capacity to push apart the weak peat fabric and create zones of secondary porosity rosenberry et al 2003 glaser et al 2004b secondary porosity can be created if the internal pressures within a bubble exceeds the sum of the resisting forces generated by 1 the overburden pressure and 2 the mechanical strength of the peat skeleton glaser et al 2004b alternatively bubbles can become trapped within more competent peat strata in which woody structures confer greater mechanical strength to the peat fabric rosenberry et al 2003 glaser et al 2004b a sudden drop in the resisting forces could therefore trigger an ebullition event in which swarms of bubbles are released from deep confining strata and rise to the surface en masse creating a plume like stream this mechanism fits the results of the mini aquifer test if the bubbles are small and only partially block the peat pores within zones of low k values overall the distributional patterns of k at the rlii bog sites provide support for the existence of three different modes of bubble transport proposed by fechner levy and hemond 1996 glaser et al 2004b and coulthard et al 2003 the mini aquifer results from the bog forest site for example can best be explained by the transport mode proposed by glaser et al 2004b the wood layer at 3 m depth apparently created an effective trap for small methane bubbles rising from deeper production zones as the bubbles accumulated they partially blocked the peat pores throughout the deeper peat producing a zone of lower k values that is characteristic of this layer the pumping operation triggered a localized release of these bubbles which converged into a spheroidal shaped region marked by lower k values 10 6 m 1 s 1 as they pierced through a zone of weakness in the wood layer figs 5 and 11 the bubble swarm then apparently expanded outward into a plume like stream of small bubbles on its rise to the surface this general model of methane bubble entrapment and escape is analogous to the rise of salt diapirs that deform the sea bed on the floor of the gulf of mexico e g schultz ela et al 1993 dooley et al 2017 dooley and hudec 2017 kramer and shedd 2017 in contrast the much higher k values determined for the bog lawn domain seem to be the result of higher bubble fluxes these k values are 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those determined for the bog forest site fig 4 suggesting a greater capacity for methane bubbles to maintain open passageways as the bubble streams dilate the pore space and vertically push pore waters ahead of them through the peat fig 11 further support for this dilation hypothesis is provided by the core scans figs 2 and 3 appendix c which show a visibly looser and more porous fabric at the bog lawn site particulary in the upper 0 3 m depth layers of sphagnum dominated peat the corresponding sphagnum strata at the bog forest site are not only denser but are also strengthened by more woody structures the fine scale distributional patterns of k at the bog lawn site therefore support a hybrid model of bubble transport that combines 1 episodic and massive releases of bubble swarms from deep confining layers sensu glaser et al 2004b with 2 a more continuous fluxes of bubbles through well defined ribbon like conduits sensu the bubble tracks of fechner levy and hemond 1996 and 3 the more diffuse continuous fluxes through the pore matrix of coulthard et al 2003 ramirez et al 2015 4 6 k as a driver for bog landform development the results of the mini aquifer tests have implications beyond the immediate test sites the red lake bog sites are located on mesoscale peat landforms that are characteristic of all large 20 km2 bog complexes within the forested bog region as mapped by glaser and janssens 1986 and glaser 1992b this region extends across the mid continental portion of north america south of the permafrost belt glaser et al 1981 and later glaser 1992a 1992b proposed that the surface patterns of these large 160 km2 bog complexes of the red lake peatland are indicative of a common developmental sequence they further propose that this sequence is governed by feedbacks among the hydrology vegetation and the material properties of the peat their analysis was based on the assumptions that 1 rising water tables favor the replacement of trees and shrubs by sedges 2 sedge dominated stands e g carex oligosperma produce more permeable peat than that laid down by trees and shrubs and 3 runoff draining from the forested bog crest will be channeled into zones dominated by sedges the feedback system originates at the forested bog crests as surface runoff is progressively channeled into linear zones dominated by sedges bog drains which expand farther downslope into broad non forested lawns dominated by carex oligosperma and sphagnum the mini aquifer tests at the red lake ii bog forest and bog lawn support the basic assumption that sedges lay down more permeable peat than the woody peat under the forested bog crest however these tests also suggest that the actual mechanism driving this feedback system may involve unexpected linkages of biogenic gas bubbles to the hydraulic conductivity of the peat chanton et al 2008 has reported isotopic evidence showing that sedge dominated areas produce more labile doc dissolved organic carbon than areas dominated by woody vegetation these labile organic compounds can then be transported downward into the peat column and stimulate methane production this linkage has been verified by isotopic analysis of ch4 doc and the solid phase peat e g chanton et al 1995 2008 chasar et al 2000a 2000b corbett et al 2013 corbett et al 2015 glaser et al 2016 the mini aquifer tests further suggest that higher rates of methane production can lead to higher k values as bubble streams dilate the peat pores 5 conclusions the mini aquifer method offers several important advantages for determining the 3d distribution of k on a fine scale over a large 940 m3 model domain in peatlands first the tests use multiple monitoring wells and over a hundred pilot points to calibrate a single groundwater flow equation with the aid of pest this method therefore provides a statistically reliable method for determining the fine scale distribution of k in contrast to interpolating discrete scaler values from separate sampling points second a sustained pumping operation is capable of mobilizing biogenic gas pools that may have accumulated in the peat the mini aquifer tests therefore provide a means to determine the capacity of gas bubbles to either dilate or form local obstructions within the interconnected pore space the rlii bog tests also support a 2 layered concept of peat deposits orignally proposed by ingam 1983 composed of a highly permeable upper layer i e acrotelm and a much less permeable deeper layer i e catotelm the principal exceptions to this classic 2 layered concept at the rlii bog sites is the deeper extension of the upper more permeable layer to 2 4 m depth and the still highly permeable deeper peat that extends down to the mineral substratum an even more striking departure from expectations was the highly heterogeneous distribution of k throughout both model domains these distributional patterns seem to be indicative of local peat deformations produced by three different modes of bubble transport 1 swarms of bubbles rising from ruptures in deep confining layers 2 continuous bubble fluxes through ribbon like conduits and 3 background bubble fluxes dispersing through the peat matrix these insights might otherwise be masked by relying on statistical averaged values of k

4744,dynamics of terrestrial water storage are determinant for many natural and social phenomena with implications for water security and environmental sustainability here we use 2002 2017 data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace to study these dynamics in the magdalena cauca river basin in northwestern south america through comparison with water balance based estimates we assess the performance of multiple grace products in representing water storage dynamics in the basin identifying the mascon product from the jet propulsion laboratory as the best suited for further analysis we then investigate the existence of long term trends and show that terrestrial water storage in general and groundwater storage in particular have been gradually depleting in the basin since around the end of 2010 grace data reveal that this trend is not uniform across the basin but exhibits a clear cut pattern in which the water depletion rate is more pronounced in the lower parts of the basin than it is in the upper basin we explore the mechanisms behind the identified temporal trends and spatial patterns and show that water storage depletion largely coincides with a period between the la niña and el niño extreme phases of enso likewise the pronounced contrast between depletion rates in the lower and higher parts of the basin largely coincides with marked biophysical differences between these regions including the presence of major wetland systems in the lowlands and the highlands of the andean mountains keywords terrestrial water storage groundwater depletion enso tropical andes grace 1 introduction many natural and social phenomena depend on the dynamics of terrestrial water storage which plays a major role in the earth s climate system through its effect on the global water energy and biogeochemical cycles famiglietti 2004 huang et al 2013 long et al 2017 yang et al 2017 salazar et al 2018 the dynamics of terrestrial water storage are however sensitive to global change and understanding how and why these dynamics are changing in different regions of the world is critical to water resources management in river basins and the assessing of present and future water security voss et al 2013 long et al 2014 and is recognized as a fundamental problem of the hydrological sciences in the panta rhei context montanari et al 2013 rodriguez et al 2018 a first order explanation of these dynamics is given by the water balance equation 1 ds dt p e q which for a river basin determines that temporal variations in terrestrial water storage ds dt depend on the

techniques e g gauging networks and remote sensing and modelling the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellite mission in 2002 has provided an unprecedented way of directly estimating ds dt through high precision measurements of the earth s gravity field the fundamental idea behind these grace based estimates is that variations in the earth s gravity field are related with the dynamics of the total terrestrial water storage tws defined as the sum of snow surface water soil moisture and groundwater tapley et al 2004 wahr et al 2004 since the launch of the mission the use of grace data to investigate variations in tws has attracted much attention wada et al 2010 famiglietti 2014 it has helped identify different regions of the world in which terrestrial water mainly groundwater is being depleted including northwest india tiwari et al 2009 rodell et al 2009 the central valley in california famiglietti et al 2011 and texas long et al 2013 brazil

water security and environmental sustainability of those regions several studies have demonstrated that water storage variations can be inferred from grace with enough resolution and accuracy to benefit water security assessments and water management landerer and swenson 2012 jiang et al 2014 long et al 2015 wang and li 2016 however there is incomplete evidence of the ability of grace data to reproduce the dynamics of terrestrial water storage in all continental regions of the world thus calling for further evaluation and case specific studies e g long et al 2016 seyoum and milewski 2016

of e g precipitation and either hydrological or land surface models through the combination improved insight is provided into the water balance and fluxes in basins studied but less so into the performance of grace data in representing the dynamics of tws independent observation of tws dynamics at the basin level and how these are related to climatic phenomena such as enso is of importance to water resources management particularly in large and sparsely monitored basins and considering the projected intensification of the enso phenomenon cai et al 2015 in this paper we use grace data derived products to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of tws at the basin scale and their potential linkages to climate change and variability in the tropical magdalena cauca basin mc basin henceforth in northwestern south america we develop five main activities supplementary fig s1 after describing our data and methods section 2 we first assess the performance of multiple available grace products more details in section 2 in representing water storage dynamics as compared to independent water balance estimates based on terrestrial observations section 3 1 second we use the best performing grace product to investigate the existence of long term trends in the mc basin as a whole as well as in its major sub basins section 3 2 third we use the global land data assimilation system gldas to separate surface water sws and groundwater gws contributions to trends in tws fourth we use grace data to study the spatial variability of temporal trends in order to explore the existence of physically meaningful spatial patterns this mapping highlights an advantage of using grace data as it would not be possible with water balance estimates that depend on spatially non continuous and relatively scarce observations of water balance fluxes finally we explore the underlying mechanisms that explain the identified temporal trends and spatial patterns hypothesising that these are commensurate to enso related variability and pronounced biophysical differences in the basin section 4 we present our main conclusions in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 the magdalena cauca basin the region of interest in this study is the mc basin located in northwestern south america and draining an area of 276 000 km2 fig 1 the magdalena river originates from its headwaters in the andes at an elevation of approximately 3 700 m above sea level and runs for 1 612 km before flowing into the western caribbean in the atlantic ocean lópez et al 2018 restrepo and kjerfve 2000 the cauca river is the main tributary of the magdalena river flowing along the western part of the basin and joining the magdalena river in a inner delta wetland area called la mojana which is a part of the mompós depression the average precipitation regime of the basin is characterized by a markedly bi modal cycle fig 2 linked to the latitudinal migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz urrea et al 2019 though the bi modal cycle is more pronounced in the northern part of the basin seasonal variations in terrestrial water storage also exhibit a bi modal cycle focus on this basin is

use 183 months from april 2002 to june 2017 of grace derived monthly anomalies of tws from three different products the first product is constructed from post processed grace rl05 level 3 land l3 land data gridded at 1 110 km near the equator and based on the rl05 spherical harmonics sh basis function sh datasets are obtained from three sources the center for space research at university of texas csr austin the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and geoforschungs zentrum potsdam gfz processing centers landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 the ensemble mean of these three post processed grace datasets is used to balance the bias of any single post processing technique e g sakumura et al 2014 voss et al 2013 the second and third products are mascons producs from jpl and csr we denote these as jpl mascons and csr mascons respectively these are solutions gridded at 0 5 55 km that use regional mass concentration functions i e mascons to parameterize the gravity field mascon products have become operational within the last years save et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 all five solutions of grace land used in this study csr jpl gfz jpl mascon and csr mascon are available through the grace tellus page http grace jpl nasa gov supported by the nasa measures program in order to restore the signal lost through processing the scaling factors provided by each processing center to scale grace data and standard processing steps are used landerer and swenson 2012 ouma et al 2015 this signal loss refers to a smoothing and signal attenuation that result from the filtering process that is used to reduce grace data noise grace data are noisy with noise increasing with increasing sh degree landerer and swenson 2012 scanlon et al 2016 correcting the loss of signal is important because it reduces the ability of grace data to reproduce components of the observed water balance especially in small basins scanlon et al 2016 in the original grace data tws

management were directly remedied by linear interpolation e g ouma et al 2015 xiao et al 2015 liesch and ohmer 2016 shamsudduha et al 2012 there were 20 out of 183 missing values corresponding to the

always expressed as an equivalent water thickness e g cm of water the water balance components in the mc basin are estimated using a combination of data from the national network of gauging stations and global re analysis and satellite datasets in all cases these data correspond to the period 2002 2015 with the original values converted into anomalies relative to the common 2004 2009 baseline data from gauging stations of the national network were provided by the national institute of hydrology meteorology and environmental studies of colombia ideam for its spanish acronym available in http www ideam gov co and include time series of precipitation from 1084 gauges evaporation from 199 gauges and river flow from 5 gauges fig 1 precipitation data were also obtained from four products

martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 are considered gleam v3a is based on satellite observed soil moisture vegetation optical depth and snow water equivalent air temperature and radiation from reanalysis and a multi source precipitation product whereas gleam v3b is largely driven by satellite data taking advantage of the multiple available data sources an ensemble of estimates of the variation in terrestrial water storage through the water balance is produced eq 1 table 1 summarizes the grace and water balance components data used in this study 2 3 comparing grace and water balance derived estimates of tws variation comparison between grace derived and water balance based estimates of tws variation has been widely used as a procedure for assessing grace data e g becker et al 2010 famiglietti et al 2011 voss et al 2013 nanteza et al 2016 scanlon et al 2018 using all sources of data for p and e as well as records of q near the outlet of the mc basin we first estimate monthly values of ds dt from the water balance equation eq 1 then we compare these water balance based estimates of ds dt with the time derivative of tws anomalies expressed as a forward difference derivative twsc of the form 2 ds dt n twsc n tws n tws n 1 where n 1 and n denote consecutive months and the primes indicate anomalies this comparison is used to differentiate between grace products with all further analyses using only the grace products found to perform best 2 4 isolation of gws contribution from grace derived tws variation tws anomalies derived from grace can be understood as the result of adding anomalies in groundwater storage gws and all forms of surface water storage sws e g chen et al 2016 shamsudduha et al 2012 famiglietti et al 2011 and others as expressed by 3 tws gws sws therefore anomalies of groundwater storage gws can be estimated as the residual of tws after subtracting sws sws includes multiple components though some may be negligible for a given region for instance the snow water equivalent can be assumed as negligible for the mc basin due to its tropical climate regime soil moisture sm is included in the definition of sws adopted here similar to other studies fatolazadeh et al 2016 ouma et al 2015 chen et al 2016 and arguably accounts for a considerable portion of sws variations huss et al 2017 another tws component that may be significant is surface water storage of major water bodies such as reservoirs and lakes e g becker et al 2010 swenson and wahr 2009 shamsudduha et al 2017 indeed most of the major reservoirs and some large wetland systems in colombia are located within the mc basin angarita et al 2018 in some studies this component is subtracted from tws to isolate gws e g famiglietti et al 2011 fatolazadeh et al 2016 huang et al 2016 liesch and ohmer 2016 and others however this requires an estimation of water storage dynamics in such water bodies e g using surface water altimetry data from legos voss et al 2013 which is not possible for the mc basin due to lack of data further water storage dynamics in large water bodies is often tightly coupled to gws dynamics through sub surface flows winter 1999 ouma et al 2015 from this perspective as with several other studies e g rodell et al 2007 moiwo et al 2012 ouma et al 2015 hachborn et al 2017 gws is calculated as 4 gws tws sm where sm can be estimated by means of hydrological or land surface models such as the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 gldas integrates ground and satellite observation based data sets for parameterizing forcing and constraining multiple hydrological or land surface models lsms in order to realistically simulate water and energy budgets and fluxes syed et al 2008 gldas is a robust simulation system that incorporates satellite and ground based observational data products using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques with the purpose of generating optimal fields of land surface states for soil moisture snow and fluxes at global scales and high spatial resolution 0 25 1 in near real time rodell et al 2004 gldas outputs have been similarly used in grace studies e g ni et al 2018 ospina et al 2018 ouma et al 2015 yang and chen 2015 gldas output from the noah lsm is used noah uses parameterizations of multiple land surface processes e g runoff infiltration and canopy conductance to simulate the evolution of the surface energy and water budgets in response to near surface atmospheric forcing as well as the dependence of this evolution on surface conditions such as vegetation state and soil texture ek et al 2003 this lsm provides the finer resolution 0 25 as compared to the other available lsms and has been successfully used to study the dynamics of water storage in tropical south america eom et al 2017 han et al 2009 2 5 detection of trends and breakpoints to analyse trends seasonality from grace data is removed by subtracting the monthly mean for each calendar month and then applying linear regression and the non parametric mann kendall mk test the mk test is a standard rank based procedure which allows assessing the significance of trends huang et al 2013 the segmented package in r muggeo et al 2008 is used to study whether the water storage records are better described by one or two trend lines i e whether there are breakpoints at which a trend is reduced e g the slope is reduced without changing its sign or even reversed the sign of the slope changes this trend analysis is performed for the whole mc basin and its main tributaries as well as for each grace grid cell in order to explore the existence of spatial patterns in tws variability 2 6 optical and synthetic aperture radar sar images to support our discussion of the spatial variability of trends variations in the extent of wetlands areas in the mompós depression are estimated based on palsar and landsat images e g escobar martínez 2011 anaya acevedo et al 2017 yuan et al 2015 palomino ángel et al 2019 dabrowska zielinska et al 2014 arnesen et al 2013 to characterize the extent of flooding during the 2010 2011 la niña wet season 43 available sar images were processed the l band hh polarized mode is adopted as it is known to be sensitive to water level change beneath the vegetation pope et al 1997 rosenqvist et al 2007 grings et al 2009 while maintaining coherence for interferometric processing kim et al 2009 for the dry season optical images are found to be better suited to identify wetland extent in tropical environments liesenberg et al 2007 deus 2016 36 landsat images are used to characterize wetlands in the mompós depression during the el niño of 2015 2016 data from palsar and landsat were obtained respectively from online portals

estimates fig 3 shows a comparison between the multiple grace based estimates of twsc and the corresponding estimates of ds dt based on the water balance eqs 1 and 2 three different grace based estimates are included the mean of the spherical harmonics sh basis functions from the csr jpl and gfz processing centers grace mean sh and the mascon products from jpl jpl mascon and csr csr mascon estimates derived from the water balance are established with 14 combinations that use all sources of data for p e and q table 1 in this taylor diagram filled and unfilled points correspond to observation based estimates obtained respectively with all 14 combinations of data sources and gauging stations from ideam only agreement between grace and water balance based estimates varies among the three grace products there are three clear differences first correlation is worst for the grace mean sh product red in fig 3 both for the time series and the annual cycle the poor correlation is particularly as a result of the lag in the first peak of the bi modal climate which for the grace mean sh product occurs between may june while all other estimates indicate the peak in april may this lag is evident in the average annual cycle fig 3b as a result of the pronounced lags that are observed in several years of the time series e g 2004 2006 2009 2012 and 2013 fig 3a second the bi modality of the annual cycle is less pronounced in estimates of csr mascon yellow in fig 3 than it is for all other estimates although this is not easy to detect by visual examination of the time series fig 3a it is evident in the average annual cycle fig 3b and results in the worst representation of temporal variance standard deviation obtained with this product yellow points in fig 3c third better agreement between grace and the water balance based estimates is found for the jpl mascon product blue in fig 3 in particular jpl mascon is clearly best in representing the average annual cycle fig 3b with the highest correlation lowest error and best standard deviation blue triangle in fig 3c as for the time series of monthly values fig 3a jpl mascon is comparable with grace mean sh in error and standard deviation but better in correlation blue vs red circles in fig 3c and comparable with csr mascon in correlation but much better in standard deviation blue vs yellow circles in fig 3c the only statistics in which jpl mascon is clearly worse than other product is in the error for the time series which is best for csr mascon blue vs yellow circles in fig 3c in summary jpl mascon produces better or comparable results with respect to other grace based estimates in almost all cases five out of six statistics this indicates that estimates based on jpl mascon are closer to water balance based estimates in the mc basin and hence we choose this product for further analysis 3 2 trends in water storage grace data jpl mascon henceforth reveals the existence of two different trends in terrestrial water storage tws during the study period for the whole mc basin fig 4 there is a positive trend i e an increase in water storage 0 14 0 02 cm month before 2010 and a negative trend i e a decrease or depletion of water storage 0 37 0 04 cm month afterwards this positive negative trend is equivalent to an increase decrease of tws of 41 04 5 19 km3 77 68 7 57 km3 during 2002 2010 2011 2017 in the mc basin in all cases reported trends are statistically significant meaning that the corresponding p value is lower than 0 05 and break points are identified by using the objective method described in section 2 the pattern consisting in a positive trend of water storage that is reversed in recent years is also present in major tributaries of the mc basin and for surface and groundwater storage fig 5 shows gws and sm while supplementary fig s3 shows the same map but for tws here we introduce the major sub basins of the whole mc basin and refer to them as the middle sub basins the upper middle magdalena umm and cauca c and upper sub basins the upper cauca uc and upper magdalena um soil moisture sm and groundwater gws storage contribute differently to trends in total terrestrial water storage tws at the scale of the whole basin mc as well as in its middle sub basins umm and c trends in groundwater are more pronounced than for soil moisture during the decreasing trend in 2011 2017 the umm basin lost around 27 64 km3 and 12 73 km3 of groundwater and soil moisture respectively during the same period the corresponding losses of groundwater storage and soil moisture in the c basin were close to 6 30 km3 and 4 78 km3 respectively the upper sub basins fig 5e d exhibit contrasting patterns when compared to the middle sub basins fig 5c b as well as the whole mc basin fig 5a two main differences are that in the upper sub basins depletion rates during recent years have been more pronounced for soil moisture than for groundwater and break point may be located in 2008 i e earlier than the break point identified in 2010 for the other basins despite these differences two findings are still common to the whole mc basin and all of its major sub basins i there has been a water storage depletion trend in recent years which in most cases only exceptions are for soil moisture in the upper sub basins fig 5e d was preceded by a positive trend and ii the depleting trend coincides with a period between enso extremes common patterns and differences between sub basins are further discussed in section 4 temporal trends in water storage are not uniformly distributed across space in the mc basin there is a marked difference between the higher upstream south of 7 5 latitude and lower downstream north of 7 5 latitude parts of the basin fig 6 note that this partition of the mc basin around 7 5 latitude this is not an arbitrary selection but a result based on fig 6 implies that the upper sub basins are in the upper part of the basin while the middle sub basins include areas in both the higher and lower parts of the basin average trends have the same sign in both parts of the basin positive during 2002 2010 and negative for 2011 2017 but are much more pronounced in the lower part during the positive trend period water storage increased about 26 14 km3 trend is 0 23 0 03 cm month in the lower part of the basin whereas it increased around 13 99 km3 trend is 0 08 0 02 cm month in the higher part likewise the decreasing trend in the lower part 0 60 0 06 cm month is equivalent to a loss of 49 96 km3 during the period while in the higher part 0 24 0 03 cm month the corresponding loss is about 31 80 km3 from fig 6 it is evident that the monthly variability variance of tws is higher for the northern time series than it is for the southern time series even if the trends are removed this implies that the trends have different levels of significance likewise the variability of gws is higher than that of sm fig 5 with consequent differences in the significance of the trends despite these differences all trends are found to be statistically significant differences in trends between the northern and southern parts of the mc basin are not attributable to differences in the size of these areas likewise differences between trends shown in fig 5 are not attributable to differences in the size of sub basins this is because time series data in figs 5 and 6 are normalized by the size of the corresponding area this area is directly related to but does not fully describe the storage capacity which depends also on the properties of soil columns and related land atmosphere dynamics some important factors affecting these properties and dynamics will be discussed in the next section 4 discussion in this section we explore the reasons and or mechanisms behind our three main findings as well as their implications for water security and environmental sustainability the first finding is that among different grace based products the jpl mascon product exhibits a closer agreement with water balance based estimates of water storage dynamics in the mc basin section 3 1 this finding generally agrees with scanlon et al 2016 who describe several advantages of mascon solutions relative to sh such as the increase of signal amplitude due to the reduction of leakage from land to ocean and the application of geophysical data constraints during processing with little empirical post processing required in contrast to the sh approach in which noise reduction and signal restoration are applied as post processing steps noise is reduced during mascon processing by applying constraints scanlon et al 2016 the use of mass concentrations leads to better signal to noise ratios of the mascon fields as compared to the sh solutions watkins et al 2015 shamsudduha et al 2017 in contrast to sh products used to produce our grace ensemble jpl mascon does not require the use of scaling factors in post processing which are needed in sh products to restore the signal lost during the processing of the truncation of the gravity coefficients and filtering landerer and swenson 2012 jpl mascon as well as csr mascon estimates terrestrial mass changes directly from inter satellite acceleration measurements and can be used without further post processing rowlands et al 2010 watkins et al 2015 shamsudduha et al 2017 another difference between sh and mascons is that sh solutions are global whereas mascons can be applied at regional to global scales scanlon et al 2016 this difference is important because in the global sh solutions one cannot distinguish between land and ocean areas hence the generally higher land signals leak into the lower ocean signals thereby reducing signal amplitudes in contrast land and ocean areas can be explicitly defined during mascon processing reducing leakage errors relative to the sh solutions scanlon et al 2016 also gridded mascon fields are provided at the improved spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 while sh solutions are available at a resolution of 1 1 the greater resolution of mascons solutions for smaller spatial regions watkins et al 2015 may also provide an explanation for the lag between sh and mascons solutions particularly for the first peak april may of the largely bi modal climate while the upper basin is clearly bi modal fig 3 the lower basin tends to a more uni modal climate with an extended wet season whether the lag is due to the poorer resolution of sh solutions resulting in a mixed representation of the heterogeneous climate or due to the sh solution better capturing the dynamic of the lower basin than the upper basin is open to additional research as compared to the other mascon type product i e csr mascon jpl mascon has two differences that we consider consistent with the better performance found first these mascon products differ in their spatial resolution jpl mascon samples the gravity field at approximately the native resolution of the grace mission at the equator whereas csr mascon deliberately oversamples the gravity field at the equator to increase the solution resolution at higher latitudes watkins et al 2015 save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 this may be why csr maps present a spatial distribution smoother than jpl maps so that it is difficult to identify areas with special interest e g supplementary fig s3 the second difference between jpl mascon and csr mascon solutions is that they represent two fundamentally different approaches to applying constraints among these differences jpl mascon constraints are based on both grace data and geophysical models whereas csr mascon constraints are based on grace data only watkins et al 2015 save et al 2016 hence jpl mascon uses a combination of near global geophysical models along with altimetry observations to improve mass flux estimates globally which may be particularly important in the complex terrain of the andes watkins et al 2015 scanlon et al 2016 also show that csr mascon has slightly higher errors than all the other solutions for large basins for further comparison between sh and mascon grace products we refer the reader to scanlon et al 2016 and shamsudduha et al 2017 overall our results suggest that jpl mascon is preferrable than other products for the assessments of water storage dynamics in the mc basin the second finding is the existence of significant temporal trends in water storage that shift from positive increase in water storage to negative water storage depletion during the study period section 3 2 in the mc basin as a whole as well as in its middle sub basins c and umm this shift occurs during the 2010 2011 la niña figs 4 and 5a c the resulting negative trend continues until the 2015 2016 el niño this is further clarified by fig 7 which shows the evolution of tws anomalies along with precipitation anomalies and the multivariate enso index mei wolter and timlin 1993 several other similar concepts are highlighted in fig 7 the depleting trend occurs between two strong enso extremes that had extensive impacts in the mc basin the 2010 2011 la niña was related with severe flooding hoyos et al 2013 while the 2015 2016 el niño was linked with the most severe drought in recent years hoyos et al 2017 martinez et al 2017 indeed the maximum tws 22 60 cm in december 2010 and minimum tws 21 48 cm in march 2016 values of tws anomalies found during the whole study period occurs during these enso extremes fig 7 also shows that weaker la niña e g 2007 2008 and el niño e g 2009 2010 events can be related with positive and negative anomalies of tws respectively this is consistent with la niña and el niño being typically associated with positive and negative anomalies of precipitation in this region witnessed by the positive negative anomalies of precipitation mirroring negative positive values of mei the correlation between deseasonalized tws anomalies and mei is also negative 0 71 indicating that negative positive values of mei during la niña el niño are related with positive negative anomalies of tws this correlation between mei and tws anomalies exhibits the same pattern as the correlation between mei and precipitation found for northwestern south america waylen and poveda 2002 poveda 2004 guarin and poveda 2013 as well as in other tropical regions in which la niña and el niño are related with positive negative precipitation anomalies phillips et al 2012 awange et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 the correlation between tws and mei improves slightly up to 0 73 if the time series are lagged by two months consistent with the notion that the effects of enso on the hydrology of the region are lagged guarin and poveda 2013 ni et al 2018 these results concur with the conclusion that the mc basin is in a region highly sensitive to enso extremes poveda 2004 and are consistent with the premise that the observed trends in water storage figs 4 and 5 are strongly modulated by enso extremes it is notable that in the upper sub basins the objective method does not identify the break point in the trend in 2010 but rather in 2008 fig 5d e the depleting trend in these sub basins is significant if starting at 2010 as well results not shown that the objective method identifies this break point in 2008 may however be related to physically meaningful differences between the upper and middle sub basins there were two la niña years around 2008 fig 7 and the effect of la niña 2010 2011 on tws was less pronounced in the upper sub basins fig 5d e than in the middle sub basins fig 5b c or the whole basin fig 5a this is evident from comparison between peak values of tws anomalies which occur in 2008 for the upper sub basins despite this difference in the start of the depleting trend there is a clear pattern common to all sub basins and the mc basin as a whole a depleting trend which starts during la niña around either 2008 or 2010 and continues until el niño 2015 2016 i e that occurs between enso extremes although our results indicate that climate variability plays a major role in water storage dynamics they do not allow to relate the water storage depletion trends found with climate change near the end of our study period there is an evident positive trend in tws after around 2016 this may be interpreted as recovery of the tws after the strong el niño of 2015 2016 we do not isolate this trend in our analysis because it occurs during a very short period of time given the available period of record the period of record available also means that we cannot be conclusive on the existence of a climate change signal in water storage dynamics in the mc basin e g long term persistent water storage depletion this highlights the importance of long term monitoring of water storage dynamics which in the case of grace and the mc basin depends on international efforts beyond the reach of colombia such continued monitoring is critical for distinguishing between climate variability and the potential effects of climate change the implications for water security and environmental sustainability and water resources management planning are quite different for positive negative trends in tws modulated by enso than for a persistent depletion rate as a result of climate change e g buytaert and de bièvre 2012 ideam et al 2015 more frequent and or intense el niño events as a result of climate change duque villegas et al 2019 cai et al 2015 cai et al 2014 could however exacerbate longer term depletion rates in the region other signals of climate change have been identified in the region including the shrinkage of tropical glaciers poveda and pineda 2009 and long term trends in monthly hydro climatic series including streamflow precipitation and temperature carmona and poveda 2014 the third finding is that the magnitude not the sign of temporal trends exhibit a pronounced difference between the lower and higher parts of the basin fig 6 this spatial heterogeneity largely coincides with the pronounced differences between these parts of the basin the higher part of the basin to the south is in the andes mountains and is characterized by complex terrain with pronounced elevation gradients elevation ranges from approximately 41 to 5500 m a s l there are also pronounced gradients in biophysical properties including biodiversity josse et al 2011 weather and climate regimes poveda 2004 ideam and cormagdalena 2001 geomorphology and soils ideam and cormagdalena 2001 this andean part of the mc basin is also characterized by the presence of dams and reservoirs angarita et al 2018 strategic ecosystems including paramos ortiz et al 2005 and tropical forests rodriguez and armenteras 2005 as well as tropical glaciers on the highest peaks rabatel et al 2013 all of which can exert a significant influence on the hydrology of the basin at multiple scales indeed the progressing loss of paramos tropical forests and glaciers has raised concerns on how these changes will affect future water security in the tropical andes bradley et al 2006 buytaert et al 2011 vuille 2013 compared to the higher part of the mc basin the lower part constitutes much flatter terrain characterized by the presence of extensive wetland systems mainly in the mompós depression angarita et al 2018 and a drier climate with some areas experiencing increasing aridity and desertification processes jaramillo mejia and chernichovsky 2019 etter et al 2008 fig 8 illustrates how the spatial extent of these wetlands was largely reduced between 2010 and 2016 consistent with water depletion during the same period the mompós wetlands system are severely impacted by droughts and floods related to enso extremes indeed while the 2010 2011 la niña caused severe flooding and concomitant damage due to e g the breach of a large artificial levee in the cauca river nardini and idarraga 2016 the 2015 2016 el niño caused a severe drought with significant impacts on local water security and related economic impacts martinez et al 2017 we interpret the result of the more pronounced positive before 2010 and negative after 2010 trends in the lower part of the basin as a higher sensitivity of water storage in this region to external forcing due to enso variability this higher sensitivity can be related to the high variability of water storage in the extensive wetlands of the region fig 8 indeed previous studies have found a close relation between wetland dynamics and tws xie et al 2016 o loughlin et al 2018 lee et al 2011 wetlands are inextricably linked to other key players of the terrestrial water balance such as rivers and aquifers during wet conditions extensive wetlands in a flat terrain or depression e g the mompós depression can enhance tws via retention of water from increased precipitation and river discharges including floods la niña and particularly the strong 2010 2011 event exacerbated the wet conditions in the lower part of the mc basin in contrast during dry conditions wetlands can enhance the reduction of tws via direct evaporation from extensive areas of free surface water especially if the availability of energy is relatively high such as in tropical regions 5 conclusions we assess the performance of selected grace products in representing the dynamics of water storage in the northwestern south america more specifically in the magdalena cauca mc basin in colombia the potential of grace derived products in understanding of these dynamics and their relation to climate variability is significant to water resources planning in large sparsely monitored river basins our results show that grace based estimates of the water storage are comparable to estimates obtained through the water balance equation using independent sources of the constituent components of the water balance precipitation evaporation and river discharge the performance of the different available grace products is however not uniform the mascon product developed by the jet propulsion laboratory jpl mascon is found to be best suited for describing the spatial and temporal variability of terrestrial water storage tws in the tropical mc basin the jpl mascon data reveals the existence of trends in terrestrial water storage in the mc basin that have shifted from positive i e increase of water storage to negative i e water storage depletion during the study period these trends and shifts are evident not only in the total terrestrial water storage but also in soil moisture and groundwater and have not only occurred in the mc basin as a whole but are also evident in its major sub basins compared to soil moisture the contribution of groundwater to these trends in total water storage is generally larger we find that identified shifts in trends are clearly related to enso with the most pronounced trend in the period of analysis occurring between the strong 2010 2011 la niña and 2015 2016 el niño events the trends in water storage are however not uniform across the mc basin exhibiting a pronounced contrast between the higher and the lower parts of the basin i e between the mountainous andean and flatter near the caribbean sea parts of the basin we interpret the more pronounced trends in the lower part of the basin as a higher sensitivity of water storage to enso variability related with the presence of extensive wetlands that can exacerbate both water retention during wet conditions related to la niña and water loss during dry conditions related to el niño this has implications for future planning and management of water

4744,dynamics of terrestrial water storage are determinant for many natural and social phenomena with implications for water security and environmental sustainability here we use 2002 2017 data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace to study these dynamics in the magdalena cauca river basin in northwestern south america through comparison with water balance based estimates we assess the performance of multiple grace products in representing water storage dynamics in the basin identifying the mascon product from the jet propulsion laboratory as the best suited for further analysis we then investigate the existence of long term trends and show that terrestrial water storage in general and groundwater storage in particular have been gradually depleting in the basin since around the end of 2010 grace data reveal that this trend is not uniform across the basin but exhibits a clear cut pattern in which the water depletion rate is more pronounced in the lower parts of the basin than it is in the upper basin we explore the mechanisms behind the identified temporal trends and spatial patterns and show that water storage depletion largely coincides with a period between the la niña and el niño extreme phases of enso likewise the pronounced contrast between depletion rates in the lower and higher parts of the basin largely coincides with marked biophysical differences between these regions including the presence of major wetland systems in the lowlands and the highlands of the andean mountains keywords terrestrial water storage groundwater depletion enso tropical andes grace 1 introduction many natural and social phenomena depend on the dynamics of terrestrial water storage which plays a major role in the earth s climate system through its effect on the global water energy and biogeochemical cycles famiglietti 2004 huang et al 2013 long et al 2017 yang et al 2017 salazar et al 2018 the dynamics of terrestrial water storage are however sensitive to global change and understanding how and why these dynamics are changing in different regions of the world is critical to water resources management in river basins and the assessing of present and future water security voss et al 2013 long et al 2014 and is recognized as a fundamental problem of the hydrological sciences in the panta rhei context montanari et al 2013 rodriguez et al 2018 a first order explanation of these dynamics is given by the water balance equation 1 ds dt p e q which for a river basin determines that temporal variations in terrestrial water storage ds dt depend on the differences between input fluxes of precipitation p and output fluxes of evapotranspiration e and river discharge q here s includes all components of water storage at the surface e g water bodies soil moisture and snow and beneath it groundwater estimation of ds dt for any given region is challenging especially when hydrological data is scarce or unavailable e g voss et al 2013 ouma et al 2015 hassan and jin 2016 monitoring wells provide precise but generally scattered in space and time data of groundwater level that can be used to estimate variations in groundwater storage e g nanteza et al 2016 huang et al 2013 observations of soil moisture snow and surface water provide additional means to directly estimate different components of total water storage the water balance equation eq 1 allows for the estimation of ds dt indirectly through estimates of fluxes p e and q though this is not trivial for large river basins it can be accomplished through combining multiple observational techniques e g gauging networks and remote sensing and modelling the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellite mission in 2002 has provided an unprecedented way of directly estimating ds dt through high precision measurements of the earth s gravity field the fundamental idea behind these grace based estimates is that variations in the earth s gravity field are related with the dynamics of the total terrestrial water storage tws defined as the sum of snow surface water soil moisture and groundwater tapley et al 2004 wahr et al 2004 since the launch of the mission the use of grace data to investigate variations in tws has attracted much attention wada et al 2010 famiglietti 2014 it has helped identify different regions of the world in which terrestrial water mainly groundwater is being depleted including northwest india tiwari et al 2009 rodell et al 2009 the central valley in california famiglietti et al 2011 and texas long et al 2013 brazil gonçalves et al 2020 china shen et al 2015 2014 2013 2019 the middle east voss et al 2013 and east africa nanteza et al 2016 swenson and wahr 2009 such depletion in water storage poses a threat to the water security and environmental sustainability of those regions several studies have demonstrated that water storage variations can be inferred from grace with enough resolution and accuracy to benefit water security assessments and water management landerer and swenson 2012 jiang et al 2014 long et al 2015 wang and li 2016 however there is incomplete evidence of the ability of grace data to reproduce the dynamics of terrestrial water storage in all continental regions of the world thus calling for further evaluation and case specific studies e g long et al 2016 seyoum and milewski 2016 abiy and melesse 2017 moreover variations in processing of grace data have led to multiple grace products e g jpl mascons and csr mascons save et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 more details in section 2 the performance of which is not equivalent in every region e g scanlon et al 2016 long et al 2017 shamsudduha et al 2017 the performance of grace data can be assessed through comparison of tws anomalies from grace and variations in surface water soil moisture snow and groundwater storage estimated from groundwater level data if available scanlon et al 2012 seyoum and milewski 2016 alternatively grace based tws anomalies can be compared with estimates of ds dt through eq 1 using data of the fluxes data p e and q for instance water balance estimates have been used to show that grace produces a realistic representation of water storage dynamics in california s sacramento and san joaquin river basins in the u s famiglietti et al 2011 and in east africa nanteza et al 2016 other applications of grace data include estimating the water balance of large river basins jiang et al 2014 seo and lee 2016 evapotranspiration billah et al 2015 lv et al 2017 ramillien et al 2006 tang and zhang 2011 water budget closure lv et al 2017 sheffield et al 2009 wang et al 2014 basin storage river flow relationships papa et al 2015 reager et al 2014 sproles et al 2015 groundwater

al 2009 long et al 2014 tang et al 2014 glacier ice cap changes and snow water equivalent chen et al 2007 frappart et al 2011 li et al 2019 in most of these grace data are combined with observations of e g precipitation and either hydrological or land surface models through the combination improved insight is provided into the water balance and fluxes in basins studied but less so into the performance of grace data in representing the dynamics of tws independent observation of tws dynamics at the basin level and how these are related to climatic phenomena such as enso is of importance to water resources management particularly in large and sparsely monitored basins and considering the projected intensification of the enso phenomenon cai et al 2015 in this paper we use grace data derived products to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of tws at the basin scale and their potential linkages to climate change and variability in the tropical magdalena cauca basin mc basin henceforth in northwestern south america we develop five main activities supplementary fig s1 after describing our data and methods section 2 we first assess the performance of multiple available grace products more details in section 2 in representing water storage dynamics as compared to independent water balance estimates based on terrestrial observations section 3 1 second we use the best performing grace product to investigate the existence of long term trends in the mc basin as a whole as well as in its major sub basins section 3 2 third we use the global land data assimilation system gldas to separate surface water sws and groundwater gws contributions to trends in tws fourth we use grace data to study the spatial variability of temporal trends in order to explore the existence of physically meaningful spatial patterns this mapping highlights an advantage of using grace data as it would not be possible with water balance estimates that depend on spatially non continuous and relatively scarce observations of water balance fluxes finally we explore the underlying mechanisms that explain the identified temporal trends and spatial patterns hypothesising that these are commensurate to enso related variability and pronounced biophysical differences in the basin section 4 we present our main conclusions in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 the magdalena cauca basin the region of interest in this study is the mc basin located in northwestern south america and draining an area of 276 000 km2 fig 1 the magdalena river originates from its headwaters in the andes at an elevation of approximately 3 700 m above sea level and runs for 1 612 km before flowing into the western caribbean in the atlantic ocean lópez et al 2018 restrepo and kjerfve 2000 the cauca river is the main tributary of the magdalena river flowing along the western part of the basin and joining the magdalena river in a inner delta wetland area called la mojana which is a part of the mompós depression the average precipitation regime of the basin is characterized by a markedly bi modal cycle fig 2 linked to the latitudinal migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz urrea et al 2019 though the bi modal cycle is more pronounced in the northern part of the basin seasonal variations in terrestrial water storage also exhibit a bi modal cycle focus on this basin is motivated by its paramount importance to water security and related energy and food security in colombia this importance is highlighted by the fact that the mc basin is the largest basin entirely contained within colombia covering around 25 of the country s continental area contains most of the reservoirs of the national hydropower system as well as multiple wetlands paramos montane wetland ecosystems unique to the northern andes and small watershed systems which are critical to water supply across the country angarita et al 2018 ideam and cormagdalena 2001 the national water study ena after its spanish acronym versions 2014 and 2018 identifies 34 aquifer systems in the mc basin supplementary fig s2 some of which have been extensively exploited and are critical to the agricultural sector of the country http www andi com co uploads ena 2018 comprimido pdf these aquifers will likely play a crucial role in safeguarding future water security and environmental sustainability ideam 2015 ideam 2019 further the mc basin is located in a region that is a world biodiversity hotspot rangel ch 2015 myers et al 2000 and has been identified as highly sensitive to enso induced climate variability hoyos et al 2013 bedoya soto et al 2019 the region is regarded to be highly vulnerable to climate change pabón caicedo 2012 magrin et al 2014 2 2 grace and water balance components data we use 183 months from april 2002 to june 2017 of grace derived monthly anomalies of tws from three different products the first product is constructed from post processed grace rl05 level 3 land l3 land data gridded at 1 110 km near the equator and based on the rl05 spherical harmonics sh basis function sh datasets are obtained from three sources the center for space research at university of texas csr austin the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and geoforschungs zentrum potsdam gfz processing centers landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 the ensemble mean of these three post processed grace datasets is used to balance the bias of any single post processing technique e g sakumura et al 2014 voss et al 2013 the second and third products are mascons producs from jpl and csr we denote these as jpl mascons and csr mascons respectively these are solutions gridded at 0 5 55 km that use regional mass concentration functions i e mascons to parameterize the gravity field mascon products have become operational within the last years save et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 all five solutions of grace land used in this study csr jpl gfz jpl mascon and csr mascon are available through the grace tellus page http grace jpl nasa gov supported by the nasa measures program in order to restore the signal lost through processing the scaling factors provided by each processing center to scale grace data and standard processing steps are used landerer and swenson 2012 ouma et al 2015 this signal loss refers to a smoothing and signal attenuation that result from the filtering process that is used to reduce grace data noise grace data are noisy with noise increasing with increasing sh degree landerer and swenson 2012 scanlon et al 2016 correcting the loss of signal is important because it reduces the ability of grace data to reproduce components of the observed water balance especially in small basins scanlon et al 2016 in the original grace data tws anomalies are relative to the 2004 2009 time mean baseline for consistency all other anomalies used in this study were calculated with respect to the same baseline missing data e g due to battery management were directly remedied by linear interpolation e g ouma et al 2015 xiao et al 2015 liesch and ohmer 2016 shamsudduha et al 2012 there were 20 out of 183 missing values corresponding to the following months mmm yy jun 02 jul 02 jun 03 jan 11 jun 11 may 12 oct 12 mar 13 aug 13 sep 13 feb 14 jul 14 dec 14 jun 15 oct 15 nov 15 apr 16 sep 16 oct 16 and feb 17 variations in water storage are always expressed as an equivalent water thickness e g cm of water the water balance components in the mc basin are estimated using a combination of data from the national network of gauging stations and global re analysis and satellite datasets in all cases these data correspond to the period 2002 2015 with the original values converted into anomalies relative to the common 2004 2009 baseline data from gauging stations of the national network were provided by the national institute of hydrology meteorology and environmental studies of colombia ideam for its spanish acronym available in http www ideam gov co and include time series of precipitation from 1084 gauges evaporation from 199 gauges and river flow from 5 gauges fig 1 precipitation data were also obtained from four products

the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam gleam combines multi satellite observations to estimate daily actual evaporation through a process based methodology both gleam versions v3a and v3b martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 are considered gleam v3a is based on satellite observed soil moisture vegetation optical depth and snow water equivalent air temperature and radiation from reanalysis and a multi source precipitation product whereas gleam v3b is largely driven by satellite data taking advantage of the multiple available data sources an ensemble of estimates of the variation in terrestrial water storage through the water balance is produced eq 1 table 1 summarizes the grace and water balance components data used in this study 2 3 comparing grace and water balance derived estimates of tws variation comparison between grace derived and water balance based estimates of tws variation has been widely used as a procedure for assessing grace data e g becker et al 2010 famiglietti et al 2011 voss et al 2013 nanteza et al 2016 scanlon et al 2018 using all sources of data for p and e as well as records of q near the outlet of the mc basin we first estimate monthly values of ds dt from the water balance equation eq 1 then we compare these water balance based estimates of ds dt with the time derivative of tws anomalies expressed as a forward difference derivative twsc of the form 2 ds dt n twsc n tws n tws n 1 where n 1 and n denote consecutive months and the primes indicate anomalies this comparison is used to differentiate between grace products with all further analyses using only the grace products found to perform best 2 4 isolation of gws contribution from grace derived tws variation tws anomalies derived from grace can be understood as the result of adding anomalies in groundwater storage gws and all forms of surface water storage sws e g chen et al 2016 shamsudduha et al 2012 famiglietti et al 2011 and others as expressed by 3 tws gws sws therefore anomalies of groundwater storage gws can be estimated as the residual of tws after subtracting sws sws includes multiple components though some may be negligible for a given region for instance the snow water equivalent can be assumed as negligible for the mc basin due to its tropical climate regime soil moisture sm is included in the definition of sws adopted here similar to other studies fatolazadeh et al 2016 ouma et al 2015 chen et al 2016 and arguably accounts for a considerable portion of sws variations huss et al 2017 another tws component that may be significant is surface water storage of major water bodies such as reservoirs and lakes e g becker et al 2010 swenson and wahr 2009 shamsudduha et al 2017 indeed most of the major reservoirs and some large wetland systems in colombia are located within the mc basin angarita et al 2018 in some studies this component is subtracted from tws to isolate gws e g famiglietti et al 2011 fatolazadeh et al 2016 huang et al 2016 liesch and ohmer 2016 and others however this requires an estimation of water storage dynamics in such water bodies e g using surface water altimetry data from legos voss et al 2013 which is not possible for the mc basin due to lack of data further water storage dynamics in large water bodies is often tightly coupled to gws dynamics through sub surface flows winter 1999 ouma et al 2015 from this perspective as with several other studies e g rodell et al 2007 moiwo et al 2012 ouma et al 2015 hachborn et al 2017 gws is calculated as 4 gws tws sm where sm can be estimated by means of hydrological or land surface models such as the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 gldas integrates ground and satellite observation based data sets for parameterizing forcing and constraining multiple hydrological or land surface models lsms in order to realistically simulate water and energy budgets and fluxes syed et al 2008 gldas is a robust simulation system that incorporates satellite and ground based observational data products using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques with the purpose of generating optimal fields of land surface states for soil moisture snow and fluxes at global scales and high spatial resolution 0 25 1 in near real time rodell et al 2004 gldas outputs have been similarly used in grace studies e g ni et al 2018 ospina et al 2018 ouma et al 2015 yang and chen 2015 gldas output from the noah lsm is used noah uses parameterizations of multiple land surface processes e g runoff infiltration and canopy conductance to simulate the evolution of the surface energy and water budgets in response to near surface atmospheric forcing as well as the dependence of this evolution on surface conditions such as vegetation state and soil texture ek et al 2003 this lsm provides the finer resolution 0 25 as compared to the other available lsms and has been successfully used to study the dynamics of water storage in tropical south america eom et al 2017 han et al 2009 2 5 detection of trends and breakpoints to analyse trends seasonality from grace data is removed by subtracting the monthly mean for each calendar month and then applying linear regression and the non parametric mann kendall mk test the mk test is a standard rank based procedure which allows assessing the significance of trends huang et al 2013 the segmented package in r muggeo et al 2008 is used to study whether the water storage records are better described by one or two trend lines i e whether there are breakpoints at which a trend is reduced e g the slope is reduced without changing its sign or even reversed the sign of the slope changes this trend analysis is performed for the whole mc basin and its main tributaries as well as for each grace grid cell in order to explore the existence of spatial patterns in tws variability 2 6 optical and synthetic aperture radar sar images to support our discussion of the spatial variability of trends variations in the extent of wetlands areas in the mompós depression are estimated based on palsar and landsat images e g escobar martínez 2011 anaya acevedo et al 2017 yuan et al 2015 palomino ángel et al 2019 dabrowska zielinska et al 2014 arnesen et al 2013 to characterize the extent of flooding during the 2010 2011 la niña wet season 43 available sar images were processed the l band hh polarized mode is adopted as it is known to be sensitive to water level change beneath the vegetation pope et al 1997 rosenqvist et al 2007 grings et al 2009 while maintaining coherence for interferometric processing kim et al 2009 for the dry season optical images are found to be better suited to identify wetland extent in tropical environments liesenberg et al 2007 deus 2016 36 landsat images are used to characterize wetlands in the mompós depression during the el niño of 2015 2016 data from palsar and landsat were obtained respectively from online portals

estimates fig 3 shows a comparison between the multiple grace based estimates of twsc and the corresponding estimates of ds dt based on the water balance eqs 1 and 2 three different grace based estimates are included the mean of the spherical harmonics sh basis functions from the csr jpl and gfz processing centers grace mean sh and the mascon products from jpl jpl mascon and csr csr mascon estimates derived from the water balance are established with 14 combinations that use all sources of data for p e and q table 1 in this taylor diagram filled and unfilled points correspond to observation based estimates obtained respectively with all 14 combinations of data sources and gauging stations from ideam only agreement between grace and water balance based estimates varies among the three grace products there are three clear differences first correlation is worst for the grace mean sh product red in fig 3 both for the time series and the annual cycle the poor correlation is particularly as a result of the lag in the first peak of the bi modal climate which for the grace mean sh product occurs between may june while all other estimates indicate the peak in april may this lag is evident in the average annual cycle fig 3b as a result of the pronounced lags that are observed in several years of the time series e g 2004 2006 2009 2012 and 2013 fig 3a second the bi modality of the annual cycle is less pronounced in estimates of csr mascon yellow in fig 3 than it is for all other estimates although this is not easy to detect by visual examination of the time series fig 3a it is evident in the average annual cycle fig 3b and results in the worst representation of temporal variance standard deviation obtained with this product yellow points in fig 3c third better agreement between grace and the water balance based estimates is found for the jpl mascon product blue in fig 3 in particular jpl mascon is clearly best in representing the average annual cycle fig 3b with the highest correlation lowest error and best standard deviation blue triangle in fig 3c as for the time series of monthly values fig 3a jpl mascon is comparable with grace mean sh in error and standard deviation but better in correlation blue vs red circles in fig 3c and comparable with csr mascon in correlation but much better in standard deviation blue vs yellow circles in fig 3c the only statistics in which jpl mascon is clearly worse than other product is in the error for the time series which is best for csr mascon blue vs yellow circles in fig 3c in summary jpl mascon produces better or comparable results with respect to other grace based estimates in almost all cases five out of six statistics this indicates that estimates based on jpl mascon are closer to water balance based estimates in the mc basin and hence we choose this product for further analysis 3 2 trends in water storage grace data jpl mascon henceforth reveals the existence of two different trends in terrestrial water storage tws during the study period for the whole mc basin fig 4 there is a positive trend i e an increase in water storage 0 14 0 02 cm month before 2010 and a negative trend i e a decrease or depletion of water storage 0 37 0 04 cm month afterwards this positive negative trend is equivalent to an increase decrease of tws of 41 04 5 19 km3 77 68 7 57 km3 during 2002 2010 2011 2017 in the mc basin in all cases reported trends are statistically significant meaning that the corresponding p value is lower than 0 05 and break points are identified by using the objective method described in section 2 the pattern consisting in a positive trend of water storage that is reversed in recent years is also present in major tributaries of the mc basin and for surface and groundwater storage fig 5 shows gws and sm while supplementary fig s3 shows the same map but for tws here we introduce the major sub basins of the whole mc basin and refer to them as the middle sub basins the upper middle magdalena umm and cauca c and upper sub basins the upper cauca uc and upper magdalena um soil moisture sm and groundwater gws storage contribute differently to trends in total terrestrial water storage tws at the scale of the whole basin mc as well as in its middle sub basins umm and c trends in groundwater are more pronounced than for soil moisture during the decreasing trend in 2011 2017 the umm basin lost around 27 64 km3 and 12 73 km3 of groundwater and soil moisture respectively during the same period the corresponding losses of groundwater storage and soil moisture in the c basin were close to 6 30 km3 and 4 78 km3 respectively the upper sub basins fig 5e d exhibit contrasting patterns when compared to the middle sub basins fig 5c b as well as the whole mc basin fig 5a two main differences are that in the upper sub basins depletion rates during recent years have been more pronounced for soil moisture than for groundwater and break point may be located in 2008 i e earlier than the break point identified in 2010 for the other basins despite these differences two findings are still common to the whole mc basin and all of its major sub basins i there has been a water storage depletion trend in recent years which in most cases only exceptions are for soil moisture in the upper sub basins fig 5e d was preceded by a positive trend and ii the depleting trend coincides with a period between enso extremes common patterns and differences between sub basins are further discussed in section 4 temporal trends in water storage are not uniformly distributed across space in the mc basin there is a marked difference between the higher upstream south of 7 5 latitude and lower downstream north of 7 5 latitude parts of the basin fig 6 note that this partition of the mc basin around 7 5 latitude this is not an arbitrary selection but a result based on fig 6 implies that the upper sub basins are in the upper part of the basin while the middle sub basins include areas in both the higher and lower parts of the basin average trends have the same sign in both parts of the basin positive during 2002 2010 and negative for 2011 2017 but are much more pronounced in the lower part during the positive trend period water storage increased about 26 14 km3 trend is 0 23 0 03 cm month in the lower part of the basin whereas it increased around 13 99 km3 trend is 0 08 0 02 cm month in the higher part likewise the decreasing trend in the lower part 0 60 0 06 cm month is equivalent to a loss of 49 96 km3 during the period while in the higher part 0 24 0 03 cm month the corresponding loss is about 31 80 km3 from fig 6 it is evident that the monthly variability variance of tws is higher for the northern time series than it is for the southern time series even if the trends are removed this implies that the trends have different levels of significance likewise the variability of gws is higher than that of sm fig 5 with consequent differences in the significance of the trends despite these differences all trends are found to be statistically significant differences in trends between the northern and southern parts of the mc basin are not attributable to differences in the size of these areas likewise differences between trends shown in fig 5 are not attributable to differences in the size of sub basins this is because time series data in figs 5 and 6 are normalized by the size of the corresponding area this area is directly related to but does not fully describe the storage capacity which depends also on the properties of soil columns and related land atmosphere dynamics some important factors affecting these properties and dynamics will be discussed in the next section 4 discussion in this section we explore the reasons and or mechanisms behind our three main findings as well as their implications for water security and environmental sustainability the first finding is that among different grace based products the jpl mascon product exhibits a closer agreement with water balance based estimates of water storage dynamics in the mc basin section 3 1 this finding generally agrees with scanlon et al 2016 who describe several advantages of mascon solutions relative to sh such as the increase of signal amplitude due to the reduction of leakage from land to ocean and the application of geophysical data constraints during processing with little empirical post processing required in contrast to the sh approach in which noise reduction and signal restoration are applied as post processing steps noise is reduced during mascon processing by applying constraints scanlon et al 2016 the use of mass concentrations leads to better signal to noise ratios of the mascon fields as compared to the sh solutions watkins et al 2015 shamsudduha et al 2017 in contrast to sh products used to produce our grace ensemble jpl mascon does not require the use of scaling factors in post processing which are needed in sh products to restore the signal lost during the processing of the truncation of the gravity coefficients and filtering landerer and swenson 2012 jpl mascon as well as csr mascon estimates terrestrial mass changes directly from inter satellite acceleration measurements and can be used without further post processing rowlands et al 2010 watkins et al 2015 shamsudduha et al 2017 another difference between sh and mascons is that sh solutions are global whereas mascons can be applied at regional to global scales scanlon et al 2016 this difference is important because in the global sh solutions one cannot distinguish between land and ocean areas hence the generally higher land signals leak into the lower ocean signals thereby reducing signal amplitudes in contrast land and ocean areas can be explicitly defined during mascon processing reducing leakage errors relative to the sh solutions scanlon et al 2016 also gridded mascon fields are provided at the improved spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 while sh solutions are available at a resolution of 1 1 the greater resolution of mascons solutions for smaller spatial regions watkins et al 2015 may also provide an explanation for the lag between sh and mascons solutions particularly for the first peak april may of the largely bi modal climate while the upper basin is clearly bi modal fig 3 the lower basin tends to a more uni modal climate with an extended wet season whether the lag is due to the poorer resolution of sh solutions resulting in a mixed representation of the heterogeneous climate or due to the sh solution better capturing the dynamic of the lower basin than the upper basin is open to additional research as compared to the other mascon type product i e csr mascon jpl mascon has two differences that we consider consistent with the better performance found first these mascon products differ in their spatial resolution jpl mascon samples the gravity field at approximately the native resolution of the grace mission at the equator whereas csr mascon deliberately oversamples the gravity field at the equator to increase the solution resolution at higher latitudes watkins et al 2015 save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 this may be why csr maps present a spatial distribution smoother than jpl maps so that it is difficult to identify areas with special interest e g supplementary fig s3 the second difference between jpl mascon and csr mascon solutions is that they represent two fundamentally different approaches to applying constraints among these differences jpl mascon constraints are based on both grace data and geophysical models whereas csr mascon constraints are based on grace data only watkins et al 2015 save et al 2016 hence jpl mascon uses a combination of near global geophysical models along with altimetry observations to improve mass flux estimates globally which may be particularly important in the complex terrain of the andes watkins et al 2015 scanlon et al 2016 also show that csr mascon has slightly higher errors than all the other solutions for large basins for further comparison between sh and mascon grace products we refer the reader to scanlon et al 2016 and shamsudduha et al 2017 overall our results suggest that jpl mascon is preferrable than other products for the assessments of water storage dynamics in the mc basin the second finding is the existence of significant temporal trends in water storage that shift from positive increase in water storage to negative water storage depletion during the study period section 3 2 in the mc basin as a whole as well as in its middle sub basins c and umm this shift occurs during the 2010 2011 la niña figs 4 and 5a c the resulting negative trend continues until the 2015 2016 el niño this is further clarified by fig 7 which shows the evolution of tws anomalies along with precipitation anomalies and the multivariate enso index mei wolter and timlin 1993 several other similar concepts are highlighted in fig 7 the depleting trend occurs between two strong enso extremes that had extensive impacts in the mc basin the 2010 2011 la niña was related with severe flooding hoyos et al 2013 while the 2015 2016 el niño was linked with the most severe drought in recent years hoyos et al 2017 martinez et al 2017 indeed the maximum tws 22 60 cm in december 2010 and minimum tws 21 48 cm in march 2016 values of tws anomalies found during the whole study period occurs during these enso extremes fig 7 also shows that weaker la niña e g 2007 2008 and el niño e g 2009 2010 events can be related with positive and negative anomalies of tws respectively this is consistent with la niña and el niño being typically associated with positive and negative anomalies of precipitation in this region witnessed by the positive negative anomalies of precipitation mirroring negative positive values of mei the correlation between deseasonalized tws anomalies and mei is also negative 0 71 indicating that negative positive values of mei during la niña el niño are related with positive negative anomalies of tws this correlation between mei and tws anomalies exhibits the same pattern as the correlation between mei and precipitation found for northwestern south america waylen and poveda 2002 poveda 2004 guarin and poveda 2013 as well as in other tropical regions in which la niña and el niño are related with positive negative precipitation anomalies phillips et al 2012 awange et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 the correlation between tws and mei improves slightly up to 0 73 if the time series are lagged by two months consistent with the notion that the effects of enso on the hydrology of the region are lagged guarin and poveda 2013 ni et al 2018 these results concur with the conclusion that the mc basin is in a region highly sensitive to enso extremes poveda 2004 and are consistent with the premise that the observed trends in water storage figs 4 and 5 are strongly modulated by enso extremes it is notable that in the upper sub basins the objective method does not identify the break point in the trend in 2010 but rather in 2008 fig 5d e the depleting trend in these sub basins is significant if starting at 2010 as well results not shown that the objective method identifies this break point in 2008 may however be related to physically meaningful differences between the upper and middle sub basins there were two la niña years around 2008 fig 7 and the effect of la niña 2010 2011 on tws was less pronounced in the upper sub basins fig 5d e than in the middle sub basins fig 5b c or the whole basin fig 5a this is evident from comparison between peak values of tws anomalies which occur in 2008 for the upper sub basins despite this difference in the start of the depleting trend there is a clear pattern common to all sub basins and the mc basin as a whole a depleting trend which starts during la niña around either 2008 or 2010 and continues until el niño 2015 2016 i e that occurs between enso extremes although our results indicate that climate variability plays a major role in water storage dynamics they do not allow to relate the water storage depletion trends found with climate change near the end of our study period there is an evident positive trend in tws after around 2016 this may be interpreted as recovery of the tws after the strong el niño of 2015 2016 we do not isolate this trend in our analysis because it occurs during a very short period of time given the available period of record the period of record available also means that we cannot be conclusive on the existence of a climate change signal in water storage dynamics in the mc basin e g long term persistent water storage depletion this highlights the importance of long term monitoring of water storage dynamics which in the case of grace and the mc basin depends on international efforts beyond the reach of colombia such continued monitoring is critical for distinguishing between climate variability and the potential effects of climate change the implications for water security and environmental sustainability and water resources management planning are quite different for positive negative trends in tws modulated by enso than for a persistent depletion rate as a result of climate change e g buytaert and de bièvre 2012 ideam et al 2015 more frequent and or intense el niño events as a result of climate change duque villegas et al 2019 cai et al 2015 cai et al 2014 could however exacerbate longer term depletion rates in the region other signals of climate change have been identified in the region including the shrinkage of tropical glaciers poveda and pineda 2009 and long term trends in monthly hydro climatic series including streamflow precipitation and temperature carmona and poveda 2014 the third finding is that the magnitude not the sign of temporal trends exhibit a pronounced difference between the lower and higher parts of the basin fig 6 this spatial heterogeneity largely coincides with the pronounced differences between these parts of the basin the higher part of the basin to the south is in the andes mountains and is characterized by complex terrain with pronounced elevation gradients elevation ranges from approximately 41 to 5500 m a s l there are also pronounced gradients in biophysical properties including biodiversity josse et al 2011 weather and climate regimes poveda 2004 ideam and cormagdalena 2001 geomorphology and soils ideam and cormagdalena 2001 this andean part of the mc basin is also characterized by the presence of dams and reservoirs angarita et al 2018 strategic ecosystems including paramos ortiz et al 2005 and tropical forests rodriguez and armenteras 2005 as well as tropical glaciers on the highest peaks rabatel et al 2013 all of which can exert a significant influence on the hydrology of the basin at multiple scales indeed the progressing loss of paramos tropical forests and glaciers has raised concerns on how these changes will affect future water security in the tropical andes bradley et al 2006 buytaert et al 2011 vuille 2013 compared to the higher part of the mc basin the lower part constitutes much flatter terrain characterized by the presence of extensive wetland systems mainly in the mompós depression angarita et al 2018 and a drier climate with some areas experiencing increasing aridity and desertification processes jaramillo mejia and chernichovsky 2019 etter et al 2008 fig 8 illustrates how the spatial extent of these wetlands was largely reduced between 2010 and 2016 consistent with water depletion during the same period the mompós wetlands system are severely impacted by droughts and floods related to enso extremes indeed while the 2010 2011 la niña caused severe flooding and concomitant damage due to e g the breach of a large artificial levee in the cauca river nardini and idarraga 2016 the 2015 2016 el niño caused a severe drought with significant impacts on local water security and related economic impacts martinez et al 2017 we interpret the result of the more pronounced positive before 2010 and negative after 2010 trends in the lower part of the basin as a higher sensitivity of water storage in this region to external forcing due to enso variability this higher sensitivity can be related to the high variability of water storage in the extensive wetlands of the region fig 8 indeed previous studies have found a close relation between wetland dynamics and tws xie et al 2016 o loughlin et al 2018 lee et al 2011 wetlands are inextricably linked to other key players of the terrestrial water balance such as rivers and aquifers during wet conditions extensive wetlands in a flat terrain or depression e g the mompós depression can enhance tws via retention of water from increased precipitation and river discharges including floods la niña and particularly the strong 2010 2011 event exacerbated the wet conditions in the lower part of the mc basin in contrast during dry conditions wetlands can enhance the reduction of tws via direct evaporation from extensive areas of free surface water especially if the availability of energy is relatively high such as in tropical regions 5 conclusions we assess the performance of selected grace products in representing the dynamics of water storage in the northwestern south america more specifically in the magdalena cauca mc basin in colombia the potential of grace derived products in understanding of these dynamics and their relation to climate variability is significant to water resources planning in large sparsely monitored river basins our results show that grace based estimates of the water storage are comparable to estimates obtained through the water balance equation using independent sources of the constituent components of the water balance precipitation evaporation and river discharge the performance of the different available grace products is however not uniform the mascon product developed by the jet propulsion laboratory jpl mascon is found to be best suited for describing the spatial and temporal variability of terrestrial water storage tws in the tropical mc basin the jpl mascon data reveals the existence of trends in terrestrial water storage in the mc basin that have shifted from positive i e increase of water storage to negative i e water storage depletion during the study period these trends and shifts are evident not only in the total terrestrial water storage but also in soil moisture and groundwater and have not only occurred in the mc basin as a whole but are also evident in its major sub basins compared to soil moisture the contribution of groundwater to these trends in total water storage is generally larger we find that identified shifts in trends are clearly related to enso with the most pronounced trend in the period of analysis occurring between the strong 2010 2011 la niña and 2015 2016 el niño events the trends in water storage are however not uniform across the mc basin exhibiting a pronounced contrast between the higher and the lower parts of the basin i e between the mountainous andean and flatter near the caribbean sea parts of the basin we interpret the more pronounced trends in the lower part of the basin as a higher sensitivity of water storage to enso variability related with the presence of extensive wetlands that can exacerbate both water retention during wet conditions related to la niña and water loss during dry conditions related to el niño this has implications for future planning and management of water resources particularly considering projections of increased frequency and severity of enso events these results provide a first quantitative assessment of grace data for this basin contributing to the global assessment of grace as a reliable source of data for the study of terrestrial water resources and highlighting the importance of continuing monitoring efforts like grace credit authorship
