4720,although irrigation practices affect food production and water resource management with ever more impacting effects under climate change and population increasing scenarios detailed knowledge of irrigation is still lacking in fact explicit information on the spatial occurrence of irrigation and on the amounts of water used for this purpose is often not available thus making irrigation the missing variable to comprehensively understand the hydrological cycle dynamics over agricultural areas nevertheless remote sensing techniques can be used to delimit the irrigation extent in this study the capability of five remotely sensed soil moisture products to detect the irrigation signal over an area intensely equipped for irrigation in the north east of spain is investigated moreover a method to map the actually irrigated areas based on the k means clustering algorithm is proposed the remote sensing soil moisture data sets used in this study are smos soil moisture and ocean salinity at 1 km smap soil moisture active passive at 1 km and 9 km sentinel 1 at 1 km and ascat advanced scatterometer at 12 5 km the 1 km resolution versions of smos and smap are obtained by downscaling coarser smos and smap data through the dispatch disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change algorithm the analyses are supported by an additional data set of soil moisture at 1 km resolution simulated by the surfex isba surface externalisée interaction sol biosphère atmosphère land surface model among all the considered data sets the l band passive microwave downscaled products show the best performances in detecting the irrigation signal over the pilot area especially smap at 1 km the proposed maps of irrigated areas derived by exploiting soil moisture from smap at 1 km data set agree well up to 78 with the ground truth derived irrigated areas furthermore the method is able to well distinguish the actually irrigated areas from rainfed agricultural areas thus representing a useful tool to obtain reliable spatial information about the areas where irrigation actually occurs keywords irrigation remote sensing soil moisture land surface modeling 1 introduction human induced changes on the hydrological cycle nowadays rival the geophysical processes with short term impacts that can be stricter than the effects of climate changes irrigation is the anthropogenic activity that introduces the largest imbalances in the natural hydrological cycle at different spatial scales wada et al 2014 alter et al 2015 in the past decades the irrigation practices allowed to double the agricultural production despite an increase of cropland by only 12 rosegrant et al 2002 gleick 2003 it is estimated that over 70 of global freshwater withdrawals are destined to irrigation practices foley et al 2011 with the major rates of water consumption attributable to northern america europe northern india and eastern china zhou et al 2016 the ever growing global population and consequent increases of food requirements combined with rising global mean temperatures are expected to further stress the freshwater availability for irrigation purposes especially over areas already facing water scarcity vörösmarty et al 2000 rockström et al 2012 kummu et al 2016 it appears clear that under this scenario a rational management of irrigation practices is required methods to retrieve information about irrigation water volumes romaguera et al 2014 brocca et al 2018 jalilvand et al 2019 dari et al 2020 filippucci et al 2020 and the detailed knowledge of the irrigation extent kumar et al 2015 ambika and mishra 2016 gao et al 2018 zaussinger et al 2019 are challenging targets for the development of sustainable agricultural practices and for the water resource management in the upcoming decades the rise of remote sensing has led to new perspectives in monitoring irrigated lands this technology has proven to be a promising tool for mapping the exact locations and spatial extensions of irrigated areas thus enhancing approximate statistical information within arbitrary political edges ozdogan et al 2010 several studies have investigated the detectability of irrigation signals by using optical data only ozdogan and gutman 2008 peña arancibia et al 2014 ambika and mishra 2016 optical data supported by land surface modeling romaguera et al 2014 hain et al 2015 microwave data only lawston et al 2017 gao et al 2018 and microwave data supported by land surface modeling kumar et al 2015 escorihuela and quintana seguí 2016 the first study exploiting microwave sensors to detect irrigated areas was carried out by kumar et al 2015 who investigated the capability of several remotely sensed soil moisture products to detect irrigation over the conus contiguous united states area the data sets used were ascat advanced scatterometer amsr e advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system esa cci sm european space agency climate change initiative soil moisture smos soil moisture and ocean salinity and windsat the detection of irrigated areas was supported by comparisons with modeled soil moisture obtained by the noah land surface model which does not take into account of irrigation hence positive biases between satellite and modeled soil moisture data were interpreted as a signal of irrigation only ascat showed some potential in detecting irrigation over wide irrigated areas in the plains of nebraska over the same area zaussinger et al 2019 found scarce correlation between ascat retrieved and merra 2 modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications 2 reanalysis soil moisture in absence of precipitation however a similar pattern was also found over rainfed agricultural areas escorihuela and quintana seguí 2016 compared four soil moisture products ascat amsr e smos and a version of smos at 1 km obtained by downscaling the original product through the disaggregation based on physical and theorical scale change dispatch algorithm with soil moisture simulated by the surfex isba surface externalisée interaction sol biosphère atmosphère land surface model over the northeast of the iberian peninsula the results pointed out the potential of the high resolution version of smos to detect the irrigation signal in terms of low correlation with modeled soil moisture over an intensely irrigated area the urgell in the catalonia autonomous community over areas with a similar flat topography but not irrigated higher correlations were obtained lawston et al 2017 showed the capability of the enhanced 9 km version of smap soil moisture active passive to detect the irrigation signal over three semiarid regions in the western united states very recently gao et al 2018 exploited sentinel 1 sar synthetic aperture radar time series to map irrigated fields over an agricultural site in the urgell catalonia spain however studies exploiting remote sensing soil moisture to map irrigation over areas where high resolution products are needed are still lacking in fact irrigation is practiced worldwide at different spatial scales depending on several factors e g the topography or climate this work is aimed at showing the capability of high resolution products in detecting irrigation occurring at a spatial scale compatible with the mediterranean environment as a first objective of this study the capability of five remotely sensed soil moisture products to detect irrigation during the biennium 2016 2017 over an intensely irrigated area located in spain is evaluated three of the considered data sets are high resolution 1 km products smos at 1 km smap at 1 km and sentinel 1 the first two products are downscaled versions of coarser resolution smos and smap data obtained through the dispatch algorithm merlin et al 2013 the other two products used in this study have a coarser resolution and are the enhanced version of smap 9 km sampling and ascat 12 5 km sampling the choice of the data sets is related to the extent of the pilot area and it is mainly oriented on high resolution 1 km products however the two coarser resolution data sets have been included in order to perform a comprehensive analysis involving medium to high resolution products obtained through different operational bands an additional data set of modeled soil moisture at 1 km obtained by forcing the surfex isba land surface model with atmospheric data from era 5 reanalysis resampled at the same resolution is used as a support for the analyses as a secondary objective a method to map the actually irrigated areas based on the k means clustering algorithm and exploiting the best performing products over the study area is proposed 2 study area the study area is located in the north eastern part of spain within the ebro river basin and has an extension of about 125 km 80 km a part of it falls in catalonia while the other part is inside aragon this tile encloses an irrigated land surrounding the city of lleida an overview of the study area is given in fig 1 which shows where the area is located the map of the area equipped for irrigation and the land cover map the area equipped for irrigation is derived from the global map of irrigated areas gmia version 5 0 produced by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao siebert et al 2013 the data is expressed as the percentage of each cell area that is equipped for irrigation and has a spatial resolution of 5 arc minutes about 10 km at the equator the land cover map is derived from the corine land cover clc provided by the copernicus land monitoring service the map has a 100 m resolution and it is referred to the year 2018 according to the structure of the irrigation canals network it is possible to distinguish two different irrigated portions within the pilot area the first one henceforth urgell area mainly supplied by the urgell and the algerri balaguer canals in the east side and the second one henceforth catalan and aragonese area mainly supplied by the catalan and aragonese canal in the west side within the urgell area different irrigation systems coexist in the old irrigation district the most used system is inundation while in algerri balaguer drip irrigation is typically used for fruit trees and sprinkler irrigation is used for crops the irrigation systems in the area supplied by the catalan and aragonese canal are flood irrigation 18 of the area sprinkler irrigation 54 and drip irrigation 28 these differences in the adopted irrigation methods contribute in making the irrigated fields more scattered within this area several pivot infrastructures can be observed the timing of the irrigation practices depends on several factors e g the crop type but they are mainly concentrated during the summer period from may to september the frequency depends on the irrigation technique for example within the urgell in the old system inundation irrigation occurs typically every two weeks while in modern irrigated areas irrigation can occur every day in both areas summer cereals and forage are present fruit trees are spread in the south of both irrigated lands in the east of urgell and along the river channel that divides the two areas in the catalan and aragonese domain there is an area destined to vineyard towards the east of urgell there is a wide area of rainfed cropland which is connected to the south to olive groves through a mixed zone of sparse shrubs this entire portion is generally dry during summer thus creating an extended dryland that is in contrast with the irrigated areas which appear lush especially in the dry season the two strongly different wetness conditions coexisting in the area of interest contribute in making it an optimal site to test the capability of remote sensing data to spot where irrigation practices occur 3 materials and methods 3 1 remote sensing data in this study five soil moisture products have been considered smos at 1 km smap at 1 km and 9 km sentinel 1 at 1 km and ascat at 12 5 km the first two products are obtained by downscaling coarser smos and smap data through the dispatch algorithm 3 1 1 smos the smos mission was launched by the european space agency esa in november 2009 kerr et al 2001 2010 to collect global measurements of soil moisture over the continents and of salinity over the oceans it is the second esa s earth explorer opportunity mission which is jointed with the centre national d estudes spatiales cnes and the centro para el desarrollo tecnológico industrial cdti the revisit period of smos is 3 days at the equator which is crossed at 06 00 and 18 00 local solar time lst during the ascending and descending orbits respectively the smos satellite carries an y shaped passive 2d interferometric radiometer working at l band frequency 1 4 ghz and is capable to collect multiangular observations of the brightness temperature thus retrieving surface soil moisture and other parameters the original smos soil moisture data has a spatial resolution ranging between 35 and 50 km and is obtained through the level 2 l2 retrieval algorithm which exploits additional static soil texture topography index land use and dynamic rain temperature frost and thaw cycle data sets kerr et al 2012 in this study a high resolution 1 km dispatch downscaled version merlin et al 2008 is used the dispatch method allows to downscale smos surface soil moisture from low resolution about 40 km to high resolution 1 km by using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the land surface temperature data both at 1 km resolution detected by modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensor aboard terra eos am and aqua eos pm satellites the disaggregation of coarser soil moisture data is performed by separating the evaporation from the surface soil layer 0 5 cm and the transpiration from the root zone due to the vegetation hence the soil evaporative efficiency see defined as the ratio of actual to potential evaporation can be estimated over the bare soil the spatial link between the optical derived see and the near surface soil moisture allows to distribute the high resolution soil moisture around the mean value of the low resolution product merlin et al 2012 providing outputs with the same temporal resolution of the coarser resolution input data the dispatch method does not require in situ observations to disaggregate coarse resolution data but its applicability is limited to cloudless conditions peng et al 2017 however when there are clouds the algorithm attributes the low resolution soil moisture value to the high resolution pixel merlin et al 2013 compared smos soil moisture at 40 km and two dispatch disaggregated versions at 3 km and 100 m with in situ measurements aggregated at the same spatial scales over pilot sites in catalonia and observed enhancements of the spatio temporal correlation when considering the downscaled products in fact a value of correlation equal to 0 59 was found for the 40 km resolution product while correlation values were 0 67 for the 3 km version and 0 73 and 0 86 for two different configurations of the 100 m resolution product a similar study was carried out by malbéteau et al 2015 which evaluated the performances of coarse and dispatch downscaled 1 km versions of smos and amsr e soil moisture products against in situ observations over the south east of australia the study highlighted enhancements in the correlation with ground measurements over a semi arid region obtained during summer for the disaggregated products with respect to their coarser resolution versions correlation values increased from 0 37 to 0 63 and from 0 47 to 0 73 in afternoon overpasses for smos and amsr e respectively and from 0 63 to 0 78 and from to 0 42 to 0 71 in morning overpasses for smos and amsr e respectively molero et al 2016 evaluated the performances of dispatch downscaled smos at 1 km under different climatic conditions obtaining higher correlations with ground observations over semi arid areas where the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture is mainly determined by precipitation and irrigation with respect to sub humid regions 3 1 2 smap the smap mission was launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa at the end of january 2015 with the aim of collecting soil moisture data and to detect the freeze thaw state at global scale entekhabi et al 2010 smap has a revisit period of 2 3 days at the equator which is overpassed at 06 00 lst during the descending orbit and at 18 00 lst during the ascending orbit originally smap was supposed to enhance the resolution of radiometer only retrievals by combining the benefits of active and passive remote sensing through an l band radar 1 26 ghz and an l band radiometer 1 4 ghz thus providing surface soil moisture measurements at three different resolutions 3 km 9 km and 36 km unfortunately the radar stopped working only a few months after the launch so only the 36 km and the enhanced 9 km products have been delivered during the post radar period however a 3 km version obtained by merging with data retrieved by sentinel 1a sentinel 1b has been recently released das et al 2019 the 9 km sampling product whose complete name is smap level 2 enhanced passive soil moisture product l2 sm p e is obtained after the interpolation of the antenna temperature data in the smap original brightness temperature product through the backus gilbert technique poe 1990 stogryn 1978 and several calibration and correction processes chan et al 2018 both smos and smap radiometers operate within the protected earth exploration satellite service passive frequency allocation of 1400 1427 mhz however unauthorized in band transmitters and out of band emissions from transmitters operating at frequencies adjacent to this allocated spectrum cause interference to microwave radiometry in this band thanks to smos it was realised that radio frequency interference rfi was affecting measurements in this protected band and the smap radiometer included a special flight hardware to enable the detection and filtering of rfi in this study we use the 9 km sampling version o neill et al 2016 and a 1 km resolution version derived through the dispatch downscaling algorithm described in the previous section 3 1 3 sentinel 1 the sentinel 1 constellation is the first of the six missions developed by esa for copernicus the european earth observation program and consists of two identical satellites sentinel 1a and sentinel 1b launched in april 2014 and april 2016 respectively the sentinel 1 satellites carry a single sar operating at c band frequency c sar 5 4 ghz which is capable to collect measurements in four different ways the one of interest for soil moisture observations is the interferometric wide swath iw mode the data detected through this technique are the basis of the production of the sentinel 1 surface soil moisture ssm delivered by the copernicus global land service and used in this work since 2016 when both the satellites of the sentinel 1 constellation are operational the coverage over europe is guaranteed with a revisit time ranging between 1 5 and 4 days but it can go down up to 6 days over the rest of the earth the sentinel 1 ssm is retrieved by adapting to high resolution sar data the change detection algorithm wagner et al 1999 hornáček et al 2012 originally developed by the vienna university of technology bauer marschallinger et al 2018 the soil moisture product is delivered with three masks one for water areas one for pixels with low sensitivity and one for excessive terrain slope 3 1 4 ascat the ascat remote sensing instrument on board of the eumetsat meteorological operational satellites metop series is a real aperture active radar operating at c band frequency 5 3 ghz and using vertically polarized antennas the first satellite of metop series metop a was launched in october 2006 metop b was launched later in september 2012 in order to ensure the continuity of observations after the end of metop a operational life the last metop satellite metop c was launched in november 2018 ascat global coverage is obtained every 1 3 days and the equator is overpassed at 21 30 during the ascending pass and at 09 30 during the descending pass originally ascat was designed to monitor wind speed and direction over the oceans and was not supposed to collect soil moisture observation but studies focused on the antecedent version of the instrument escat proved the suitability of ascat in monitoring soil moisture pulliainen et al 1998 wen and su 2003 wagner et al 2007 the ascat soil moisture product is obtained through the change detection algorithm wagner et al 1999 2013 bartalis et al 2007 naeimi et al 2009 developed by the vienna university of technology and is furnished as degree of saturation ranging between 0 and 1 ascat soil moisture has a spatial resolution of 25 km and is provided resampled on a 12 5 km grid in this study the h115 soil moisture product distributed by eumetsat hsaf and available from 2007 to 2018 is used 3 2 surfex modeling platform the modeled soil moisture data set used in this study is obtained from the surfex modeling platform masson et al 2013 developed by météo france surfex allows to calculate the surface fluxes and it consists of independent physical schemes that allow describing four different kind of surfaces natural surfaces urbanized areas inland water and oceans in the study presented here only the isba scheme for natural surfaces has been used isba noilhan and planton 1989 mahfouf and noilhan 1996 noilhan and mahfouf 1996 contains several algorithms to compute the exchanges of energy and water between the surface soil vegetation snow continuum and the atmosphere several versions of the isba scheme have been developed in time boone et al 1999 boone 2000 habets et al 2003 in this study the isba dif version is used where the soil is divided in n layers with n equal to 14 by default and the root zone has a variable extension depending on vegetation simulations have been carried out at 1 km resolution by using the latest version of the model surfex v8 1 obtained from the centre national de recherches météorologiques in general 1d hydrological assumptions adopted in land surface models as the absence of lateral flows in surfex isba are expected to become less valid with the increase of the resolution at which simulations are performed however in the pilot area lateral flows are supposed to be negligible and thus the missing modeling of such processes is expected to be not relevant in fact the study area is dry and rather flat especially over the irrigated land thus lateral flows are of several orders of magnitude lower than vertical flows e g evapotranspiration infiltration drainage in the performed simulation a prescribed vegetation scheme based on the climatology of the leaf area index lai has been adopted hence the vegetation is the same every year this simplified approach has been preferred to a more accurate interactive vegetation scheme available in surfex isba as in this study the modeling part has been involved with the aim of showing the soil moisture distribution in absence of irrigation and the adopted approach is able to represent the first order effects of a lack of irrigation without adding complexity to the modeling it is noteworthy that a new irrigation scheme has been implemented in the next version of surfex to be released druel et al 2019 in this configuration isba is able to simulate sprinkler drip and flood irrigation over irrigated areas experiencing a soil moisture deficit the atmospheric data to force the model are taken from the era 5 reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 released by the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf the era 5 data provided at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 has been downloaded from the copernicus climate data store in order to run surfex isba hourly data of 2 m air temperature and relative humidity precipitation wind speed and downward visible and infrared radiation are needed it is noteworthy that although the input data is at an hourly time step the model s internal step is of higher resolution 15 min before the simulation the input atmospheric variables have been resampled to the finer grid of the model 1 km furthermore a lapse rate correction to temperature and relative humidity has been performed to overcome the vertical mismatch between the coarse resolution relief of era 5 and the high resolution relief gtopo30 adopted in surfex recently albergel et al 2018 showed the benefits of forcing isba simulations with era 5 atmospheric data in terms of the good representation of the surface variables linked to the terrestrial hydrological cycle e g soil moisture the modeled surface soil moisture used in this study is referred to the first 4 cm of soil and is obtained by the weighted average between the first two layers of the soil parametrization whose thicknesses are up to 1 cm and up to 4 cm respectively 3 3 temporal stability the temporal stability theory is a well established method originally introduced by vachaud et al 1985 to identify optimal soil moisture measurement points within a certain area this technique has been widely applied in studies aimed to optimize the soil moisture monitoring see e g brocca et al 2010 gao et al 2015 dari et al 2019 or the raingauge network design morbidelli et al 2019 in this study the key variables of the method are used to calculate indices expressing the dynamics of soil moisture both in space and time let θ xt be the soil moisture observed or modeled at the pixel x of the grid and at the day t assuming that θ t is the spatial mean of soil moisture referred to the whole area and to each day the relative differences δ xt for each pixel and for each day are given by 1 δ xt θ xt θ t θ t for each pixel x the temporal mean δ x and the standard deviation σ δ x can be calculated by 2 δ x 1 t t 1 t δ xt 3 σ δ x 1 t 1 t 1 t δ xt δ x 2 where t is the total number of considered days the relative difference is an index giving information about the spatial variability of soil moisture the perspective proposed by mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 allows to investigate also the temporal dynamics of soil moisture by exploiting the anomalies the temporal anomalies a xt quantify how much the soil moisture at pixel x differs from its temporal mean and can be calculated as follows 4 a xt θ xt θ x θ x where θ x is the temporal mean referred to pixel x a x and a t indicate the temporal and spatial mean of temporal anomalies respectively 3 4 k means clustering k means is one of the most widespread clustering algorithms it allows to group n data points into k clusters on the basis of predefined characteristics each cluster is identified by a centroid determined through an iterative process starting from a first attempt randomly chosen among the input data then the algorithm associates each data point to the nearest centroid thus grouping elements with the same features the association of each element to its cluster is performed by minimizing the euclidean distance d between the input vector and the centroids vector 5 d i 1 k j 1 n x j c i where x j is the j th element of the input vector with j 1 n and c i is the i th centroid with i 1 k more details on the algorithm can be found in macqueen 1967 in this study the k means algorithm is employed to classify on the basis of satellite and modeled soil moisture three kinds of surfaces within the study area the area actually irrigated the dryland and forest or natural areas four sets of features are used to group the data into the three clusters the first set is composed by the standard deviation of the relative differences and the mean temporal anomaly calculated for the satellite soil moisture the second set is composed by the mean relative difference and the mean temporal anomaly derived from the satellite soil moisture in the third and fourth sets respectively the correlation between satellite and modeled soil moisture is added to the previous two parameters for each year all the considered features are referred to the period ranging from may to september when irrigation mainly occurs 3 5 ground truth data the ground truth data set used in this study is the map of crops in catalonia for the years 2016 and 2017 distributed by the department d agricultura ramaderia pesca i alimentació it is an open access map produced in the same domain of the geographic information system for agricultural parcels sigpac available at http agricultura gencat cat ca serveis cartografia sig aplicatius tematics geoinformacio sigpac mapa cultius the map is produced by integrating the agricultural parcels data produced by sigpac with the declaració unica agrària dun document which consists in a yearly mandatory declaration about the agricultural exploitation that each owner of an agricultural productive area must provide in order to optimize the product some corrections are performed before its delivering the non cultivated areas forest urban areas pastures and unproductive areas are masked out the parcels smaller than 50 m2 and those with incomplete dun documents are deleted and some geometry points are simplified however these corrections reduce the originally declared area by less than 1 for each plot the resulting yearly crops maps contain information about the geographic and administrative localization the type of cultivated product the irrigation coefficient and the extension in this study the sigpac crops maps have been used as the ground truth data set to validate the k means retrieved classification maps two kind of validations have been performed the first one exploits the irrigation coefficient information while in the second one the attribute regarding the kind of crop is used unfortunately the ground truth data set is available for catalonia autonomous community only so the validations have been performed over an area equal to the 71 of the total in addition an analysis of the sensitivity of the classification accuracy to the aggregation threshold of the original ground truth data has been performed and it is provided in the appendix a 3 6 data preparation 3 6 1 remote sensing data all the remote sensing soil moisture data sets used have been resampled to the 1 km grid used for the surfex isba simulations this process allowed to obtain spatially coherent data to carry out the analyses described in this study 3 6 2 ground truth data the ground truth data set has been pre processed for the first of the two validations a map of irrigated crops dryland and forest or natural areas has been produced on the basis of sigpac data the original data has a plot scale resolution so as a first step the information has been projected on a 100 m resolution regular grid over the study area thus producing a map with irrigated pixels and dryland pixels where the information about the irrigation coefficient in ground truth data set provides irrigation and non irrigation respectively elsewhere where the ground truth data set has no data the pixel has been classified as forest or natural area actually this procedure is not expected to introduce large errors because the crops maps are produced starting by land use maps provided by sigpac and masking exactly this kind of surfaces with the addition of urban areas that we mask together with water bodies before the validation the resulting maps at 100 m resolution have then been resampled to the 1 km grid used to run surfex isba simulations by assigning to each pixel of 1 km 1 km the predominant class among those of the 100 m 100 m pixels contained in it only in the case of distinguishing between dryland and forest or natural area an additional condition has been added a 1 km 1 km pixel in order to be classified as forest or natural must contain 100 m 100 m pixels with the forest or natural class as dominant one and the pixels with this attribute must be at least the double of those non irrigated this condition is necessary to classify in a homogeneous class complex landscapes like the one in the south of the urgell area where it is difficult to clearly distinguish between the forest the shrubs areas and olive trees that are highly mixed the sigpac classification between irrigated non irrigated refers to the capability of the field to be reached by the irrigation network but does not necessarily imply that the field is actually irrigated it may happen for instance that the field irrigation infrastructure is not installed for this reason a second validation has been carried out by exploiting the information about the type of cultivation among the irrigated plots those with crops that for sure are irrigated in the period may september have been selected they are summer cereals forage and fruit trees pixels with this information have been classified as irrigated while pixels with information linked to other crops e g cereals or olive groves have been classified as dryland the remaining pixels have been considered as forest or natural areas the final product used for the validation is at 1 km resolution and it is obtained with the same procedure previously described 4 results henceforth we call the downscaled products smos at 1 km and smap at 1 km while the others sentinel 1 smap and ascat although the study covers the whole period 2016 2017 many results are focused on a time span of four months from may 1st to september 1st of the two considered years when the irrigation practices reach the maximum intensities in subsection 4 1 the analysis performed on the basis of the temporal stability derived indices is presented while subsection 4 2 presents the results of the classification performed through the k means clustering 4 1 indices derived from the temporal stability theory 4 1 1 spatial relative differences the most immediate temporal stability derived index to test the capability of a soil moisture product to detect the irrigated areas is the spatial relative difference it quantifies how much the soil moisture in a site during a certain day differs from the spatial mean for the same day hence a soil moisture product able to detect irrigation should provide higher values of relative differences over the irrigated areas which are human induced to be wet during the dry season the peculiarity of the study area where the irrigation districts are surrounded by dryland during summer is expected to emphasize this behaviour in fig 2 the panels a 1 b 1 and c 1 show the time series of the areal mean relative differences calculated for the urgell area for the catalan and aragonese area and for the dryland respectively for each product the same colour has been kept for time series referred to the three areas the panels a 2 and b 2 show the time series of the water flowing through the irrigation canals network and feeding the urgell and the catalan and aragonese area respectively the records of the flow data supplying the urgell are taken from the stations c116 cabecera urgell and c117 auxiliar de cabecera urgell while for the catalan and aragonese area the stations of interest are c081 el ciego and c101 coll de foix the data about the irrigation systems flow is delivered by the automatic hydrologic information system of the ebro river basin saih ebro at the website http www saihebro com saihebro index php url datos canales during the period going from july 2016 to the end of february 2017 the data about irrigation water supplying the urgell are missing the capability of a satellite product in containing information about irrigation in terms of the relative difference is evaluated by looking at which data set shows higher values of this index inside the irrigated areas concurrently with lower values in the dryland during the periods may september 2016 and 2017 in the urgell smap at 1 km results the best performing high resolution product with a mean relative difference equal to 0 274 during may september 2016 and equal to 0 266 during may september 2017 while in the dryland the corresponding values for the same periods are equal to 0 078 and to 0 088 smos at 1 km performs well only for a part of the focus period in 2016 while sentinel 1 does not show clear irrigation signals among the coarser resolution products in the urgell ascat performs better than smap showing values of the mean relative difference equal to 0 121 and to 0 111 for may september 2016 and 2017 respectively the corresponding values for the same periods but referred to the dryland are equal to 0 045 and to 0 023 over the catalan and aragonese area smos at 1 km is the best performing high resolution product with values of the mean relative difference equal to 0 286 and to 0 481 for the periods may september 2016 and 2017 respectively the values of the same indices and referred to the same periods but calculated over the dryland result equal to 0 100 and 0 112 smap at 1 km also shows good performances comparable to those from smos at 1 km while sentinel 1 still does not show a clearly interpretable irrigation signal the coarser resolution products do not show good performances in the catalan and aragonese domain it is noteworthy that during summer 2016 and 2017 the time series of the relative differences derived from surfex isba modeled soil moisture which does not take into account of irrigation show slightly lower values than the areal mean relative differences for both the irrigation districts while outside the irrigated areas the trend is temporally constant this behaviour can be likely attributed to the vegetation and soil map implemented in the model which regulate the spatial distribution of soil moisture as explained in subsection 3 2 in the adopted version of isba the lai cycle and thus the cycle of the vegetation is the same every year because its evolution is determined by the climatology the maps of the spatial relative differences averaged during the periods may september 2016 and 2017 are shown in fig 3 because of the extension of the pilot area only the maps referred to the high resolution products are shown the maps obtained from the coarser resolution products can be found in the appendix b the spatial distribution of the considered index during the focus period is an essential information if the aim is to spot where irrigation actually occurs in fact by considering the mean value inside the two pilot irrigation areas only could be misleading because it is not always true that all the irrigable land is actually irrigated the maps derived from the surfex isba modeled soil moisture can be considered as a reference for a situation not taking into account of irrigation in the lsm the spatial distribution of surface soil moisture responds to precipitation events and it is mainly governed by soil texture and vegetation cover for the focus period in 2016 the mean relative difference calculated for the downscaled products reproduces well the contrast between the irrigation districts and the dryland at east of the urgell during the focus period in 2017 smap at 1 km provides positive values of the relative differences within both the irrigation areas while smos at 1 km shows bad performances for the urgell the relative differences retrieved from sentinel 1 soil moisture reproduce well only the upper part of the dryland at east of the irrigated area where rainfed croplands are located negative relative differences are obtained for the urgell while positive relative differences can be detected in the central part of the catalan and aragonese domain 4 1 2 temporal anomalies the second index used in this study to evaluate the capability of several microwave soil moisture products to detect irrigation is the temporal anomaly which quantifies how much the soil moisture in a certain observation day differs from the temporal mean calculated in this case for the whole study period fig 4 shows the time series of the 7 days moving average referred to the mean value of the temporal anomalies calculated for the urgell area for the catalan and aragonese area and for the dryland for each product the same colour has been kept for time series referred to the three areas the analysis in terms of temporal anomalies allows looking at the temporal dynamics of soil moisture thus not considering the influence of static patterns e g soil texture that may affect soil moisture observations good performances in detecting irrigation are represented by higher anomalies within the districts than over the surrounding area during the irrigation period the downscaled products show mean values of the temporal anomalies for the irrigable areas higher than those calculated for the dryland during both focus periods except for smos at 1 km in the urgell domain during the period may september 2017 sentinel 1 shows positive temporal anomalies over the irrigable land but this behaviour is probably not attributable to the irrigation as similar patterns can be observed over the dryland as well hence the different wetness conditions coexisting in the pilot area are not detected finally the time series of the temporal anomalies derived from the coarser resolution soil moisture products adopted in this study over the irrigation districts do not show clear discrepancies with respect to the time series referred to the dryland as stated before to make evaluations only by looking at the areal mean value can lead to missing information about the actual spatial occurrence of irrigation so maps of the temporal anomalies averaged for the periods may september 2016 and 2017 are provided fig 5 in this section only the maps for the high resolution data sets are shown the maps referred to the coarser resolution products can be found in the appendix b for the downscaled products the anomalies within the irrigable area are higher than over the surrounding dryland and are often greater than or equal to zero how expected furthermore during both the focus periods a homogeneous pattern of positive temporal anomalies over the urgell domain can be observed except for smos at 1 km in the period may september 2017 during the focus period in 2016 the anomalies obtained by smos and smap at 1 km rarely are higher than zero over the catalan and aragonese area while in the focus period in 2017 positive values can be observed however over this area the anomalies are higher than over the dryland the sentinel 1 retrieved soil moisture product shows an unexpected behaviour without differences between the spatial anomalies distributions inside and outside the irrigable areas corroborating previously described results finally the maps obtained from the modeled soil moisture data set still show a uniform dry situation which is expected during summer from a modeled data set does not taking into account of irrigation 4 2 classification based on the k means algorithm on the basis of the previously described results the analysis has been refined the best performing products smos and smap at 1 km have been exploited to map the irrigated areas through the k means clustering algorithm three clusters representing the three classes of natural surfaces detectable in the study area have been considered the actually irrigated area the dryland and the forest or natural areas the clustering has been performed by merging information from satellite retrieved and modeled soil moisture it does not require training processes and is based on the statistic and temporal stability derived features that are expected to show a clear behaviour over the irrigated areas during the focus periods the input parameters of the clustering are the mean temporal anomaly a x the mean relative difference δ x the standard deviation of relative differences σ δ x and the correlation with the model r x further details on the correlation analysis can be found in appendix c the first two parameters are expected to assume higher values over the irrigated areas while the latter two are expected to show lower values over the same domain all the parameters have been calculated for both the focus periods considered in this study the information from the modeling has been involved in the clustering in order to evaluate whether it can bring benefits with respect to considering remotely sensed data only for the mapping of irrigation table 1 describes the eight combinations of input parameters used to generate an equal number of maps for each focus period may september 2016 and 2017 for a total of sixteen maps it is noteworthy that the performed classifications can be grouped into two main categories one exploiting satellite soil moisture only clustering with two input parameters and three clusters and the other merging information from modeled and remotely sensed soil moisture clustering with three input parameters and three clusters the resulting maps have been validated in two different configurations and results are shown in the next sections 4 2 1 first validation procedure in the first validation the maps have been compared with those obtained from the ground truth data set by exploiting the information about the irrigation coefficient sigpac derived maps of dryland d corresponding to non irrigated fields irrigated areas i corresponding to irrigated fields and forest or natural areas f corresponding to the remaining areas have been compared with the clustering classification maps before the validation the data outside the spatial availability of the ground truth data set catalonia have been masked out as well as the urban areas and the inland water bodies fig 6 shows the confusion matrices resulting from comparisons between the ground truth and the performed classifications each matrix is referred to a specific classification identified by the combination of the input parameters used the ground truth classes are represented on the y axis while on the x axis the classes derived from the clustering process are shown the more a classification reproduces the ground truth the higher values on the diagonal of the matrix and lower values outside can be observed during the period may september 2016 all the performed classifications reproduce well the dryland in fact the percentage of dryland pixels well classified through the k means algorithm ranges between 61 and 83 of the total dryland pixels lower scores are observed for the forest or natural areas and for the irrigated areas which in several experiments are wrongly classified however in the classification identified by the code st a smap16 the percentages of natural and irrigated areas well classified reach the values of 60 and 51 respectively it can also be observed that smap at 1 km provides overall better classification results in fact matrices referred to this product use to show the higher values along the diagonal it is noteworthy that the percentages of non irrigated agricultural pixels confused with those irrigated are always low ranging from 0 to 7 and equal to 0 according to four classifications the same is valid by looking at the confusion between the irrigated and the not irrigated areas ranging between 6 and 26 this result highlights that the method performs well in distinguishing the irrigated areas from those not irrigated during the focus period in 2017 a similar behaviour can be observed also in this case the dryland is well reproduced with percentages ranging between 68 and 83 confusion between forest and irrigated areas still persist even if with the classification st a smap17 the 65 of the ground truth irrigated pixels are well classified by the proposed method and in the experiment d a smos17 the 58 of the forest or natural pixels obtained by the sigpac data are well reproduced by the clustering the overall better performances of classifications based on data from smap at 1 km are confirmed as well as the capability of the method to separate the irrigated areas from those not irrigated the percentage of the pixels belonging to the dryland class that are misinterpreted as irrigated from the clustering ranges between 1 and 5 while the percentage referred to irrigated pixels confused with those not irrigated ranges between 6 and 28 4 2 2 second validation procedure a second validation of the clustering derived maps has been performed by exploiting another kind of information from the ground truth data set instead of the information regarding the irrigation coefficient the one linked to the kind of crops has been used this alternative validation which is specific for summer crops is driven by the consideration that it may happen that a certain plot has the irrigation attribute associated to it because it is capable to reach the irrigation network but this does not imply that has been actually irrigated during the reference period for which the clustering maps have been produced that is may september from the perspective of this alternative proposed validation sigpac derived maps of selected summer crops summer cereals forage and fruit trees other crops and remaining areas have been interpreted as irrigated areas i dryland d and forest or natural areas f respectively these maps have been used to perform an alternative validation of the k means clustering derived maps whose resulting confusion matrices are shown in fig 7 the results of this second validation show for both the focus periods a systematic enhancement of the representation of the forest and of the actually irrigated areas associated with a slight worsening of the detection of the not irrigated areas however the percentage of dryland pixels recognized varies between 54 and 78 for the focus period in 2016 and between 60 and 78 for the focus period in 2017 the highest percentage of pixels belonging to the forest or natural areas class well detected is equal to 62 in 2016 and to 59 in 2017 both results are referred to the same experiment configuration d a smos16 for 2016 and d a smos17 for 2017 the best performances in detecting the irrigated crops during the focus periods are obtained for the experiments st a smap16 in 2016 percentage of recognized pixels 65 and st a smap17 percentage of recognized pixels 78 also this second validation highlights overall better performances when using data retrieved from smap at 1 km another common aspect between the two proposed validations is the almost total absence of confusion between irrigated and agricultural non irrigated areas the percentage of dryland pixels confused with irrigated pixels ranges between 1 and 9 during the focus period in 2016 and between 2 and 9 during the same period in 2017 irrigated pixels confused with dryland ones are between 2 and 14 of the total during may september 2016 and between 1 and 18 during may september 2017 finally not negligible rates of irrigated pixels wrongly classified as natural pixels still persist 4 2 3 best performing classifications according to both the validation procedures presented in this study the best performing classifications result to be the same and are shown in fig 8 for each year two classifications have been chosen the one that overall best reproduces the irrigated areas represented by the combination st a smap16 for 2016 and st a smap17 for 2017 and the one that shows the best performances by considering all the three classes concurrently represented by d a c smap16 for 2016 and d a c smap17 for 2017 the classes are identified by different colors blue for the actually irrigated areas green for the forest or natural areas and brown for the dryland together with the classification derived maps the ground truth maps are also represented the cities and the inland water areas have been masked out while the irrigation canals network is represented in magenta it is noteworthy that the sigpac crops maps are available for catalonia only east of the red border so it has not been possible to quantitative validate the k means clustering derived maps for the portion of the study area falling into aragon the overall capability of the method to reproduce the ground truth conditions can be immediately observed even if the proposed maps show some disturbances due to a system of reservoirs in the north of the study area and to evergreen forests in the south east 5 discussion this study investigates the capability of five remotely sensed soil moisture products to detect the irrigation signal over an intensely irrigated area located in the north east of spain in addition a method to classify and map irrigated areas is proposed the evaluation of the performances of the satellite products in detecting the irrigated areas has been addressed by looking at the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture through normalized indices derived from the temporal stability theory according to all the performed analyses the enhanced resolution l band passive microwave based products result to be the most skilful ones in detecting irrigation over the study area analyses based on the relative differences revealing the spatial dynamics of soil moisture indicate smap at 1 km as the data set showing the clearest irrigation signal over the urgell area while smos at 1 km results the best performing product over the catalan and aragonese area according to the same metric analyses based on the temporal anomalies which allow to investigate the temporal dynamics of soil moisture reveal a clear pattern of positive anomalies over the urgell area during the focus period in 2016 for both smos and smap at 1 km this area is where flood irrigation is the most widespread technique during may september 2017 the results obtained for the downscaled products over the urgell area are not comparable because of a rfi source detected in this area since the end of 2016 onwards see appendix d however over the catalan and aragonese area the products show a similar behaviour sentinel 1 is unable to reproduce well the spatial distribution of the different wetness conditions coexisting in the study area moreover the analysis in terms of temporal anomalies reveals unexpected uniform wetness conditions during the dry season the unsatisfactory performances obtained with sentinel 1 can be explained by the higher sensitivity to vegetation and surface roughness characterizing the c band active sensors with respect to the l band passive sensors in addition the non implementation of a correction for seasonal vegetation effects in the retrieval algorithm bauer marschallinger et al 2018 can represent a complementary reason for the poor performances of sentinel 1 over the pilot area the coarser resolution products adopted in this study ascat and smap do not show promising results in detecting irrigation over the pilot area this issue can be attributed to the scale of the irrigated land and to the complexity of the surrounding landscape with respect to the resolution of the products too coarse to capture the differences existing at the considered scale both products in fact proved to be capable to detect irrigation signal over different wide irrigated areas in the continental united states kumar et al 2015 lawston et al 2017 the downscaling through optical data from modis represents an enhancement making the dispatch downscaled products suitable for obtaining reliable spatial information about irrigated areas where high resolution is needed the potential of smos at 1 km in detecting irrigation occurring over the pilot area was already shown in escorihuela and quintana seguí 2016 nevertheless in that study the authors compared remote sensing and modeled soil moisture over different land covers finding inconsistencies over irrigated areas attributed to the irrigation occurrence in this work an analysis involving three high resolution products and specifically focused on the irrigation detection by using diagnostic indices derived from the temporal stability theory is presented in addition a method to map irrigated areas based on a k means clustering classification and exploiting the downscaled data sets is proposed despite many existing classification methods require training processes and rules based on decision tree structures thenkabail et al 2007 ozdogan and gutman 2008 jin et al 2016 teluguntla et al 2017 the method proposed in this study does not require any training in fact it is based on indices obtained from remotely sensed soil moisture that are expected to assume a clear and distinct behaviour over irrigated areas and over the other kinds of surfaces from both the validation procedures carried out it appears clear how the method is able to separate irrigated areas from not irrigated agricultural areas thus representing a useful tool to retrieve the actually irrigated portion of areas that are known to be equipped for irrigation by looking at the best resulting classification maps shown in fig 8 and at their related confusion matrices in figs 6 and 7 recurring confusion between forest or natural areas and irrigated areas can be observed the percentages of forest or natural pixels confused with those irrigated can be mainly attributed to the system of reservoirs located in the north of the study area and feeding the irrigation canals network which alter the soil wetness conditions retrieved from the satellite products conversely the percentages of irrigated pixels confused with forest or natural areas can be mainly attributed to the difficulty of the method to correctly distinguish between areas where fruit trees are cultivated and highly mixed areas like the upper part of the urgell where isolated corn crops abandoned fields and fruit trees fields coexist however the fact that the proposed method interprets this kind of areas as natural land is important and valuable difficulties in the correct classification of fruit trees areas were also found in gao et al 2018 fruit trees are usually drip irrigated a very localized irrigation method that is difficult to detect using remote sensing soil moisture data consequently over this kind of areas the soil moisture might assume lower values than over areas destined to other irrigated crops thus leading to a wrong classification during the clustering the above discussed best performing classifications are obtained by exploiting smap at 1 km data set which performs better than smos at 1 km in the clustering the higher accuracy of coarse resolution smap data with respect to coarse resolution smos data is supported by several validation studies e g chen et al 2018 however the dispatch downscaled versions of smos and smap at 1 km are both skilful in detecting irrigation over the study area but the smos derived clustering experiments are influenced by the rfi problems described in appendix d finally it is noteworthy that the adoption of less restrictive thresholds when aggregating the ground truth data to a coarser resolution can lead to an improvement of the performances of the already well performing combinations conversely this gain is not observed for already bad performing combinations see appendix a 6 conclusions on the basis of the above discussed results the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the spatial scale of the irrigation processes and the complexity of the study area make necessary the adoption of high resolution 1 km or less soil moisture products to detect the irrigation signal 2 indices derived from the temporal stability theory represent useful tools to investigate both spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture and to evaluate the capability of remotely sensed soil moisture to detect irrigated areas 3 smos and smap at 1 km dispatch downscaled proved to be the most suitable products to detect irrigation over the pilot area 4 the proposed irrigation mapping method performs well in separating irrigated areas from agricultural rainfed areas the percentages of ground truth dryland pixels confused with irrigated pixels range between 0 and 9 the irrigated pixels wrongly classified as dryland range between 1 an 28 but percentages higher than 20 can be observed for the first validation method proposed only 5 for both the focus periods the best resulting classification are the same and the best performing product is smap at 1 km the combinations st a smap16 and st a smap17 are those that overall best represent irrigated areas it is noteworthy that these combinations exploit remotely sensed data only meaning that the model does not add information for mapping irrigation this is comforting if we consider the scarcity of models running at 1 km over large regions 6 the experiments identified by the combinations d a c smap16 and d a c smap17 are those that overall best represent the three considered classes concurrently and merge information from satellite and modeled soil moisture the capability of the l band passive microwave downscaled products to detect irrigation and the correct distinction between areas where irrigation actually occurs and agricultural rainfed areas achieved by the proposed method constitute a solid basis for studies aimed to quantify the amounts of irrigation water in addition the assessment of the potential in producing maps of irrigated areas at a very high spatial resolution through the proposed methodology with plot scale resolution soil moisture data e g from sentinel 1 as input is among the future perspectives of this study credit authorship contribution statement jacopo dari conceptualization

contract n 4000129870 20 i nb the authors wish to thank the sigpac team for providing the ground truth data used in this study appendix a sensitivity of the classification to the aggregation threshold it is well known that the aggregation to coarser resolutions produces a loss of information in order to test the sensitivity of the performed classifications to this issue two data sets containing binary information linked to the ground truth data used to perform the validations described in the section 3 6 2 have been derived the two data sets contain only the irrigated crops and only the summer crops respectively inside the irrigated areas the procedure to obtain these products at 1 km consists in projecting the data on a 100 m resolution regular grid as a first step and then in aggregating it to the 1 km grid by assigning to the 1 km 1 km pixel the class irrigated or summer crops if the pixels at 100 m 100 m contained in it are more than the 30 40 50 and 60 of the total this aggregation technique allows to obtain sixteen additional ground truth data set eight for 2016 and eight for 2017 with information about the irrigated pixels only and the selected summer crops only obtained by considering four different aggregation thresholds 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 the results of the assessment of the sensitivity to the aggregation threshold when aggregating the benchmark ground truth data to the coarser 1 km resolution are shown in fig a 1 for both the validation procedures adopted in this study it can be observed that for the well performing classifications the percentage of pixels with the irrigation or summer crops information that are well represented by the proposed method increases when the aggregation threshold increases even reaching the 90 when a threshold of 0 6 is considered conversely changes in the considered aggregation threshold do not enhance the worst performing classifications this is a simplified experiment in which the distinction is made only between two and not three classes but it gives an idea of the partial loss of information occurring when the ground truth data is aggregated to the remote sensing products resolution and it confirms the capability of the method to well interpret homogeneous irrigation pattern appendix b maps of temporal stability derived indices for the coarser resolution products for complete information the maps of the temporal stability indices calculated for the coarser resolution products used in this study are shown fig b 1 shows the maps of the spatial relative differences calculated for the coarser resolution products smap and ascat and averaged during both focus periods considered in this study fig b 2 shows the maps of the temporal anomalies obtained from the same products and averaged during the same periods appendix c correlation analysis the correlation between the time series of remotely sensed and modeled soil moisture is a statistical feature that can be used to evaluate the detectability of irrigation over the pilot area escorihuela and quintana seguí 2016 to this aim the correlation between remotely sensed soil moisture data sets smos and smap at 1 km and the modeled one during the irrigation seasons in 2016 and 2017 has been investigated fig c 1 shows the spatial distribution of the pearson correlation coefficient r x calculated for the dispatch downscaled soil moisture products against surfex isba soil moisture the modeled soil moisture does not take irrigation into account so by assuming that precipitation is correct low scarce correlation or negative inverse correlation r x values within an irrigated area can be an indicator of the remotely sensed product capability to contain the irrigation information the downscaled products show similar behaviours in the period may september 2016 both smos and smap at 1 km show a clear pattern of low correlation in the upper and central zones of the irrigation areas outside the irrigable lands the correlation rises during may september 2017 the irrigation related pattern is less clear but over the irrigable land correlation lower than over the dryland especially over the rainfed cropland in the upper part can still be observed appendix d rfi problems affecting smos data in 2017 during the period may september 2017 smos at 1 km shows an anomalous behaviour over the urgell especially if compared with the performances over the same area in 2016 and over the catalan and aragonese area during both focus period which are generally in agreement with those shown by the other downscaled product smap at 1 km this issue is due to a source of rfi detected over the urgell area and not correctly solved by the post processing through the rfi filter fig d 1 shows the probability of rfi occurrence in the urgell area in the second part of the 2016 the rfi probability begins rising reaching values close to 0 7 in 2017 as a result the dielectric constant of the soil and thus the soil wetness conditions are underestimated this problem does not affect the other downscaled product considered in this study smap at 1 km the smap radar and radiometer electronics and algorithms are more recent than the smos mission and have been designed to include on board filters to mitigate rfi effects entekhabi et al 2010 
4720,although irrigation practices affect food production and water resource management with ever more impacting effects under climate change and population increasing scenarios detailed knowledge of irrigation is still lacking in fact explicit information on the spatial occurrence of irrigation and on the amounts of water used for this purpose is often not available thus making irrigation the missing variable to comprehensively understand the hydrological cycle dynamics over agricultural areas nevertheless remote sensing techniques can be used to delimit the irrigation extent in this study the capability of five remotely sensed soil moisture products to detect the irrigation signal over an area intensely equipped for irrigation in the north east of spain is investigated moreover a method to map the actually irrigated areas based on the k means clustering algorithm is proposed the remote sensing soil moisture data sets used in this study are smos soil moisture and ocean salinity at 1 km smap soil moisture active passive at 1 km and 9 km sentinel 1 at 1 km and ascat advanced scatterometer at 12 5 km the 1 km resolution versions of smos and smap are obtained by downscaling coarser smos and smap data through the dispatch disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change algorithm the analyses are supported by an additional data set of soil moisture at 1 km resolution simulated by the surfex isba surface externalisée interaction sol biosphère atmosphère land surface model among all the considered data sets the l band passive microwave downscaled products show the best performances in detecting the irrigation signal over the pilot area especially smap at 1 km the proposed maps of irrigated areas derived by exploiting soil moisture from smap at 1 km data set agree well up to 78 with the ground truth derived irrigated areas furthermore the method is able to well distinguish the actually irrigated areas from rainfed agricultural areas thus representing a useful tool to obtain reliable spatial information about the areas where irrigation actually occurs keywords irrigation remote sensing soil moisture land surface modeling 1 introduction human induced changes on the hydrological cycle nowadays rival the geophysical processes with short term impacts that can be stricter than the effects of climate changes irrigation is the anthropogenic activity that introduces the largest imbalances in the natural hydrological cycle at different spatial scales wada et al 2014 alter et al 2015 in the past decades the irrigation practices allowed to double the agricultural production despite an increase of cropland by only 12 rosegrant et al 2002 gleick 2003 it is estimated that over 70 of global freshwater withdrawals are destined to irrigation practices foley et al 2011 with the major rates of water consumption attributable to northern america europe northern india and eastern china zhou et al 2016 the ever growing global population and consequent increases of food requirements combined with rising global mean temperatures are expected to further stress the freshwater availability for irrigation purposes especially over areas already facing water scarcity vörösmarty et al 2000 rockström et al 2012 kummu et al 2016 it appears clear that under this scenario a rational management of irrigation practices is required methods to retrieve information about irrigation water volumes romaguera et al 2014 brocca et al 2018 jalilvand et al 2019 dari et al 2020 filippucci et al 2020 and the detailed knowledge of the irrigation extent kumar et al 2015 ambika and mishra 2016 gao et al 2018 zaussinger et al 2019 are challenging targets for the development of sustainable agricultural practices and for the water resource management in the upcoming decades the rise of remote sensing has led to new perspectives in monitoring irrigated lands this technology has proven to be a promising tool for mapping the exact locations and spatial extensions of irrigated areas thus enhancing approximate statistical information within arbitrary political edges ozdogan et al 2010 several studies have investigated the detectability of irrigation signals by using optical data only ozdogan and gutman 2008 peña arancibia et al 2014 ambika and mishra 2016 optical data supported by land surface modeling romaguera et al 2014 hain et al 2015 microwave data only lawston et al 2017 gao et al 2018 and microwave data supported by land surface modeling kumar et al 2015 escorihuela and quintana seguí 2016 the first study exploiting microwave sensors to detect irrigated areas was carried out by kumar et al 2015 who investigated the capability of several remotely sensed soil moisture products to detect irrigation over the conus contiguous united states area the data sets used were ascat advanced scatterometer amsr e advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system esa cci sm european space agency climate change initiative soil moisture smos soil moisture and ocean salinity and windsat the detection of irrigated areas was supported by comparisons with modeled soil moisture obtained by the noah land surface model which does not take into account of irrigation hence positive biases between satellite and modeled soil moisture data were interpreted as a signal of irrigation only ascat showed some potential in detecting irrigation over wide irrigated areas in the plains of nebraska over the same area zaussinger et al 2019 found scarce correlation between ascat retrieved and merra 2 modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications 2 reanalysis soil moisture in absence of precipitation however a similar pattern was also found over rainfed agricultural areas escorihuela and quintana seguí 2016 compared four soil moisture products ascat amsr e smos and a version of smos at 1 km obtained by downscaling the original product through the disaggregation based on physical and theorical scale change dispatch algorithm with soil moisture simulated by the surfex isba surface externalisée interaction sol biosphère atmosphère land surface model over the northeast of the iberian peninsula the results pointed out the potential of the high resolution version of smos to detect the irrigation signal in terms of low correlation with modeled soil moisture over an intensely irrigated area the urgell in the catalonia autonomous community over areas with a similar flat topography but not irrigated higher correlations were obtained lawston et al 2017 showed the capability of the enhanced 9 km version of smap soil moisture active passive to detect the irrigation signal over three semiarid regions in the western united states very recently gao et al 2018 exploited sentinel 1 sar synthetic aperture radar time series to map irrigated fields over an agricultural site in the urgell catalonia spain however studies exploiting remote sensing soil moisture to map irrigation over areas where high resolution products are needed are still lacking in fact irrigation is practiced worldwide at different spatial scales depending on several factors e g the topography or climate this work is aimed at showing the capability of high resolution products in detecting irrigation occurring at a spatial scale compatible with the mediterranean environment as a first objective of this study the capability of five remotely sensed soil moisture products to detect irrigation during the biennium 2016 2017 over an intensely irrigated area located in spain is evaluated three of the considered data sets are high resolution 1 km products smos at 1 km smap at 1 km and sentinel 1 the first two products are downscaled versions of coarser resolution smos and smap data obtained through the dispatch algorithm merlin et al 2013 the other two products used in this study have a coarser resolution and are the enhanced version of smap 9 km sampling and ascat 12 5 km sampling the choice of the data sets is related to the extent of the pilot area and it is mainly oriented on high resolution 1 km products however the two coarser resolution data sets have been included in order to perform a comprehensive analysis involving medium to high resolution products obtained through different operational bands an additional data set of modeled soil moisture at 1 km obtained by forcing the surfex isba land surface model with atmospheric data from era 5 reanalysis resampled at the same resolution is used as a support for the analyses as a secondary objective a method to map the actually irrigated areas based on the k means clustering algorithm and exploiting the best performing products over the study area is proposed 2 study area the study area is located in the north eastern part of spain within the ebro river basin and has an extension of about 125 km 80 km a part of it falls in catalonia while the other part is inside aragon this tile encloses an irrigated land surrounding the city of lleida an overview of the study area is given in fig 1 which shows where the area is located the map of the area equipped for irrigation and the land cover map the area equipped for irrigation is derived from the global map of irrigated areas gmia version 5 0 produced by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao siebert et al 2013 the data is expressed as the percentage of each cell area that is equipped for irrigation and has a spatial resolution of 5 arc minutes about 10 km at the equator the land cover map is derived from the corine land cover clc provided by the copernicus land monitoring service the map has a 100 m resolution and it is referred to the year 2018 according to the structure of the irrigation canals network it is possible to distinguish two different irrigated portions within the pilot area the first one henceforth urgell area mainly supplied by the urgell and the algerri balaguer canals in the east side and the second one henceforth catalan and aragonese area mainly supplied by the catalan and aragonese canal in the west side within the urgell area different irrigation systems coexist in the old irrigation district the most used system is inundation while in algerri balaguer drip irrigation is typically used for fruit trees and sprinkler irrigation is used for crops the irrigation systems in the area supplied by the catalan and aragonese canal are flood irrigation 18 of the area sprinkler irrigation 54 and drip irrigation 28 these differences in the adopted irrigation methods contribute in making the irrigated fields more scattered within this area several pivot infrastructures can be observed the timing of the irrigation practices depends on several factors e g the crop type but they are mainly concentrated during the summer period from may to september the frequency depends on the irrigation technique for example within the urgell in the old system inundation irrigation occurs typically every two weeks while in modern irrigated areas irrigation can occur every day in both areas summer cereals and forage are present fruit trees are spread in the south of both irrigated lands in the east of urgell and along the river channel that divides the two areas in the catalan and aragonese domain there is an area destined to vineyard towards the east of urgell there is a wide area of rainfed cropland which is connected to the south to olive groves through a mixed zone of sparse shrubs this entire portion is generally dry during summer thus creating an extended dryland that is in contrast with the irrigated areas which appear lush especially in the dry season the two strongly different wetness conditions coexisting in the area of interest contribute in making it an optimal site to test the capability of remote sensing data to spot where irrigation practices occur 3 materials and methods 3 1 remote sensing data in this study five soil moisture products have been considered smos at 1 km smap at 1 km and 9 km sentinel 1 at 1 km and ascat at 12 5 km the first two products are obtained by downscaling coarser smos and smap data through the dispatch algorithm 3 1 1 smos the smos mission was launched by the european space agency esa in november 2009 kerr et al 2001 2010 to collect global measurements of soil moisture over the continents and of salinity over the oceans it is the second esa s earth explorer opportunity mission which is jointed with the centre national d estudes spatiales cnes and the centro para el desarrollo tecnológico industrial cdti the revisit period of smos is 3 days at the equator which is crossed at 06 00 and 18 00 local solar time lst during the ascending and descending orbits respectively the smos satellite carries an y shaped passive 2d interferometric radiometer working at l band frequency 1 4 ghz and is capable to collect multiangular observations of the brightness temperature thus retrieving surface soil moisture and other parameters the original smos soil moisture data has a spatial resolution ranging between 35 and 50 km and is obtained through the level 2 l2 retrieval algorithm which exploits additional static soil texture topography index land use and dynamic rain temperature frost and thaw cycle data sets kerr et al 2012 in this study a high resolution 1 km dispatch downscaled version merlin et al 2008 is used the dispatch method allows to downscale smos surface soil moisture from low resolution about 40 km to high resolution 1 km by using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the land surface temperature data both at 1 km resolution detected by modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensor aboard terra eos am and aqua eos pm satellites the disaggregation of coarser soil moisture data is performed by separating the evaporation from the surface soil layer 0 5 cm and the transpiration from the root zone due to the vegetation hence the soil evaporative efficiency see defined as the ratio of actual to potential evaporation can be estimated over the bare soil the spatial link between the optical derived see and the near surface soil moisture allows to distribute the high resolution soil moisture around the mean value of the low resolution product merlin et al 2012 providing outputs with the same temporal resolution of the coarser resolution input data the dispatch method does not require in situ observations to disaggregate coarse resolution data but its applicability is limited to cloudless conditions peng et al 2017 however when there are clouds the algorithm attributes the low resolution soil moisture value to the high resolution pixel merlin et al 2013 compared smos soil moisture at 40 km and two dispatch disaggregated versions at 3 km and 100 m with in situ measurements aggregated at the same spatial scales over pilot sites in catalonia and observed enhancements of the spatio temporal correlation when considering the downscaled products in fact a value of correlation equal to 0 59 was found for the 40 km resolution product while correlation values were 0 67 for the 3 km version and 0 73 and 0 86 for two different configurations of the 100 m resolution product a similar study was carried out by malbéteau et al 2015 which evaluated the performances of coarse and dispatch downscaled 1 km versions of smos and amsr e soil moisture products against in situ observations over the south east of australia the study highlighted enhancements in the correlation with ground measurements over a semi arid region obtained during summer for the disaggregated products with respect to their coarser resolution versions correlation values increased from 0 37 to 0 63 and from 0 47 to 0 73 in afternoon overpasses for smos and amsr e respectively and from 0 63 to 0 78 and from to 0 42 to 0 71 in morning overpasses for smos and amsr e respectively molero et al 2016 evaluated the performances of dispatch downscaled smos at 1 km under different climatic conditions obtaining higher correlations with ground observations over semi arid areas where the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture is mainly determined by precipitation and irrigation with respect to sub humid regions 3 1 2 smap the smap mission was launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa at the end of january 2015 with the aim of collecting soil moisture data and to detect the freeze thaw state at global scale entekhabi et al 2010 smap has a revisit period of 2 3 days at the equator which is overpassed at 06 00 lst during the descending orbit and at 18 00 lst during the ascending orbit originally smap was supposed to enhance the resolution of radiometer only retrievals by combining the benefits of active and passive remote sensing through an l band radar 1 26 ghz and an l band radiometer 1 4 ghz thus providing surface soil moisture measurements at three different resolutions 3 km 9 km and 36 km unfortunately the radar stopped working only a few months after the launch so only the 36 km and the enhanced 9 km products have been delivered during the post radar period however a 3 km version obtained by merging with data retrieved by sentinel 1a sentinel 1b has been recently released das et al 2019 the 9 km sampling product whose complete name is smap level 2 enhanced passive soil moisture product l2 sm p e is obtained after the interpolation of the antenna temperature data in the smap original brightness temperature product through the backus gilbert technique poe 1990 stogryn 1978 and several calibration and correction processes chan et al 2018 both smos and smap radiometers operate within the protected earth exploration satellite service passive frequency allocation of 1400 1427 mhz however unauthorized in band transmitters and out of band emissions from transmitters operating at frequencies adjacent to this allocated spectrum cause interference to microwave radiometry in this band thanks to smos it was realised that radio frequency interference rfi was affecting measurements in this protected band and the smap radiometer included a special flight hardware to enable the detection and filtering of rfi in this study we use the 9 km sampling version o neill et al 2016 and a 1 km resolution version derived through the dispatch downscaling algorithm described in the previous section 3 1 3 sentinel 1 the sentinel 1 constellation is the first of the six missions developed by esa for copernicus the european earth observation program and consists of two identical satellites sentinel 1a and sentinel 1b launched in april 2014 and april 2016 respectively the sentinel 1 satellites carry a single sar operating at c band frequency c sar 5 4 ghz which is capable to collect measurements in four different ways the one of interest for soil moisture observations is the interferometric wide swath iw mode the data detected through this technique are the basis of the production of the sentinel 1 surface soil moisture ssm delivered by the copernicus global land service and used in this work since 2016 when both the satellites of the sentinel 1 constellation are operational the coverage over europe is guaranteed with a revisit time ranging between 1 5 and 4 days but it can go down up to 6 days over the rest of the earth the sentinel 1 ssm is retrieved by adapting to high resolution sar data the change detection algorithm wagner et al 1999 hornáček et al 2012 originally developed by the vienna university of technology bauer marschallinger et al 2018 the soil moisture product is delivered with three masks one for water areas one for pixels with low sensitivity and one for excessive terrain slope 3 1 4 ascat the ascat remote sensing instrument on board of the eumetsat meteorological operational satellites metop series is a real aperture active radar operating at c band frequency 5 3 ghz and using vertically polarized antennas the first satellite of metop series metop a was launched in october 2006 metop b was launched later in september 2012 in order to ensure the continuity of observations after the end of metop a operational life the last metop satellite metop c was launched in november 2018 ascat global coverage is obtained every 1 3 days and the equator is overpassed at 21 30 during the ascending pass and at 09 30 during the descending pass originally ascat was designed to monitor wind speed and direction over the oceans and was not supposed to collect soil moisture observation but studies focused on the antecedent version of the instrument escat proved the suitability of ascat in monitoring soil moisture pulliainen et al 1998 wen and su 2003 wagner et al 2007 the ascat soil moisture product is obtained through the change detection algorithm wagner et al 1999 2013 bartalis et al 2007 naeimi et al 2009 developed by the vienna university of technology and is furnished as degree of saturation ranging between 0 and 1 ascat soil moisture has a spatial resolution of 25 km and is provided resampled on a 12 5 km grid in this study the h115 soil moisture product distributed by eumetsat hsaf and available from 2007 to 2018 is used 3 2 surfex modeling platform the modeled soil moisture data set used in this study is obtained from the surfex modeling platform masson et al 2013 developed by météo france surfex allows to calculate the surface fluxes and it consists of independent physical schemes that allow describing four different kind of surfaces natural surfaces urbanized areas inland water and oceans in the study presented here only the isba scheme for natural surfaces has been used isba noilhan and planton 1989 mahfouf and noilhan 1996 noilhan and mahfouf 1996 contains several algorithms to compute the exchanges of energy and water between the surface soil vegetation snow continuum and the atmosphere several versions of the isba scheme have been developed in time boone et al 1999 boone 2000 habets et al 2003 in this study the isba dif version is used where the soil is divided in n layers with n equal to 14 by default and the root zone has a variable extension depending on vegetation simulations have been carried out at 1 km resolution by using the latest version of the model surfex v8 1 obtained from the centre national de recherches météorologiques in general 1d hydrological assumptions adopted in land surface models as the absence of lateral flows in surfex isba are expected to become less valid with the increase of the resolution at which simulations are performed however in the pilot area lateral flows are supposed to be negligible and thus the missing modeling of such processes is expected to be not relevant in fact the study area is dry and rather flat especially over the irrigated land thus lateral flows are of several orders of magnitude lower than vertical flows e g evapotranspiration infiltration drainage in the performed simulation a prescribed vegetation scheme based on the climatology of the leaf area index lai has been adopted hence the vegetation is the same every year this simplified approach has been preferred to a more accurate interactive vegetation scheme available in surfex isba as in this study the modeling part has been involved with the aim of showing the soil moisture distribution in absence of irrigation and the adopted approach is able to represent the first order effects of a lack of irrigation without adding complexity to the modeling it is noteworthy that a new irrigation scheme has been implemented in the next version of surfex to be released druel et al 2019 in this configuration isba is able to simulate sprinkler drip and flood irrigation over irrigated areas experiencing a soil moisture deficit the atmospheric data to force the model are taken from the era 5 reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 released by the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf the era 5 data provided at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 has been downloaded from the copernicus climate data store in order to run surfex isba hourly data of 2 m air temperature and relative humidity precipitation wind speed and downward visible and infrared radiation are needed it is noteworthy that although the input data is at an hourly time step the model s internal step is of higher resolution 15 min before the simulation the input atmospheric variables have been resampled to the finer grid of the model 1 km furthermore a lapse rate correction to temperature and relative humidity has been performed to overcome the vertical mismatch between the coarse resolution relief of era 5 and the high resolution relief gtopo30 adopted in surfex recently albergel et al 2018 showed the benefits of forcing isba simulations with era 5 atmospheric data in terms of the good representation of the surface variables linked to the terrestrial hydrological cycle e g soil moisture the modeled surface soil moisture used in this study is referred to the first 4 cm of soil and is obtained by the weighted average between the first two layers of the soil parametrization whose thicknesses are up to 1 cm and up to 4 cm respectively 3 3 temporal stability the temporal stability theory is a well established method originally introduced by vachaud et al 1985 to identify optimal soil moisture measurement points within a certain area this technique has been widely applied in studies aimed to optimize the soil moisture monitoring see e g brocca et al 2010 gao et al 2015 dari et al 2019 or the raingauge network design morbidelli et al 2019 in this study the key variables of the method are used to calculate indices expressing the dynamics of soil moisture both in space and time let θ xt be the soil moisture observed or modeled at the pixel x of the grid and at the day t assuming that θ t is the spatial mean of soil moisture referred to the whole area and to each day the relative differences δ xt for each pixel and for each day are given by 1 δ xt θ xt θ t θ t for each pixel x the temporal mean δ x and the standard deviation σ δ x can be calculated by 2 δ x 1 t t 1 t δ xt 3 σ δ x 1 t 1 t 1 t δ xt δ x 2 where t is the total number of considered days the relative difference is an index giving information about the spatial variability of soil moisture the perspective proposed by mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 allows to investigate also the temporal dynamics of soil moisture by exploiting the anomalies the temporal anomalies a xt quantify how much the soil moisture at pixel x differs from its temporal mean and can be calculated as follows 4 a xt θ xt θ x θ x where θ x is the temporal mean referred to pixel x a x and a t indicate the temporal and spatial mean of temporal anomalies respectively 3 4 k means clustering k means is one of the most widespread clustering algorithms it allows to group n data points into k clusters on the basis of predefined characteristics each cluster is identified by a centroid determined through an iterative process starting from a first attempt randomly chosen among the input data then the algorithm associates each data point to the nearest centroid thus grouping elements with the same features the association of each element to its cluster is performed by minimizing the euclidean distance d between the input vector and the centroids vector 5 d i 1 k j 1 n x j c i where x j is the j th element of the input vector with j 1 n and c i is the i th centroid with i 1 k more details on the algorithm can be found in macqueen 1967 in this study the k means algorithm is employed to classify on the basis of satellite and modeled soil moisture three kinds of surfaces within the study area the area actually irrigated the dryland and forest or natural areas four sets of features are used to group the data into the three clusters the first set is composed by the standard deviation of the relative differences and the mean temporal anomaly calculated for the satellite soil moisture the second set is composed by the mean relative difference and the mean temporal anomaly derived from the satellite soil moisture in the third and fourth sets respectively the correlation between satellite and modeled soil moisture is added to the previous two parameters for each year all the considered features are referred to the period ranging from may to september when irrigation mainly occurs 3 5 ground truth data the ground truth data set used in this study is the map of crops in catalonia for the years 2016 and 2017 distributed by the department d agricultura ramaderia pesca i alimentació it is an open access map produced in the same domain of the geographic information system for agricultural parcels sigpac available at http agricultura gencat cat ca serveis cartografia sig aplicatius tematics geoinformacio sigpac mapa cultius the map is produced by integrating the agricultural parcels data produced by sigpac with the declaració unica agrària dun document which consists in a yearly mandatory declaration about the agricultural exploitation that each owner of an agricultural productive area must provide in order to optimize the product some corrections are performed before its delivering the non cultivated areas forest urban areas pastures and unproductive areas are masked out the parcels smaller than 50 m2 and those with incomplete dun documents are deleted and some geometry points are simplified however these corrections reduce the originally declared area by less than 1 for each plot the resulting yearly crops maps contain information about the geographic and administrative localization the type of cultivated product the irrigation coefficient and the extension in this study the sigpac crops maps have been used as the ground truth data set to validate the k means retrieved classification maps two kind of validations have been performed the first one exploits the irrigation coefficient information while in the second one the attribute regarding the kind of crop is used unfortunately the ground truth data set is available for catalonia autonomous community only so the validations have been performed over an area equal to the 71 of the total in addition an analysis of the sensitivity of the classification accuracy to the aggregation threshold of the original ground truth data has been performed and it is provided in the appendix a 3 6 data preparation 3 6 1 remote sensing data all the remote sensing soil moisture data sets used have been resampled to the 1 km grid used for the surfex isba simulations this process allowed to obtain spatially coherent data to carry out the analyses described in this study 3 6 2 ground truth data the ground truth data set has been pre processed for the first of the two validations a map of irrigated crops dryland and forest or natural areas has been produced on the basis of sigpac data the original data has a plot scale resolution so as a first step the information has been projected on a 100 m resolution regular grid over the study area thus producing a map with irrigated pixels and dryland pixels where the information about the irrigation coefficient in ground truth data set provides irrigation and non irrigation respectively elsewhere where the ground truth data set has no data the pixel has been classified as forest or natural area actually this procedure is not expected to introduce large errors because the crops maps are produced starting by land use maps provided by sigpac and masking exactly this kind of surfaces with the addition of urban areas that we mask together with water bodies before the validation the resulting maps at 100 m resolution have then been resampled to the 1 km grid used to run surfex isba simulations by assigning to each pixel of 1 km 1 km the predominant class among those of the 100 m 100 m pixels contained in it only in the case of distinguishing between dryland and forest or natural area an additional condition has been added a 1 km 1 km pixel in order to be classified as forest or natural must contain 100 m 100 m pixels with the forest or natural class as dominant one and the pixels with this attribute must be at least the double of those non irrigated this condition is necessary to classify in a homogeneous class complex landscapes like the one in the south of the urgell area where it is difficult to clearly distinguish between the forest the shrubs areas and olive trees that are highly mixed the sigpac classification between irrigated non irrigated refers to the capability of the field to be reached by the irrigation network but does not necessarily imply that the field is actually irrigated it may happen for instance that the field irrigation infrastructure is not installed for this reason a second validation has been carried out by exploiting the information about the type of cultivation among the irrigated plots those with crops that for sure are irrigated in the period may september have been selected they are summer cereals forage and fruit trees pixels with this information have been classified as irrigated while pixels with information linked to other crops e g cereals or olive groves have been classified as dryland the remaining pixels have been considered as forest or natural areas the final product used for the validation is at 1 km resolution and it is obtained with the same procedure previously described 4 results henceforth we call the downscaled products smos at 1 km and smap at 1 km while the others sentinel 1 smap and ascat although the study covers the whole period 2016 2017 many results are focused on a time span of four months from may 1st to september 1st of the two considered years when the irrigation practices reach the maximum intensities in subsection 4 1 the analysis performed on the basis of the temporal stability derived indices is presented while subsection 4 2 presents the results of the classification performed through the k means clustering 4 1 indices derived from the temporal stability theory 4 1 1 spatial relative differences the most immediate temporal stability derived index to test the capability of a soil moisture product to detect the irrigated areas is the spatial relative difference it quantifies how much the soil moisture in a site during a certain day differs from the spatial mean for the same day hence a soil moisture product able to detect irrigation should provide higher values of relative differences over the irrigated areas which are human induced to be wet during the dry season the peculiarity of the study area where the irrigation districts are surrounded by dryland during summer is expected to emphasize this behaviour in fig 2 the panels a 1 b 1 and c 1 show the time series of the areal mean relative differences calculated for the urgell area for the catalan and aragonese area and for the dryland respectively for each product the same colour has been kept for time series referred to the three areas the panels a 2 and b 2 show the time series of the water flowing through the irrigation canals network and feeding the urgell and the catalan and aragonese area respectively the records of the flow data supplying the urgell are taken from the stations c116 cabecera urgell and c117 auxiliar de cabecera urgell while for the catalan and aragonese area the stations of interest are c081 el ciego and c101 coll de foix the data about the irrigation systems flow is delivered by the automatic hydrologic information system of the ebro river basin saih ebro at the website http www saihebro com saihebro index php url datos canales during the period going from july 2016 to the end of february 2017 the data about irrigation water supplying the urgell are missing the capability of a satellite product in containing information about irrigation in terms of the relative difference is evaluated by looking at which data set shows higher values of this index inside the irrigated areas concurrently with lower values in the dryland during the periods may september 2016 and 2017 in the urgell smap at 1 km results the best performing high resolution product with a mean relative difference equal to 0 274 during may september 2016 and equal to 0 266 during may september 2017 while in the dryland the corresponding values for the same periods are equal to 0 078 and to 0 088 smos at 1 km performs well only for a part of the focus period in 2016 while sentinel 1 does not show clear irrigation signals among the coarser resolution products in the urgell ascat performs better than smap showing values of the mean relative difference equal to 0 121 and to 0 111 for may september 2016 and 2017 respectively the corresponding values for the same periods but referred to the dryland are equal to 0 045 and to 0 023 over the catalan and aragonese area smos at 1 km is the best performing high resolution product with values of the mean relative difference equal to 0 286 and to 0 481 for the periods may september 2016 and 2017 respectively the values of the same indices and referred to the same periods but calculated over the dryland result equal to 0 100 and 0 112 smap at 1 km also shows good performances comparable to those from smos at 1 km while sentinel 1 still does not show a clearly interpretable irrigation signal the coarser resolution products do not show good performances in the catalan and aragonese domain it is noteworthy that during summer 2016 and 2017 the time series of the relative differences derived from surfex isba modeled soil moisture which does not take into account of irrigation show slightly lower values than the areal mean relative differences for both the irrigation districts while outside the irrigated areas the trend is temporally constant this behaviour can be likely attributed to the vegetation and soil map implemented in the model which regulate the spatial distribution of soil moisture as explained in subsection 3 2 in the adopted version of isba the lai cycle and thus the cycle of the vegetation is the same every year because its evolution is determined by the climatology the maps of the spatial relative differences averaged during the periods may september 2016 and 2017 are shown in fig 3 because of the extension of the pilot area only the maps referred to the high resolution products are shown the maps obtained from the coarser resolution products can be found in the appendix b the spatial distribution of the considered index during the focus period is an essential information if the aim is to spot where irrigation actually occurs in fact by considering the mean value inside the two pilot irrigation areas only could be misleading because it is not always true that all the irrigable land is actually irrigated the maps derived from the surfex isba modeled soil moisture can be considered as a reference for a situation not taking into account of irrigation in the lsm the spatial distribution of surface soil moisture responds to precipitation events and it is mainly governed by soil texture and vegetation cover for the focus period in 2016 the mean relative difference calculated for the downscaled products reproduces well the contrast between the irrigation districts and the dryland at east of the urgell during the focus period in 2017 smap at 1 km provides positive values of the relative differences within both the irrigation areas while smos at 1 km shows bad performances for the urgell the relative differences retrieved from sentinel 1 soil moisture reproduce well only the upper part of the dryland at east of the irrigated area where rainfed croplands are located negative relative differences are obtained for the urgell while positive relative differences can be detected in the central part of the catalan and aragonese domain 4 1 2 temporal anomalies the second index used in this study to evaluate the capability of several microwave soil moisture products to detect irrigation is the temporal anomaly which quantifies how much the soil moisture in a certain observation day differs from the temporal mean calculated in this case for the whole study period fig 4 shows the time series of the 7 days moving average referred to the mean value of the temporal anomalies calculated for the urgell area for the catalan and aragonese area and for the dryland for each product the same colour has been kept for time series referred to the three areas the analysis in terms of temporal anomalies allows looking at the temporal dynamics of soil moisture thus not considering the influence of static patterns e g soil texture that may affect soil moisture observations good performances in detecting irrigation are represented by higher anomalies within the districts than over the surrounding area during the irrigation period the downscaled products show mean values of the temporal anomalies for the irrigable areas higher than those calculated for the dryland during both focus periods except for smos at 1 km in the urgell domain during the period may september 2017 sentinel 1 shows positive temporal anomalies over the irrigable land but this behaviour is probably not attributable to the irrigation as similar patterns can be observed over the dryland as well hence the different wetness conditions coexisting in the pilot area are not detected finally the time series of the temporal anomalies derived from the coarser resolution soil moisture products adopted in this study over the irrigation districts do not show clear discrepancies with respect to the time series referred to the dryland as stated before to make evaluations only by looking at the areal mean value can lead to missing information about the actual spatial occurrence of irrigation so maps of the temporal anomalies averaged for the periods may september 2016 and 2017 are provided fig 5 in this section only the maps for the high resolution data sets are shown the maps referred to the coarser resolution products can be found in the appendix b for the downscaled products the anomalies within the irrigable area are higher than over the surrounding dryland and are often greater than or equal to zero how expected furthermore during both the focus periods a homogeneous pattern of positive temporal anomalies over the urgell domain can be observed except for smos at 1 km in the period may september 2017 during the focus period in 2016 the anomalies obtained by smos and smap at 1 km rarely are higher than zero over the catalan and aragonese area while in the focus period in 2017 positive values can be observed however over this area the anomalies are higher than over the dryland the sentinel 1 retrieved soil moisture product shows an unexpected behaviour without differences between the spatial anomalies distributions inside and outside the irrigable areas corroborating previously described results finally the maps obtained from the modeled soil moisture data set still show a uniform dry situation which is expected during summer from a modeled data set does not taking into account of irrigation 4 2 classification based on the k means algorithm on the basis of the previously described results the analysis has been refined the best performing products smos and smap at 1 km have been exploited to map the irrigated areas through the k means clustering algorithm three clusters representing the three classes of natural surfaces detectable in the study area have been considered the actually irrigated area the dryland and the forest or natural areas the clustering has been performed by merging information from satellite retrieved and modeled soil moisture it does not require training processes and is based on the statistic and temporal stability derived features that are expected to show a clear behaviour over the irrigated areas during the focus periods the input parameters of the clustering are the mean temporal anomaly a x the mean relative difference δ x the standard deviation of relative differences σ δ x and the correlation with the model r x further details on the correlation analysis can be found in appendix c the first two parameters are expected to assume higher values over the irrigated areas while the latter two are expected to show lower values over the same domain all the parameters have been calculated for both the focus periods considered in this study the information from the modeling has been involved in the clustering in order to evaluate whether it can bring benefits with respect to considering remotely sensed data only for the mapping of irrigation table 1 describes the eight combinations of input parameters used to generate an equal number of maps for each focus period may september 2016 and 2017 for a total of sixteen maps it is noteworthy that the performed classifications can be grouped into two main categories one exploiting satellite soil moisture only clustering with two input parameters and three clusters and the other merging information from modeled and remotely sensed soil moisture clustering with three input parameters and three clusters the resulting maps have been validated in two different configurations and results are shown in the next sections 4 2 1 first validation procedure in the first validation the maps have been compared with those obtained from the ground truth data set by exploiting the information about the irrigation coefficient sigpac derived maps of dryland d corresponding to non irrigated fields irrigated areas i corresponding to irrigated fields and forest or natural areas f corresponding to the remaining areas have been compared with the clustering classification maps before the validation the data outside the spatial availability of the ground truth data set catalonia have been masked out as well as the urban areas and the inland water bodies fig 6 shows the confusion matrices resulting from comparisons between the ground truth and the performed classifications each matrix is referred to a specific classification identified by the combination of the input parameters used the ground truth classes are represented on the y axis while on the x axis the classes derived from the clustering process are shown the more a classification reproduces the ground truth the higher values on the diagonal of the matrix and lower values outside can be observed during the period may september 2016 all the performed classifications reproduce well the dryland in fact the percentage of dryland pixels well classified through the k means algorithm ranges between 61 and 83 of the total dryland pixels lower scores are observed for the forest or natural areas and for the irrigated areas which in several experiments are wrongly classified however in the classification identified by the code st a smap16 the percentages of natural and irrigated areas well classified reach the values of 60 and 51 respectively it can also be observed that smap at 1 km provides overall better classification results in fact matrices referred to this product use to show the higher values along the diagonal it is noteworthy that the percentages of non irrigated agricultural pixels confused with those irrigated are always low ranging from 0 to 7 and equal to 0 according to four classifications the same is valid by looking at the confusion between the irrigated and the not irrigated areas ranging between 6 and 26 this result highlights that the method performs well in distinguishing the irrigated areas from those not irrigated during the focus period in 2017 a similar behaviour can be observed also in this case the dryland is well reproduced with percentages ranging between 68 and 83 confusion between forest and irrigated areas still persist even if with the classification st a smap17 the 65 of the ground truth irrigated pixels are well classified by the proposed method and in the experiment d a smos17 the 58 of the forest or natural pixels obtained by the sigpac data are well reproduced by the clustering the overall better performances of classifications based on data from smap at 1 km are confirmed as well as the capability of the method to separate the irrigated areas from those not irrigated the percentage of the pixels belonging to the dryland class that are misinterpreted as irrigated from the clustering ranges between 1 and 5 while the percentage referred to irrigated pixels confused with those not irrigated ranges between 6 and 28 4 2 2 second validation procedure a second validation of the clustering derived maps has been performed by exploiting another kind of information from the ground truth data set instead of the information regarding the irrigation coefficient the one linked to the kind of crops has been used this alternative validation which is specific for summer crops is driven by the consideration that it may happen that a certain plot has the irrigation attribute associated to it because it is capable to reach the irrigation network but this does not imply that has been actually irrigated during the reference period for which the clustering maps have been produced that is may september from the perspective of this alternative proposed validation sigpac derived maps of selected summer crops summer cereals forage and fruit trees other crops and remaining areas have been interpreted as irrigated areas i dryland d and forest or natural areas f respectively these maps have been used to perform an alternative validation of the k means clustering derived maps whose resulting confusion matrices are shown in fig 7 the results of this second validation show for both the focus periods a systematic enhancement of the representation of the forest and of the actually irrigated areas associated with a slight worsening of the detection of the not irrigated areas however the percentage of dryland pixels recognized varies between 54 and 78 for the focus period in 2016 and between 60 and 78 for the focus period in 2017 the highest percentage of pixels belonging to the forest or natural areas class well detected is equal to 62 in 2016 and to 59 in 2017 both results are referred to the same experiment configuration d a smos16 for 2016 and d a smos17 for 2017 the best performances in detecting the irrigated crops during the focus periods are obtained for the experiments st a smap16 in 2016 percentage of recognized pixels 65 and st a smap17 percentage of recognized pixels 78 also this second validation highlights overall better performances when using data retrieved from smap at 1 km another common aspect between the two proposed validations is the almost total absence of confusion between irrigated and agricultural non irrigated areas the percentage of dryland pixels confused with irrigated pixels ranges between 1 and 9 during the focus period in 2016 and between 2 and 9 during the same period in 2017 irrigated pixels confused with dryland ones are between 2 and 14 of the total during may september 2016 and between 1 and 18 during may september 2017 finally not negligible rates of irrigated pixels wrongly classified as natural pixels still persist 4 2 3 best performing classifications according to both the validation procedures presented in this study the best performing classifications result to be the same and are shown in fig 8 for each year two classifications have been chosen the one that overall best reproduces the irrigated areas represented by the combination st a smap16 for 2016 and st a smap17 for 2017 and the one that shows the best performances by considering all the three classes concurrently represented by d a c smap16 for 2016 and d a c smap17 for 2017 the classes are identified by different colors blue for the actually irrigated areas green for the forest or natural areas and brown for the dryland together with the classification derived maps the ground truth maps are also represented the cities and the inland water areas have been masked out while the irrigation canals network is represented in magenta it is noteworthy that the sigpac crops maps are available for catalonia only east of the red border so it has not been possible to quantitative validate the k means clustering derived maps for the portion of the study area falling into aragon the overall capability of the method to reproduce the ground truth conditions can be immediately observed even if the proposed maps show some disturbances due to a system of reservoirs in the north of the study area and to evergreen forests in the south east 5 discussion this study investigates the capability of five remotely sensed soil moisture products to detect the irrigation signal over an intensely irrigated area located in the north east of spain in addition a method to classify and map irrigated areas is proposed the evaluation of the performances of the satellite products in detecting the irrigated areas has been addressed by looking at the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture through normalized indices derived from the temporal stability theory according to all the performed analyses the enhanced resolution l band passive microwave based products result to be the most skilful ones in detecting irrigation over the study area analyses based on the relative differences revealing the spatial dynamics of soil moisture indicate smap at 1 km as the data set showing the clearest irrigation signal over the urgell area while smos at 1 km results the best performing product over the catalan and aragonese area according to the same metric analyses based on the temporal anomalies which allow to investigate the temporal dynamics of soil moisture reveal a clear pattern of positive anomalies over the urgell area during the focus period in 2016 for both smos and smap at 1 km this area is where flood irrigation is the most widespread technique during may september 2017 the results obtained for the downscaled products over the urgell area are not comparable because of a rfi source detected in this area since the end of 2016 onwards see appendix d however over the catalan and aragonese area the products show a similar behaviour sentinel 1 is unable to reproduce well the spatial distribution of the different wetness conditions coexisting in the study area moreover the analysis in terms of temporal anomalies reveals unexpected uniform wetness conditions during the dry season the unsatisfactory performances obtained with sentinel 1 can be explained by the higher sensitivity to vegetation and surface roughness characterizing the c band active sensors with respect to the l band passive sensors in addition the non implementation of a correction for seasonal vegetation effects in the retrieval algorithm bauer marschallinger et al 2018 can represent a complementary reason for the poor performances of sentinel 1 over the pilot area the coarser resolution products adopted in this study ascat and smap do not show promising results in detecting irrigation over the pilot area this issue can be attributed to the scale of the irrigated land and to the complexity of the surrounding landscape with respect to the resolution of the products too coarse to capture the differences existing at the considered scale both products in fact proved to be capable to detect irrigation signal over different wide irrigated areas in the continental united states kumar et al 2015 lawston et al 2017 the downscaling through optical data from modis represents an enhancement making the dispatch downscaled products suitable for obtaining reliable spatial information about irrigated areas where high resolution is needed the potential of smos at 1 km in detecting irrigation occurring over the pilot area was already shown in escorihuela and quintana seguí 2016 nevertheless in that study the authors compared remote sensing and modeled soil moisture over different land covers finding inconsistencies over irrigated areas attributed to the irrigation occurrence in this work an analysis involving three high resolution products and specifically focused on the irrigation detection by using diagnostic indices derived from the temporal stability theory is presented in addition a method to map irrigated areas based on a k means clustering classification and exploiting the downscaled data sets is proposed despite many existing classification methods require training processes and rules based on decision tree structures thenkabail et al 2007 ozdogan and gutman 2008 jin et al 2016 teluguntla et al 2017 the method proposed in this study does not require any training in fact it is based on indices obtained from remotely sensed soil moisture that are expected to assume a clear and distinct behaviour over irrigated areas and over the other kinds of surfaces from both the validation procedures carried out it appears clear how the method is able to separate irrigated areas from not irrigated agricultural areas thus representing a useful tool to retrieve the actually irrigated portion of areas that are known to be equipped for irrigation by looking at the best resulting classification maps shown in fig 8 and at their related confusion matrices in figs 6 and 7 recurring confusion between forest or natural areas and irrigated areas can be observed the percentages of forest or natural pixels confused with those irrigated can be mainly attributed to the system of reservoirs located in the north of the study area and feeding the irrigation canals network which alter the soil wetness conditions retrieved from the satellite products conversely the percentages of irrigated pixels confused with forest or natural areas can be mainly attributed to the difficulty of the method to correctly distinguish between areas where fruit trees are cultivated and highly mixed areas like the upper part of the urgell where isolated corn crops abandoned fields and fruit trees fields coexist however the fact that the proposed method interprets this kind of areas as natural land is important and valuable difficulties in the correct classification of fruit trees areas were also found in gao et al 2018 fruit trees are usually drip irrigated a very localized irrigation method that is difficult to detect using remote sensing soil moisture data consequently over this kind of areas the soil moisture might assume lower values than over areas destined to other irrigated crops thus leading to a wrong classification during the clustering the above discussed best performing classifications are obtained by exploiting smap at 1 km data set which performs better than smos at 1 km in the clustering the higher accuracy of coarse resolution smap data with respect to coarse resolution smos data is supported by several validation studies e g chen et al 2018 however the dispatch downscaled versions of smos and smap at 1 km are both skilful in detecting irrigation over the study area but the smos derived clustering experiments are influenced by the rfi problems described in appendix d finally it is noteworthy that the adoption of less restrictive thresholds when aggregating the ground truth data to a coarser resolution can lead to an improvement of the performances of the already well performing combinations conversely this gain is not observed for already bad performing combinations see appendix a 6 conclusions on the basis of the above discussed results the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the spatial scale of the irrigation processes and the complexity of the study area make necessary the adoption of high resolution 1 km or less soil moisture products to detect the irrigation signal 2 indices derived from the temporal stability theory represent useful tools to investigate both spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture and to evaluate the capability of remotely sensed soil moisture to detect irrigated areas 3 smos and smap at 1 km dispatch downscaled proved to be the most suitable products to detect irrigation over the pilot area 4 the proposed irrigation mapping method performs well in separating irrigated areas from agricultural rainfed areas the percentages of ground truth dryland pixels confused with irrigated pixels range between 0 and 9 the irrigated pixels wrongly classified as dryland range between 1 an 28 but percentages higher than 20 can be observed for the first validation method proposed only 5 for both the focus periods the best resulting classification are the same and the best performing product is smap at 1 km the combinations st a smap16 and st a smap17 are those that overall best represent irrigated areas it is noteworthy that these combinations exploit remotely sensed data only meaning that the model does not add information for mapping irrigation this is comforting if we consider the scarcity of models running at 1 km over large regions 6 the experiments identified by the combinations d a c smap16 and d a c smap17 are those that overall best represent the three considered classes concurrently and merge information from satellite and modeled soil moisture the capability of the l band passive microwave downscaled products to detect irrigation and the correct distinction between areas where irrigation actually occurs and agricultural rainfed areas achieved by the proposed method constitute a solid basis for studies aimed to quantify the amounts of irrigation water in addition the assessment of the potential in producing maps of irrigated areas at a very high spatial resolution through the proposed methodology with plot scale resolution soil moisture data e g from sentinel 1 as input is among the future perspectives of this study credit authorship contribution statement jacopo dari conceptualization

contract n 4000129870 20 i nb the authors wish to thank the sigpac team for providing the ground truth data used in this study appendix a sensitivity of the classification to the aggregation threshold it is well known that the aggregation to coarser resolutions produces a loss of information in order to test the sensitivity of the performed classifications to this issue two data sets containing binary information linked to the ground truth data used to perform the validations described in the section 3 6 2 have been derived the two data sets contain only the irrigated crops and only the summer crops respectively inside the irrigated areas the procedure to obtain these products at 1 km consists in projecting the data on a 100 m resolution regular grid as a first step and then in aggregating it to the 1 km grid by assigning to the 1 km 1 km pixel the class irrigated or summer crops if the pixels at 100 m 100 m contained in it are more than the 30 40 50 and 60 of the total this aggregation technique allows to obtain sixteen additional ground truth data set eight for 2016 and eight for 2017 with information about the irrigated pixels only and the selected summer crops only obtained by considering four different aggregation thresholds 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 the results of the assessment of the sensitivity to the aggregation threshold when aggregating the benchmark ground truth data to the coarser 1 km resolution are shown in fig a 1 for both the validation procedures adopted in this study it can be observed that for the well performing classifications the percentage of pixels with the irrigation or summer crops information that are well represented by the proposed method increases when the aggregation threshold increases even reaching the 90 when a threshold of 0 6 is considered conversely changes in the considered aggregation threshold do not enhance the worst performing classifications this is a simplified experiment in which the distinction is made only between two and not three classes but it gives an idea of the partial loss of information occurring when the ground truth data is aggregated to the remote sensing products resolution and it confirms the capability of the method to well interpret homogeneous irrigation pattern appendix b maps of temporal stability derived indices for the coarser resolution products for complete information the maps of the temporal stability indices calculated for the coarser resolution products used in this study are shown fig b 1 shows the maps of the spatial relative differences calculated for the coarser resolution products smap and ascat and averaged during both focus periods considered in this study fig b 2 shows the maps of the temporal anomalies obtained from the same products and averaged during the same periods appendix c correlation analysis the correlation between the time series of remotely sensed and modeled soil moisture is a statistical feature that can be used to evaluate the detectability of irrigation over the pilot area escorihuela and quintana seguí 2016 to this aim the correlation between remotely sensed soil moisture data sets smos and smap at 1 km and the modeled one during the irrigation seasons in 2016 and 2017 has been investigated fig c 1 shows the spatial distribution of the pearson correlation coefficient r x calculated for the dispatch downscaled soil moisture products against surfex isba soil moisture the modeled soil moisture does not take irrigation into account so by assuming that precipitation is correct low scarce correlation or negative inverse correlation r x values within an irrigated area can be an indicator of the remotely sensed product capability to contain the irrigation information the downscaled products show similar behaviours in the period may september 2016 both smos and smap at 1 km show a clear pattern of low correlation in the upper and central zones of the irrigation areas outside the irrigable lands the correlation rises during may september 2017 the irrigation related pattern is less clear but over the irrigable land correlation lower than over the dryland especially over the rainfed cropland in the upper part can still be observed appendix d rfi problems affecting smos data in 2017 during the period may september 2017 smos at 1 km shows an anomalous behaviour over the urgell especially if compared with the performances over the same area in 2016 and over the catalan and aragonese area during both focus period which are generally in agreement with those shown by the other downscaled product smap at 1 km this issue is due to a source of rfi detected over the urgell area and not correctly solved by the post processing through the rfi filter fig d 1 shows the probability of rfi occurrence in the urgell area in the second part of the 2016 the rfi probability begins rising reaching values close to 0 7 in 2017 as a result the dielectric constant of the soil and thus the soil wetness conditions are underestimated this problem does not affect the other downscaled product considered in this study smap at 1 km the smap radar and radiometer electronics and algorithms are more recent than the smos mission and have been designed to include on board filters to mitigate rfi effects entekhabi et al 2010 
4721,while determining the water balance for large irrigation schemes coping with complexities and uncertainties in estimation of groundwater gw abstraction is still a challenge on other hand estimating gw abstraction is of paramount importance to ensure the proper management of surface and gw resources although there are number of well known methods exist to map gw abstraction utilization factor uf is considered as a reliable method however at large scales tubewells utilization time required for uf method is difficult to retrieve as large and small tubewells are governed under different rules geo informatics is another emerging approach being used to estimate gw abstraction however there are several complexities and uncertainties involved in characterizing gw abstraction using satellite remote sensing imagery that leads to inaccurate end results in current study in situ gw measurements were performed to calibrate and validate the gw abstraction estimated from geo informatics approach at lower bari doab canal lbdc command area of the indus basin of pakistan for in situ measurements an intensive tubewell survey was conducted at a grid size of 1 km at 30 locations situated at head middle and tail end reaches of the lbdc for the geo informatics approach used in this study gw abstraction is considered as a difference of actual evapotranspiration eta from net canal water use and effective rainfall after satisfying soil moisture storage changes results of calibration of geo informatics approach compared with the in situ measurements showed r2 of 0 89 0 81 and 0 79 at head middle and tail end reaches respectively intra grid annual comparison of in situ measurements showed that tubewells were being governed by different rules and thus yielded different abstraction within a grid ranging from 854 mm 105 at head 742 mm 220 at middle and 649 mm 244 at tail grids statistical analysis showed that annual gw abstraction by in situ measurements at head 814 mm 52 middle 769 mm 44 and tail 688 mm 56 end reaches varied significantly at a confidence interval of 95 the spatial mapping by geo informatics showed that farmers fields situated at proximity of head end reaches utilize 4 and 9 extra water than from those placed at middle and tail end reaches respectively the inequity of gw abstraction in lbdc command area highlighted in this study requires immediate intervention of policy makers for sustainable gw management keywords remote sensing tubewell density sebal indus basin 1 introduction groundwater gw is considered as a scarce natural resource in different semi arid and arid environments around the globe macdonald et al 2012 according to the recent studies conducted by awan et al 2016a and wada et al 2013 gw contributes around 55 of the crop water requirements under changing climate increased overexploitation of gw for irrigation is considered as a main threat for coping surface water scarcity mustafa et al 2017 wada et al 2014 gleeson et al 2010 reported that gw abstraction is exceeding gw recharge in many parts of the world resulting in gw depletion globally therefore a comprehensive knowledge on inflows and outflows from the gw aquifer is prerequisite for sustainable gw management policy sustainable gw management however requires accurate estimates of gw abstraction a variety of direct and indirect methods exist to quantify the gw abstraction castaño et al 2010 kenny 2004 direct methods determine gw use based on in situ measurements for direct methods usually flow meters are used to measure the gw abstraction from the tubewells power consumption is also used as a proxy to derive the gw abstraction from fuel and electricity consumption however hardly any pumping station in the developing world has flow meters attached to the tubewells due to its initial cost and also cost on repair and maintenance further there is no record keeping by farmers on fuel consumption for tubewell abstraction castaño et al 2010 indirect methods reduce the cost of monitoring the gw abstraction without compromising on accuracy these methods use gw abstraction withdrawn from the agricultural statistics utilization factor uf method or water table fluctuation wtf method agricultural statistics are based on different analytical methods which require parameters that are not easy to quantify uf method is based on the relationship between the discharge from a given tubewell and the utilization time tubewell run time for a given time period nespak sgi 1991 maupin 1999 however at large scales tubewells utilization time required for uf method is difficult to retrieve due to different governing rules for tubewells famiglietti et al 2011 whereas wtf method lacks to estimate the storage parameter accurately which results in errors in gw estimations cuthbert et al 2016 healy and cook 2002 despite the reliance on indirect methods for estimating gw abstraction not a single method exists to quantify withdrawals accurately over large areas although ahmad et al 2005 castaño et al 2010 ruud et al 2004 used geo informatics approaches to estimate gw abstraction but these approaches lack the way to validate gw abstraction with ground data castaño et al 2010 and ruud et al 2004 validated the gw abstraction with wtf method several studies already reported that wtf method can provide error due to lack of information on specific yield for example ahmad et al 2005 reported that gw abstraction estimated by wtf method can provide error up to 65 as compared to geo informatics approach in this study gw abstraction is mapped for lower bari doab canal lbdc command area at a high spatial 1 km pixel size and temporal monthly resolution lbdc command area is one of the vulnerable canal command areas of the punjab province of pakistan due to insufficient surface water supplies farmers are mostly relying on gw as it is a flexible and reliable source of water for agriculture as competition for water is increasing among different sectors coupled with climate change uncontrolled and ungoverned gw abstraction is not sustainable in current study we used geo informatics approach to map gw abstraction over a large area the actual evapotranspiration eta required for gw abstraction was estimated by surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal data on rainfall and irrigation water supplies was collated from programme monitoring implementation unit and pakistan metrological department the results of the geo informatics approach were then calibrated and validated with in situ measurements for in situ measurements an intensive tubewell survey was conducted at 30 different locations situated at head middle and tail end reaches of lbdc keeping in view the grid size of 1 km the in situ measurements were used to validate the geo informatics derived maps which were further used to assess the pattern of gw abstraction at spatial scale finally the results of this study highlighted the gw stressed areas and such information would be useful for the regional policy makers to identify the areas where gw abstraction is increasing 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the lower bari doab canal lbdc command area which is one of the major irrigation systems and is part of the largest irrigation network of the indus basin of pakistan the lbdc irrigation system is feeding water to 50 canal commands referred as distributaries in further text distributaries are lowest in the hierarchy of the administrative units in provincial irrigation departments fig 1 the entire lbdc region falls in the mixed agro climatic zone of the indus basin with an approximate 0 747 million ha culturable command area of the entire lbdc network maize and cotton are the dominating crops during summer season october to march whereas wheat and potato dominates during winter season april to september table 1 sugarcane is also one of the major crops in the study region which is cultivated where there is sufficient availability of surface water and gw the main canal which originates at head balloki from the left bank of river ravi and flows within lbdc command area for around 201 km is the major source of surface irrigation water with an average flow rate of 278 m3 s 1 9817 ft3 s 1 elevation of the lbdc command area ranges from 208 m from north west side to 113 m at the south east side of the region 2 2 climate climate of the lbdc command area is arid to semi arid with strong fluctuations in rainfall and temperature the temperature during summer is usually remained hot ranging from 20 c to 45 c which lasts from may to september while in the winter season it varies from 15 c to 27 c during the months of december to february mean annual rainfall is around 300 mm in the upper lbdc command area which reduces to 170 mm in the lower lbdc command area for the last twenty years the long term average annual rainfall and reference evapotranspiration eto in study area are around 297 mm and 1437 mm respectively fig 2 2 3 a methodological framework for estimating groundwater abstraction a methodological framework was established to calibrate and validate the groundwater gw abstraction by geo informatics technique fig 3 the key components of the framework were canal water gross and net actual evapotranspiration eta and the effective rainfall however there are several complexities and uncertainties involved in estimating these components therefore the results were calibrated and validated with ground truthing using in situ measurements 2 3 1 geo informatics approach a geo informatics technique was used to estimate gw abstraction on monthly and annual basis ahmad et al 2005 awan et al 2016b campos et al 2013 liaqat et al 2016 found that geo informatics provide more reliable results than direct and indirect methods to estimate the net gw abstraction by geo informatics the root zone water balance was established at a 1 km grid size according to this approach net gw irrigation ingw is a residual product derived from water balance in the unsaturated zone for the given period dt as given below eq 1 1 i n g w e t a p n i n c w d w u d t where incw net canal water irrigation eta actual evapotranspiration pn effective rainfall dwu change in the soil moisture storage over time and ingw net gw irrigation the dwu values are taken form study published by ahmad 2002 for the study region and is described in table 2 as net gw abstraction is not the total amount of water abstracted from gw aquifer the conveyance and application losses were introduced to determine total gw abstraction hussain et al 2011 showed that irrigation and field application efficiency in the indus basin for gw use are 90 and 75 respectively thus an overall irrigation efficiency for the lbdc is taken as 68 to determine the gross gw abstraction eq 1 describes net values for both surface and gw use by the plants to achieve net irrigation ingw net gw irrigation required for eq 1 the efficiency concept is used which incorporates the deep percolation losses that are contributing to the gw aquifer the application efficiency at field level is 75 and according to awan et al 2016a around 90 of the field losses are percolated to recharge the gw aquifer the canal water supply data is collated from punjab irrigation department pid for all distributaries in the lbdc command area the eta used in eq 1 was estimated by forcing the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal 2 3 1 1 actual evapotranspiration the sebal is a well known remote sensing based algorithm to map eta at high temporal and spatial resolution detailed methodology for the sebal algorithm is published by bastiaanssen et al 1998 when sebal algorithm is validated under different agro climatic conditions it yielded around 95 accuracy bastiaanssen et al 1998 the recently published literature showed that sebal algorithm was used in several water balance studies which has been conducted across the globe e g awan et al 2011 conrad et al 2007 hafeez et al 2007 hellegers et al 2009 the fundamental basis of the algorithm is surface energy budget where eta is residual product of energy balance eq 2 2 r n g o h λ e where go soil heat flux w m 2 λe latent heat flux w m 2 h sensible heat flux w m 2 and rn net radiation w m 2 modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer used to map eta for lbdc command area table 3 modis standard products utilized in this study are collected free of cost from the website https earthexplorer usgs gov for this study climatic data was collated form pakistan metrological department 2 3 1 2 validation of eta with advection aridity method flux towers equipped with energy instruments are used for validating eta however the energy balance instruments are expensive and hardly available in developing world therefore different researchers e g liaqat et al 2015 validated surface energy balance system sebs algorithm using the advection aridity aa method in current study we also validated eta calculated from sebal algorithm against ground based eta derived from the aa method eq 3 the aa method combined advection effects and energy budget information and then scaled by aero dynamic vapor transfer brutsaert and stricker 1979 3 et a 2 α e 1 δ δ γ q ne γ δ γ 0 26 1 0 54 u 2 e s e a where αe is priestley taylor coefficient v2 is the average wind speed qne is ratio of rn to λ γ is psychometric constant ea and es are actual and saturated vapor pressures and δ is slope of vapor pressure versus temperature respectively the eta by the aa method was determined on monthly basis for the study region 2 3 1 3 canal water use different distributaries which diverts water from the main lbdc by flow regulating infrastructure are the major source of irrigation water distribution in the command area the pid is mainly responsible for the measurement and control of water release in the distributaries as well as maintaining the online discharge dataset water depth in the distributaries is measured by stream gauges which then use rating curves to estimate the flow in distributaries the concept of irrigation efficiency conveyance and field efficiency was applied to estimate the net canal water amount of water accessible by plant hussain et al 2011 reported that field application and conveyance efficiency in the lbdc command area is approximately around 75 and 48 respectively this results in an overall irrigation efficiency of around 36 which was used for the current study 2 3 2 in situ measurements of gw abstraction there is unplanned and rapid development of private tubewells for mitigating surface water scarcity however there is no mechanism established to estimate the gw abstraction in the entire indus basin in current study we determined the gw abstraction by physically calculating gw abstraction at 1 km by 1 km grid size the canal discharge and operation time was determined from each tubewell eq 4 was then used to compute the gw abstraction itw of the given tubewell ntw 4 i tw t q tw a where t is operating time of the tubewell in hours for the given time period qtw is discharge of tubewell m3 day 1 and a m2 is area of grid 1 km by 1 km 2 3 3 calibration and validation of gw abstraction there are complexities and uncertainties in geo informatics techniques which may result in an inaccuracy however to mitigate these complexities and uncertainties there is need to calibrate and validate the gw abstraction estimated by geo informatics technique with in situ measurements survey was conducted in thirty grids each grid is 1 km2 of size for tubewells data fig 4 for calibration purposes fifteen grids were selected at head 5 grids middle 5 grids and tail 5 grids end reaches of lbdc for validation purposes fifteen more grids were selected at head 5 grids middle 5 grids and tail 5 grids end reaches of lbdc the gw abstraction in these grids were estimated by in situ measurements the factors which can influence the gw abstraction includes canal water supplies rainfall and eta as gw abstraction by geo informatics is estimated at 1 km2 pixel size these factors vary significantly within the pixel the eta estimated from sebal is validated with aa method and thus can least influence the gw abstraction the rainfall data is also observed at pakistan metrological department stations with high accuracy however canal water supplies data measured at head of distributary cannot be assumed constant for the entire distributary with on average 2000 ha size awan et al 2016a reported inequity at head middle and tail reaches therefore we used the canal water consumption at head middle and tail reaches for the calibration of gw abstraction after calibration of the gw abstraction at 1 km pixel size the geo informatics approach was validated for other 15 pixels the coefficient of determination r2 for evaluating the predictive performance of geo informatics results was used awan and ismaeel 2014 and calculated using eq 5 5 r 2 σ r r m e e m σ r r m 2 0 5 σ e e m 2 0 5 where e is estimated data and em is the mean of the estimated data whereas rm is the mean of the reported data and r is the reported data 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance comparison of the surface energy balance algorithm for land algorithm and the advection aridity method results of the comparison for daily values show that there is a reasonable correlation between actual evapotranspiration eta derived from advection aridity aa methods and eta derived from surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal algorithm the coefficients of determination r2 for this correlation were 0 76 and 0 85 during the rabi seasons and the kharif seasons respectively fig 5 the differences in eta by both methods can be due to the difference in spatial scale when bastiaanssen et al 2012 compared the sebal results with the lysimeter values they also attributed the difference in values due to the spatial scale further liu et al 2006 reported that eta estimated using complementary relationships yield underestimates in humid conditions similar results were reported for eta derived from aa method as compared to other methods rwasoka et al 2011 3 2 intra grid variation of groundwater abstraction in lower bari doab canal command area table 4 is showing the statistical analysis of groundwater gw abstraction in 9 grids selected as a sample out of 30 for head middle and tail end reaches of the lower bari doab canal lbdc results reveal that there are around 22 2 20 3 and 18 3 tubewells in one grid 1 km at head middle and tail end reaches of the lbdc respectively the variation of gw abstraction within all the grids is significantly high ranging from 105 mm year 1 to 244 mm year 1 at all spatial scales this variation typically depends on type and size of tubewell cropping patterns and cropping intensities surface water supplies and agro climatic conditions basharat and tariq 2014 reported that there is no governance regime in indus basin to regulate over exploitation for judicious use of the gw resources maximum gw abstraction was 854 mm 105 in grid 5 whereas minimum gw abstraction was 649 mm 244 in grid 26 the wide ranges of gw abstraction for lbdc can be attributed to diverse cropping patterns interviews with farmers in okara khanewal and sahiwal divisions revealed that due to cotton wheat cropping rotation in khanewal and sahiwal division the gw abstraction is low in these divisions as compared to okara division more water consumption in okara division is due to more crop water requirements for the predominant rice wheat and sugarcane crops results of the survey further show that sugarcane and rice crops use three times more water when compared to cotton and wheat crops the overall gw abstraction in all 30 grids was 747 175 mm year 1 3 3 inter grid variation of gw abstraction at different locations in lbdc fig 6 is showing the gw abstraction from all tubewells 524 in all 30 grids the gw abstraction was decreasing from head to tail the average gw abstraction in head distributaries was 814 mm year 1 whereas average gw abstraction in tail end distributaries was 688 mm year 1 this analysis reveals that farmers at head grids are using 16 more gw as compared to farmers at tail end grids majority of the tubewells approximately 60 are installed around 40 m below the soil surface at head and middle reaches of lbdc due to shallower gw levels tubewells at the tail end reaches are installed at a depth of 60 m or more different studies show that gw abstraction from deeper aquifer raises the cost of installing tubewells and also causes a risk of accumulation of salts in the soil profile a statistical analysis of gw abstraction between the head middle and tail end reaches depict relatively large differences table 5 the analysis of variance shows that gw use significantly differs at head middle and tail end reaches at confidence interval of 95 3 4 calibration and validation of gw abstraction results show that the trend of gw abstractions by geo informatics and in situ measurements does not vary significantly the gw abstraction is higher at head end grids and reduce to minimum at tail end grids fig 7 however the r2 value after first results is less than 0 6 the reason for that is huge discrepancies of gw abstraction between the middle and tail end reaches fig 7 this could also be related with the simplified assumptions of constant canal water use at all spatial scales during estimation of gw abstraction which result in uncertainties however researchers have shown that the canal water availability differ at head middle and tail end reaches approximately by 40 34 and 26

4721,while determining the water balance for large irrigation schemes coping with complexities and uncertainties in estimation of groundwater gw abstraction is still a challenge on other hand estimating gw abstraction is of paramount importance to ensure the proper management of surface and gw resources although there are number of well known methods exist to map gw abstraction utilization factor uf is considered as a reliable method however at large scales tubewells utilization time required for uf method is difficult to retrieve as large and small tubewells are governed under different rules geo informatics is another emerging approach being used to estimate gw abstraction however there are several complexities and uncertainties involved in characterizing gw abstraction using satellite remote sensing imagery that leads to inaccurate end results in current study in situ gw measurements were performed to calibrate and validate the gw abstraction estimated from geo informatics approach at lower bari doab canal lbdc command area of the indus basin of pakistan for in situ measurements an intensive tubewell survey was conducted at a grid size of 1 km at 30 locations situated at head middle and tail end reaches of the lbdc for the geo informatics approach used in this study gw abstraction is considered as a difference of actual evapotranspiration eta from net canal water use and effective rainfall after satisfying soil moisture storage changes results of calibration of geo informatics approach compared with the in situ measurements showed r2 of 0 89 0 81 and 0 79 at head middle and tail end reaches respectively intra grid annual comparison of in situ measurements showed that tubewells were being governed by different rules and thus yielded different abstraction within a grid ranging from 854 mm 105 at head 742 mm 220 at middle and 649 mm 244 at tail grids statistical analysis showed that annual gw abstraction by in situ measurements at head 814 mm 52 middle 769 mm 44 and tail 688 mm 56 end reaches varied significantly at a confidence interval of 95 the spatial mapping by geo informatics showed that farmers fields situated at proximity of head end reaches utilize 4 and 9 extra water than from those placed at middle and tail end reaches respectively the inequity of gw abstraction in lbdc command area highlighted in this study requires immediate intervention of policy makers for sustainable gw management keywords remote sensing tubewell density sebal indus basin 1 introduction groundwater gw is considered as a scarce natural resource in different semi arid and arid environments around the globe macdonald et al 2012 according to the recent studies conducted by awan et al 2016a and wada et al 2013 gw contributes around 55 of the crop water requirements under changing climate increased overexploitation of gw for irrigation is considered as a main threat for coping surface water scarcity mustafa et al 2017 wada et al 2014 gleeson et al 2010 reported that gw abstraction is exceeding gw recharge in many parts of the world resulting in gw depletion globally therefore a comprehensive knowledge on inflows and outflows from the gw aquifer is prerequisite for sustainable gw management policy sustainable gw management however requires accurate estimates of gw abstraction a variety of direct and indirect methods exist to quantify the gw abstraction castaño et al 2010 kenny 2004 direct methods determine gw use based on in situ measurements for direct methods usually flow meters are used to measure the gw abstraction from the tubewells power consumption is also used as a proxy to derive the gw abstraction from fuel and electricity consumption however hardly any pumping station in the developing world has flow meters attached to the tubewells due to its initial cost and also cost on repair and maintenance further there is no record keeping by farmers on fuel consumption for tubewell abstraction castaño et al 2010 indirect methods reduce the cost of monitoring the gw abstraction without compromising on accuracy these methods use gw abstraction withdrawn from the agricultural statistics utilization factor uf method or water table fluctuation wtf method agricultural statistics are based on different analytical methods which require parameters that are not easy to quantify uf method is based on the relationship between the discharge from a given tubewell and the utilization time tubewell run time for a given time period nespak sgi 1991 maupin 1999 however at large scales tubewells utilization time required for uf method is difficult to retrieve due to different governing rules for tubewells famiglietti et al 2011 whereas wtf method lacks to estimate the storage parameter accurately which results in errors in gw estimations cuthbert et al 2016 healy and cook 2002 despite the reliance on indirect methods for estimating gw abstraction not a single method exists to quantify withdrawals accurately over large areas although ahmad et al 2005 castaño et al 2010 ruud et al 2004 used geo informatics approaches to estimate gw abstraction but these approaches lack the way to validate gw abstraction with ground data castaño et al 2010 and ruud et al 2004 validated the gw abstraction with wtf method several studies already reported that wtf method can provide error due to lack of information on specific yield for example ahmad et al 2005 reported that gw abstraction estimated by wtf method can provide error up to 65 as compared to geo informatics approach in this study gw abstraction is mapped for lower bari doab canal lbdc command area at a high spatial 1 km pixel size and temporal monthly resolution lbdc command area is one of the vulnerable canal command areas of the punjab province of pakistan due to insufficient surface water supplies farmers are mostly relying on gw as it is a flexible and reliable source of water for agriculture as competition for water is increasing among different sectors coupled with climate change uncontrolled and ungoverned gw abstraction is not sustainable in current study we used geo informatics approach to map gw abstraction over a large area the actual evapotranspiration eta required for gw abstraction was estimated by surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal data on rainfall and irrigation water supplies was collated from programme monitoring implementation unit and pakistan metrological department the results of the geo informatics approach were then calibrated and validated with in situ measurements for in situ measurements an intensive tubewell survey was conducted at 30 different locations situated at head middle and tail end reaches of lbdc keeping in view the grid size of 1 km the in situ measurements were used to validate the geo informatics derived maps which were further used to assess the pattern of gw abstraction at spatial scale finally the results of this study highlighted the gw stressed areas and such information would be useful for the regional policy makers to identify the areas where gw abstraction is increasing 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the lower bari doab canal lbdc command area which is one of the major irrigation systems and is part of the largest irrigation network of the indus basin of pakistan the lbdc irrigation system is feeding water to 50 canal commands referred as distributaries in further text distributaries are lowest in the hierarchy of the administrative units in provincial irrigation departments fig 1 the entire lbdc region falls in the mixed agro climatic zone of the indus basin with an approximate 0 747 million ha culturable command area of the entire lbdc network maize and cotton are the dominating crops during summer season october to march whereas wheat and potato dominates during winter season april to september table 1 sugarcane is also one of the major crops in the study region which is cultivated where there is sufficient availability of surface water and gw the main canal which originates at head balloki from the left bank of river ravi and flows within lbdc command area for around 201 km is the major source of surface irrigation water with an average flow rate of 278 m3 s 1 9817 ft3 s 1 elevation of the lbdc command area ranges from 208 m from north west side to 113 m at the south east side of the region 2 2 climate climate of the lbdc command area is arid to semi arid with strong fluctuations in rainfall and temperature the temperature during summer is usually remained hot ranging from 20 c to 45 c which lasts from may to september while in the winter season it varies from 15 c to 27 c during the months of december to february mean annual rainfall is around 300 mm in the upper lbdc command area which reduces to 170 mm in the lower lbdc command area for the last twenty years the long term average annual rainfall and reference evapotranspiration eto in study area are around 297 mm and 1437 mm respectively fig 2 2 3 a methodological framework for estimating groundwater abstraction a methodological framework was established to calibrate and validate the groundwater gw abstraction by geo informatics technique fig 3 the key components of the framework were canal water gross and net actual evapotranspiration eta and the effective rainfall however there are several complexities and uncertainties involved in estimating these components therefore the results were calibrated and validated with ground truthing using in situ measurements 2 3 1 geo informatics approach a geo informatics technique was used to estimate gw abstraction on monthly and annual basis ahmad et al 2005 awan et al 2016b campos et al 2013 liaqat et al 2016 found that geo informatics provide more reliable results than direct and indirect methods to estimate the net gw abstraction by geo informatics the root zone water balance was established at a 1 km grid size according to this approach net gw irrigation ingw is a residual product derived from water balance in the unsaturated zone for the given period dt as given below eq 1 1 i n g w e t a p n i n c w d w u d t where incw net canal water irrigation eta actual evapotranspiration pn effective rainfall dwu change in the soil moisture storage over time and ingw net gw irrigation the dwu values are taken form study published by ahmad 2002 for the study region and is described in table 2 as net gw abstraction is not the total amount of water abstracted from gw aquifer the conveyance and application losses were introduced to determine total gw abstraction hussain et al 2011 showed that irrigation and field application efficiency in the indus basin for gw use are 90 and 75 respectively thus an overall irrigation efficiency for the lbdc is taken as 68 to determine the gross gw abstraction eq 1 describes net values for both surface and gw use by the plants to achieve net irrigation ingw net gw irrigation required for eq 1 the efficiency concept is used which incorporates the deep percolation losses that are contributing to the gw aquifer the application efficiency at field level is 75 and according to awan et al 2016a around 90 of the field losses are percolated to recharge the gw aquifer the canal water supply data is collated from punjab irrigation department pid for all distributaries in the lbdc command area the eta used in eq 1 was estimated by forcing the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal 2 3 1 1 actual evapotranspiration the sebal is a well known remote sensing based algorithm to map eta at high temporal and spatial resolution detailed methodology for the sebal algorithm is published by bastiaanssen et al 1998 when sebal algorithm is validated under different agro climatic conditions it yielded around 95 accuracy bastiaanssen et al 1998 the recently published literature showed that sebal algorithm was used in several water balance studies which has been conducted across the globe e g awan et al 2011 conrad et al 2007 hafeez et al 2007 hellegers et al 2009 the fundamental basis of the algorithm is surface energy budget where eta is residual product of energy balance eq 2 2 r n g o h λ e where go soil heat flux w m 2 λe latent heat flux w m 2 h sensible heat flux w m 2 and rn net radiation w m 2 modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer used to map eta for lbdc command area table 3 modis standard products utilized in this study are collected free of cost from the website https earthexplorer usgs gov for this study climatic data was collated form pakistan metrological department 2 3 1 2 validation of eta with advection aridity method flux towers equipped with energy instruments are used for validating eta however the energy balance instruments are expensive and hardly available in developing world therefore different researchers e g liaqat et al 2015 validated surface energy balance system sebs algorithm using the advection aridity aa method in current study we also validated eta calculated from sebal algorithm against ground based eta derived from the aa method eq 3 the aa method combined advection effects and energy budget information and then scaled by aero dynamic vapor transfer brutsaert and stricker 1979 3 et a 2 α e 1 δ δ γ q ne γ δ γ 0 26 1 0 54 u 2 e s e a where αe is priestley taylor coefficient v2 is the average wind speed qne is ratio of rn to λ γ is psychometric constant ea and es are actual and saturated vapor pressures and δ is slope of vapor pressure versus temperature respectively the eta by the aa method was determined on monthly basis for the study region 2 3 1 3 canal water use different distributaries which diverts water from the main lbdc by flow regulating infrastructure are the major source of irrigation water distribution in the command area the pid is mainly responsible for the measurement and control of water release in the distributaries as well as maintaining the online discharge dataset water depth in the distributaries is measured by stream gauges which then use rating curves to estimate the flow in distributaries the concept of irrigation efficiency conveyance and field efficiency was applied to estimate the net canal water amount of water accessible by plant hussain et al 2011 reported that field application and conveyance efficiency in the lbdc command area is approximately around 75 and 48 respectively this results in an overall irrigation efficiency of around 36 which was used for the current study 2 3 2 in situ measurements of gw abstraction there is unplanned and rapid development of private tubewells for mitigating surface water scarcity however there is no mechanism established to estimate the gw abstraction in the entire indus basin in current study we determined the gw abstraction by physically calculating gw abstraction at 1 km by 1 km grid size the canal discharge and operation time was determined from each tubewell eq 4 was then used to compute the gw abstraction itw of the given tubewell ntw 4 i tw t q tw a where t is operating time of the tubewell in hours for the given time period qtw is discharge of tubewell m3 day 1 and a m2 is area of grid 1 km by 1 km 2 3 3 calibration and validation of gw abstraction there are complexities and uncertainties in geo informatics techniques which may result in an inaccuracy however to mitigate these complexities and uncertainties there is need to calibrate and validate the gw abstraction estimated by geo informatics technique with in situ measurements survey was conducted in thirty grids each grid is 1 km2 of size for tubewells data fig 4 for calibration purposes fifteen grids were selected at head 5 grids middle 5 grids and tail 5 grids end reaches of lbdc for validation purposes fifteen more grids were selected at head 5 grids middle 5 grids and tail 5 grids end reaches of lbdc the gw abstraction in these grids were estimated by in situ measurements the factors which can influence the gw abstraction includes canal water supplies rainfall and eta as gw abstraction by geo informatics is estimated at 1 km2 pixel size these factors vary significantly within the pixel the eta estimated from sebal is validated with aa method and thus can least influence the gw abstraction the rainfall data is also observed at pakistan metrological department stations with high accuracy however canal water supplies data measured at head of distributary cannot be assumed constant for the entire distributary with on average 2000 ha size awan et al 2016a reported inequity at head middle and tail reaches therefore we used the canal water consumption at head middle and tail reaches for the calibration of gw abstraction after calibration of the gw abstraction at 1 km pixel size the geo informatics approach was validated for other 15 pixels the coefficient of determination r2 for evaluating the predictive performance of geo informatics results was used awan and ismaeel 2014 and calculated using eq 5 5 r 2 σ r r m e e m σ r r m 2 0 5 σ e e m 2 0 5 where e is estimated data and em is the mean of the estimated data whereas rm is the mean of the reported data and r is the reported data 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance comparison of the surface energy balance algorithm for land algorithm and the advection aridity method results of the comparison for daily values show that there is a reasonable correlation between actual evapotranspiration eta derived from advection aridity aa methods and eta derived from surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal algorithm the coefficients of determination r2 for this correlation were 0 76 and 0 85 during the rabi seasons and the kharif seasons respectively fig 5 the differences in eta by both methods can be due to the difference in spatial scale when bastiaanssen et al 2012 compared the sebal results with the lysimeter values they also attributed the difference in values due to the spatial scale further liu et al 2006 reported that eta estimated using complementary relationships yield underestimates in humid conditions similar results were reported for eta derived from aa method as compared to other methods rwasoka et al 2011 3 2 intra grid variation of groundwater abstraction in lower bari doab canal command area table 4 is showing the statistical analysis of groundwater gw abstraction in 9 grids selected as a sample out of 30 for head middle and tail end reaches of the lower bari doab canal lbdc results reveal that there are around 22 2 20 3 and 18 3 tubewells in one grid 1 km at head middle and tail end reaches of the lbdc respectively the variation of gw abstraction within all the grids is significantly high ranging from 105 mm year 1 to 244 mm year 1 at all spatial scales this variation typically depends on type and size of tubewell cropping patterns and cropping intensities surface water supplies and agro climatic conditions basharat and tariq 2014 reported that there is no governance regime in indus basin to regulate over exploitation for judicious use of the gw resources maximum gw abstraction was 854 mm 105 in grid 5 whereas minimum gw abstraction was 649 mm 244 in grid 26 the wide ranges of gw abstraction for lbdc can be attributed to diverse cropping patterns interviews with farmers in okara khanewal and sahiwal divisions revealed that due to cotton wheat cropping rotation in khanewal and sahiwal division the gw abstraction is low in these divisions as compared to okara division more water consumption in okara division is due to more crop water requirements for the predominant rice wheat and sugarcane crops results of the survey further show that sugarcane and rice crops use three times more water when compared to cotton and wheat crops the overall gw abstraction in all 30 grids was 747 175 mm year 1 3 3 inter grid variation of gw abstraction at different locations in lbdc fig 6 is showing the gw abstraction from all tubewells 524 in all 30 grids the gw abstraction was decreasing from head to tail the average gw abstraction in head distributaries was 814 mm year 1 whereas average gw abstraction in tail end distributaries was 688 mm year 1 this analysis reveals that farmers at head grids are using 16 more gw as compared to farmers at tail end grids majority of the tubewells approximately 60 are installed around 40 m below the soil surface at head and middle reaches of lbdc due to shallower gw levels tubewells at the tail end reaches are installed at a depth of 60 m or more different studies show that gw abstraction from deeper aquifer raises the cost of installing tubewells and also causes a risk of accumulation of salts in the soil profile a statistical analysis of gw abstraction between the head middle and tail end reaches depict relatively large differences table 5 the analysis of variance shows that gw use significantly differs at head middle and tail end reaches at confidence interval of 95 3 4 calibration and validation of gw abstraction results show that the trend of gw abstractions by geo informatics and in situ measurements does not vary significantly the gw abstraction is higher at head end grids and reduce to minimum at tail end grids fig 7 however the r2 value after first results is less than 0 6 the reason for that is huge discrepancies of gw abstraction between the middle and tail end reaches fig 7 this could also be related with the simplified assumptions of constant canal water use at all spatial scales during estimation of gw abstraction which result in uncertainties however researchers have shown that the canal water availability differ at head middle and tail end reaches approximately by 40 34 and 26 respectively anwar and ul haq 2013 awan et al 2016a therefore the differences in gw abstraction by geo informatics was greater 68 mm at tail end reaches after multitudinous run calibration was done by rectifying the canal water supplies and the scatter plot comparison which reveal good agreement between the two methods at head middle and tail grids the r2 at head middle and tail was 0 89 0 81 and 0 79 respectively the equations were developed after calibration at head eq 6 middle eq 7 and tail eq 8 which are shown in fig 8 6 gw gi 0 71 i s 257 7 gw gi 0 81 i s 146 8 gw gi 0 81 i s 122 where gwgi gw abstraction by geo informatics gi method and is gw abstraction using in situ method fig 9 shows the validation results using eq 6 eq 7 and eq 8 such a level of similarity in annual gw abstraction can give confidence to use geo informatics for other regions after calibration the r2 value between estimated and calculated gw abstraction at head middle and tail end reaches is 0 88 0 86 and 0 84 respectively fig 10 shows the annual gw abstraction in different distributaries of lbdc command area the gw abstraction map shows that there is a variation in gw use at head and tail end reaches of the lbdc the gw abstraction is quite high from where the lbdc originates north east side and low at tail of the lbdc south west side 3 5 interrelations of gw with canal water at different spatial and temporal scale among different distributaries maximum canal water irrigation was 823 mm whereas the minimum canal water irrigation was 579 mm for the entire cropping year in the entire lbdc the average annual canal water supply was 2 02 mm day 1 the canal water supply was 21 more during kharif season when compared to rabi season since december and january are the months when accumulated silt is removed there is no canal water supply during these months ahmad et al 2005 results further show that around 2 4 mm day 1 of water is supplied during the kharif season whereas 1 6 mm day 1 is supplied during the rabi season to the entire lbdc command area fig 11 as the sum of net canal water and rainfall was only 518 mm 44 of eta farmers generally rely on the gw abstraction to mitigate the water scarcity awan et al 2017 the annual gw abstraction from aquifer varied from 576 mm to 846 mm with an average of 730 mm fig 12 out of which 64 is extracted during kharif season and rest is extracted during rabi season in various months the gw fluctuated between 0 mm and 183 mm which is mainly controlled by crop water requirement and rainfall pattern in study area gw abstraction is minimum during january 13 mm and november 4 mm due to low crop water demand and high rainfall respectively basharat 2016 the maximum gw abstraction occurred in month of may which could be due to the insufficient canal water supplies and low rainfall as well as cultivation of rice crop the results show that 37 of the total gw abstraction used by farmers situated at head end reaches in lbdc command area whereas the farmers fields situated at the middle and tail end reaches use 33 and 30 of the total gw abstracted in lbdc command area respectively fig 13 a these results are in line with the findings of awan et al 2016a who reported comparable results for hakra canal command area of punjab province pakistan according to that study framers situated at head middle and tail end reaches use 42 35 and 23 gw of total gw abstracted respectively fig 13 b shows that farmers situated at head end reaches of the lbdc receive only 39 of the total surface water supply whereas only 32 and 29 surface water supply is received by farmers situated at the middle and tail end reaches respectively awan et al 2016a reported that in hakra canal command area the surface water supplies at the head middle and tail end reaches is only 40 34 and 26 respectively the results of both studies show similar trends of canal water and gw use results show that 36 of the total rainfall occurs at head end reaches which reduces to 34 and 30 for middle and tail end reaches fig 13 c the variation between rainfall at head and middle reaches is only 2 however at tail end reaches rainfall reduce by 6 as compare to the head end reaches 4 conclusion in the indus basin the profound gw abstraction is exposed to agriculture activities which requires proper governance during vegetation season however

4722,an improved cumulative distribution function cdf based approach to reduce the systematic biases of multi satellite precipitation estimates in real time is proposed and verified over mainland china efforts are primarily focused on establishing the bias adjusting model by adopting the cdf based on a self adaptive moving window csmw which systematically integrates the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa into the real time trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa rt in our modelling experiments the first 9 yr 2008 2016 precipitation data pairs were used to calibrate the csmw model and establish a satellite gauge relationship which was then applied to the last 3 years of 2017 2019 as validation assessment results during the independent validation period show that the csmw approach can significantly reduce the systematic positive bias of original tmpa rt precipitation estimates in that the relative bias rb during the validation period decreases from 16 01 before adjustments to 0 29 and the root mean square error rmse also has a dramatic drop of 13 the error component analysis indicates that the substantial improvement is mainly manifested in the hit events observed rain was correctly detected by satellite but it failed to reduce the miss bias observed rain was not detected by satellite this arises because a majority of missed precipitation is drizzle and falls below the rain no rain discriminant threshold which is normally excluded from the csmw algorithm additionally the csmw approach seems to have significantly improved the tmpa rt estimates at the medium high rain rates 8 mm day but it also has a limitation in enhancing the correlation coefficient between satellite retrievals and ground observations the major advantage of this approach is its applicability when real time gauge data are not available which could further facilitate the expansion of satellite based precipitation estimates for real time natural hazards

remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 hong et al 2004 the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 and integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2014 despite these community developments satellite derived precipitation estimates are subject to considerable errors aghakouchak et al 2011 chen et al 2013 yong et al 2015 due to the inherently indirect nature of remote sensing retrievals tian et al 2010 tang et al 2015 sadeghi et al 2019 this limitation can propagate into larger uncertainties in hydrologic modelling and limit the applications for near real time flood forecasting typhoon warning or landslide monitoring many efforts have been devoted to correct the satellite based precipitation estimates by integrating ground based gauge observations for instance tian et al 2010 proposed a statistical approach based on the bayesian logic model to effectively reduce the biases of two real time satellite precipitation products tmpa rt and cmorph by integrating a gauge analysis dataset i e the cpc unified analysis xie and xiong 2011 constructed a satellite gauge merged precipitation dataset using a probability density function optimal interpolation pdf oi nie et al 2015 nie et al 2016 reduced the precipitation biases of cmorph and national centers for environmental prediction ncep numerical simulations by blending them with the chinese high resolution gauge network through cumulative probability function optimal interpolation cdf oi several other studies also employed the cdf method to adjust the satellite precipitation estimates in real time at some specific basins zhang and tang 2015 climate regions katiraie boroujerdy et al 2020 or fixed windows yang et al 2016 2017 in summary the above studies demonstrate that the approach of cdf matching is a practical way to reduce the error and bias of satellite precipitation estimates in real time on the basis of these previous works here we propose a new bias adjustment approach which applies the gamma distribution cdf matching procedure based on self adapting moving window hereafter referred to as csmw to real time tmpa estimates different from the aforementioned studies that normally used the fixed target areas to calculate the key parameters in the cdf based adjustments the new proposed csmw approach comprehensively considers the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation and estimates the algorithmic parameters for different target regions using a moving window with variable sizes moreover this scheme is also entirely self adapting in that it can adjust itself according to different training data pairs additionally this real time bias adjustment mainly depends on the rainfall characteristics of historical gauge data and the real time rain rates of satellite retrievals suggesting that it does not need the timely availability of gauge observations in the correction algorithm this will further advance the real time applications of satellite precipitation estimates for hydrometeorological forecasting and natural hazard warning 2 datasets considering both the impact of solid precipitation and snow ice cover during the cool season on gauge observations and the strong dependence of cswm algorithm on the assumed accuracy of the gauges we selected those warm season months from may through september from 2008 to 2019 to execute the bias adjustment and verify the cswm approach in this study since a relative long calibration period is needed to establish the satellite gauge relationship the widely used tmpa rt with long time series was selected here to conduct the adjustment in csmw approach the first 9 yr 2008 2016 historical precipitation records of tmpa rt and rain gauges covering mainland china were used to establish a satellite gauge relationship for the csmw model the last 3 years from 2017 to 2019 were taken as an independent validation period for assessing the applicability of csmw approach in real time estimation 2 1 ground reference the gridded china gauge based daily precipitation analysis v1 0 cgdpa developed by china meteorological administration cma was taken as the ground reference available at http data cma cn this dataset has a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a time step of 1 day and was derived from 2400 rainfall gauges over mainland china by using climatology based optimal interpolation oi proposed by xie et al 2007 first a daily climatology was computed by interpolating station data through the algorithm of shepard 1968 this daily climatology was then adjusted through the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism monthly precipitation climatology to consider orographic effects next the gridded ratio of daily observed precipitation to the daily climatology was created by interpolating the corresponding station values based on the optimal interpolation oi finally cgdpa is calculated by multiplying the daily climatology with the ratio the cgdpa goes through a series of strict quality control procedures including extreme value check internal consistency check and spatial consistency check shen et al 2010 and cgdpa was demonstrated as a reliable precipitation product over mainland china shen and xiong 2016 fig 1 shows the number of gauge stations in each 0 25 grid box of cgdpa over mainland china the gauge stations are distributed unevenly across mainland china with approximately 80 of them located in eastern china and the minority in western china 2 2 satellite precipitation estimates trmm which was led by the u s national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japanese aerospace exploration agency jaxa is the first mission for global precipitation detection based on satellite the trmm near real time precipitation product tmpa 3b42rt tmpa rt developed by nasa is available at a 3 hourly temporal frequency and a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 quasi globally 50 s 50 n with about 8 h of latency after the observation time huffman et al 2007 tmpa rt takes advantage of the most recent passive microwave pmw satellite sensors to derive the precipitation estimates the infrared ir precipitation estimates calibrated by pmw estimates are used to fill the pmw coverage gaps to obtain the daily tmpa rt product the 3 hourly precipitation estimates of a specific day are accumulated tan and santo 2018 3 methods 3 1 bias adjusting procedure yu et al 2013 and shen et al 2014 proposed a bias adjusting strategy using a pdf matching method to correct the cmorph based on automatic weather stations awss over mainland china in both studies the pdf method is employed to establish the satellite gauge rainfall relationship within a spatial domain centered on the target grid while the spatial scale is 10 in the former and 4 in the latter they focused on correcting the satellite precipitation estimates by using the synchronous gauge data and not for adjusting the future satellite precipitation estimates in real time without the timely availability of gauge observations the cdf pdf matching method in the present study has been developed to reduce the errors and bias for satellite precipitation estimates in real time nie et al 2008 pointed out that the spatial scale of gauge precipitation in different regions of china is on the order of 100 km it means that the spatial autocorrelation of precipitation is highest on the order of 100 km over mainland china and precipitation showed homogeneity at this spatial scale since the spatial resolution of tmpa rt is 0 25 0 25 here we employed an initial moving window with a size of 1 25 1 25 containing 5 5 grids centered on the target pixel in each window the historical data record pairs gauge and tmpa rt greater than the rain no rain discriminant threshold of 1 mm day centered on the gauged pixels were collected and then they were treated as valid data pairs for the cdf matching procedure here 1 mm day was used to determine the rain no rain event as suggested by many previous studies dai 2006 dai et al 2007 tian et al 2007 yong et al 2010 for both the gauge observations and satellite precipitation estimates have large uncertainties for light precipitation tian et al 2009 tang et al 2020 however this initial window size may contain few or even no qualified pixels in gauge sparse regions like in western china especially over the tibetan plateau therefore the criteria for window size selection are adapted as detailed below if the qualified data pairs of gauge data and tmpa rt in the initial window were less than the 20 threshold during the calibration period then the window size is expanded by one pixel centered on the target pixel at a fixed time until the box window contains no less than the threshold of the qualified data pairs after the size of the window in each target pixel is ascertained the qualified data pairs in time series are sorted from smallest to largest by magnitude for cdf matching based on the gauge data and tmpa rt in each window the corrected tmpa rt using the csmw method csmw rt is calculated from the original daily tmpa rt at a given pixel i at 0 25 0 25 resolution as follows 1 p i t cdf g 1 cdf rt p i t where p i t and p i t denote the cdf corrected and original tmpa rt in pixel i at time t respectively cdf g 1 and cdf rt represent the inverse cdf of gauge data and the cdf of tmpa rt in the window centered on the pixel i the flowchart of the bias adjustment is shown in fig 2 the entire study period is divided into two parts the first part is the calibration period 2008 2016 the purpose of this period is to calculate the parameters of csmw using the historical gauge data and original tmpa rt the second part is the validation period 2017 2019 aiming to verify the adjusted tmpa rt by using the csmw model estimated from the calibration period 3 2 evaluation indices to measure the performance of the original tmpa rt and csmw rt we adopted the following three widely used statistical metrics pearson correlation coefficient cc the root mean square error rmse and the relative bias rb the equations of the statistic metrics above are as follows 2 cc i 1 n g i g s i s i 1 n g i g 2 i 1 n s i s 2 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i g i 2 4 rb i 1 n s i g i i 1 n g i where g i refers to the gauge observations s i and s means the satellite precipitation products i e tmpa rt csmw rt and their average respectively n refers to the number of samples 3 3 error decomposition to analyze the error components before and after bias adjustment for tmpa rt an error decomposition strategy proposed by tian et al 2009 was applied in our study the total error can be decomposed into hit bias observed rain was correctly detected by satellite missed precipitation observed rain was not detected by satellite and false precipitation rain was not observed but was detected by satellite here the threshold of 1 mm d was also used to determine the rain no rain event the equations of different error components are as follows 5 e sum p s p g 6 e hit p s h p g h 7 e miss p g m 8 e false p s f 9 e sum e hit e miss e false where e sum e hit e miss and e false represent total bias hit bias missed precipitation and false precipitation respectively h m f are the numbers of hit events missed event and false events respectively p s and p g are the satellite precipitation estimates and gauge observations 4 results 4 1 spatio temporal performance fig 3 shows the daily average precipitation of cgdpa tmpa rt and csmw rt during the calibration period 2008 2016 and validation period 2017 2019 generally the tmpa rt showed notable overestimation as compared to cgdpa over southeast china the tibet plateau tp and the ili river valley in northwest china for both calibration and validation periods compared to tmpa rt csmw rt showed a more similar spatial distribution pattern of daily average precipitation with cgdpa however we noticed that the csmw rt significantly underestimated the daily average precipitation over southern tibet influenced by the warm and wet southwest monsoon from the indian ocean the rainfall in southern tibet is very abundant from the developed algorithm of cgdpa the gridded precipitation of cdgpa over southern tibet is derived from the joint result by the orographically corrected climatology field and station interpolation however there are no rain gauges over this region so the cdf parameters calculated for each pixel in this area were derived from the qualified data pairs surrounding this area mainly derived from the southern part of the tp the rainfall amounts of these surrounding data pairs are much less than that in southern tibet and the cdf approach forced the precipitation in southern tibet to match more closely to the magnitude of its surrounding areas resulting in the considerable underestimation of the csmw rt over this area fig 4 shows the spatial distributions of rb rmse and cc derived from the tmpa rt and csmw rt against cgdpa for both calibration and validation periods to ensure the robustness of the evaluation results hereafter only grid pixels with at least one gauge in cgdpa were chosen to conduct the evaluation generally tmpa rt significantly overestimated the precipitation over southeast china and western china in the warm months against cgdpa especially over the tp fig 4a d as was previously documented in yong et al 2016 on the other hand csmw rt has consistently improved upon tmpa rt for both calibration and validation periods with the apparent lower rb values of csmw rt suggesting the adjusted tmpa rt by the csmw method is closer to cgdpa than the original tmpa rt in addition to the improvement of rb values one can see that the csmw rt showed lower rmse values than tmpa rt fig 4e h in particular the large magnitudes of rmse values for tmpa rt in southeast china were largely reduced after corrected by the csmw method moreover the csmw rt also had an obvious improvement of rmse over the eastern tp where there are relatively fewer rain gauges therefore we concluded that the csmw approach could effectively decrease the rmse values and is still functional for the areas with relatively low density gauge networks the spatial distribution patterns of cc values showed an upward gradient from northwest to southeast for both original and adjusted tmpa rt fig 4i l generally the tmpa rt and csmw rt showed an almost identical spatial distribution of cc values for both calibration and validation periods this issue can be explained by two major reasons first random errors such as missed precipitation and false precipitation may hinder the improvement of the cc through the csmw approach then yang et al 2016 pointed out that the cdf based adjustment only considers the probability distribution of precipitation but neglects the day by day adjustment with simultaneous observation resulting in the inadequacy for reducing the local time dependent random errors therefore the bias adjusting approach proposed in this study might not be able to improve the cc values effectively to evaluate the temporal performance of the bias adjustment we plotted the time series of the rb rmse and cc for tmpa rt and csmw rt against cgdpa during the calibration period fig 5 a c and validation period fig 5d f to more clearly show the trends a 21 day moving average was applied to the entire time series same as skøien et al 2003 ebert et al 2007 and nie et al 2015 it is easy to see that the tmpa rt had noteworthy positive biases during the calibration period fig 5a and validation periods fig 5d as the vast majority of rb values with tmpa rt are above the horizontal axis rb 0 meanwhile csmw rt effectively diminished such overestimation suggesting the systematic positive biases of the original tmpa rt were effectively removed after they were adjusted by the csmw approach for rmse csmw rt has lower rmse values than tmpa rt both for calibration and validation periods fig 5b e more than half of the rmse values had a 10 decrease relative to the tmpa rt we conclude that the improvements of rb and rmse of csmw rt in the spatial distribution are also reflected in the temporal pattern as for the time series of cc values the curves of tmpa rt and csmw rt are almost overlapped fig 5c f the csmw rt outperformed tmpa rt only by a slight margin it suggests that the csmw method may not be able to obtain an effective improvement of cc values across time and this is consistent with its spatial distribution pattern 4 2 intensity distribution the probability density function pdf is widely used to evaluate the quality of satellite precipitation estimates for different classes of rain intensity fig 6 shows the pdfs of the daily precipitation amount fig 6a b and precipitation events fig 6c d for the two satellite precipitation products and cgdpa over mainland china during the calibration and validation periods similar to tian et al 2009 an exponential scale was adopted to bin the rainfall intensities and we used a logarithmic format to scale the x axis for better visualization we found that the significant overestimation of tmpa rt was consistent for all rain intensity classes especially across the range of 8 256 mm day fig 6a b this means that the tmpa rt had a considerable systematic overestimation which is consistent with the above temporal statistical results in fig 5a and d meanwhile the intensity distribution patterns of csmw rt and cgdpa are quite similar csmw rt only had a relatively slight underestimation across the rain rate range of 8 32 mm day and a relatively slight overestimation from 32 to 128 mm day against the cgdpa both for calibration and validation periods thus the systematic overestimation of the tmpa rt is effectively reduced after being corrected through the csmw method from the perspective of rainy events csmw rt and cgdpa have a better agreement of precipitation events across the rainfall range of 8 256 mm day in contrast the tmpa rt yielded more rainy events than cgdpa across the corresponding rain range for both calibration and validation periods fig 6c d this overestimation of rainy events from tmpa rt is consistent with the rainfall amount analyses in fig 6a and b however we noticed that the csmw rt had more rainy events at low rain rates of 8 mm day but this overestimation was not reflected in the rainfall amounts for the relatively low rain intensity compared to cgdpa the small amount of less rainy events across the range of 8 32 mm day and more rainy events across the range of 32 128 mm day of csmw rt were consistent with the underestimation and overestimation of precipitation amounts at its corresponding rain ranges respectively from the performance of precipitation amounts and events from these two real time satellite precipitation products we concluded that the csmw approach mainly played a role in correcting the tmpa rt at the medium high rain rates of 8 mm day although csmw rt yielded more light rain events they have little impact on the overall precipitation amount 4 3 overall metrics of daily mean precipitation fig 7 shows the scatterplots and statistical metrics of the daily average precipitation for tmpa rt and csmw rt versus cgdpa during the calibration period fig 7a b and validation periods fig 7c d in general the scatterplots of the average daily csmw rt are clustered more closely to the 1 1 line than that of tmpa rt and outliers were effectively removed after being corrected by the csmw approach furthermore tmpa rt substantially overestimated precipitation and the csmw rt effectively reduced such positive biases after bias adjustment the rb values decrease from 15 79 16 01 to 0 25 0 29 during calibration validation period the rmse values dropped 64 and 49 for calibration and validation periods in going from tmpa rt to csmw rt respectively moreover compared to the spatial and temporal performance of cc values we noticed that the overall cc value of average daily csmw rt has an obvious improvement relative to the tmpa rt this is because the influence of missed precipitation and false precipitation were homogenized after averaging the daily precipitation during the bias correcting procedure yang et al 2016 furthermore the csmw approach helped to correct the precipitation in the overall magnitude rather than in local time table 1 summarizes the statistical metrics of daily tmpa rt and csmw rt for calibration and validation periods against cgdpa at gauged pixels different from the daily average precipitation used in fig 7 here each daily precipitation record was adopted to calculate the statistical metrics from table 1 the rb values have significant improvement after bias adjustment however the csmw rt had slight negative biases during both calibration and validation periods this is mainly attributed to the underestimation of precipitation amount and events across the rain rate range of 8 32 mm day as for rmse the values dropped 12 for the calibration period and 13 for the validation period after bias adjustment consistent with the spatial distribution pattern and time series analyses the overall cc values of daily precipitation only got a negligible improvement after bias adjustment both for calibration and validation periods 4 4 error component analysis yang et al 2016 pointed out that the missed and false precipitation for satellite precipitation estimates can hardly be corrected by the cdf based method to analyze the impact on the false rainfall and missed rainfall of the tmpa rt following correction by the csmw approach the spatial distributions of error components of the tmpa rt and csmw rt during the calibration and validation periods were plotted in fig 8 the hit bias of csmw rt was consistently improved upon tmpa rt for the calibration period fig 8a b and validation period fig 8c d suggesting the csmw approach is successful in correcting the hit bias and will still be very effective to reduce the hit bias with future tmpa rt estimates however we noticed that the csmw approach was limited in reducing the missed precipitation fig 8e h since the cdf method only corrected the precipitation amounts greater than the rain no rain discriminant threshold of 1 mm day the missed precipitation whose amount is less than the threshold is excluded from cdf matching procedure similar to missed precipitation the amounts of false precipitation won t be less than the threshold of 1 mm day after cdf matching so the csmw approach can only reduce the false precipitation instead of removing it compared to the performance of hit bias the correction of false precipitation was very limited fig 8i l we noticed that the principal reductions of false precipitation occurred in southeast china where the amounts of false rainfall exceeded 8 mm day as for the areas where false precipitation was less than 8 mm day the false precipitation didn t seem to be improved upon after adjustment it further confirms that the csmw approach mainly corrected the tmpa rt at the medium high rain rates of 8 mm day time series of the spatially averaged error components of the tmpa rt and csmw rt for the calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 9 also a 21 day moving average was applied to the entire time series to present the trends more clearly tmpa rt displayed positive hit biases for both calibration and validation periods and the hit bias showed the synchronized variation as with the time series of rb fig 5a d in addition missed events and false events had similar magnitudes of rainfall they almost offset each other when calculating the total bias therefore we inferred that the overestimation of tmpa rt was mainly attributed to its hit bias on the other hand such systematic positive hit biases of tmpa rt were significantly diminished after being corrected by the csmw method however the temporal performance of missed precipitation was not improved after the adjustment the spatially averaged amounts of false rainfall were almost less than 8 mm day so the csmw approach was limited in reducing the false precipitation as shown in fig 9 the false precipitation of csmw rt did have a reduction but this improvement was relatively weak compared to that of hit bias therefore from the spatial and temporal performances of error components we conclude that the csmw method mainly focused on correcting the hit bias but rarely corrected the false precipitation and failed to correct the missed precipitation 5 discussions 5 1 difference between the csmw approach and traditional cdf matching method it is necessary to compare the csmw method and conventional cdf matching algorithms to show the difference between these bias adjusting approaches in this study we further conduct the bias adjustment based on the cdf approach for different climate regions over mainland china according to the long historical record of precipitation mainland china is separated into four climatic regions the humid region precipitation 800 mm yr the semi humid region 400 800 mm yr the semi arid 200 400 mm yr and the arid region 200 mm yr the cdf was derived from the historical data pairs within each climate region and then the empirical cdf was used to correct the future tmpa rt over each climate region hereafter referred to as cdf rt the difference between this cdf method and the csmw approach is that each pixel in csmw has a variable spatial domain while many pixels in a given climate region are grouped together in the conventional cdf method fig 10 shows four different climate regions and the spatial distributions of three statistical metrics of tmpa rt cdf rt csmw rt against cgdpa for the validation period both cdf rt and csmw rt had lower rb values and rmse values than tmpa rt over mainland china especially in eastern china it means the cdf based matching approach is a practical way to reduce the bias of satellite precipitation estimates however csmw rt and cdf rt still didn t show significant improvements in cc compared to tmpa rt with respect to the intercomparison between csmw rt and cdf rt cmsw rt outperformed cdf rt in eastern china with a small margin cdf rt exhibited more negative rb values and slightly higher rmse values relative to csmw rt in eastern china in addition csmw rt had a significant improvement in western china relative to cdf rt especially in the eastern part of the tp table 2 summarizes the error metrics of these three satellite precipitation products against cgdpa for the validation period csmw rt and cdf rt had significant improvement of rb and rmse values compared to tmpa rt over all climate regions moreover csmw rt had better performance than cdf rt and the advantage of csmw rt was more pronounced in semi arid and arid regions the density of the gauge network is sparse over semi arid and arid regions and csmw rt took advantage of the surrounding gauge data to correct the tmpa rt estimates while the gauge data applied in cdf rt was more distant furthermore the cc values of csmw rt were higher than tmpa rt while cdf rt didn t realize any improvement generally csmw rt slightly outperformed cdf rt in humid and semi humid regions where there are more rain gauges the improvement of csmw rt was significant relative to cdf rt over semi arid and arid regions especially in western china from the results of the bias adjustment for the validation period one can conclude that both csmw and the traditional cdf matching methods are effective ways to reduce the errors of tmpa rt and the csmw improved upon the traditional cdf method in areas with low gauge densities 5 2 csmw approach with different lengths and pairs of training data to verify the robustness of the csmw method with different lengths of training data seven different calibration periods 3 9 yr were tested to derive the empirical satellite gauge relationships based on csmw then used to adjust tmpa rt for the validation period table 3 shows the statistics of csmw rt for the validation period with the different training period lengths in general csmw rt had a significant improvement relative to tmpa rt under all training period lengths all the metrics reveal little sensitivity to the different training period lengths especially for rmse and cc values it seems that a longer length of training only resulted in a lower rb with csmw rt while the rmse and cc didn t realize the improved performance with training period length with the extension of training time the training samples were more abundant and complete that covered the precipitation information over many years so the csmw approach is more effective in correcting the future satellite precipitation estimates in real time rb is the average result offset by opposing signs and the csmw method worked to correct the overall biases meanwhile the rmse and cc are sensitive to random errors and such random errors were hard to reduce using the csmw method generally the csmw is a robust bias adjustment approach for csmw rt as it presented consistent improvement with the different lengths of the training periods from fig 1 most of the gauge stations are located in eastern china each window centered on the target pixel in eastern china is prone to gather a sufficient number of historical data pairs to conduct the csmw based adjustments to tmpa rt however the gauge network over western china is quite sparse and the majority of grid pixels did not have a sufficient number of data pairs to establish the satellite gauge relationship using the csmw approach therefore thresholds of historical data pairs were tested to meet the requirement of sufficient number of data pairs for the csmw method the adaptive thresholds of historical data pairs didn t make much difference in eastern china because most data pairs of the window centered on the target pixels exceed the thresholds to analyze the impact of different thresholds of historical data pairs on the adjustments different thresholds of data pairs 5 10 20 30 50 of the number of the calibration days were employed to train the csmw model since the thresholds were mainly tested for the adjustment in western china the statistical metrics of csmw rt with different thresholds of training data pairs for the validation period were calculated separately in western and eastern china the metrics for tmpa rt and cdf rt were also included to conduct the comparison see table 4 both csmw rt and cdf rt had lower rb and rmse values than tmpa rt in eastern china during the validation period and the metrics of cdf rt and csmw rt were quite close to each other furthermore the metrics of csmw rt with different training thresholds were almost unchanged in eastern china suggesting both csmw and the traditional cdf matching method are practical ways to reduce biases over areas with dense gauge networks as for the adjustments in western china csmw rt with different training thresholds had significant improvement compared to cdf rt and both of them outperformed tmpa rt this is consistent with the aforementioned results that the csmw approach was superior to the traditional cdf method in areas with low gauge densities additionally the rb and rmse values of csmw rt had variations with different training thresholds but these were relatively slight therefore we inferred that although the different thresholds of training data pairs led to different adjustments in western china using the csmw approach the csmw approach still had robust performance in western china and a significant improvement relative to the traditional cdf approach however the cc values of cdf rt and csmw rt with different training thresholds didn t realize a substantial improvement in western or eastern china this a weakness of the cdf based bias correction method 5 3 future prospects for reducing the random errors and improving the cc the quantile mapping approach tends to force real time satellite precipitation estimates to match the gauge data according to their corresponding cumulative probability rather than to match the simultaneous gauge data the bias adjusting approach proposed in this study is essentially a kind of climatology based adjustment like the climatological calibration algorithm cca proposed by huffman et al 2007 yong et al 2015 compared two types of tmpa rt rt uc and rt c rt uc and rt c are the tmpa rt before and after being calibrated by cca the results showed that the cc values only have a slight improvement after cca adjustment so a climatology based bias adjustment is limited in significantly improving instantaneous discrepancies between satellite precipitation estimates and gauge observations furthermore the random errors caused by missed precipitation and false precipitation are difficult to reduce however we believe there may be two ways to effectively reduce the random errors and would further improve the cc values with real time satellite precipitation estimates one way is to merge the satellite precipitation estimates with simultaneous ground observations and or environmental variables related to precipitation another is to improve the retrieval algorithm for real time precipitation estimates the latter is the more effective but also challenging way to reduce the random errors of satellite precipitation estimates overall both these approaches should be considered in future efforts 6 conclusions in this study a bias adjustment approach named csmw was developed to correct satellite precipitation estimates in real time the core of this approach is to use the csmw to establish the relationship between satellite retrievals and gauge observations based on their historical characteristics future real time satellite precipitation estimates can be adjusted using the prior empirical satellite gauge relationships although the current bias adjustment approach still has room for improvement we believe that it will substantially benefit the mainstream retrieval system e g imerg or gsmap to produce more reliable and accurate real time satellite precipitation estimates for data users in the gpm era the major conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 the spatio temporal comparisons between the original tmpa rt and corrected csmw rt show that tmpa rt generally overestimates daily precipitation over mainland china compared to the ground reference the rb values decreased from 15 79 16 01 with tmpa rt to 0 25 0 29 of csmw rt during the calibration validation period indicating that the csmw approach can significantly reduce the systematic positive biases of tmpa rt estimates moreover the rmse values also had remarkable reductions after correction with a 12 drop and a 13 drop during the calibration and validation periods respectively this implies that csmw may be an effective approach to correct the real time satellite precipitation estimates in practice 2 in terms of error components tmpa rt exhibited apparent positive hit biases during both calibration and validation periods and this systematic overestimation was effectively diminished after the adjustments using the csmw algorithm however csmw seems unable to correct the missed precipitation because these events are generally excluded from the considered rain rates used in the matching procedure of csmw additionally false precipitation did have a slightreduction but not nearly as much as the hit bias as for the intensity distribution of precipitation amount and events the csmw method made a major contribution to improve the tmpa rt estimates at the medium high rain rates 8 mm day meanwhile a majority of the rainfall rates associated with false precipitation is less than 8 mm day thus it can be concluded that the csmw approach was ineffective in reducing the error and bias with false precipitation events 3 our evaluation suggests that the proposed csmw model which is a refinement of the conventional cdf matching method is effective in correcting the overall biases rather than reducing the random errors for a specific time in other words the csmw approach tends to force the tmpa rt to match the gauge data according to their corresponding cumulative probability rather than to match the simultaneous gauge data this limitation of quantile mapping is clearly reflected in the meager improvement of correlation coefficients considering both spatial distribution and time series in future studies there is still much room to improve the csmw approach to meet the requirement of increasing the correlation between satellite estimates and ground observations 4 each pixel in the csmw approach has a viable spatial domain over areas with sparse gauge densities the csmw approach took advantage of the surrounding gauge data to correct tmpa rt while the gauge data applied in the traditional cdf method was found to be unrepresentative therefore we concluded the cmsw is more effective than the traditional cdf method over sparse gauge areas the results confirmed that the improvement of csmw rt is significant relative to cdf rt over semi arid and arid regions especially in western china credit authorship contribution statement zhehui shen

4722,an improved cumulative distribution function cdf based approach to reduce the systematic biases of multi satellite precipitation estimates in real time is proposed and verified over mainland china efforts are primarily focused on establishing the bias adjusting model by adopting the cdf based on a self adaptive moving window csmw which systematically integrates the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa into the real time trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa rt in our modelling experiments the first 9 yr 2008 2016 precipitation data pairs were used to calibrate the csmw model and establish a satellite gauge relationship which was then applied to the last 3 years of 2017 2019 as validation assessment results during the independent validation period show that the csmw approach can significantly reduce the systematic positive bias of original tmpa rt precipitation estimates in that the relative bias rb during the validation period decreases from 16 01 before adjustments to 0 29 and the root mean square error rmse also has a dramatic drop of 13 the error component analysis indicates that the substantial improvement is mainly manifested in the hit events observed rain was correctly detected by satellite but it failed to reduce the miss bias observed rain was not detected by satellite this arises because a majority of missed precipitation is drizzle and falls below the rain no rain discriminant threshold which is normally excluded from the csmw algorithm additionally the csmw approach seems to have significantly improved the tmpa rt estimates at the medium high rain rates 8 mm day but it also has a limitation in enhancing the correlation coefficient between satellite retrievals and ground observations the major advantage of this approach is its applicability when real time gauge data are not available which could further facilitate the expansion of satellite based precipitation estimates for real time natural hazards

climate system and earth s ecosystem allen and ingram 2002 michaelides et al 2009 reliable and accurate measurement of precipitation is crucial not only for the understanding of climate change but also for water sources management and hydrological prediction larson and peck 1974 lin and wang 2011 yilmaz et al 2005 traditionally rain gauges measuring precipitation at a point are considered as the most accurate however their small spatial coverage limits the adequacy in representing the high spatial variability of precipitation and even dense gauge networks have significant uncertainties in providing accurate estimates of areal rainfall huff 1970 buytaert et al 2006 with the development of advanced infrared ir and passive microwave pmw instruments satellite based remote sensing has become a popular alternative for measuring rainfall and it can provide spatially continuous and temporally complete precipitation on a global scale xie et al 2003 boushaki et al 2009 vila et al 2010 sun et al 2018 a range of algorithms and products for global satellite precipitation estimation have been rapidly developed by two important scientific programs i e tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and its successor global precipitation measurement gpm mission during the past three decades among them several representative mainstream products include the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 hong et al 2004 the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 and integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2014 despite these community developments satellite derived precipitation estimates are subject to considerable errors aghakouchak et al 2011 chen et al 2013 yong et al 2015 due to the inherently indirect nature of remote sensing retrievals tian et al 2010 tang et al 2015 sadeghi et al 2019 this limitation can propagate into larger uncertainties in hydrologic modelling and limit the applications for near real time flood forecasting typhoon warning or landslide monitoring many efforts have been devoted to correct the satellite based precipitation estimates by integrating ground based gauge observations for instance tian et al 2010 proposed a statistical approach based on the bayesian logic model to effectively reduce the biases of two real time satellite precipitation products tmpa rt and cmorph by integrating a gauge analysis dataset i e the cpc unified analysis xie and xiong 2011 constructed a satellite gauge merged precipitation dataset using a probability density function optimal interpolation pdf oi nie et al 2015 nie et al 2016 reduced the precipitation biases of cmorph and national centers for environmental prediction ncep numerical simulations by blending them with the chinese high resolution gauge network through cumulative probability function optimal interpolation cdf oi several other studies also employed the cdf method to adjust the satellite precipitation estimates in real time at some specific basins zhang and tang 2015 climate regions katiraie boroujerdy et al 2020 or fixed windows yang et al 2016 2017 in summary the above studies demonstrate that the approach of cdf matching is a practical way to reduce the error and bias of satellite precipitation estimates in real time on the basis of these previous works here we propose a new bias adjustment approach which applies the gamma distribution cdf matching procedure based on self adapting moving window hereafter referred to as csmw to real time tmpa estimates different from the aforementioned studies that normally used the fixed target areas to calculate the key parameters in the cdf based adjustments the new proposed csmw approach comprehensively considers the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation and estimates the algorithmic parameters for different target regions using a moving window with variable sizes moreover this scheme is also entirely self adapting in that it can adjust itself according to different training data pairs additionally this real time bias adjustment mainly depends on the rainfall characteristics of historical gauge data and the real time rain rates of satellite retrievals suggesting that it does not need the timely availability of gauge observations in the correction algorithm this will further advance the real time applications of satellite precipitation estimates for hydrometeorological forecasting and natural hazard warning 2 datasets considering both the impact of solid precipitation and snow ice cover during the cool season on gauge observations and the strong dependence of cswm algorithm on the assumed accuracy of the gauges we selected those warm season months from may through september from 2008 to 2019 to execute the bias adjustment and verify the cswm approach in this study since a relative long calibration period is needed to establish the satellite gauge relationship the widely used tmpa rt with long time series was selected here to conduct the adjustment in csmw approach the first 9 yr 2008 2016 historical precipitation records of tmpa rt and rain gauges covering mainland china were used to establish a satellite gauge relationship for the csmw model the last 3 years from 2017 to 2019 were taken as an independent validation period for assessing the applicability of csmw approach in real time estimation 2 1 ground reference the gridded china gauge based daily precipitation analysis v1 0 cgdpa developed by china meteorological administration cma was taken as the ground reference available at http data cma cn this dataset has a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a time step of 1 day and was derived from 2400 rainfall gauges over mainland china by using climatology based optimal interpolation oi proposed by xie et al 2007 first a daily climatology was computed by interpolating station data through the algorithm of shepard 1968 this daily climatology was then adjusted through the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism monthly precipitation climatology to consider orographic effects next the gridded ratio of daily observed precipitation to the daily climatology was created by interpolating the corresponding station values based on the optimal interpolation oi finally cgdpa is calculated by multiplying the daily climatology with the ratio the cgdpa goes through a series of strict quality control procedures including extreme value check internal consistency check and spatial consistency check shen et al 2010 and cgdpa was demonstrated as a reliable precipitation product over mainland china shen and xiong 2016 fig 1 shows the number of gauge stations in each 0 25 grid box of cgdpa over mainland china the gauge stations are distributed unevenly across mainland china with approximately 80 of them located in eastern china and the minority in western china 2 2 satellite precipitation estimates trmm which was led by the u s national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japanese aerospace exploration agency jaxa is the first mission for global precipitation detection based on satellite the trmm near real time precipitation product tmpa 3b42rt tmpa rt developed by nasa is available at a 3 hourly temporal frequency and a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 quasi globally 50 s 50 n with about 8 h of latency after the observation time huffman et al 2007 tmpa rt takes advantage of the most recent passive microwave pmw satellite sensors to derive the precipitation estimates the infrared ir precipitation estimates calibrated by pmw estimates are used to fill the pmw coverage gaps to obtain the daily tmpa rt product the 3 hourly precipitation estimates of a specific day are accumulated tan and santo 2018 3 methods 3 1 bias adjusting procedure yu et al 2013 and shen et al 2014 proposed a bias adjusting strategy using a pdf matching method to correct the cmorph based on automatic weather stations awss over mainland china in both studies the pdf method is employed to establish the satellite gauge rainfall relationship within a spatial domain centered on the target grid while the spatial scale is 10 in the former and 4 in the latter they focused on correcting the satellite precipitation estimates by using the synchronous gauge data and not for adjusting the future satellite precipitation estimates in real time without the timely availability of gauge observations the cdf pdf matching method in the present study has been developed to reduce the errors and bias for satellite precipitation estimates in real time nie et al 2008 pointed out that the spatial scale of gauge precipitation in different regions of china is on the order of 100 km it means that the spatial autocorrelation of precipitation is highest on the order of 100 km over mainland china and precipitation showed homogeneity at this spatial scale since the spatial resolution of tmpa rt is 0 25 0 25 here we employed an initial moving window with a size of 1 25 1 25 containing 5 5 grids centered on the target pixel in each window the historical data record pairs gauge and tmpa rt greater than the rain no rain discriminant threshold of 1 mm day centered on the gauged pixels were collected and then they were treated as valid data pairs for the cdf matching procedure here 1 mm day was used to determine the rain no rain event as suggested by many previous studies dai 2006 dai et al 2007 tian et al 2007 yong et al 2010 for both the gauge observations and satellite precipitation estimates have large uncertainties for light precipitation tian et al 2009 tang et al 2020 however this initial window size may contain few or even no qualified pixels in gauge sparse regions like in western china especially over the tibetan plateau therefore the criteria for window size selection are adapted as detailed below if the qualified data pairs of gauge data and tmpa rt in the initial window were less than the 20 threshold during the calibration period then the window size is expanded by one pixel centered on the target pixel at a fixed time until the box window contains no less than the threshold of the qualified data pairs after the size of the window in each target pixel is ascertained the qualified data pairs in time series are sorted from smallest to largest by magnitude for cdf matching based on the gauge data and tmpa rt in each window the corrected tmpa rt using the csmw method csmw rt is calculated from the original daily tmpa rt at a given pixel i at 0 25 0 25 resolution as follows 1 p i t cdf g 1 cdf rt p i t where p i t and p i t denote the cdf corrected and original tmpa rt in pixel i at time t respectively cdf g 1 and cdf rt represent the inverse cdf of gauge data and the cdf of tmpa rt in the window centered on the pixel i the flowchart of the bias adjustment is shown in fig 2 the entire study period is divided into two parts the first part is the calibration period 2008 2016 the purpose of this period is to calculate the parameters of csmw using the historical gauge data and original tmpa rt the second part is the validation period 2017 2019 aiming to verify the adjusted tmpa rt by using the csmw model estimated from the calibration period 3 2 evaluation indices to measure the performance of the original tmpa rt and csmw rt we adopted the following three widely used statistical metrics pearson correlation coefficient cc the root mean square error rmse and the relative bias rb the equations of the statistic metrics above are as follows 2 cc i 1 n g i g s i s i 1 n g i g 2 i 1 n s i s 2 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i g i 2 4 rb i 1 n s i g i i 1 n g i where g i refers to the gauge observations s i and s means the satellite precipitation products i e tmpa rt csmw rt and their average respectively n refers to the number of samples 3 3 error decomposition to analyze the error components before and after bias adjustment for tmpa rt an error decomposition strategy proposed by tian et al 2009 was applied in our study the total error can be decomposed into hit bias observed rain was correctly detected by satellite missed precipitation observed rain was not detected by satellite and false precipitation rain was not observed but was detected by satellite here the threshold of 1 mm d was also used to determine the rain no rain event the equations of different error components are as follows 5 e sum p s p g 6 e hit p s h p g h 7 e miss p g m 8 e false p s f 9 e sum e hit e miss e false where e sum e hit e miss and e false represent total bias hit bias missed precipitation and false precipitation respectively h m f are the numbers of hit events missed event and false events respectively p s and p g are the satellite precipitation estimates and gauge observations 4 results 4 1 spatio temporal performance fig 3 shows the daily average precipitation of cgdpa tmpa rt and csmw rt during the calibration period 2008 2016 and validation period 2017 2019 generally the tmpa rt showed notable overestimation as compared to cgdpa over southeast china the tibet plateau tp and the ili river valley in northwest china for both calibration and validation periods compared to tmpa rt csmw rt showed a more similar spatial distribution pattern of daily average precipitation with cgdpa however we noticed that the csmw rt significantly underestimated the daily average precipitation over southern tibet influenced by the warm and wet southwest monsoon from the indian ocean the rainfall in southern tibet is very abundant from the developed algorithm of cgdpa the gridded precipitation of cdgpa over southern tibet is derived from the joint result by the orographically corrected climatology field and station interpolation however there are no rain gauges over this region so the cdf parameters calculated for each pixel in this area were derived from the qualified data pairs surrounding this area mainly derived from the southern part of the tp the rainfall amounts of these surrounding data pairs are much less than that in southern tibet and the cdf approach forced the precipitation in southern tibet to match more closely to the magnitude of its surrounding areas resulting in the considerable underestimation of the csmw rt over this area fig 4 shows the spatial distributions of rb rmse and cc derived from the tmpa rt and csmw rt against cgdpa for both calibration and validation periods to ensure the robustness of the evaluation results hereafter only grid pixels with at least one gauge in cgdpa were chosen to conduct the evaluation generally tmpa rt significantly overestimated the precipitation over southeast china and western china in the warm months against cgdpa especially over the tp fig 4a d as was previously documented in yong et al 2016 on the other hand csmw rt has consistently improved upon tmpa rt for both calibration and validation periods with the apparent lower rb values of csmw rt suggesting the adjusted tmpa rt by the csmw method is closer to cgdpa than the original tmpa rt in addition to the improvement of rb values one can see that the csmw rt showed lower rmse values than tmpa rt fig 4e h in particular the large magnitudes of rmse values for tmpa rt in southeast china were largely reduced after corrected by the csmw method moreover the csmw rt also had an obvious improvement of rmse over the eastern tp where there are relatively fewer rain gauges therefore we concluded that the csmw approach could effectively decrease the rmse values and is still functional for the areas with relatively low density gauge networks the spatial distribution patterns of cc values showed an upward gradient from northwest to southeast for both original and adjusted tmpa rt fig 4i l generally the tmpa rt and csmw rt showed an almost identical spatial distribution of cc values for both calibration and validation periods this issue can be explained by two major reasons first random errors such as missed precipitation and false precipitation may hinder the improvement of the cc through the csmw approach then yang et al 2016 pointed out that the cdf based adjustment only considers the probability distribution of precipitation but neglects the day by day adjustment with simultaneous observation resulting in the inadequacy for reducing the local time dependent random errors therefore the bias adjusting approach proposed in this study might not be able to improve the cc values effectively to evaluate the temporal performance of the bias adjustment we plotted the time series of the rb rmse and cc for tmpa rt and csmw rt against cgdpa during the calibration period fig 5 a c and validation period fig 5d f to more clearly show the trends a 21 day moving average was applied to the entire time series same as skøien et al 2003 ebert et al 2007 and nie et al 2015 it is easy to see that the tmpa rt had noteworthy positive biases during the calibration period fig 5a and validation periods fig 5d as the vast majority of rb values with tmpa rt are above the horizontal axis rb 0 meanwhile csmw rt effectively diminished such overestimation suggesting the systematic positive biases of the original tmpa rt were effectively removed after they were adjusted by the csmw approach for rmse csmw rt has lower rmse values than tmpa rt both for calibration and validation periods fig 5b e more than half of the rmse values had a 10 decrease relative to the tmpa rt we conclude that the improvements of rb and rmse of csmw rt in the spatial distribution are also reflected in the temporal pattern as for the time series of cc values the curves of tmpa rt and csmw rt are almost overlapped fig 5c f the csmw rt outperformed tmpa rt only by a slight margin it suggests that the csmw method may not be able to obtain an effective improvement of cc values across time and this is consistent with its spatial distribution pattern 4 2 intensity distribution the probability density function pdf is widely used to evaluate the quality of satellite precipitation estimates for different classes of rain intensity fig 6 shows the pdfs of the daily precipitation amount fig 6a b and precipitation events fig 6c d for the two satellite precipitation products and cgdpa over mainland china during the calibration and validation periods similar to tian et al 2009 an exponential scale was adopted to bin the rainfall intensities and we used a logarithmic format to scale the x axis for better visualization we found that the significant overestimation of tmpa rt was consistent for all rain intensity classes especially across the range of 8 256 mm day fig 6a b this means that the tmpa rt had a considerable systematic overestimation which is consistent with the above temporal statistical results in fig 5a and d meanwhile the intensity distribution patterns of csmw rt and cgdpa are quite similar csmw rt only had a relatively slight underestimation across the rain rate range of 8 32 mm day and a relatively slight overestimation from 32 to 128 mm day against the cgdpa both for calibration and validation periods thus the systematic overestimation of the tmpa rt is effectively reduced after being corrected through the csmw method from the perspective of rainy events csmw rt and cgdpa have a better agreement of precipitation events across the rainfall range of 8 256 mm day in contrast the tmpa rt yielded more rainy events than cgdpa across the corresponding rain range for both calibration and validation periods fig 6c d this overestimation of rainy events from tmpa rt is consistent with the rainfall amount analyses in fig 6a and b however we noticed that the csmw rt had more rainy events at low rain rates of 8 mm day but this overestimation was not reflected in the rainfall amounts for the relatively low rain intensity compared to cgdpa the small amount of less rainy events across the range of 8 32 mm day and more rainy events across the range of 32 128 mm day of csmw rt were consistent with the underestimation and overestimation of precipitation amounts at its corresponding rain ranges respectively from the performance of precipitation amounts and events from these two real time satellite precipitation products we concluded that the csmw approach mainly played a role in correcting the tmpa rt at the medium high rain rates of 8 mm day although csmw rt yielded more light rain events they have little impact on the overall precipitation amount 4 3 overall metrics of daily mean precipitation fig 7 shows the scatterplots and statistical metrics of the daily average precipitation for tmpa rt and csmw rt versus cgdpa during the calibration period fig 7a b and validation periods fig 7c d in general the scatterplots of the average daily csmw rt are clustered more closely to the 1 1 line than that of tmpa rt and outliers were effectively removed after being corrected by the csmw approach furthermore tmpa rt substantially overestimated precipitation and the csmw rt effectively reduced such positive biases after bias adjustment the rb values decrease from 15 79 16 01 to 0 25 0 29 during calibration validation period the rmse values dropped 64 and 49 for calibration and validation periods in going from tmpa rt to csmw rt respectively moreover compared to the spatial and temporal performance of cc values we noticed that the overall cc value of average daily csmw rt has an obvious improvement relative to the tmpa rt this is because the influence of missed precipitation and false precipitation were homogenized after averaging the daily precipitation during the bias correcting procedure yang et al 2016 furthermore the csmw approach helped to correct the precipitation in the overall magnitude rather than in local time table 1 summarizes the statistical metrics of daily tmpa rt and csmw rt for calibration and validation periods against cgdpa at gauged pixels different from the daily average precipitation used in fig 7 here each daily precipitation record was adopted to calculate the statistical metrics from table 1 the rb values have significant improvement after bias adjustment however the csmw rt had slight negative biases during both calibration and validation periods this is mainly attributed to the underestimation of precipitation amount and events across the rain rate range of 8 32 mm day as for rmse the values dropped 12 for the calibration period and 13 for the validation period after bias adjustment consistent with the spatial distribution pattern and time series analyses the overall cc values of daily precipitation only got a negligible improvement after bias adjustment both for calibration and validation periods 4 4 error component analysis yang et al 2016 pointed out that the missed and false precipitation for satellite precipitation estimates can hardly be corrected by the cdf based method to analyze the impact on the false rainfall and missed rainfall of the tmpa rt following correction by the csmw approach the spatial distributions of error components of the tmpa rt and csmw rt during the calibration and validation periods were plotted in fig 8 the hit bias of csmw rt was consistently improved upon tmpa rt for the calibration period fig 8a b and validation period fig 8c d suggesting the csmw approach is successful in correcting the hit bias and will still be very effective to reduce the hit bias with future tmpa rt estimates however we noticed that the csmw approach was limited in reducing the missed precipitation fig 8e h since the cdf method only corrected the precipitation amounts greater than the rain no rain discriminant threshold of 1 mm day the missed precipitation whose amount is less than the threshold is excluded from cdf matching procedure similar to missed precipitation the amounts of false precipitation won t be less than the threshold of 1 mm day after cdf matching so the csmw approach can only reduce the false precipitation instead of removing it compared to the performance of hit bias the correction of false precipitation was very limited fig 8i l we noticed that the principal reductions of false precipitation occurred in southeast china where the amounts of false rainfall exceeded 8 mm day as for the areas where false precipitation was less than 8 mm day the false precipitation didn t seem to be improved upon after adjustment it further confirms that the csmw approach mainly corrected the tmpa rt at the medium high rain rates of 8 mm day time series of the spatially averaged error components of the tmpa rt and csmw rt for the calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 9 also a 21 day moving average was applied to the entire time series to present the trends more clearly tmpa rt displayed positive hit biases for both calibration and validation periods and the hit bias showed the synchronized variation as with the time series of rb fig 5a d in addition missed events and false events had similar magnitudes of rainfall they almost offset each other when calculating the total bias therefore we inferred that the overestimation of tmpa rt was mainly attributed to its hit bias on the other hand such systematic positive hit biases of tmpa rt were significantly diminished after being corrected by the csmw method however the temporal performance of missed precipitation was not improved after the adjustment the spatially averaged amounts of false rainfall were almost less than 8 mm day so the csmw approach was limited in reducing the false precipitation as shown in fig 9 the false precipitation of csmw rt did have a reduction but this improvement was relatively weak compared to that of hit bias therefore from the spatial and temporal performances of error components we conclude that the csmw method mainly focused on correcting the hit bias but rarely corrected the false precipitation and failed to correct the missed precipitation 5 discussions 5 1 difference between the csmw approach and traditional cdf matching method it is necessary to compare the csmw method and conventional cdf matching algorithms to show the difference between these bias adjusting approaches in this study we further conduct the bias adjustment based on the cdf approach for different climate regions over mainland china according to the long historical record of precipitation mainland china is separated into four climatic regions the humid region precipitation 800 mm yr the semi humid region 400 800 mm yr the semi arid 200 400 mm yr and the arid region 200 mm yr the cdf was derived from the historical data pairs within each climate region and then the empirical cdf was used to correct the future tmpa rt over each climate region hereafter referred to as cdf rt the difference between this cdf method and the csmw approach is that each pixel in csmw has a variable spatial domain while many pixels in a given climate region are grouped together in the conventional cdf method fig 10 shows four different climate regions and the spatial distributions of three statistical metrics of tmpa rt cdf rt csmw rt against cgdpa for the validation period both cdf rt and csmw rt had lower rb values and rmse values than tmpa rt over mainland china especially in eastern china it means the cdf based matching approach is a practical way to reduce the bias of satellite precipitation estimates however csmw rt and cdf rt still didn t show significant improvements in cc compared to tmpa rt with respect to the intercomparison between csmw rt and cdf rt cmsw rt outperformed cdf rt in eastern china with a small margin cdf rt exhibited more negative rb values and slightly higher rmse values relative to csmw rt in eastern china in addition csmw rt had a significant improvement in western china relative to cdf rt especially in the eastern part of the tp table 2 summarizes the error metrics of these three satellite precipitation products against cgdpa for the validation period csmw rt and cdf rt had significant improvement of rb and rmse values compared to tmpa rt over all climate regions moreover csmw rt had better performance than cdf rt and the advantage of csmw rt was more pronounced in semi arid and arid regions the density of the gauge network is sparse over semi arid and arid regions and csmw rt took advantage of the surrounding gauge data to correct the tmpa rt estimates while the gauge data applied in cdf rt was more distant furthermore the cc values of csmw rt were higher than tmpa rt while cdf rt didn t realize any improvement generally csmw rt slightly outperformed cdf rt in humid and semi humid regions where there are more rain gauges the improvement of csmw rt was significant relative to cdf rt over semi arid and arid regions especially in western china from the results of the bias adjustment for the validation period one can conclude that both csmw and the traditional cdf matching methods are effective ways to reduce the errors of tmpa rt and the csmw improved upon the traditional cdf method in areas with low gauge densities 5 2 csmw approach with different lengths and pairs of training data to verify the robustness of the csmw method with different lengths of training data seven different calibration periods 3 9 yr were tested to derive the empirical satellite gauge relationships based on csmw then used to adjust tmpa rt for the validation period table 3 shows the statistics of csmw rt for the validation period with the different training period lengths in general csmw rt had a significant improvement relative to tmpa rt under all training period lengths all the metrics reveal little sensitivity to the different training period lengths especially for rmse and cc values it seems that a longer length of training only resulted in a lower rb with csmw rt while the rmse and cc didn t realize the improved performance with training period length with the extension of training time the training samples were more abundant and complete that covered the precipitation information over many years so the csmw approach is more effective in correcting the future satellite precipitation estimates in real time rb is the average result offset by opposing signs and the csmw method worked to correct the overall biases meanwhile the rmse and cc are sensitive to random errors and such random errors were hard to reduce using the csmw method generally the csmw is a robust bias adjustment approach for csmw rt as it presented consistent improvement with the different lengths of the training periods from fig 1 most of the gauge stations are located in eastern china each window centered on the target pixel in eastern china is prone to gather a sufficient number of historical data pairs to conduct the csmw based adjustments to tmpa rt however the gauge network over western china is quite sparse and the majority of grid pixels did not have a sufficient number of data pairs to establish the satellite gauge relationship using the csmw approach therefore thresholds of historical data pairs were tested to meet the requirement of sufficient number of data pairs for the csmw method the adaptive thresholds of historical data pairs didn t make much difference in eastern china because most data pairs of the window centered on the target pixels exceed the thresholds to analyze the impact of different thresholds of historical data pairs on the adjustments different thresholds of data pairs 5 10 20 30 50 of the number of the calibration days were employed to train the csmw model since the thresholds were mainly tested for the adjustment in western china the statistical metrics of csmw rt with different thresholds of training data pairs for the validation period were calculated separately in western and eastern china the metrics for tmpa rt and cdf rt were also included to conduct the comparison see table 4 both csmw rt and cdf rt had lower rb and rmse values than tmpa rt in eastern china during the validation period and the metrics of cdf rt and csmw rt were quite close to each other furthermore the metrics of csmw rt with different training thresholds were almost unchanged in eastern china suggesting both csmw and the traditional cdf matching method are practical ways to reduce biases over areas with dense gauge networks as for the adjustments in western china csmw rt with different training thresholds had significant improvement compared to cdf rt and both of them outperformed tmpa rt this is consistent with the aforementioned results that the csmw approach was superior to the traditional cdf method in areas with low gauge densities additionally the rb and rmse values of csmw rt had variations with different training thresholds but these were relatively slight therefore we inferred that although the different thresholds of training data pairs led to different adjustments in western china using the csmw approach the csmw approach still had robust performance in western china and a significant improvement relative to the traditional cdf approach however the cc values of cdf rt and csmw rt with different training thresholds didn t realize a substantial improvement in western or eastern china this a weakness of the cdf based bias correction method 5 3 future prospects for reducing the random errors and improving the cc the quantile mapping approach tends to force real time satellite precipitation estimates to match the gauge data according to their corresponding cumulative probability rather than to match the simultaneous gauge data the bias adjusting approach proposed in this study is essentially a kind of climatology based adjustment like the climatological calibration algorithm cca proposed by huffman et al 2007 yong et al 2015 compared two types of tmpa rt rt uc and rt c rt uc and rt c are the tmpa rt before and after being calibrated by cca the results showed that the cc values only have a slight improvement after cca adjustment so a climatology based bias adjustment is limited in significantly improving instantaneous discrepancies between satellite precipitation estimates and gauge observations furthermore the random errors caused by missed precipitation and false precipitation are difficult to reduce however we believe there may be two ways to effectively reduce the random errors and would further improve the cc values with real time satellite precipitation estimates one way is to merge the satellite precipitation estimates with simultaneous ground observations and or environmental variables related to precipitation another is to improve the retrieval algorithm for real time precipitation estimates the latter is the more effective but also challenging way to reduce the random errors of satellite precipitation estimates overall both these approaches should be considered in future efforts 6 conclusions in this study a bias adjustment approach named csmw was developed to correct satellite precipitation estimates in real time the core of this approach is to use the csmw to establish the relationship between satellite retrievals and gauge observations based on their historical characteristics future real time satellite precipitation estimates can be adjusted using the prior empirical satellite gauge relationships although the current bias adjustment approach still has room for improvement we believe that it will substantially benefit the mainstream retrieval system e g imerg or gsmap to produce more reliable and accurate real time satellite precipitation estimates for data users in the gpm era the major conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 the spatio temporal comparisons between the original tmpa rt and corrected csmw rt show that tmpa rt generally overestimates daily precipitation over mainland china compared to the ground reference the rb values decreased from 15 79 16 01 with tmpa rt to 0 25 0 29 of csmw rt during the calibration validation period indicating that the csmw approach can significantly reduce the systematic positive biases of tmpa rt estimates moreover the rmse values also had remarkable reductions after correction with a 12 drop and a 13 drop during the calibration and validation periods respectively this implies that csmw may be an effective approach to correct the real time satellite precipitation estimates in practice 2 in terms of error components tmpa rt exhibited apparent positive hit biases during both calibration and validation periods and this systematic overestimation was effectively diminished after the adjustments using the csmw algorithm however csmw seems unable to correct the missed precipitation because these events are generally excluded from the considered rain rates used in the matching procedure of csmw additionally false precipitation did have a slightreduction but not nearly as much as the hit bias as for the intensity distribution of precipitation amount and events the csmw method made a major contribution to improve the tmpa rt estimates at the medium high rain rates 8 mm day meanwhile a majority of the rainfall rates associated with false precipitation is less than 8 mm day thus it can be concluded that the csmw approach was ineffective in reducing the error and bias with false precipitation events 3 our evaluation suggests that the proposed csmw model which is a refinement of the conventional cdf matching method is effective in correcting the overall biases rather than reducing the random errors for a specific time in other words the csmw approach tends to force the tmpa rt to match the gauge data according to their corresponding cumulative probability rather than to match the simultaneous gauge data this limitation of quantile mapping is clearly reflected in the meager improvement of correlation coefficients considering both spatial distribution and time series in future studies there is still much room to improve the csmw approach to meet the requirement of increasing the correlation between satellite estimates and ground observations 4 each pixel in the csmw approach has a viable spatial domain over areas with sparse gauge densities the csmw approach took advantage of the surrounding gauge data to correct tmpa rt while the gauge data applied in the traditional cdf method was found to be unrepresentative therefore we concluded the cmsw is more effective than the traditional cdf method over sparse gauge areas the results confirmed that the improvement of csmw rt is significant relative to cdf rt over semi arid and arid regions especially in western china credit authorship contribution statement zhehui shen

4723,in this study experimental and theoretical methods are used to investigate the longitudinal velocity profiles in a channel partially covered with novel artificial vegetation due to the discontinuity of the drag force of the artificial vegetation in the lateral direction the experimental data of longitudinal velocity in the partially covered channel shows a two zone flow structure the measured profile of shear stress reaches its peak at the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation zones and it has a slowly changing boundary layer in the non vegetation zone the velocity difference causes the formation of a dominant vortex across the zone interface that contributes to the lateral transport of momentum and mass hence a vortex based model based on a momentum balance is utilized to predict the lateral distribution of the longitudinal velocity meanwhile the expression of the momentum penetration distance induced by the coherent vortex into the vegetation zone is developed the predicted and measured velocities are consistent within a relative error of 4 6 the two zone analysis of velocity profiles paves the way for the turbulent structure to be examined future in partially artificial vegetated channels keywords artificial vegetation compound channel longitudinal velocity profiles two zone flow structure 1 introduction aquatic vegetation commonly extends only partially across the width of rivers examples of environments with this type of vegetation are lowland rivers and their floodplains seagoing rivers with bank vegetation and estuarine channels with fringing vegetation fig 1 vegetation can increase flow resistance thereby increasing the complexity of the internal flow structure cheng 2011 huang et al 2002 huai et al 2014 2019a 2019b li et al 2015 2019 wang et al 2015 2019 shi and huai 2018 the mass and momentum exchanges between fast flow in the main channel and slow flow in the vegetation floodplain are highly significant this exchange may provide nutrients and food to aquatic organisms and influence sediment transport and deposition across the vegetation boundary leading to erosion and stabilizing the bank cattrijsse and hampel 2006 nepf 2012 wu et al 2005 a few studies have been conducted to investigate the flow velocity in compound channels with a vegetated floodplain huai et al 2008 used a model for the eddy viscosity to predict the transverse velocity distribution in a compound channel the nondimensional eddy viscosity coefficient in the model is determined using an empirical formula that was obtained for non vegetation flow and is therefore acceptable for a non vegetation zone however this empirical formula is unsatisfactory in a vegetated floodplain because it cannot provide a clear picture of vortex physics and thus cannot clearly capture vortex characteristics and the related flow structure pasche and rouve 1985 investigated the flow velocity in a compound channel with vegetated floodplains the flow was simplified to a 2d physical process the momentum transfer between the main channel and the floodplain was modeled and a third order power function and a logarithmic curve were used to predict the longitudinal velocity profile in a vegetated floodplain however the prediction formula obtained did not favor actual practical applications interfacial vortex existing at the boundary of main channel and vegetated floodplain dominates the momentum and mass exchange but has not been studied sufficiently by previous studies huai et al 2009 2018 liu et al 2013 chen et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 the vortex leads to momentum and mass exchange at the vegetation boundary and is an essential link for describing the flow structure in a compound channel the formation of a vortex is driven by the kelvin helmholtz instability tamai et al 1986 huai et al 2015 and zhao and huai 2016 captured the vortices at a vegetation boundary by using a large eddy simulation les model white and nepf 2007 2008 performed an experiment in which dense emergent rigid vegetation filled half the width of an open channel and observed a coherent vortex structure at the interface between the slow flow in the vegetation zone and the fast flow in the non vegetation zone katul et al 2002 and nezu and onitsuka 2000 demonstrated that the slow flow in the vegetation zone and the fast flow in the vegetation free zone can produce an inflection point in the velocity profile such that the vegetated flow resembles free shear flow van prooijen et al 2000 detected large scale horizontal coherent structures between the main channel and the floodplain in a concrete compound channel van prooijen et al 2005 subsequently considered the transverse exchange of momentum between the channel and the floodplain in a straight uniform compound channel flow vortex physics was used in conjunction with a novel effective eddy viscosity to determine the transverse shear stress in the mixing region however the model still needs to be improved because a simplified eddy viscosity model with a constant mixing length was used across the entire floodplain this simplification neglects the rapid decrease in the length scale of the inner shear layer of the floodplain hence the width of momentum penetration into the floodplain is overpredicted this problem is exacerbated in a vegetated floodplain which offers higher flow resistance than a non vegetated floodplain fernandes et al 2014 proposed a lateral division of a compound channel into four regions this division is physically based on the mixing layer width between the main channel and the vegetation floodplain the use of several empirical relationships in the analysis makes it difficult to extend the results to general floodplains the subject of this study is a common system consisting of an open channel partially covered by a parallel array of artificial emergent vegetation vegetation has been simulated in previous studies by either cylindrical shapes or flexible plastic blades a novel and eco friendly artificial vegetation system is adopted in this study this type of vegetation was first proposed by zdankus et al 2016 and is described in detail in the experimental section zdankus et al 2016 maintained that this artificial vegetation effectively increases the flow resistance and water depth and can thus be used to improve navigation kinetic hydropower development and recreational conditions the novelty of this artificial vegetation lies in its unprecedented shape fig 2 besides the artificial vegetation is made of plastic and rubber and thus cannot be easily degraded in natural rivers when used for engineering applications the artificial vegetation can be reused and is therefore eco friendly similar to commonly found natural riparian vegetation the novel artificial vegetation is only placed near river banks to employ this artificial vegetation in practical engineering problems knowledge of basic hydraulic properties such as the velocity profile is required to predict the flood discharge capacity of river channels and other flow characteristics in the partially covered channel investigated in this study a shear layer forms at the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation zones and consists of two regions a region of rapid transition inside the vegetation zone and a more gradual transition region in the non vegetation zone each region is considered separately and has its own length scale this two zone vortex structure is used in conjunction with a momentum balance to obtain theoretical solutions for velocity profiles a vortex based model is developed that can accurately predict the lateral velocity distribution the results of the model can facilitate the determination of flow turbulence characteristics with artificial vegetation in the future 2 experimental setup experiments were performed in a 1 m wide 20 m long and 0 4 m deep recirculated rectangular flume in the state key laboratory of water resources and hydropower engineering science at wuhan university a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 a the flume was partially covered with a 0 495 m wide b v and 8 m long l veg array of artificial emergent vegetation for each investigated experimental condition a steady water depth was maintained by adjusting the tailgate at the end of the flume and the electromagnetic flowmeter we investigated experimental configurations in which the flow was sufficiently shallow to be approximated as 2d that is the effects of the sidewall on the flow could be neglected hence the water depths were varied between h 0 115 m and h 0 205 m in the experiments corresponding to width to water depth ratios larger than 5 for the channel width b 1 m the experimental configurations are summarized in table 1 the coordinate system is as follows the x axis is aligned along the longitudinal direction i e the main flow direction with x 0 at the leading edge of the artificial vegetation zone the y axis lies in the lateral direction where y 0 at the wall of the non vegetation zone the z axis lies in the vertical direction where z 0 at the flume bed the artificial emergent vegetation is arranged in a parallel configuration and the longitudinal and lateral spacings of two adjacent vegetation arrays are 0 2 m and 0 1 m respectively shown in fig 2 b each vegetation array consists of four large hollow floats and four small solid floats which are alternately connected by a thin rope shown in fig 2 c the diameters of the solid and hollow floats are d 1 0 02 m and d 2 0 04 m respectively and the arithmetic mean diameter of a vegetation array is d d 1 d 2 2 0 03 m the projection height of the vegetation is equal to the water depth such that the vegetation is always emergent the vegetation drag force also depends on the changing states of the vegetation at various water depths the number of floats submerged in the flow is used to calculate the vegetation drag force l 1 denotes the number of large floats that are completely submerged in the flow and l 2 indicates the total number of the volume for the partially submerged large floats s 3 and s 4 represent the corresponding numbers for the small floats note that completely submerged indicates that the entire float is immersed in the flow and partially submerged indicates that only a partial volume of the float is immersed in the flow the detailed values of l 1 l 2 s 1 and s 2 under each experimental condition are summarized in table 1 these values are used in the theoretical analysis presented in section 4 when flow enters the vegetation patch the flow velocity gradually decreases and eventually reaches an equilibrium state for which t 0 and x 0 the velocity measurement comprises two steps our first aim is to determine where the flow becomes fully developed hence 8 cross sections locating at x 50 35 95 190 375 400 515 and 575 cm are selected along the flow direction and then the velocity is measured across the various cross sections by using acoustic doppler velocimeters adv with a down looking and an up looking probes the sampling frequency of the probe is 50 hz and the sampling time at each point is 120 s the raw velocity data needs to be despiked following the method of goring and nikora 2002 12 measurement points were made for each cross section every point was set at mid depth of the flow as a proxy for the depth averaged velocity i e u u d huai et al 2019b white and nepf 2007 2008 the fully developed region can be easily determined considering the velocity development in the longitudinal direction the second objective of velocity measurement is to measure the lateral distribution of the longitudinal velocity in the fully developed region in detail to clearly capture the flow structure having determined that the fully developed region occurs at x 4 0 m the fully developed cross section is placed at x 4 1 m which is shown as a vertical dashed line in fig 3 a total of 18 measuring lines is selected in this fully developed cross section and a total of 10 20 measurement points is made in each measurement line under different experimental conditions 3 experimental results 3 1 downstream evolution of flow in a partially covered channel when flow encounters a partially covered vegetated channel the velocity evolves with the distance from the leading edge fig 3 shows the flow adjustment process along the partially covered channel note that the double averaged longitudinal velocity u d shown in fig 3 and the succeeding figures has been time averaged to eliminate instantaneous turbulent fluctuations and depth averaged over h there is a velocity difference between the vegetation and non vegetation zones because of the discontinuity in the drag force between these two zones in particular the velocity in the vegetation zone decreases gradually and then remains constant by contrast the velocity in the non vegetation zone grows steadily and eventually stabilizes the velocity difference creates a shear layer and vortices shown as blue circles in fig 3 at the interface of the two zones x d is the length scale of the initial flow adjustment over which the flow velocity is decelerated by the vegetation drag force in the fully developed cross section δ i is the distance over which the shear layer penetrates into the vegetation zone correspondingly δ o is the extension width of the vortices into the non vegetation zone white and nepf 2008 the downstream evolution of the transverse distribution of the longitudinal velocity for case 3 is shown in fig 4 a the double averaged longitudinal velocity evolves from a uniform profile upstream of the vegetation patch to a shear layer profile in the fully developed cross section in fig 4 a the adjustment length scale x d is determined to be 400 cm beyond which the flow can be regarded as fully developed belcher et al 2003 proposed the following formula for x d for a sparse aquatic vegetation array 1 x d 3 2 1 ϕ c d a where ϕ is the solid volume fraction and c d is the vegetation drag coefficient in the current study c d a b v 0 74 2 which corresponds to a sparse case hence the predicted x d 390 cm belcher et al 2003 agrees well with the measured value 400 cm the width of the shear layer between the two zones can be measured in terms of the momentum thickness θ which is given 2 θ 1 4 u d u d δ u 2 d y where u d is the double averaged longitudinal velocity and u d is the arithmetic mean of u d 1 and u d 2 u d 1 and u d 2 are the velocities inside the vegetation and non vegetation zones respectively δ u is the velocity difference between u d 1 and u d 2 in fig 4 b θ grows rapidly downstream and asymptotes to approximately 6 cm at x 400 cm beyond which the equilibrium velocity distribution is attained 3 2 equilibrium velocity and turbulence characteristics the normalized longitudinal velocity profiles and normalized reynolds stress profiles at various water depths are presented in fig 5 a distinct peak in the reynolds stress occurs at the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation zones based on the distribution of the reynolds stress white and nepf 2007 found two clear subzones in the shear layer the first high shear subzone occurs near the interface between the two zones this subzone decides the length scale in the vegetation zone which the flow momentum penetrates into and then is named as inner zone with thickness δ i as shown in fig 5 a the second shear subzone lies inside the non vegetation zone and decides the width of boundary layer in the non vegetation zone this subzone is called outer zone with thickness δ o a velocity inflection point can be identified at the interface in vegetated flows and its position is defined as y 0 white and nepf 2007 raupach et al 1996 however this inflection point cannot be easily found in fig 5 a because the measuring lines are insufficiently dense the distribution of the reynolds stress is not symmetric in fig 5 b which is consistent with the experimental results of white and nepf 2008 the interface between the two zones plays a similar role of wall thereby the velocity profile in the non vegetation zone is similar to a boundary layer see fig 5 a in fig 6 the velocity distribution in the lateral direction for each investigated case collapses after separate nondimensionalization by the velocity scale and length scales of the inner and outer zones the x axis in fig 6 a is offset by the position of the inflection point y 0 and then is nondimensionalized by δ i previous researchers demonstrated that y 0 was 1 2 times diameter of the artificial vegetation in fig 6 a the profiles of longitudinal velocity in all cases collapse to a same curve with s shape which resemble the turbulent structure of mixing layer in submerged vegetated flows by previous researchers huai et al 2019a katul et al 2002 this s curve can be fitted to a hyperbolic tangent function which is shown as a solid black curve in fig 6 a the measured velocity inside δ i agrees well with the hyperbolic tangent profile but deviates from this profile at a length of around 0 5 δ i outside the interface fig 6 b shows that the velocity distribution in the non vegetation zone collapses when the x axis is offset by the length scale y m and normalized by δ o y m is the position where the velocity gradients in the inner and outer zones match white and nepf 2008 and is marked in fig 5 a the normalized velocity distributions are consistent with a parabolic shape which is shown as a solid black line in fig 6 b 4 theoretical analysis for the prediction of double averaged velocity 4 1 velocity prediction model huai et al 2019b demonstrated that a coherent vortex structure spreads downstream in the shear layer occurring at the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation zones and eventually reaches equilibrium by a kelvin helmholtz instability periodic fluctuations in the velocity and reynolds stress at the interface verified the formation of coherent vortices by huai et al 2019b who also reported the dominant dimensionless frequency f of the vortex was 0 032 via the method of power spectral density on the basis of the coherent vortex structure white and nepf 2008 proposed a framework to predict the longitudinal velocity and classified the cross section into four subzones i a uniform region inside the vegetation zone where has a constant longitudinal velocity u d 1 ii an inner region across the interface iii an outer boundary region in the non vegetation zone and iv a uniform region deep within the non vegetation zone where also has a constant longitudinal velocity u d 2 the four subzones are separated by the vertical solid lines in fig 5 a in these four subzones we follow the rule of streamwise momentum balance under the fully developed flow condition and can derive 3 g s h h ρ τ xy y f x the surface slope of free water s equals to the bed gradient for steady and uniform flow adopted here angle brackets denote the lateral spatial average τ xy is the shear stress in the lateral direction which is given as 4 τ xy ρ u v d u d u d v d v d the first term in eq 4 is the depth averaged reynolds stress and the second term is the secondary circulation the second term can be neglected because the first term is at least an order of magnitude more than it in the present study similar results were obtained by van prooijen et al 2005 f x is the vegetation total drag integrated along the water depth which is given as 5 f x 1 2 c d m u d 2 a f 1 l 1 l 2 a f 2 s 1 s 2 1 2 c f u d 2 i n t h e v e g e t a t i o n z o n e 1 2 c f u d 2 i n t h e n o n v e g e t a t i o n z o n e where l 1 l 2 s 1 and s 2 have been defined in section 2 and a f 1 and a f 2 are the projection areas of the large and small floats in the longitudinal direction respectively m is the number of artificial vegetation per unit area c f is the friction coefficient of the channel bed the bed drag is considerably smaller than the vegetation drag force for all the studied cases and can be neglected in the vegetation zone zhang et al 2020 white and nepf 2008 shi et al 2019 the velocity in each subzone is analyzed separately i the flow deep inside the vegetation zone is uniform in the lateral direction the reynolds stress in this zone is approximately zero fig 5 b and thus is neglected hence the constant velocity deep inside the vegetation zone u d 1 can be obtained using eq 3 which corresponds to balancing the vegetation drag against the flow surface gradient 6 u d 1 2 g s h c d m a f 1 l 1 l 2 a f 2 s 1 s 2 0 5 ii across the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation zones the velocity profile u di in the inner zone exhibits the structural characteristics of a mixing layer and can be fitted using the hyperbolic tangent function shown in fig 6 a 7 u di u s t a n h y y 0 δ i 1 u d 1 the value of y 0 in natural rivers and the laboratory open channel tends to be much smaller than the length scale of the main channel hence y 0 0 is taken in this study u s u d y 0 u d 1 is named the slip velocity and is the velocity difference between u d y 0 and u d 1 u s can be calculated by the eq 24 in white and nepf 2008 the expression of δ i is given in section 4 2 iii in the outer zone of the vegetation interface the velocity profile u do can still be obtained using the momentum balance eq 3 and constant eddy viscosity model see details in white and nepf 2008 8 u do 3 u d 2 tanh 2 3 4 u dym u d 2 2 y y m δ o tanh 1 1 u dym u d 2 1 3 0 5 2 u d 2 where u dym is the matching velocity at y m the equations of u dym and δ o can be solved by the iterative method white and nepf 2008 then the matching point y m can be obtained by eq 20 in white and nepf 2008 with the known u dym ν t is the eddy viscosity coefficient and can be calculated by the eq 37 in white and nepf 2008 iv in the non vegetation zone outside the region of the shear layer the reynolds stress is also small and can be ignored fig 5 b thus the velocity can be presented by a balance between surface gradient and channel bed resistance as follows 9 u d 2 2 g s h c f 0 5 4 2 inner zone width of model parameters given the vegetation drag properties the inner zone width δ i can be calculated as 10 δ i c 1 c d a 1 where the empirical result c 1 0 14 is obtained from the experimental results in this study this value is smaller than c 1 0 5 given by white and nepf 2008 white and nepf 2008 simulated vegetation using rigid circular rods which produce a higher turbulence intensity than flexible vegetation with the same density chen et al 2013 ghisalberti and nepf 2006 thus δ i decreases with the flexibility of the vegetation hence a smaller parameter value is obtained in the current study than that reported by white and nepf 2008 the discontinuity in the flow resistance causes a strong shear layer to form near the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation zones lateral momentum exchange near the interface leads to the penetration of the shear stress into the vegetation zone the reynolds stress gradient near the interface between the non vegetation and vegetation zones is relatively significant compared to the reynolds stress in the vegetation zone fig 5 b the reynolds stress decreases to a constant value within a short length the reynolds stress distribution shown in fig 5 b is used to calculate δ i from the interface to the point where u v d u v d i n t e r f a c e u v d 2 0 1 u v d 2 where u v d i n t e r f a c e is the reynolds stress at the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation zones and u v d 2 is the corresponding spatial average in the steady region of the vegetation zone the lengths for the three investigated cases are 0 07 m 0 08 m and 0 09 m which are consistent with the values obtained using eq 10 5 discussion given the expressions for the inner and outer zones widths the slip velocity interfacial shear stress and model for the eddy viscosity coefficient the longitudinal velocity profile in the channel with partial artificial vegetation can be predicted the theoretical and experimental velocity distributions at x 4 1 m are compared in fig 7 the theoretical and experimental data are generally consistent at x 4 1 m for all the studied cases an error analysis is performed to quantify the difference between the predicted and measured data the absolute error is calculated from the difference between the predicted and measured velocities as follows 11 δ a u d predicted u d measured the relative error δ r and the average relative error δ r are defined as 12 δ r δ a u d measured 13 δ r 1 n 1 n a b s δ r 100 where n is the number of the measurement lines across the open channel the average relative errors are presented in table 2 the variation in the average relative errors from 4 to 6 is acceptable the error statistics presented in table 2 confirm the accuracy and reliability of the theoretical vortex based model 6 conclusion an effective method is presented to predict longitudinal velocity profiles in an open channel partially covered with an artificial vegetation patch this type of vegetation differs from previously investigated vegetation types and its drag force is calculated in accordance with its specific form the measured velocity profiles exhibit a distinct two zone flow structure the high shear stress occurs at the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation zones and a boundary layer appears outside the vegetation zone given the vortex formed at the interface the vortex characteristics are utilized to illustrate the vortex caused momentum exchange the predicted velocity from the vortex based model catches the two zone structure and agrees well with the measured velocity indicating that the model can efficiently predict the transverse distribution of velocity in a channel adjacent to artificial emergent vegetation note that the vortex based model is only applicable to shallow channels with width to depth ratios higher than 5 otherwise the three dimensionality of the channel is strengthened and the interference from the channel sidewalls may introduce errors into the predictions leading to that the model is invalidated credit authorship contribution statement jiao zhang software writing original draft wen

d 1 0 02 m and d 2 0 04 m respectively and the arithmetic mean diameter of a vegetation array is d d 1 d 2 2 0 03 m the projection height of the vegetation is equal to the water depth such that the vegetation is always emergent the vegetation drag force also depends on the changing states of the vegetation at various water depths the number of floats submerged in the flow is used to calculate the vegetation drag force l 1 denotes the number of large floats that are completely submerged in the flow and l 2 indicates the total number of the volume for the partially submerged large floats s 3 and s 4 represent the corresponding numbers for the small floats note that completely submerged indicates that the entire float is immersed in the flow and partially submerged indicates that only a partial volume of the float is immersed in the flow the detailed values of l 1 l 2 s 1 and s 2 under each experimental condition are summarized in table 1 these values are used in the theoretical analysis presented in section 4 when flow enters the vegetation patch the flow velocity gradually decreases and eventually reaches an equilibrium state for which t 0 and x 0 the velocity measurement comprises two steps our first aim is to determine where the flow becomes fully developed hence 8 cross sections locating at x 50 35 95 190 375 400 515 and 575 cm are selected along the flow direction and then the velocity is measured across the various cross sections by using acoustic doppler velocimeters adv with a down looking and an up looking probes the sampling frequency of the probe is 50 hz and the sampling time at each point is 120 s the raw velocity data needs to be despiked following the method of goring and nikora 2002 12 measurement points were made for each cross section every point was set at mid depth of the flow as a proxy for the depth averaged velocity i e u u d huai et al 2019b white and nepf 2007 2008 the fully developed region can be easily determined considering the velocity development in the longitudinal direction the second objective of velocity measurement is to measure the lateral distribution of the longitudinal velocity in the fully developed region in detail to clearly capture the flow structure having determined that the fully developed region occurs at x 4 0 m the fully developed cross section is placed at x 4 1 m which is shown as a vertical dashed line in fig 3 a total of 18 measuring lines is selected in this fully developed cross section and a total of 10 20 measurement points is made in each measurement line under different experimental conditions 3 experimental results 3 1 downstream evolution of flow in a partially covered channel when flow encounters a partially covered vegetated channel the velocity evolves with the distance from the leading edge fig 3 shows the flow adjustment process along the partially covered channel note that the double averaged longitudinal velocity u d shown in fig 3 and the succeeding figures has been time averaged to eliminate instantaneous turbulent fluctuations and depth averaged over h there is a velocity difference between the vegetation and non vegetation zones because of the discontinuity in the drag force between these two zones in particular the velocity in the vegetation zone decreases gradually and then remains constant by contrast the velocity in the non vegetation zone grows steadily and eventually stabilizes the velocity difference creates a shear layer and vortices shown as blue circles in fig 3 at the interface of the two zones x d is the length scale of the initial flow adjustment over which the flow velocity is decelerated by the vegetation drag force in the fully developed cross section δ i is the distance over which the shear layer penetrates into the vegetation zone correspondingly δ o is the extension width of the vortices into the non vegetation zone white and nepf 2008 the downstream evolution of the transverse distribution of the longitudinal velocity for case 3 is shown in fig 4 a the double averaged longitudinal velocity evolves from a uniform profile upstream of the vegetation patch to a shear layer profile in the fully developed cross section in fig 4 a the adjustment length scale x d is determined to be 400 cm beyond which the flow can be regarded as fully developed belcher et al 2003 proposed the following formula for x d for a sparse aquatic vegetation array 1 x d 3 2 1 ϕ c d a where ϕ is the solid volume fraction and c d is the vegetation drag coefficient in the current study c d a b v 0 74 2 which corresponds to a sparse case hence the predicted x d 390 cm belcher et al 2003 agrees well with the measured value 400 cm the width of the shear layer between the two zones can be measured in terms of the momentum thickness θ which is given 2 θ 1 4 u d u d δ u 2 d y where u d is the double averaged longitudinal velocity and u d is the arithmetic mean of u d 1 and u d 2 u d 1 and u d 2 are the velocities inside the vegetation and non vegetation zones respectively δ u is the velocity difference between u d 1 and u d 2 in fig 4 b θ grows rapidly downstream and asymptotes to approximately 6 cm at x 400 cm beyond which the equilibrium velocity distribution is attained 3 2 equilibrium velocity and turbulence characteristics the normalized longitudinal velocity profiles and normalized reynolds stress profiles at various water depths are presented in fig 5 a distinct peak in the reynolds stress occurs at the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation zones based on the distribution of the reynolds stress white and nepf 2007 found two clear subzones in the shear layer the first high shear subzone occurs near the interface between the two zones this subzone decides the length scale in the vegetation zone which the flow momentum penetrates into and then is named as inner zone with thickness δ i as shown in fig 5 a the second shear subzone lies inside the non vegetation zone and decides the width of boundary layer in the non vegetation zone this subzone is called outer zone with thickness δ o a velocity inflection point can be identified at the interface in vegetated flows and its position is defined as y 0 white and nepf 2007 raupach et al 1996 however this inflection point cannot be easily found in fig 5 a because the measuring lines are insufficiently dense the distribution of the reynolds stress is not symmetric in fig 5 b which is consistent with the experimental results of white and nepf 2008 the interface between the two zones plays a similar role of wall thereby the velocity profile in the non vegetation zone is similar to a boundary layer see fig 5 a in fig 6 the velocity distribution in the lateral direction for each investigated case collapses after separate nondimensionalization by the velocity scale and length scales of the inner and outer zones the x axis in fig 6 a is offset by the position of the inflection point y 0 and then is nondimensionalized by δ i previous researchers demonstrated that y 0 was 1 2 times diameter of the artificial vegetation in fig 6 a the profiles of longitudinal velocity in all cases collapse to a same curve with s shape which resemble the turbulent structure of mixing layer in submerged vegetated flows by previous researchers huai et al 2019a katul et al 2002 this s curve can be fitted to a hyperbolic tangent function which is shown as a solid black curve in fig 6 a the measured velocity inside δ i agrees well with the hyperbolic tangent profile but deviates from this profile at a length of around 0 5 δ i outside the interface fig 6 b shows that the velocity distribution in the non vegetation zone collapses when the x axis is offset by the length scale y m and normalized by δ o y m is the position where the velocity gradients in the inner and outer zones match white and nepf 2008 and is marked in fig 5 a the normalized velocity distributions are consistent with a parabolic shape which is shown as a solid black line in fig 6 b 4 theoretical analysis for the prediction of double averaged velocity 4 1 velocity prediction model huai et al 2019b demonstrated that a coherent vortex structure spreads downstream in the shear layer occurring at the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation zones and eventually reaches equilibrium by a kelvin helmholtz instability periodic fluctuations in the velocity and reynolds stress at the interface verified the formation of coherent vortices by huai et al 2019b who also reported the dominant dimensionless frequency f of the vortex was 0 032 via the method of power spectral density on the basis of the coherent vortex structure white and nepf 2008 proposed a framework to predict the longitudinal velocity and classified the cross section into four subzones i a uniform region inside the vegetation zone where has a constant longitudinal velocity u d 1 ii an inner region across the interface iii an outer boundary region in the non vegetation zone and iv a uniform region deep within the non vegetation zone where also has a constant longitudinal velocity u d 2 the four subzones are separated by the vertical solid lines in fig 5 a in these four subzones we follow the rule of streamwise momentum balance under the fully developed flow condition and can derive 3 g s h h ρ τ xy y f x the surface slope of free water s equals to the bed gradient for steady and uniform flow adopted here angle brackets denote the lateral spatial average τ xy is the shear stress in the lateral direction which is given as 4 τ xy ρ u v d u d u d v d v d the first term in eq 4 is the depth averaged reynolds stress and the second term is the secondary circulation the second term can be neglected because the first term is at least an order of magnitude more than it in the present study similar results were obtained by van prooijen et al 2005 f x is the vegetation total drag integrated along the water depth which is given as 5 f x 1 2 c d m u d 2 a f 1 l 1 l 2 a f 2 s 1 s 2 1 2 c f u d 2 i n t h e v e g e t a t i o n z o n e 1 2 c f u d 2 i n t h e n o n v e g e t a t i o n z o n e where l 1 l 2 s 1 and s 2 have been defined in section 2 and a f 1 and a f 2 are the projection areas of the large and small floats in the longitudinal direction respectively m is the number of artificial vegetation per unit area c f is the friction coefficient of the channel bed the bed drag is considerably smaller than the vegetation drag force for all the studied cases and can be neglected in the vegetation zone zhang et al 2020 white and nepf 2008 shi et al 2019 the velocity in each subzone is analyzed separately i the flow deep inside the vegetation zone is uniform in the lateral direction the reynolds stress in this zone is approximately zero fig 5 b and thus is neglected hence the constant velocity deep inside the vegetation zone u d 1 can be obtained using eq 3 which corresponds to balancing the vegetation drag against the flow surface gradient 6 u d 1 2 g s h c d m a f 1 l 1 l 2 a f 2 s 1 s 2 0 5 ii across the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation zones the velocity profile u di in the inner zone exhibits the structural characteristics of a mixing layer and can be fitted using the hyperbolic tangent function shown in fig 6 a 7 u di u s t a n h y y 0 δ i 1 u d 1 the value of y 0 in natural rivers and the laboratory open channel tends to be much smaller than the length scale of the main channel hence y 0 0 is taken in this study u s u d y 0 u d 1 is named the slip velocity and is the velocity difference between u d y 0 and u d 1 u s can be calculated by the eq 24 in white and nepf 2008 the expression of δ i is given in section 4 2 iii in the outer zone of the vegetation interface the velocity profile u do can still be obtained using the momentum balance eq 3 and constant eddy viscosity model see details in white and nepf 2008 8 u do 3 u d 2 tanh 2 3 4 u dym u d 2 2 y y m δ o tanh 1 1 u dym u d 2 1 3 0 5 2 u d 2 where u dym is the matching velocity at y m the equations of u dym and δ o can be solved by the iterative method white and nepf 2008 then the matching point y m can be obtained by eq 20 in white and nepf 2008 with the known u dym ν t is the eddy viscosity coefficient and can be calculated by the eq 37 in white and nepf 2008 iv in the non vegetation zone outside the region of the shear layer the reynolds stress is also small and can be ignored fig 5 b thus the velocity can be presented by a balance between surface gradient and channel bed resistance as follows 9 u d 2 2 g s h c f 0 5 4 2 inner zone width of model parameters given the vegetation drag properties the inner zone width δ i can be calculated as 10 δ i c 1 c d a 1 where the empirical result c 1 0 14 is obtained from the experimental results in this study this value is smaller than c 1 0 5 given by white and nepf 2008 white and nepf 2008 simulated vegetation using rigid circular rods which produce a higher turbulence intensity than flexible vegetation with the same density chen et al 2013 ghisalberti and nepf 2006 thus δ i decreases with the flexibility of the vegetation hence a smaller parameter value is obtained in the current study than that reported by white and nepf 2008 the discontinuity in the flow resistance causes a strong shear layer to form near the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation zones lateral momentum exchange near the interface leads to the penetration of the shear stress into the vegetation zone the reynolds stress gradient near the interface between the non vegetation and vegetation zones is relatively significant compared to the reynolds stress in the vegetation zone fig 5 b the reynolds stress decreases to a constant value within a short length the reynolds stress distribution shown in fig 5 b is used to calculate δ i from the interface to the point where u v d u v d i n t e r f a c e u v d 2 0 1 u v d 2 where u v d i n t e r f a c e is the reynolds stress at the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation zones and u v d 2 is the corresponding spatial average in the steady region of the vegetation zone the lengths for the three investigated cases are 0 07 m 0 08 m and 0 09 m which are consistent with the values obtained using eq 10 5 discussion given the expressions for the inner and outer zones widths the slip velocity interfacial shear stress and model for the eddy viscosity coefficient the longitudinal velocity profile in the channel with partial artificial vegetation can be predicted the theoretical and experimental velocity distributions at x 4 1 m are compared in fig 7 the theoretical and experimental data are generally consistent at x 4 1 m for all the studied cases an error analysis is performed to quantify the difference between the predicted and measured data the absolute error is calculated from the difference between the predicted and measured velocities as follows 11 δ a u d predicted u d measured the relative error δ r and the average relative error δ r are defined as 12 δ r δ a u d measured 13 δ r 1 n 1 n a b s δ r 100 where n is the number of the measurement lines across the open channel the average relative errors are presented in table 2 the variation in the average relative errors from 4 to 6 is acceptable the error statistics presented in table 2 confirm the accuracy and reliability of the theoretical vortex based model 6 conclusion an effective method is presented to predict longitudinal velocity profiles in an open channel partially covered with an artificial vegetation patch this type of vegetation differs from previously investigated vegetation types and its drag force is calculated in accordance with its specific form the measured velocity profiles exhibit a distinct two zone flow structure the high shear stress occurs at the interface between the vegetation and non vegetation zones and a boundary layer appears outside the vegetation zone given the vortex formed at the interface the vortex characteristics are utilized to illustrate the vortex caused momentum exchange the predicted velocity from the vortex based model catches the two zone structure and agrees well with the measured velocity indicating that the model can efficiently predict the transverse distribution of velocity in a channel adjacent to artificial emergent vegetation note that the vortex based model is only applicable to shallow channels with width to depth ratios higher than 5 otherwise the three dimensionality of the channel is strengthened and the interference from the channel sidewalls may introduce errors into the predictions leading to that the model is invalidated credit authorship contribution statement jiao zhang software writing original draft wen

the last 800 000 years pachauri et al 2014 schilt et al 2010a tian et al 2019 agriculture which heavily uses nitrogen n fertilisers is thought to contribute 75 of global anthropogenic n2o to the atmosphere hensen et al 2013 nevison 2000 reay et al 2012 since the anthropogenic global n cycle turnover has increased 2 fold and the global demand for food is predicted to increase at 2 per year the link between food production and n2o emissions is becoming an important factor in global ghg models fao 2017 gruber galloway 2008 the production and emission of n2o in streams surrounding agriculture is largely dependent on reactive n availability skiba smith 2000 n2o can be produced during both nitrification and denitrification in soils saturated sediments and waterways bange 2006 statham 2012 the n2 n2o production ratio is influenced by many parameters notably nox concentrations dissolved o2 ph microbial communities redox potential carbon availability and temperature hefting et al 2003 walker et al 2002 n2o production is dependent on the presence of reactive n nr species dominantly nitrates nitrites nox and ammonium nh4 therefore the application of nr fertiliser and subsequent nr runoff to streams may contribute significantly to aquatic n2o emissions carpenter et al 1998 david et al 1997 fertiliser production has grown significantly in the past half century and is predicted to increase further with global population smil 1997 zhang et al 2015 following the increase in nr fertiliser use anthropogenic nitrogen inputs to streams more than tripled between the 1970s and the

poorly understood particularly in regions with episodic rather than seasonal rainfall patterns mosier et al 1998 reay et al 2012 tian et al 2019 headwater streams 4th order are estimated to contribute 85 of global riverine n2o emissions yao et al 2020 indirect emissions from agriculture are estimated to be the second highest contributor to global anthropogenic n2o emissions greater than human

n2o studies in recent decades has provided valuable data which reduce these uncertainties tian et al 2019 the recent additional indirect n2o research effort has resulted in a 50 reduction in global

subtropical southern hemisphere where the annual hydrology is more dominated by episodic heavy rainfall musenze et al 2014 reading et al 2017 yao et al 2020 many studies do not capture rapid changes in rainfall and hydrology in contrast to seasonal rainfall patterns in better studied temperate regions subtropical australia experiences weeks to months of dry weather followed by short periods of intense episodic rainfall leading to short term pulses of nutrients into surrounding waterways in agricultural catchments white et al 2018 rain events are also well known to release nutrients to surface water via groundwater seepage burt arkell 1987 santos et al 2013 though the release of nitrogen pollution from farm to creek via groundwater often occurs on time scales of decades to centuries eckhardt stackelberg 1995 helena et al 2000 as a result the contribution of groundwater to n2o aquatic emissions remains poorly understood in many landscapes in this study we investigate how the heavy use of fertilisers will increase not only nitrate loads but also aquatic n2o emissions in a nearby waterway we describe detailed time series observations of dissolved n2o covering contrasting hydrological stages ranging from drought to flood in a subtropical creek draining a heavily fertilised landscape while we focus on n2o we also report co2 and ch4 data we build on the literature by 1 focusing on poorly investigated sub tropical systems 2 comparing n2o drivers during episodic rain events and during baseflow 3 establishing linkages between nr loads and n2o emissions and 4 putting n2o emissions in perspective to the other ghg emissions including co2 and ch4 2 methods 2 1 study area detailed time series observations covering 3 rain events were performed in double crossing creek

water conservation 2001 as an icoll hearnes lake has inconstant entrance conditions longshore currents continuously deliver sand across the mouth of the estuary periodically forming a sand barrier isolating hearnes lake from the ocean during the periods of mouth closure the lake accumulates fresh and saline groundwater as well as surface water flows via double crossing creek during rain events in high rainfall events the lake can fill and overtop the sand barrier scouring a new mouth and draining the lake when the mouth is open it is hydraulically connected to the pacific ocean allowing tidal flows in and out of the lake with an upper tidal limit of 2 km haines 2009 underlying geology in the catchment is derived from hornblende bearing volcanic lithic sandstone and the current parent rock is comprised of sandstones and mudstones argillite greywacke and slate haines 2009 the upper catchment soil is moderately deep well drained podzolic and kraznozem soil whilst the areas closer to the upper creek are deep poorly drained humic clays department of land and water conservation 1999 the barrier sand berm is comprised of well drained siliceous sands and the lake sediment is made up

earth pro 2018 roper et al 2011 estimated that base flow increased 48 and surface flow increased 10 1 post clearing of the catchment for agricultural purposes regional blueberry dominated catchments are known to have high loads of nitrogen in creeks white et al 2018 particularly during rain events approximately 23 of the catchment is currently fertilised 69 of the fertilised land use is occupied by blueberry farms and the other 31 is comprised of banana macadamia avocado and nursery horticulture fertilisers are applied to blueberries in soil via drip irrigation approximately twice weekly though the timing of fertiliser application and the fertiliser recipe varies from farm to farm with growth cycle and weather patterns cucumbers are grown in woodchip media fertilised by drippers at rates of 2 l plant 1 day 1 during daylight hours in 13 week cycles grewal et al 2011 cucumber grow bags can become highly saline due to nutrient application so flushing of the bags is necessary leading to runoff into surrounding soils and eventually creeks burt 2007 grewal et al 2011 data on fertilisation rates and application times are not available therefore we assume that farmers are applying the recommended doses in our calculations blueberries are assumed to require 121 kg n ha 1 yr 1 doughty et al 1988 bananas require 100 kg n ha 1 yr 1 newley et al 2008 cucumbers in hothouses require 270 kg n ha 1 yr 1 shen et al 2010 and other horticulture macadamia avocado and nursery uses 100 kg n ha 1 yr 1 therefore the relative contribution to total fertiliser input load calculated on

there is no published data on error margins for daily estimates available from the model or within our catchment an onsite rain gauge was used to collect rain data with rainfall recorded at each of

with tukeys post hoc analysis was performed using independent samples to assess differences between nutrients in different hydrological stages the load of nutrients was calculated by simply multiplying concentrations by discharge and dividing by catchment area fertiliser loss to the creek at the time series site was calculated using the recommended fertiliser dose for each crop

wind speed and depth for k to estimate a range of n2o flux potentials the raymond and cole 2001 model was determined for estuaries as a function of wind and depth while the piston velocity model of borges et al 2004 was determined for three estuaries using wind depth and current the k values were aligned with in situ schmidt numbers at k600 using salinity and temperature assuming linear salinity dependence between 0 and 35 ppm constant atmospheric n2o of 0 326 ppm from air sampling was used in calculations the fluxes of ch4 and co2 were calculated using similar methods and equations available in wanninkhof 2014 co2 equivalent co2 eq emissions are calculated using equations of solubility yamamoto et al 1976 as well as 20 yr and 100 yr sustained global warming potential sgwp estimations neubauer megonigal 2015 sgwp converts ghg units into one standard unit of co2 eq global warming potential gwp is a commonly used metric for comparing ghgs with different lifetimes relative radiative forcing and cycling neubauer megonigal 2015 however sgwp is the preferred radiative forcing estimation over gwp since gwp is only estimated as a one time pulse of a ghg to the atmosphere and sgwp treats gas emissions as persistent fluxes myhre et al 2013 to compare our measured results to the ipcc indirect emissions model we use the updated default ef5 emission factor 0 0075 kg n2o n kg 1n

stages were defined a dry period stagnant 50 mm rain per day three rain periods rain 50 mm of rain per day and the following day and wet periods wet days after 50 mm of rain hereafter we refer to these classifications as stagnant rain and wet during the stagnant period salinity at the time series site was 20 ppt and flow was negligible the downstream lake was closed to the ocean though was likely influenced by saline groundwater exchange haines 2009 initial scoping surveys before the experiment revealed that the lake downstream of our site was saline 38 1 5 2 ppt salinity n 5 and the salinity gradient extended up to our monitoring site 19 4 ppt as the lake and creek up to our monitoring site were dominantly standing water saline groundwater exchange and evaporation during the dry period summer months may have influenced salinity at our monitoring site the rainfall on 24 february day 28 was sufficient to trigger the downstream icoll drainage to the ocean with a drop of 0 84 m depth in only 48 h the icoll remained open to the pacific ocean during the remainder of the time series the total change in depth was 1 9 m from maximum to minimum a clear shift in nox and n2o was seen before and after the rainfall on 24 february day 28 fig 3 the stagnant period was characterised by high salinity and high don whilst n2o nox and nh4 were low conversely during rain and wet periods low salinity and don and supersaturated n2o 34 fold and 27 fold higher than stagnant in rain and wet respectively on average were observed the nox values were 145 fold and 105 fold higher in the rain and wet periods respectively compared to stagnant nh4 was 1 8 fold higher in rain than stagnant and 2 9 fold higher in wet than stagnant 222rn was 3 fold higher in rain and 2 5 fold higher in wet than stagnant periods the po4 concentrations increase substantially as a pulse during rain exceeding stagnant or wet conditions by a factor of 4 groundwater samples had mean nox concentrations and n2o saturations 330 fold and 8 fold lower than surface water in rain respectively providing initial evidence that groundwater discharge cannot account for surface water values anoxic groundwater exchange driven by density inversions during the upstream propagation of the salt wedge santos et al 2012a may have influenced salinity do and n speciation prior to the rainfall events in february and march however we do not have data on hyporheic zone groundwater flows the creek shifted from being a sink of atmospheric n2o during stagnant conditions to a source of n2o to the atmosphere during the wet and rain periods in rain n2o reached the highest level at 5655 saturation 41 1 of total samples 15 8 rain and 25 2 wet were between 1000 and 5655 saturation results of post hoc anova revealed n2o was significantly different p 0 01 between rain and stagnant as well as wet and stagnant periods the water was never under saturated with either co2 or ch4 calculated mean co2 ch4 and n2o potential

during different hydrologic conditions suggesting an interaction between the flushing hypothesis for nox creed band 1998 li et al 2017 and the groundwater flow hypothesis for both nox and 222rn burt arkell 1987 yang et al 2017 even though the 3 h time steps of sampling during rainfall in this study was higher frequency than the daily sampling conducted in the stagnant period we may have missed the true maximum concentrations of nr and n2o and expected hysteresis in a typical discharge concentration relationship for example nr hysteresis can occur on time scales from a few hours to a few days in small order streams depending on rainfall intensity and duration stream size or catchment area aguilera melack 2018 andrea et al 2006 plotting nox against water parameters revealed distinct clusters of samples fig 3 nox and 222rn in the stagnant samples plotted as a very different cluster to wet and rain nox exhibited a threshold limit of upstream soil storage and subsequent nox release at above 40 soil moisture fig 3d this is likely due to the solubility of nox and the flushing of soil storages as this catchment receives episodic heavy rainfall events and can experience surface runoff even with low soil moisture we suggest that rainfall events that occur above 40 soil moisture have stronger interactions with soil nox storages and flush nox downstream the general inverse relationship between don and nox r2 0 51 p 0 005 may suggest that the mineralization of don could be a source of nox however the 280 fold nox increase compared to a 70 fold don decrease indicates that don is not the major source of nox therefore flushing of nox from agricultural soils is the most apparent source of nox to the creek the similarities between populations of nox and 222rn may indicate that the source of nox is groundwater though the scale of increase in nox when compared to 222rn increases indicates a weak relationship and groundwater nox was extremely low fig 4 gardner et al 2016 estimated that groundwater contributed only up to 12 of biogenic n2o fluxes in catchments near chesapeake bay usa a nox first flush was also seen after the first major rain event indicating that nox had been stored in the shallow soil and flushed during rains van meter et al 2016 worrall et al 2015 n in fertilised soils can accumulate at rates of 68 191 g nr ha 1 day 1 van meter et al 2016 once saturated with rainfall soils may release this nr via overland runoff or groundwater flows van meter et al 2016 worrall et al 2015 since nox is water soluble the continued leaching from soils created pulses of high concentrations during rain events puckett 1994 indicating a first flush of soils lang et al 2013 nr modelling of catchments in a 900 km2 region of our study site estimate that if 3 of a catchment is agricultural there is an expected 3 5 fold increase in n losses to surrounding creeks and horticulture is the source of 87 of nr losses to creeks though only representing 3 of the land use hajati et al 2020 our po4 results are consistent with po4 binding to soil particles followed by sediment deposition within a few days vimpany lines kelly 2004 po4 may originate from the flushing of the upper soil zone 0 5 cm in p fertilised lands during rain events sharpley 1985 sharpley et al 1996 the mean n p ratio of double crossing creek was 36 0 3 7 in stagnant rising to 1535 538 in rain and 1248 214 in wet inorganic n p ratios and concentrations are useful predictors of algal composition and or the possibility of blooms in certain conditions zhang et al 2018 the redfield ratio of 16 n 1p is often considered the optimum ratio of nutrients for algal growth and ratios above or below 16 can indicate if a system is n limited or p limited howarth 1988 redfield 1934 slomp van cappellen 2004 the limiting nutrient in freshwater is often p whereas n is usually limited in estuaries and coastal marine systems fabricius 2005 redfield 1934 smith et al 2003 very high n p ratios after rainfall show that the creek was p limited in the water column indicating that release of p can facilitate algal growth the pulse of p on 4 february day 9 after a small rain event dropped the n p ratio to 3 indicating an n limited system for 24 h following this small rain event the o2 saturation dropped to 5 indicating hypoxia during this phase observed nutrient loads reflect the upstream fertiliser intensive land uses and the subsequent expected losses during and after rain events table 1 phase shifts were evident in nutrient loads nox loads in rain and wet respectively were 695 fold higher and 242 fold higher than stagnant our results suggest that surface runoff from episodic rain events rather than groundwater seepage are the major transport mechanism of nutrients to downstream waterways wadnerkar et al 2019 though we have no data on nutrient exports to the ocean beyond hearnes lake we suspect that the lake nr levels fluctuate relative to our time series station as the lake was rapidly draining to the ocean during the rain and wet periods there was likely export of large nr loads to the coastal zone when the lake was flushed mean aquatic nitrogen loads on the australian east coast are estimated at 2 7 g n ha 1 day 1 from global models seitzinger et al 2002 dissolved inorganic nitrogen din loads in the most populated areas of china europe and india can exceed 27 g n ha 1 day 1 seitzinger kroeze 1998 seitzinger et al 2002 n loading in the nearby tuckean swamp nsw where sugarcane is a major land use have been reported at 23 2 g n tdn ha 1 day 1 santos et al 2013 and n loading in a relatively pristine estuary at hat head nsw were reported at 0 82 g n no3 ha 1 day 1 sadat noori et al 2016 in nearby creeks dominated by intensive blueberry land use n load means were 59 7 g n nox ha 1 day 1 one order of magnitude higher than creeks with no blueberry horticulture white et al 2018 here our estimated tdn loads of 16 7 g n tdn ha 1 day 1 would be 6 1 fold greater than modelled data for the australian east coast and on the same order of magnitude as the tuckean swamp without the high temporal resolution of our study during rainfall capturing episodic hydrology the loads in this catchment may have been be severely underestimated assuming that all farmers in the catchment are using the recommended fertiliser dose and our results can be up scaled to annual loads the calculated fertiliser loss to waterways would be between 14 calculated on n nox and 16 calculated on n tdn these results are similar to white et al 2018 who estimated n losses in nearby catchments to be between 18 calculated on n nox and 25 calculated on n tdn 4 2 n2o emissions controls as the availability of nr species increases there is an increased likelihood of n2o production and subsequent release to the atmosphere barnes et al 2006 wong et al 2013 our mean estimates of water n2o emissions to the atmosphere over 66 days considering episodic flows 361 41 µmol m2 day 1 or 450 60 µmol m2 day 1 depending on assumptions are amongst the highest described in natural waterways reaching a maximum of 2859 µmol m2 day 1 following episodic rain events table 2 for example bange et al 1998 reported emissions between 0 3 and 7 2 µmol m2 day 1 near the oden estuary germany barnes and upstill goddard 2011 reported emissions between 2 4 and 76 8 µmol m2 day 1 in 7 estuaries in the uk de wilde and de bie 2000 found between 9 6 and 528 µmol m2 day 1 from the scheldt river in france dong et al 2005 reported between 4 3 and 266 µmol m2 day 1 from 10 uk estuaries hashimoto et al 1999 reported between 1 44 and 153 µmol m2 day 1 in tokyo bay in australia the brisbane river estuary was reported to emit between 2 16 and 76 8 µmol m2 day 1 musenze et al 2014 and coffs creek estuary was found to emit between 0 6 and 36 7 µmol m2 day 1 reading et al 2017 it is likely that n2o emissions in the small waterways upstream are far higher than our measured results due to losses along the stream length turner et al 2015 n2o was under saturated in estuarine conditions observed during the stagnant period though small upstream flows may have contained n2o that was lost before reaching our time series station our n2o emissions may be far greater than in other systems because we captured the high n2o emissions hot moments immediately after episodic rainfall driving pulses of nox while most previous studies relied on seasonal sampling that tend to occur during fair weather previous aquatic n2o investigations in australia focused on tidal time scales in estuaries reading et al 2017 or spatial surveys at two contrasting hydrological conditions reading et al 2020 our high frequency n2o observations at time scales of hours to days are unique and capture episodic rain events that are known to control nitrate loads in this region hajati et al 2020 we suggest that hot moments may be more important in yearly nr and n2o flux estimates for subtropical australia and highlight that monthly or seasonal sampling regimes may drastically underestimate yearly averages by missing hot moments during or just after rain events when sampling is often avoided due to logistical challenges high resolution sampling in hot moments is recommended for subtropical climates experiencing sporadic intense rainfall an n2o shifting sink and source behaviour is reflected in clusters of samples in scatter plots fig 5 the origin of n2o may be associated with flushing of n2o rich soils groundwater release and denitrification or nitrification between farm and sample site within the creek barnes et al 2006 statham 2012 wong et al 2013 since mean groundwater n2o saturation 281 61 was much lower than mean surface water saturation 1376 145 it is unlikely that groundwater is the major source of n2o to the creek gardner et al 2016 the dissolved n2o is likely a by product of nitrification and denitrification from upstream fertiliser runoff and seepage the concept of nutrient spiralling newbold 1992 describes that as nr moves via stream flow loss pathways are limited to gaseous denitrification of nox nitrification of nh4 fractional gaseous losses and downstream export short term assimilation to biota will be ultimately cycled instream though the fraction of loss of nr to n2o is often small the high surface area to volume ratios in headwater streams increase the probability of gaseous n exports alexander et al 2000 howarth et al 1996 therefore nitrification of nh4 and denitrification of nox coupled with episodic runoff from soils are likely the primary drivers of n2o in double crossing creek nitrification and denitrification are expected to be occurring in the farm sediments enwall et al 2010 as well as both the riparian hefting et al 2003 woodward et al 2009 and hyporheic zone duff et al 2008 duff triska 1990 with variable oxygen availability likely driving n2o production from nr cycling processes the legacy of n2o emissions in relation to agricultural runoff is not well understood the storage of nr in agricultural soils at rates between 68 and 191 g ha 1 day 1 van meter et al 2016 worrall et al 2015 suggests that the issue of legacy leaching and subsequent n2o emissions may be underrated though the efficiency of fertiliser use in agriculture has been improving it is possible that both current and legacy nr contribute to n2o emissions nr runoff from soils and associated downstream impacts may continue for years after cessation of agriculture grimvall et al 2000 mccrackin et al 2017 this legacy effect may lead to long term n2o emissions from soils riparian buffers and downstream ecosystems the addition of legacy groundwater discharge of waters enriched in nr from fertiliser use may cause greater concern santos et al 2017 though n2o values in groundwater are still quite low in this region fig 4 4 3 implications to greenhouse gas budgets greenhouse gas emissions are commonly calculated on 20 and 100 year timescales as co2 equivalents to account for the different atmospheric residence times and impacts of each gas neubauer megonigal 2015 2019 globally n2o is estimated to account for 6 2 of the total co2 eq annual anthropogenic ghgs pachauri et al 2014 our co2 eq 20 yr potential emissions and our n2o flux calculations show large variations between stagnant and rain periods fig 6 with an average contribution of n2o at 9 5 0 8 and 10 5 0 9 of sustained global warming potential sgwp co2 eq on 20 and 100 year timescales respectively neubauer megonigal 2015 2019 the largest contribution of n2o to co2 eq was 31 of co2 eq 20 yr sgwp following rain events when both nox and n2o were highest the scarcity of studies that incorporate flooding and hydrology raises the question of possible larger uncertainties in global models and budgets as runoff and leaching are an important n2o transport mechanism to streams additional time series observations are needed to capture extreme hydrological phase shifts particularly in under investigated subtropical waterways with episodic hydrology the two important assumptions to be considered when calculating indirect n2o n produced using the ipcc guidelines for national ghg budgets are emission factor ef5 and percentage of applied fertiliser that is leached fracleach h de klein et al 2006 currently the ef5 default value is 0 0075 with uncertainties ranging between 0 0005 and 0 025 and the default fracleach h is 0 3 with uncertainties ranging from 0 1 to 0 8 de klein et al 2006 recently tian et al 2019 suggested an updated ef5 value of 0 001 rather than the most recent ipcc value of 0 0075 previously 0 025 this continued alteration of ef5 values as well as calculation methods and categories highlights the need for more data from waterways in varied hydrological conditions our calculated n2o l n n2o n created via runoff and leaching from fertiliser inputs using the ipcc ef5 and fracleach h default values was 72 6 g n2o n day 1 assuming farming area weighted nr additions of recommended fertilisers and no other nr additions occur in the catchment our observed potential emissions are 4 2 fold less than this 17 1 g n2o n day 1 at the time series site 2 km downstream of the main fertiliser intensive land uses considering the losses anticipated along the 2 km distance between the source and sample yao et al 2020 our observed emissions downstream and the calculated catchment emissions are within reasonable ranges our observed ef5 value was 0 079 calculated as mean observed n2o loads divided by mean observed din loads this suggests that the recent lowering of the ipcc default ef5 value 0 025 to 0 0075 increases the accuracy of modelling equations syakila kroeze 2011 though the real value upstream of our site may be closer to 0 001 as suggested by tian et al 2019 overall our results show that failing to capture hot moments just after rain events likely underestimates the contribution of n2o to greenhouse gas budgets 4 4 conclusions a clear shift in nox and n2o trends was revealed in the time series within one day of the major rain event nox loads were extremely high at 14 5 0 3 g ha 1 day 1 or 15 of recommended fertilizer use revealing a strong influence of upstream land use on nr loads and phase shifting in the creek our n2o emissions estimates are exceptionally high reaching 2859 µmol m2 day 1 and averaging 450 60 µmol m2 day 1 there was an apparent relationship between nox and n2o as expected for waterways downstream of farmlands the origin of n2o is likely the coupled influences of episodic flushing of soil n2o and nox as well as denitrification and nitrification between farm and sample site the estimated n2o emissions 2 km downstream of farms were 0 079 of din loads 0 004 of applied fertiliser and 10 of the sustained global warming potential on 20 and 100 year timescales compared to the global average of 6 2 the high variation in the observations between stagnant rain and wet periods indicates that in australian waterways the strong influence of periodic hydrology must be accounted for failing to capture hot moments following rain events would lead to an underestimation of indirect n2o emissions to the

4724,nitrogen n leaching from agricultural systems is a global threat to waterways however indirect aquatic emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o from agricultural runoff remain poorly understood here we assess how episodic rain events flushing an agricultural catchment drive n radon a natural groundwater tracer and n2o emissions we reveal significant nitrate nitrite nox

observed n2o emissions and ipcc ef5 n2o emissions were 17 2 g n2o n day 1 and 72 6 g n2o n day 1 respectively estimated n2o emissions 2 km downstream of farms were 0 79 of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din loads and 0 04 of applied fertiliser aquatic n2o emissions represented 10 of the total co2 ch4 n2o co2 equivalent emissions which is 60 higher than the ipcc global n2o average episodic rain events rather than groundwater seepage traced by radon were the major drivers of both nox and n2o highlighting the importance of detailed sampling approaches to capture extreme emission variabilities in heavily fertilised catchments keywords methane hydrology nutrients carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is a powerful and long lived greenhouse gas ghg that contributes to the destruction of ozone in the atmosphere montzka et al 2011 portmann et al 2012 the sustained global warming potential sgwp of n2o is 250 times and 270 times the equivalent of carbon dioxide co2 on 20 and 100 year timescales respectively neubauer megonigal 2015 pre industrial levels of n2o in the atmosphere are estimated to be 270 ppb increasing at 0 73 per year in recent decades to current levels of 320 ppb codispoti 2010 schilt et al 2010b n2o is the third contributing 6 2 ghg following co2 76 and methane ch4 16 current partial pressures of atmospheric n2o are the highest in the last 800 000 years pachauri et al 2014 schilt et al 2010a tian et al 2019 agriculture which heavily uses nitrogen n fertilisers is thought to contribute 75 of global anthropogenic n2o to the atmosphere hensen et al 2013 nevison 2000 reay et al 2012 since the anthropogenic global n cycle turnover has increased 2 fold and the global demand for food is predicted to increase at 2 per year the link between food production and n2o emissions is becoming an important factor in global ghg models fao 2017 gruber galloway 2008 the production and emission of n2o in streams surrounding agriculture is largely dependent on reactive n availability skiba smith 2000 n2o can be produced during both nitrification and denitrification in soils saturated sediments and waterways bange 2006 statham 2012 the n2 n2o production ratio is influenced by many parameters notably nox concentrations dissolved o2 ph microbial communities redox potential carbon availability and temperature hefting et al 2003 walker et al 2002 n2o production is dependent on the presence of reactive n nr species dominantly nitrates nitrites nox and ammonium nh4 therefore the application of nr fertiliser and subsequent nr runoff to streams may contribute significantly to aquatic n2o emissions carpenter et al 1998 david et al 1997 fertiliser production has grown significantly in the past half century and is predicted to increase further with global population smil 1997 zhang et al 2015 following the increase in nr fertiliser use anthropogenic nitrogen inputs to streams more than tripled between the 1970s and the 1990s paerl scott 2010 seitzinger et al 2002 but little is known about related changes in aquatic n2o emissions derived from fertiliser runoff known as indirect emissions most n2o studies focus on direct soil emissions dalal et al 2003 oertel et al 2016 indirect emissions of n2o in waterways downstream of agriculture as a result of nr leaching and runoff have large uncertainties and remain poorly understood particularly in regions with episodic rather than seasonal rainfall patterns mosier et al 1998 reay et al 2012 tian et al 2019 headwater streams 4th order are estimated to contribute 85 of global riverine n2o emissions yao et al 2020 indirect emissions from agriculture are estimated to be the second highest contributor to global anthropogenic n2o emissions greater than human sewage animal waste atmospheric deposition and crop residue syakila kroeze 2011 uncertainties in the indirect aquatic emissions factors and the lack of field measurements both spatial and temporal make global n2o budgets uncertain reay et al 2012 syakila kroeze 2011 for example european agricultural indirect n2o emission uncertainties from waterways are 80 freibauer 2008 the increase of field n2o studies in recent decades has provided valuable data which reduce these uncertainties tian et al 2019 the recent additional indirect n2o research effort has resulted in a 50 reduction in global indirect n2o emission model estimates in addition the updated data has enabled the ipcc default n2o emission factor ef5 for indirect agricultural emissions to be reduced from 0 025 to 0 0075 kg n2o n kg 1n input syakila kroeze 2011 most of the available aquatic n2o data are from the northern hemisphere temperate systems where seasonal rainfall is typical with only a few investigations in the subtropical southern hemisphere where the annual hydrology is more dominated by episodic heavy rainfall musenze et al 2014 reading et al 2017 yao et al 2020 many studies do not capture rapid changes in rainfall and hydrology in contrast to seasonal rainfall patterns in better studied temperate regions subtropical australia experiences weeks to months of dry weather followed by short periods of intense episodic rainfall leading to short term pulses of nutrients into surrounding waterways in agricultural catchments white et al 2018 rain events are also well known to release nutrients to surface water via groundwater seepage burt arkell 1987 santos et al 2013 though the release of nitrogen pollution from farm to creek via groundwater often occurs on time scales of decades to centuries eckhardt stackelberg 1995 helena et al 2000 as a result the contribution of groundwater to n2o aquatic emissions remains poorly understood in many landscapes in this study we investigate how the heavy use of fertilisers will increase not only nitrate loads but also aquatic n2o emissions in a nearby waterway we describe detailed time series observations of dissolved n2o covering contrasting hydrological stages ranging from drought to flood in a subtropical creek draining a heavily fertilised landscape while we focus on n2o we also report co2 and ch4 data we build on the literature by 1 focusing on poorly investigated sub tropical systems 2 comparing n2o drivers during episodic rain events and during baseflow 3 establishing linkages between nr loads and n2o emissions and 4 putting n2o emissions in perspective to the other ghg emissions including co2 and ch4 2 methods 2 1 study area detailed time series observations covering 3 rain events were performed in double crossing creek 30 08 10 3 s 153 11 51 0 e on the east coast of subtropical australia fig 1 the creek drains to hearnes lake an intermittently closed and open lake or lagoon icoll with an open water surface area of 10 ha haines 2009 the catchment area is 6 8 km2 the region receives an average annual rainfall of 1685 mm per year with 60 of this rainfall occurring between january and may department of land and water conservation 2001 as an icoll hearnes lake has inconstant entrance conditions longshore currents continuously deliver sand across the mouth of the estuary periodically forming a sand barrier isolating hearnes lake from the ocean during the periods of mouth closure the lake accumulates fresh and saline groundwater as well as surface water flows via double crossing creek during rain events in high rainfall events the lake can fill and overtop the sand barrier scouring a new mouth and draining the lake when the mouth is open it is hydraulically connected to the pacific ocean allowing tidal flows in and out of the lake with an upper tidal limit of 2 km haines 2009 underlying geology in the catchment is derived from hornblende bearing volcanic lithic sandstone and the current parent rock is comprised of sandstones and mudstones argillite greywacke and slate haines 2009 the upper catchment soil is moderately deep well drained podzolic and kraznozem soil whilst the areas closer to the upper creek are deep poorly drained humic clays department of land and water conservation 1999 the barrier sand berm is comprised of well drained siliceous sands and the lake sediment is made up of peaty podzols and sandy acidic peat department of land and water conservation 1999 within the catchment there are increasing pressures driven by agricultural and urban development as well as groundwater extraction haines 2009 between september 2002 and december 2017 the catchment land use has changed from 0 5 to 15 9 blueberry farms and 19 to 4 banana farms conrad et al 2018 2019 google earth pro 2018 roper et al 2011 estimated that base flow increased 48 and surface flow increased 10 1 post clearing of the catchment for agricultural purposes regional blueberry dominated catchments are known to have high loads of nitrogen in creeks white et al 2018 particularly during rain events approximately 23 of the catchment is currently fertilised 69 of the fertilised land use is occupied by blueberry farms and the other 31 is comprised of banana macadamia avocado and nursery horticulture fertilisers are applied to blueberries in soil via drip irrigation approximately twice weekly though the timing of fertiliser application and the fertiliser recipe varies from farm to farm with growth cycle and weather patterns cucumbers are grown in woodchip media fertilised by drippers at rates of 2 l plant 1 day 1 during daylight hours in 13 week cycles grewal et al 2011 cucumber grow bags can become highly saline due to nutrient application so flushing of the bags is necessary leading to runoff into surrounding soils and eventually creeks burt 2007 grewal et al 2011 data on fertilisation rates and application times are not available therefore we assume that farmers are applying the recommended doses in our calculations blueberries are assumed to require 121 kg n ha 1 yr 1 doughty et al 1988 bananas require 100 kg n ha 1 yr 1 newley et al 2008 cucumbers in hothouses require 270 kg n ha 1 yr 1 shen et al 2010 and other horticulture macadamia avocado and nursery uses 100 kg n ha 1 yr 1 therefore the relative contribution to total fertiliser input load calculated on area and fertiliser application rates upstream of our study site is from blueberries 67 7 bananas 14 2 cucumbers 12 1 and other horticulture 6 0 2 2 sampling and analysis the time series observations

107 occasions 27th january to 4th april 2018 to cover multiple rain events discrete samples were taken at 9 am daily during the stagnant period during rain periods 20 mm in a day sampling frequency was increased to every 3 hrs to capture episodic flows dissolved nutrients phosphate po4 nitrate nitrite nox ammonium nh4 and total dissolved n tdn were sampled using a sample rinsed 60 ml polyethylene syringe 0 7 μm glass fibre syringe filters were used to filter samples into a sample rinsed 10 ml polyethylene sample tube kept on ice and in darkness for 5 h before being frozen nutrients po4 nox and nh4 were analysed colourimetrically using a lachat flow injection analyser fia concentrations of total dissolved n tdn were determined colourimetrically using an fia post persulfate digestion dissolved organic nitrogen don was determined as tdn minus nox and nh4 the detection limits and analytical approach is further described in eyre and ferguson 2005 insights into groundwater inflows were obtained with 222rn a natural radiogenic tracer 222rn is used routinely to examine surface water and groundwater connectivity cook et al 2003 ellins et al 1990 hamada et al 1997 two durridge company gas equilibration shower head systems dulaiova et al 2005 were set up to receive 1 l of creek water per minute the equilibrated headspace air in the device was pumped through a closed gas loop via drierite desiccant to a rad7 radon in air detection device durridge company radon partitioning between liquid and gas was calculated using temperature and salinity data schubert et al 2012 222rn dpm l 1 observations were made every 10 mins for 66 days and data was integrated to every 3 h to match n2o observations the detection limits and approach are described in detail elsewhere burnett et al 2001 ghgs n2o ch4 and co2 were sampled by syringing 500 ml of gas from within the two shower head gas equilibration devices to gas tight sample bags supelco company gas in the bags was analysed on a picarro g2308 calibrated before and after sampling erler et al 2015 the gas partial pressures in water were calculated based on the equilibrator gas and solubility constants that are a function of salinity and temperature weiss 1974 weiss price 1980 yamamoto et al 1976 groundwater was further investigated by sampling nutrients and ghgs from six bores throughout the catchment using the above equipment fig 1 sampling of 222rn was done using 6 l of bore water in custom gas sampling bottles stringer burnett 2004 returning to the lab and connecting these in a closed loop including desiccant to a rad7 lee kim 2006 and circulating air for 2 h samples were taken at 10 min intervals polonium 218po t1 2 3 10 min counts were used to calculate 222rn dpm l 1 accounting for time lag between sampling and gas analysis as well as the volume of water and air burnett et al 2001 lee kim 2006 2 3 calculations the catchment upstream of the site was identified using a watershed delineation in environmental systems research institute esri arcgis mapping software geoscience australia 2015 esri mapping software aerial imagery and field scouting were used as well as consultation with local landholders and local council staff enabling classification of the catchment into land uses based on december 2017 imagery google earth pro 2018 land and property information nsw 2017 we use runoff data from the australian bureau of meteorology landscape water balance model australian bureau of meteorology 2018a a widely used model in data poor regions of australia hajati et al 2020 nguyen et al 2019 wadnerkar et al 2021 the model is calibrated against 782 unregulated and unimpaired catchment gauging stations and is validated by 291 unimpaired catchments with soil moisture evapotranspiration and recharge data frost et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 four of these stations are within 30 km from our site representing similar climatic and geomorphological conditions there is no published data on error margins for daily estimates available from the model or within our catchment an onsite rain gauge was used to collect rain data with rainfall recorded at each of the 107 discrete samples wind data was retrieved from coffs harbour airport australian bureau of meteorology 2018b depth was measured using an in situ unidata starflow ultrasonic doppler current velocity was calculated using horizontal area depth runoff and catchment area australian bureau of meteorology 2018a data summaries are means and standard error unless otherwise noted one way anova with tukeys post hoc analysis was performed using independent samples to assess differences between nutrients in different hydrological stages the load of nutrients was calculated by simply multiplying concentrations by discharge and dividing by catchment area fertiliser loss to the creek at the time series site was calculated using the recommended fertiliser dose for each crop multiplied by the area occupied by each crop blueberries 9075 kg yr 1 cucumbers 5908 kg yr 1 bananas 1890 kg yr 1 and other horticulture 800 kg yr 1 and dividing the sum of fertiliser applied by the mean creek flux of nr species fluxes of gases at the boundary of air and water were calculated using f k α δ p n 2 o where k is the piston velocity gas transfer coefficient α is the solubility coefficient weiss price 1980 and δpn2o is the variance between atmospheric n2o and the water partial pressure air water gradient we used two piston velocity models that take into account flow velocity wind speed and depth for k to estimate a range of n2o flux potentials the raymond and cole 2001 model was determined for estuaries as a function of wind and depth while the piston velocity model of borges et al 2004 was determined for three estuaries using wind depth and current the k values were aligned with in situ schmidt numbers at k600 using salinity and temperature assuming linear salinity dependence between 0 and 35 ppm constant atmospheric n2o of 0 326 ppm from air sampling was used in calculations the fluxes of ch4 and co2 were calculated using similar methods and equations available in wanninkhof 2014 co2 equivalent co2 eq emissions are calculated using equations of solubility yamamoto et al 1976 as well as 20 yr and 100 yr sustained global warming potential sgwp estimations neubauer megonigal 2015 sgwp converts ghg units into one standard unit of co2 eq global warming potential gwp is a commonly used metric for comparing ghgs with different lifetimes relative radiative forcing and cycling neubauer megonigal 2015 however sgwp is the preferred radiative forcing estimation over gwp since gwp is only estimated as a one time pulse of a ghg to the atmosphere and sgwp treats gas emissions as persistent fluxes myhre et al 2013 to compare our measured results to the ipcc indirect emissions model we use the updated default ef5 emission factor 0 0075 kg n2o n kg 1n uncertainty range 0 025 to 0 0005 kg n2o n kg 1n as well as the default leaching and runoff value 0 3 fracleach h uncertainty range 0 1 to 0 8 fracleach h de klein et al 2006 3 results during the 66 day sampling 3 rain events 50 mm day 1 day 28 24 february 107 mm day 38 6 march 83 mm day 56 24 march 161 mm occurred that drove abrupt changes in hydrology fig 2 and water quality three hydrological stages were defined a dry period stagnant 50 mm rain per day three rain periods rain 50 mm of rain per day and the following day and wet periods wet days after 50 mm of rain hereafter we refer to these classifications as stagnant rain and wet during the stagnant period salinity at the time series site was 20 ppt and flow was negligible the downstream lake was closed to the ocean though was likely influenced by saline groundwater exchange haines 2009 initial scoping surveys before the experiment revealed that the lake downstream of our site was saline 38 1 5 2 ppt salinity n 5 and the salinity gradient extended up to our monitoring site 19 4 ppt as the lake and creek up to our monitoring site were dominantly standing water saline groundwater exchange and evaporation during the dry period summer months may have influenced salinity at our monitoring site the rainfall on 24 february day 28 was sufficient to trigger the downstream icoll drainage to the ocean with a drop of 0 84 m depth in only 48 h the icoll remained open to the pacific ocean during the remainder of the time series the total change in depth was 1 9 m from maximum to minimum a clear shift in nox and n2o was seen before and after the rainfall on 24 february day 28 fig 3 the stagnant period was characterised by high salinity and high don whilst n2o nox and nh4 were low conversely during rain and wet periods low salinity and don and supersaturated n2o 34 fold and 27 fold higher than stagnant in rain and wet respectively on average were observed the nox values were 145 fold and 105 fold higher in the rain and wet periods respectively compared to stagnant nh4 was 1 8 fold higher in rain than stagnant and 2 9 fold higher in wet than stagnant 222rn was 3 fold higher in rain and 2 5 fold higher in wet than stagnant periods the po4 concentrations increase substantially as a pulse during rain exceeding stagnant or wet conditions by a factor of 4 groundwater samples had mean nox concentrations and n2o saturations 330 fold and 8 fold lower than surface water in rain respectively providing initial evidence that groundwater discharge cannot account for surface water values anoxic groundwater exchange driven by density inversions during the upstream propagation of the salt wedge santos et al 2012a may have influenced salinity do and n speciation prior to the rainfall events in february and march however we do not have data on hyporheic zone groundwater flows the creek shifted from being a sink of atmospheric n2o during stagnant conditions to a source of n2o to the atmosphere during the wet and rain periods in rain n2o reached the highest level at 5655 saturation 41 1 of total samples 15 8 rain and 25 2 wet were between 1000 and 5655 saturation results of post hoc anova revealed n2o was significantly different p 0 01 between rain and stagnant as well as wet and stagnant periods the water was never under saturated with either co2 or ch4 calculated mean co2 ch4 and n2o potential emissions were 243347 2438 g co2 day 1 36 1 3 9 g ch4 day 1 and 17 1 2 1 g n2o day 1 4 discussion 4 1 phase shifts in nutrient drivers our time series revealed clear phase shifts in the nutrient loads during different hydrologic conditions suggesting an interaction between the flushing hypothesis for nox creed band 1998 li et al 2017 and the groundwater flow hypothesis for both nox and 222rn burt arkell 1987 yang et al 2017 even though the 3 h time steps of sampling during rainfall in this study was higher frequency than the daily sampling conducted in the stagnant period we may have missed the true maximum concentrations of nr and n2o and expected hysteresis in a typical discharge concentration relationship for example nr hysteresis can occur on time scales from a few hours to a few days in small order streams depending on rainfall intensity and duration stream size or catchment area aguilera melack 2018 andrea et al 2006 plotting nox against water parameters revealed distinct clusters of samples fig 3 nox and 222rn in the stagnant samples plotted as a very different cluster to wet and rain nox exhibited a threshold limit of upstream soil storage and subsequent nox release at above 40 soil moisture fig 3d this is likely due to the solubility of nox and the flushing of soil storages as this catchment receives episodic heavy rainfall events and can experience surface runoff even with low soil moisture we suggest that rainfall events that occur above 40 soil moisture have stronger interactions with soil nox storages and flush nox downstream the general inverse relationship between don and nox r2 0 51 p 0 005 may suggest that the mineralization of don could be a source of nox however the 280 fold nox increase compared to a 70 fold don decrease indicates that don is not the major source of nox therefore flushing of nox from agricultural soils is the most apparent source of nox to the creek the similarities between populations of nox and 222rn may indicate that the source of nox is groundwater though the scale of increase in nox when compared to 222rn increases indicates a weak relationship and groundwater nox was extremely low fig 4 gardner et al 2016 estimated that groundwater contributed only up to 12 of biogenic n2o fluxes in catchments near chesapeake bay usa a nox first flush was also seen after the first major rain event indicating that nox had been stored in the shallow soil and flushed during rains van meter et al 2016 worrall et al 2015 n in fertilised soils can accumulate at rates of 68 191 g nr ha 1 day 1 van meter et al 2016 once saturated with rainfall soils may release this nr via overland runoff or groundwater flows van meter et al 2016 worrall et al 2015 since nox is water soluble the continued leaching from soils created pulses of high concentrations during rain events puckett 1994 indicating a first flush of soils lang et al 2013 nr modelling of catchments in a 900 km2 region of our study site estimate that if 3 of a catchment is agricultural there is an expected 3 5 fold increase in n losses to surrounding creeks and horticulture is the source of 87 of nr losses to creeks though only representing 3 of the land use hajati et al 2020 our po4 results are consistent with po4 binding to soil particles followed by sediment deposition within a few days vimpany lines kelly 2004 po4 may originate from the flushing of the upper soil zone 0 5 cm in p fertilised lands during rain events sharpley 1985 sharpley et al 1996 the mean n p ratio of double crossing creek was 36 0 3 7 in stagnant rising to 1535 538 in rain and 1248 214 in wet inorganic n p ratios and concentrations are useful predictors of algal composition and or the possibility of blooms in certain conditions zhang et al 2018 the redfield ratio of 16 n 1p is often considered the optimum ratio of nutrients for algal growth and ratios above or below 16 can indicate if a system is n limited or p limited howarth 1988 redfield 1934 slomp van cappellen 2004 the limiting nutrient in freshwater is often p whereas n is usually limited in estuaries and coastal marine systems fabricius 2005 redfield 1934 smith et al 2003 very high n p ratios after rainfall show that the creek was p limited in the water column indicating that release of p can facilitate algal growth the pulse of p on 4 february day 9 after a small rain event dropped the n p ratio to 3 indicating an n limited system for 24 h following this small rain event the o2 saturation dropped to 5 indicating hypoxia during this phase observed nutrient loads reflect the upstream fertiliser intensive land uses and the subsequent expected losses during and after rain events table 1 phase shifts were evident in nutrient loads nox loads in rain and wet respectively were 695 fold higher and 242 fold higher than stagnant our results suggest that surface runoff from episodic rain events rather than groundwater seepage are the major transport mechanism of nutrients to downstream waterways wadnerkar et al 2019 though we have no data on nutrient exports to the ocean beyond hearnes lake we suspect that the lake nr levels fluctuate relative to our time series station as the lake was rapidly draining to the ocean during the rain and wet periods there was likely export of large nr loads to the coastal zone when the lake was flushed mean aquatic nitrogen loads on the australian east coast are estimated at 2 7 g n ha 1 day 1 from global models seitzinger et al 2002 dissolved inorganic nitrogen din loads in the most populated areas of china europe and india can exceed 27 g n ha 1 day 1 seitzinger kroeze 1998 seitzinger et al 2002 n loading in the nearby tuckean swamp nsw where sugarcane is a major land use have been reported at 23 2 g n tdn ha 1 day 1 santos et al 2013 and n loading in a relatively pristine estuary at hat head nsw were reported at 0 82 g n no3 ha 1 day 1 sadat noori et al 2016 in nearby creeks dominated by intensive blueberry land use n load means were 59 7 g n nox ha 1 day 1 one order of magnitude higher than creeks with no blueberry horticulture white et al 2018 here our estimated tdn loads of 16 7 g n tdn ha 1 day 1 would be 6 1 fold greater than modelled data for the australian east coast and on the same order of magnitude as the tuckean swamp without the high temporal resolution of our study during rainfall capturing episodic hydrology the loads in this catchment may have been be severely underestimated assuming that all farmers in the catchment are using the recommended fertiliser dose and our results can be up scaled to annual loads the calculated fertiliser loss to waterways would be between 14 calculated on n nox and 16 calculated on n tdn these results are similar to white et al 2018 who estimated n losses in nearby catchments to be between 18 calculated on n nox and 25 calculated on n tdn 4 2 n2o emissions controls as the availability of nr species increases there is an increased likelihood of n2o production and subsequent release to the atmosphere barnes et al 2006 wong et al 2013 our mean estimates of water n2o emissions to the atmosphere over 66 days considering episodic flows 361 41 µmol m2 day 1 or 450 60 µmol m2 day 1 depending on assumptions are amongst the highest described in natural waterways reaching a maximum of 2859 µmol m2 day 1 following episodic rain events table 2 for example bange et al 1998 reported emissions between 0 3 and 7 2 µmol m2 day 1 near the oden estuary germany barnes and upstill goddard 2011 reported emissions between 2 4 and 76 8 µmol m2 day 1 in 7 estuaries in the uk de wilde and de bie 2000 found between 9 6 and 528 µmol m2 day 1 from the scheldt river in france dong et al 2005 reported between 4 3 and 266 µmol m2 day 1 from 10 uk estuaries hashimoto et al 1999 reported between 1 44 and 153 µmol m2 day 1 in tokyo bay in australia the brisbane river estuary was reported to emit between 2 16 and 76 8 µmol m2 day 1 musenze et al 2014 and coffs creek estuary was found to emit between 0 6 and 36 7 µmol m2 day 1 reading et al 2017 it is likely that n2o emissions in the small waterways upstream are far higher than our measured results due to losses along the stream length turner et al 2015 n2o was under saturated in estuarine conditions observed during the stagnant period though small upstream flows may have contained n2o that was lost before reaching our time series station our n2o emissions may be far greater than in other systems because we captured the high n2o emissions hot moments immediately after episodic rainfall driving pulses of nox while most previous studies relied on seasonal sampling that tend to occur during fair weather previous aquatic n2o investigations in australia focused on tidal time scales in estuaries reading et al 2017 or spatial surveys at two contrasting hydrological conditions reading et al 2020 our high frequency n2o observations at time scales of hours to days are unique and capture episodic rain events that are known to control nitrate loads in this region hajati et al 2020 we suggest that hot moments may be more important in yearly nr and n2o flux estimates for subtropical australia and highlight that monthly or seasonal sampling regimes may drastically underestimate yearly averages by missing hot moments during or just after rain events when sampling is often avoided due to logistical challenges high resolution sampling in hot moments is recommended for subtropical climates experiencing sporadic intense rainfall an n2o shifting sink and source behaviour is reflected in clusters of samples in scatter plots fig 5 the origin of n2o may be associated with flushing of n2o rich soils groundwater release and denitrification or nitrification between farm and sample site within the creek barnes et al 2006 statham 2012 wong et al 2013 since mean groundwater n2o saturation 281 61 was much lower than mean surface water saturation 1376 145 it is unlikely that groundwater is the major source of n2o to the creek gardner et al 2016 the dissolved n2o is likely a by product of nitrification and denitrification from upstream fertiliser runoff and seepage the concept of nutrient spiralling newbold 1992 describes that as nr moves via stream flow loss pathways are limited to gaseous denitrification of nox nitrification of nh4 fractional gaseous losses and downstream export short term assimilation to biota will be ultimately cycled instream though the fraction of loss of nr to n2o is often small the high surface area to volume ratios in headwater streams increase the probability of gaseous n exports alexander et al 2000 howarth et al 1996 therefore nitrification of nh4 and denitrification of nox coupled with episodic runoff from soils are likely the primary drivers of n2o in double crossing creek nitrification and denitrification are expected to be occurring in the farm sediments enwall et al 2010 as well as both the riparian hefting et al 2003 woodward et al 2009 and hyporheic zone duff et al 2008 duff triska 1990 with variable oxygen availability likely driving n2o production from nr cycling processes the legacy of n2o emissions in relation to agricultural runoff is not well understood the storage of nr in agricultural soils at rates between 68 and 191 g ha 1 day 1 van meter et al 2016 worrall et al 2015 suggests that the issue of legacy leaching and subsequent n2o emissions may be underrated though the efficiency of fertiliser use in agriculture has been improving it is possible that both current and legacy nr contribute to n2o emissions nr runoff from soils and associated downstream impacts may continue for years after cessation of agriculture grimvall et al 2000 mccrackin et al 2017 this legacy effect may lead to long term n2o emissions from soils riparian buffers and downstream ecosystems the addition of legacy groundwater discharge of waters enriched in nr from fertiliser use may cause greater concern santos et al 2017 though n2o values in groundwater are still quite low in this region fig 4 4 3 implications to greenhouse gas budgets greenhouse gas emissions are commonly calculated on 20 and 100 year timescales as co2 equivalents to account for the different atmospheric residence times and impacts of each gas neubauer megonigal 2015 2019 globally n2o is estimated to account for 6 2 of the total co2 eq annual anthropogenic ghgs pachauri et al 2014 our co2 eq 20 yr potential emissions and our n2o flux calculations show large variations between stagnant and rain periods fig 6 with an average contribution of n2o at 9 5 0 8 and 10 5 0 9 of sustained global warming potential sgwp co2 eq on 20 and 100 year timescales respectively neubauer megonigal 2015 2019 the largest contribution of n2o to co2 eq was 31 of co2 eq 20 yr sgwp following rain events when both nox and n2o were highest the scarcity of studies that incorporate flooding and hydrology raises the question of possible larger uncertainties in global models and budgets as runoff and leaching are an important n2o transport mechanism to streams additional time series observations are needed to capture extreme hydrological phase shifts particularly in under investigated subtropical waterways with episodic hydrology the two important assumptions to be considered when calculating indirect n2o n produced using the ipcc guidelines for national ghg budgets are emission factor ef5 and percentage of applied fertiliser that is leached fracleach h de klein et al 2006 currently the ef5 default value is 0 0075 with uncertainties ranging between 0 0005 and 0 025 and the default fracleach h is 0 3 with uncertainties ranging from 0 1 to 0 8 de klein et al 2006 recently tian et al 2019 suggested an updated ef5 value of 0 001 rather than the most recent ipcc value of 0 0075 previously 0 025 this continued alteration of ef5 values as well as calculation methods and categories highlights the need for more data from waterways in varied hydrological conditions our calculated n2o l n n2o n created via runoff and leaching from fertiliser inputs using the ipcc ef5 and fracleach h default values was 72 6 g n2o n day 1 assuming farming area weighted nr additions of recommended fertilisers and no other nr additions occur in the catchment our observed potential emissions are 4 2 fold less than this 17 1 g n2o n day 1 at the time series site 2 km downstream of the main fertiliser intensive land uses considering the losses anticipated along the 2 km distance between the source and sample yao et al 2020 our observed emissions downstream and the calculated catchment emissions are within reasonable ranges our observed ef5 value was 0 079 calculated as mean observed n2o loads divided by mean observed din loads this suggests that the recent lowering of the ipcc default ef5 value 0 025 to 0 0075 increases the accuracy of modelling equations syakila kroeze 2011 though the real value upstream of our site may be closer to 0 001 as suggested by tian et al 2019 overall our results show that failing to capture hot moments just after rain events likely underestimates the contribution of n2o to greenhouse gas budgets 4 4 conclusions a clear shift in nox and n2o trends was revealed in the time series within one day of the major rain event nox loads were extremely high at 14 5 0 3 g ha 1 day 1 or 15 of recommended fertilizer use revealing a strong influence of upstream land use on nr loads and phase shifting in the creek our n2o emissions estimates are exceptionally high reaching 2859 µmol m2 day 1 and averaging 450 60 µmol m2 day 1 there was an apparent relationship between nox and n2o as expected for waterways downstream of farmlands the origin of n2o is likely the coupled influences of episodic flushing of soil n2o and nox as well as denitrification and nitrification between farm and sample site the estimated n2o emissions 2 km downstream of farms were 0 079 of din loads 0 004 of applied fertiliser and 10 of the sustained global warming potential on 20 and 100 year timescales compared to the global average of 6 2 the high variation in the observations between stagnant rain and wet periods indicates that in australian waterways the strong influence of periodic hydrology must be accounted for failing to capture hot moments following rain events would lead to an underestimation of indirect n2o emissions to the
