studies on the calculation of three dimensional fractal dimension lacunarity and succolarity for reservoir rocks in addition information of how permeability is influenced by these fractal parameters for different microstructures of reservoir rock is lacking in this paper three dimensional estimates of the fractal dimension lacunarity and succolarity are computed based on the box counting methods firstly the programs are verified with standard self similar porous media based on the validated programs binary micro ct images of twelve core samples from a sandstone reservoir are used to calculate the fractal dimension lacunarity and succolarity the porosity and permeability of the cores are obtained by experimental measurement by analyzing the calculation and measurement results the findings reveal convincing statistical relationships between the porosity fractal structure parameters and the permeability 2 methods 2 1 reservoir core information and images scanned using micro ct twelve core samples from a sandstone reservoir in xunyi county shaanxi province china were selected to study the relationship between permeability and fractal structure parameters the formation in this area belongs to the triassic yanchang formation the reservoir layer is tight low porosity and poor permeability porosity and permeability data for the twelve core samples were obtained by laboratory testing the specific procedures of porosity testing are as follows firstly the pre treated core is placed in the core chamber and vacuumed and then helium gas in a standard air chamber is isothermally expanded into the core after the whole system is balanced the porosity of the core can be calculated according to boyle s law permeability is obtained by supplying high pressure nitrogen gas through the pre treated core and measuring the pressure difference and flow rate at both ends of the core when the gas flow is stable note the axial direction of the core was the test direction for the permeability i e the z direction in the binary images the twelve core samples were scanned by micro ct using a versaxrm 500 micro ct scanner the source voltage exposure time 2d projection quantity and resolution are 90 kv 30 s 3600 and 1 μm respectively the original images obtained by micro ct scanning had a volume of 10003 μm3 and are shown in fig 1 along with the corresponding processed images used for the calculation of fractal structure parameters the process included de noising processed by median filter and gaussian filter methods cropping extract a square sub volume in the center of core and binarization processed by interactive thresholding method to make a global thresholding segmentation and to get binary images all image processing steps were completed using the avizo 9 software the two dimensional contrast images before and after processing are also shown in fig 1 after image processing all the binary sample images have a volume of 5123 μm3 2 2 fractal dimension calculation in fractal geometry theory the fractal dimension is an important parameter to characterize scale invariant physical properties according to fractal definitions there are many fractal dimensions to describe the physical properties of porous media from different perspectives in binary images porous media are comprised of solids and voids according to fractal theory only one of these two phases can be fractal i e if one phase is fractal then the other phase is euclidean scaling crawford and matsui 1996 however it is unknown a priori which is the fractal phase therefore before using the fractal dimension to characterize the structural characteristics of a porous medium we must firstly determine the fractal phase i e pores or the rock skeleton box counting is the most common and efficient calculation method for estimating the fractal dimension from images and it is also the method we selected in this study in the box counting algorithm boxes of different length scales r are used to cover the images and the number of boxes n covering pores and the rock skeleton are recorded separately fig 2 the principles of the box counting algorithm for two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d images are almost identical the only difference is that the 2d images are covered with square tiles of area r 2 whereas the 3d images are covered with cubic boxes of volume r 3 in this study we generated a code for the cubic box counting method in matlab and used it to calculate the 3d fractal dimensions for the binary micro ct images of twelve core samples the bi phase box counting method perfect and donnelly 2015 was used in this study to identify the fractal phase by fitting both phases conjointly using the following equations 1a log n b log k b d log x log n w log k w 3 log x 1b log n w log k w d log x log n b log k b 3 log x 1c log n w log k w 3 log x log n b log k b 3 log x where d is the 3d fractal dimension k is the number intercept the subscripts b and w denote the black and white phases respectively and is the logical and operator eqs 1a and 1b assume that one of the phases is fractal while the complementary phase follows euclidean power law scaling for eq 1a the black phase is fractal and the white phase is euclidean while in eq 1b the white phase is fractal and the black phase is euclidean for eq 1c neither phase is fractal since both phases follow euclidean power law scaling non linear regression was used to fit eq 1 to the three dimensional box counting results for both phases in order to decide which phase is fractal and which is euclidean based on the residual sum of squares rss table 1 the equation producing the lowest rss value is selected as the most appropriate model for each core the results of the bi phase box counting analyses for the twelve sandstone core samples are summarized in table 1 it can be seen that eq 1a provided the best fit statistics for all twelve cores with rss values on average 1 3rd of those for the other models this means that all twelve cores can be considered pore fractals with pore fractal dimensions ranging from 2 68 to 2 82 therefore in this study we selected the pore fractal dimension to describe the scaling complexity of pore space 2 3 lacunarity calculation lacunarity is a characteristic of the clustering frequency and size of the measurement object in images the measured object can be particles pores or fluids in pores in a porous medium the lacunarity is positively related to the degree of object aggregation in most of physical processes lacunarity integrates the feature of spatial translation invariance in some cases different objects may have the same fractal dimension but can then be distinguished by lacunarity because the focus of this study is permeability we investigated the lacunarity of the pore phase in the 2d gliding box algorithm using a square box with a side of r gliding on 2d image the center point of the box moves continuously at adjacent pixel locations shown as fig 2 the process records how many pores are in the box marks it as m and the number of boxes as n m r then divides it by the total number of gliding boxes to get the probability density function q m r for self similar images q m r is related to the box side length r and the image side length l in order to facilitate the analysis of the probability density function q m r a statistical moments function is constructed as 2 z q q r m m q q m r the lacunarity λ r can be defined as the statistical moments function when q 2 divided by squared value of q 1 for z allain and cloitre 1991 3 λ r z q 2 r z q 1 r 2 the maximum and minimum values of upper and lower bounds of lacunarity are λ max λ 1 1 ϕ and λ min λ l 1 ϕ is porosity respectively the value of λ max shows that different values of ϕ will change the value of lacunarity in order to eliminate the effect of porosity on the analysis of lacunarity the calculated value from the gliding box algorithm is normalized the normalized formula is roy et al 2010 4 λ r λ r λ min λ max λ min ϕ λ r 1 1 ϕ lacunarity normalization has two advantages first logarithmic transformation is not required because the lacunarity is unified between r 1 and r l second the effect of ϕ is eliminated and eq 4 only reflects the influence of the pore clustering like the box counting method the gliding box algorithm for calculating 3d lacunarity applies a cubic box with a side of r gliding on the 3d image to calculate q m r then according to eqs 2 3 and 4 the value of 3d lacunarity can be obtained the 2d lacunarity characterizes the clustering of pore areas within a plane while the 3d lacunarity characterizes the concentration of pore volumes in 3d space we used the 3d gliding box algorithm to calculate the lacunarity of the ct scan images and employed 2d numerical reconstructions to verify the effectiveness of the method 2 4 succolarity calculation succolarity is also a key parameter in fractal geometry theory it is used to measure the connectivity of an image in different directions in the present context it can characterize the ability of a fluid to move within a porous medium namely it quantifies the extent that a fluid will permeate or flow into pores succolarity as well as lacunarity can also distinguish different pore structures with the same fractal dimension the method for calculating succolarity was presented by de melo and conci 2013 they apply an ideal box counting method to an image in the 2d succolarity calculation method the first step is to provide a virtual pressure field for four directions on the image the pressure field is assigned as top to bottom and bottom to top in the vertical direction left to right and right to left in the horizontal direction the magnitudes of the pressure in each direction are determined by the number of image pixels and the size of measurement box in the second step the flow is simulated in the first row column of pore pixels in each initial pressure direction of the image and the simulated fluid will fill all the connected pore pixels in each direction the solid pixels do not allow fluid to flow and form non flow boundaries within the confines of the image in the third step based on the ideal box counting method succolarity is estimated by changing the size of measurement box in the image this step divides the fluid flow area of the previous step into the equal size of box which is denoted as bs k k is the number of possible divisions of an image in boxes then the percentage of occupation for each box size of image is denoted as op bs k in the fourth step for each box size k the expression of pressure occupation value is as follows 5 k 1 n o p b s k p r b s k p c where n is the number of possible divisions and represents the central pressure of the box k this can take the pressure in horizontal or vertical directions the pressure varies with the box size and it also depends on the position of the box such as initial row or column 6a pr 0 5 b other row or column 6b pr 0 5 l 1 b in the fifth step in order to make the succolarity value dimensionless like the fractal dimension and lacunarity succolarity can be characterized as the pressure occupation value eq 5 divided by the maximum possible occupation value 7 su b s k d i r k 1 n op b s k p r b s k p c k 1 n op b s k max p r b s k p c where dir represents the direction for example left to right in 3d succolarity calculation method the virtual pressure fields are added to the 3d image in six directions then it simulates the fluid flow and 3d succolarity is obtained by calculating the percentage of pressure occupation with eqs 5 and 7 the procedure is similar to the 2d succolarity calculation method based on eq 7 we define the two dimensional anisotropy ratio λ as 8 λ s u b s k b t s u b s k t b s u b s k l r s u b s k r l where dir bt tb lr and rl signifies the bottom to top top to bottom left to right and right to left directions respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 algorithm verification the calculation methods for the fractal dimension lacunarity and succolarity given in the above section are all based on box counting methods thus we first validated the box counting algorithm by calculating the fractal dimensions of standard self similar 2d and 3d fractal structures fig 3 shows the third order sierpinski carpet and the second order menger sponge the results from our program were identical to the ideal values of 1 8928 and 2 7268 for the fractal dimensions of the white fractal phase of the carpet and the grey fractal phase of the sponge respectively this clearly demonstrates the validity of our box counting program for calculating the fractal dimension after verifying the box counting method for the basic calculation of fractal dimension the next step is to verify the calculation of lacunarity and succolarity using complex porous structures these structures were constructed by the random generation growth algorithm wang et al 2007 wang and pan 2008 as shown in fig 4 two sets of patterns were generated to represent two dimensional porous media for the images in fig 4 a the porosity was fixed at 0 10 while the generated images were changed to produce different degrees of heterogeneity the calculated lacunarities obtained at the length scale r 4 for the selected images respectively were 9 03 6 16 and 3 08 from left to right in fig 4 a the results show that the lacunarity decreases with the visual degree of pore clustering in the images from left to right fig 4 b depicts three 2d porous patterns also generated using the random generation growth algorithm the construction porosity was fixed at 0 30 and the direction growth probability of the three porous media was changed to achieve different degrees of anisotropy from left to right in fig 4 b the style of the pore structures are isotropic anisotropic in the vertical direction and anisotropic in the horizontal direction respectively the anisotropy ratios of the three images from succolarity values were 1 45 λ 1 for perfect isotropic image 4 70 and 0 23 from left to right the trend in these ratios clearly matches the observed differences in anisotropy in fig 4 b in summary the relationship between the changes in structure of these model systems and the three fractal parameters proves the effectiveness of our algorithm it also demonstrates that the fractal dimension lacunarity and succolarity can quantitatively characterize the complexity heterogeneity and anisotropy of porous media respectively 3 2 porosity and permeability the porosity of the twelve sandstone core samples ranged from 10 5 to 26 9 while their permeability varied over 2 orders of magnitude table 2 it can be seen from fig 5 that there was a significant positive relationship between porosity and permeability a power law relationship with a coefficient of determination r 2 0 916 fitted the data reasonably well 9 k 30191 ϕ 6 1498 however several permeability data points in the porosity range of 22 27 deviate from this relationship for comparison the kc equation was also used to describe the relationship between porosity and permeability bear 1972 kaviany 1995 10 k ϕ 3 36 c 1 ϕ 2 d 2 where c 5 is the kc constant carman 1937 xu and yu 2008 and d 6 666 mm is the hypothetical mean spherical particle diameter obtained by fitting eq 10 to the twelve samples it can be seen from fig 5 that the kc equation does not provide a better description of the relationship between permeability and porosity for these cores the algorithm verification and porosity results indicate that a single parameter porosity cannot completely explain the change of permeability for cores with complex structures therefore we proceed to investigate the sensitivity of the fractal parameters fractal dimension lacunarity and succolarity for quantitative discrimination between different core structures and the influence of complex microstructure on permeability 3 3 fractal structure parameters and permeability comparing the 3d fractal dimensions with the permeabilities for the twelve core samples see table 2 it is apparent that the 3d fractal dimension is less suitable for predicting permeability than porosity there is little variation in the fractal dimensions but there are large differences in permeability values between core 10 core 11 and core 12 as a result the r2 for the best fit power law relationship between k and d not shown is only 0 832 as compared to 0 916 for k versus ϕ the reason for this is that the pore space fractal dimension is mainly controlled by two factors one is the increase with increaseing porosity and the other is the decrease with increaseing heterogeneity in contrast the permeability is mainly controlled by the radii of the connected pore throats it increases when the porosity and heterogeneity both increase therefore in order to better quantitatively explain the impact of microstructure on macroscopic permeability we need to investigate the relationships between permeability lacunarity and succolarity we used the lacunarity calculation program based on eqs 2 4 to calculate the normalized lacunarity curve of the pore spaces for the twelve core samples at different scales the results are shown in fig 6 after the values of lacunarity were normalized the maximum and minimum values of λ r for all cores were 1 and 0 respectively thus differences of the middle portion of the lacunarity curves should indicate differences in pore clustering among the core samples within this range it can be seen that core 2 had the highest degree of pore clustering while core 7 had the lowest in order to further compare the lacunarity values of the different cores normalized lacunarity values were selected from the median r 16 of the different scales the results are listed in table 2 and indicate the λ r 16 values decrease in the order core 7 12 8 9 10 3 4 6 11 5 1 and 2 which also represents the trend in core sample complexity from heterogeneous to homogeneous this trend however did not track the trend in permeability and the r2 for the power law relationship between k and the λ r 16 not shown was only 0 437 as compared to 0 916 for k versus ϕ this is likely because the normalized lacunarity is only affected by the degree of heterogeneity of the pore spaces whereas the permeability is affected by both porosity and heterogeneity next we calculated succolarity values for the pore phase of the twelve core samples according to the succolarity calculation program based on eqs 5 7 while lacunarity is strongly dependent upon box size succolarity shows little dependency on box size de melo and conci 2013 therefore to improve the computational efficiency we only calculated succolarity for a single box size in this study in order to study the relationship between succolarity and permeability the direction of calculating succolarity was chosen to be consistent with the direction of calculating permeability z direction the relationship between the permeability and flow direction succolarity is shown in fig 7 the core permeability increased exponentially with increasing succolarity the following exponential model provided a very good fit r2 0 940 to this relationship 11 k 0 0239 e 23 98 s u compared with porosity pore fractal dimension and normalized lacunarity the flow direction succolarity showed a better exponential relationship higher coefficient of determination with permeability for the twelve core samples this result is due to the fact that succolarity can simultaneously characterize the connectivity and the number of pores in a certain direction of the core sample therefore it can serve as a meaningful quantitative structure parameter for permeability prediction it is hard to account for changes in permeability in the case of complex core microstructures and both the porosity and fractal dimension proved to be insufficient for quantitatively characterizing changes in microstructures instead it is recommended that a comprehensive analysis involving the fractal parameters lacunarity and succolarity is needed to fully characterize complex microstructure and give a reasonable explanation of changes in permeability of core samples from sandstone reservoirs 4 conclusions in this study 3d digital samples of sandstone reservoirs were used to calculate fractal structure parameters fractal dimension lacunarity succolarity and evaluate permeability the fractal structure parameters were used to quantitatively characterize differences in core structure and analyze their effects on permeability the following conclusions can be derived 1 the three fractal structural parameters characterize the microstructure of reservoir cores form different perspectives i fractal dimension characterizes complexity ii lacunarity characterizes heterogeneity and iii succolarity characterizes anisotropy 2 low porosity sandstone rocks appear to be pore fractals 3 for complex reservoir core structures even if their pore fractal dimension values are similar the permeability can still vary greatly 4 lacunarity can quantitatively characterize the heterogeneity clustering of the overall pore structure in core samples but is less sensitive to connectivity which controls flow 5 succolarity in flow direction can better characterize the permeability of cores compared to porosity the pore fractal dimension and lacunarity the experimentally derived relationship between succolarity and permeability for the selected twelve cores is exponential in summary only using the porosity and pore fractal dimension to characterize complex microscopic structure is not thorough enough to accurately predict flow characteristics instead using the three fractal parameters pore fractal dimension lacunarity and succolarity can provide a better explanation for the influence of heterogeneous structure and anisotropic physical properties on permeability on the basis of the presented work flow direction succolarity is the best predictor of permeability further theoretical and numerical investigations

permeability i e the z direction in the binary images the twelve core samples were scanned by micro ct using a versaxrm 500 micro ct scanner the source voltage exposure time 2d projection quantity and resolution are 90 kv 30 s 3600 and 1 μm respectively the original images obtained by micro ct scanning had a volume of 10003 μm3 and are shown in fig 1 along with the corresponding processed images used for the calculation of fractal structure parameters the process included de noising processed by median filter and gaussian filter methods cropping extract a square sub volume in the center of core and binarization processed by interactive thresholding method to make a global thresholding segmentation and to get binary images all image processing steps were completed using the avizo 9 software the two dimensional contrast images before and after processing are also shown in fig 1 after image processing all the binary sample images have a volume of 5123 μm3 2 2 fractal dimension calculation in fractal geometry theory the fractal dimension is an important parameter to characterize scale invariant physical properties according to fractal definitions there are many fractal dimensions to describe the physical properties of porous media from different perspectives in binary images porous media are comprised of solids and voids according to fractal theory only one of these two phases can be fractal i e if one phase is fractal then the other phase is euclidean scaling crawford and matsui 1996 however it is unknown a priori which is the fractal phase therefore before using the fractal dimension to characterize the structural characteristics of a porous medium we must firstly determine the fractal phase i e pores or the rock skeleton box counting is the most common and efficient calculation method for estimating the fractal dimension from images and it is also the method we selected in this study in the box counting algorithm boxes of different length scales r are used to cover the images and the number of boxes n covering pores and the rock skeleton are recorded separately fig 2 the principles of the box counting algorithm for two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d images are almost identical the only difference is that the 2d images are covered with square tiles of area r 2 whereas the 3d images are covered with cubic boxes of volume r 3 in this study we generated a code for the cubic box counting method in matlab and used it to calculate the 3d fractal dimensions for the binary micro ct images of twelve core samples the bi phase box counting method perfect and donnelly 2015 was used in this study to identify the fractal phase by fitting both phases conjointly using the following equations 1a log n b log k b d log x log n w log k w 3 log x 1b log n w log k w d log x log n b log k b 3 log x 1c log n w log k w 3 log x log n b log k b 3 log x where d is the 3d fractal dimension k is the number intercept the subscripts b and w denote the black and white phases respectively and is the logical and operator eqs 1a and 1b assume that one of the phases is fractal while the complementary phase follows euclidean power law scaling for eq 1a the black phase is fractal and the white phase is euclidean while in eq 1b the white phase is fractal and the black phase is euclidean for eq 1c neither phase is fractal since both phases follow euclidean power law scaling non linear regression was used to fit eq 1 to the three dimensional box counting results for both phases in order to decide which phase is fractal and which is euclidean based on the residual sum of squares rss table 1 the equation producing the lowest rss value is selected as the most appropriate model for each core the results of the bi phase box counting analyses for the twelve sandstone core samples are summarized in table 1 it can be seen that eq 1a provided the best fit statistics for all twelve cores with rss values on average 1 3rd of those for the other models this means that all twelve cores can be considered pore fractals with pore fractal dimensions ranging from 2 68 to 2 82 therefore in this study we selected the pore fractal dimension to describe the scaling complexity of pore space 2 3 lacunarity calculation lacunarity is a characteristic of the clustering frequency and size of the measurement object in images the measured object can be particles pores or fluids in pores in a porous medium the lacunarity is positively related to the degree of object aggregation in most of physical processes lacunarity integrates the feature of spatial translation invariance in some cases different objects may have the same fractal dimension but can then be distinguished by lacunarity because the focus of this study is permeability we investigated the lacunarity of the pore phase in the 2d gliding box algorithm using a square box with a side of r gliding on 2d image the center point of the box moves continuously at adjacent pixel locations shown as fig 2 the process records how many pores are in the box marks it as m and the number of boxes as n m r then divides it by the total number of gliding boxes to get the probability density function q m r for self similar images q m r is related to the box side length r and the image side length l in order to facilitate the analysis of the probability density function q m r a statistical moments function is constructed as 2 z q q r m m q q m r the lacunarity λ r can be defined as the statistical moments function when q 2 divided by squared value of q 1 for z allain and cloitre 1991 3 λ r z q 2 r z q 1 r 2 the maximum and minimum values of upper and lower bounds of lacunarity are λ max λ 1 1 ϕ and λ min λ l 1 ϕ is porosity respectively the value of λ max shows that different values of ϕ will change the value of lacunarity in order to eliminate the effect of porosity on the analysis of lacunarity the calculated value from the gliding box algorithm is normalized the normalized formula is roy et al 2010 4 λ r λ r λ min λ max λ min ϕ λ r 1 1 ϕ lacunarity normalization has two advantages first logarithmic transformation is not required because the lacunarity is unified between r 1 and r l second the effect of ϕ is eliminated and eq 4 only reflects the influence of the pore clustering like the box counting method the gliding box algorithm for calculating 3d lacunarity applies a cubic box with a side of r gliding on the 3d image to calculate q m r then according to eqs 2 3 and 4 the value of 3d lacunarity can be obtained the 2d lacunarity characterizes the clustering of pore areas within a plane while the 3d lacunarity characterizes the concentration of pore volumes in 3d space we used the 3d gliding box algorithm to calculate the lacunarity of the ct scan images and employed 2d numerical reconstructions to verify the effectiveness of the method 2 4 succolarity calculation succolarity is also a key parameter in fractal geometry theory it is used to measure the connectivity of an image in different directions in the present context it can characterize the ability of a fluid to move within a porous medium namely it quantifies the extent that a fluid will permeate or flow into pores succolarity as well as lacunarity can also distinguish different pore structures with the same fractal dimension the method for calculating succolarity was presented by de melo and conci 2013 they apply an ideal box counting method to an image in the 2d succolarity calculation method the first step is to provide a virtual pressure field for four directions on the image the pressure field is assigned as top to bottom and bottom to top in the vertical direction left to right and right to left in the horizontal direction the magnitudes of the pressure in each direction are determined by the number of image pixels and the size of measurement box in the second step the flow is simulated in the first row column of pore pixels in each initial pressure direction of the image and the simulated fluid will fill all the connected pore pixels in each direction the solid pixels do not allow fluid to flow and form non flow boundaries within the confines of the image in the third step based on the ideal box counting method succolarity is estimated by changing the size of measurement box in the image this step divides the fluid flow area of the previous step into the equal size of box which is denoted as bs k k is the number of possible divisions of an image in boxes then the percentage of occupation for each box size of image is denoted as op bs k in the fourth step for each box size k the expression of pressure occupation value is as follows 5 k 1 n o p b s k p r b s k p c where n is the number of possible divisions and represents the central pressure of the box k this can take the pressure in horizontal or vertical directions the pressure varies with the box size and it also depends on the position of the box such as initial row or column 6a pr 0 5 b other row or column 6b pr 0 5 l 1 b in the fifth step in order to make the succolarity value dimensionless like the fractal dimension and lacunarity succolarity can be characterized as the pressure occupation value eq 5 divided by the maximum possible occupation value 7 su b s k d i r k 1 n op b s k p r b s k p c k 1 n op b s k max p r b s k p c where dir represents the direction for example left to right in 3d succolarity calculation method the virtual pressure fields are added to the 3d image in six directions then it simulates the fluid flow and 3d succolarity is obtained by calculating the percentage of pressure occupation with eqs 5 and 7 the procedure is similar to the 2d succolarity calculation method based on eq 7 we define the two dimensional anisotropy ratio λ as 8 λ s u b s k b t s u b s k t b s u b s k l r s u b s k r l where dir bt tb lr and rl signifies the bottom to top top to bottom left to right and right to left directions respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 algorithm verification the calculation methods for the fractal dimension lacunarity and succolarity given in the above section are all based on box counting methods thus we first validated the box counting algorithm by calculating the fractal dimensions of standard self similar 2d and 3d fractal structures fig 3 shows the third order sierpinski carpet and the second order menger sponge the results from our program were identical to the ideal values of 1 8928 and 2 7268 for the fractal dimensions of the white fractal phase of the carpet and the grey fractal phase of the sponge respectively this clearly demonstrates the validity of our box counting program for calculating the fractal dimension after verifying the box counting method for the basic calculation of fractal dimension the next step is to verify the calculation of lacunarity and succolarity using complex porous structures these structures were constructed by the random generation growth algorithm wang et al 2007 wang and pan 2008 as shown in fig 4 two sets of patterns were generated to represent two dimensional porous media for the images in fig 4 a the porosity was fixed at 0 10 while the generated images were changed to produce different degrees of heterogeneity the calculated lacunarities obtained at the length scale r 4 for the selected images respectively were 9 03 6 16 and 3 08 from left to right in fig 4 a the results show that the lacunarity decreases with the visual degree of pore clustering in the images from left to right fig 4 b depicts three 2d porous patterns also generated using the random generation growth algorithm the construction porosity was fixed at 0 30 and the direction growth probability of the three porous media was changed to achieve different degrees of anisotropy from left to right in fig 4 b the style of the pore structures are isotropic anisotropic in the vertical direction and anisotropic in the horizontal direction respectively the anisotropy ratios of the three images from succolarity values were 1 45 λ 1 for perfect isotropic image 4 70 and 0 23 from left to right the trend in these ratios clearly matches the observed differences in anisotropy in fig 4 b in summary the relationship between the changes in structure of these model systems and the three fractal parameters proves the effectiveness of our algorithm it also demonstrates that the fractal dimension lacunarity and succolarity can quantitatively characterize the complexity heterogeneity and anisotropy of porous media respectively 3 2 porosity and permeability the porosity of the twelve sandstone core samples ranged from 10 5 to 26 9 while their permeability varied over 2 orders of magnitude table 2 it can be seen from fig 5 that there was a significant positive relationship between porosity and permeability a power law relationship with a coefficient of determination r 2 0 916 fitted the data reasonably well 9 k 30191 ϕ 6 1498 however several permeability data points in the porosity range of 22 27 deviate from this relationship for comparison the kc equation was also used to describe the relationship between porosity and permeability bear 1972 kaviany 1995 10 k ϕ 3 36 c 1 ϕ 2 d 2 where c 5 is the kc constant carman 1937 xu and yu 2008 and d 6 666 mm is the hypothetical mean spherical particle diameter obtained by fitting eq 10 to the twelve samples it can be seen from fig 5 that the kc equation does not provide a better description of the relationship between permeability and porosity for these cores the algorithm verification and porosity results indicate that a single parameter porosity cannot completely explain the change of permeability for cores with complex structures therefore we proceed to investigate the sensitivity of the fractal parameters fractal dimension lacunarity and succolarity for quantitative discrimination between different core structures and the influence of complex microstructure on permeability 3 3 fractal structure parameters and permeability comparing the 3d fractal dimensions with the permeabilities for the twelve core samples see table 2 it is apparent that the 3d fractal dimension is less suitable for predicting permeability than porosity there is little variation in the fractal dimensions but there are large differences in permeability values between core 10 core 11 and core 12 as a result the r2 for the best fit power law relationship between k and d not shown is only 0 832 as compared to 0 916 for k versus ϕ the reason for this is that the pore space fractal dimension is mainly controlled by two factors one is the increase with increaseing porosity and the other is the decrease with increaseing heterogeneity in contrast the permeability is mainly controlled by the radii of the connected pore throats it increases when the porosity and heterogeneity both increase therefore in order to better quantitatively explain the impact of microstructure on macroscopic permeability we need to investigate the relationships between permeability lacunarity and succolarity we used the lacunarity calculation program based on eqs 2 4 to calculate the normalized lacunarity curve of the pore spaces for the twelve core samples at different scales the results are shown in fig 6 after the values of lacunarity were normalized the maximum and minimum values of λ r for all cores were 1 and 0 respectively thus differences of the middle portion of the lacunarity curves should indicate differences in pore clustering among the core samples within this range it can be seen that core 2 had the highest degree of pore clustering while core 7 had the lowest in order to further compare the lacunarity values of the different cores normalized lacunarity values were selected from the median r 16 of the different scales the results are listed in table 2 and indicate the λ r 16 values decrease in the order core 7 12 8 9 10 3 4 6 11 5 1 and 2 which also represents the trend in core sample complexity from heterogeneous to homogeneous this trend however did not track the trend in permeability and the r2 for the power law relationship between k and the λ r 16 not shown was only 0 437 as compared to 0 916 for k versus ϕ this is likely because the normalized lacunarity is only affected by the degree of heterogeneity of the pore spaces whereas the permeability is affected by both porosity and heterogeneity next we calculated succolarity values for the pore phase of the twelve core samples according to the succolarity calculation program based on eqs 5 7 while lacunarity is strongly dependent upon box size succolarity shows little dependency on box size de melo and conci 2013 therefore to improve the computational efficiency we only calculated succolarity for a single box size in this study in order to study the relationship between succolarity and permeability the direction of calculating succolarity was chosen to be consistent with the direction of calculating permeability z direction the relationship between the permeability and flow direction succolarity is shown in fig 7 the core permeability increased exponentially with increasing succolarity the following exponential model provided a very good fit r2 0 940 to this relationship 11 k 0 0239 e 23 98 s u compared with porosity pore fractal dimension and normalized lacunarity the flow direction succolarity showed a better exponential relationship higher coefficient of determination with permeability for the twelve core samples this result is due to the fact that succolarity can simultaneously characterize the connectivity and the number of pores in a certain direction of the core sample therefore it can serve as a meaningful quantitative structure parameter for permeability prediction it is hard to account for changes in permeability in the case of complex core microstructures and both the porosity and fractal dimension proved to be insufficient for quantitatively characterizing changes in microstructures instead it is recommended that a comprehensive analysis involving the fractal parameters lacunarity and succolarity is needed to fully characterize complex microstructure and give a reasonable explanation of changes in permeability of core samples from sandstone reservoirs 4 conclusions in this study 3d digital samples of sandstone reservoirs were used to calculate fractal structure parameters fractal dimension lacunarity succolarity and evaluate permeability the fractal structure parameters were used to quantitatively characterize differences in core structure and analyze their effects on permeability the following conclusions can be derived 1 the three fractal structural parameters characterize the microstructure of reservoir cores form different perspectives i fractal dimension characterizes complexity ii lacunarity characterizes heterogeneity and iii succolarity characterizes anisotropy 2 low porosity sandstone rocks appear to be pore fractals 3 for complex reservoir core structures even if their pore fractal dimension values are similar the permeability can still vary greatly 4 lacunarity can quantitatively characterize the heterogeneity clustering of the overall pore structure in core samples but is less sensitive to connectivity which controls flow 5 succolarity in flow direction can better characterize the permeability of cores compared to porosity the pore fractal dimension and lacunarity the experimentally derived relationship between succolarity and permeability for the selected twelve cores is exponential in summary only using the porosity and pore fractal dimension to characterize complex microscopic structure is not thorough enough to accurately predict flow characteristics instead using the three fractal parameters pore fractal dimension lacunarity and succolarity can provide a better explanation for the influence of heterogeneous structure and anisotropic physical properties on permeability on the basis of the presented work flow direction succolarity is the best predictor of permeability further theoretical and numerical investigations into the use of combinations of multiple fractal structure parameters could result in significant advances in the characterization of reservoir rocks and unconventional shale gas reservoirs with

6076,drought is one of the costliest natural hazards and the main factor of concern impacting crop growth in the arid hexi corridor in northwest china however the inter relationship between meteorological drought severity and crop yield is seldom studied across this region in this study two multi scalar drought indices the standardized precipitation index spi and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei are employed to monitor the evolution of drought condition in the hexi corridor we examined a the historical drought evolution of the hexi corridor since 1970s b the possible future drought tendency under different rcp scenarios and c the multi scale correlation between climatic crop yield and drought indices the results indicate that the studied area experienced a trend towards warmer and wetter conditions during the last 4 decades and this trend last until the middle 2030s indicated by spei the feasibility of spei and spi for quantifying drought condition and evaluating production loss was tested in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest of china and spei was found more reliable correlation analysis between climatic yield and drought indices revealed that the drought condition of the month july detected by 3 month spei was the most relevant for the observed changes in climate yield in the hexi corridor by obtaining the critical point of each spei climatic yield curve we found the different levels of yield vulnerability for the four selected districts according to which we are able to gain an early prediction of the crop production crisis corresponding to the future drought events keywords drought spi spei crop yield climate change 1 introduction drought is an important kind of extreme events that severely damages the agriculture ecology water resources and human lives around the world being one of the costliest and most widespread natural hazards wilhite and glantz 1985 dai 2011 niu et al 2015 under the changing environment water scarcity which is being further compounded by droughts is posing increasingly larger threats to the carbon cycle and food production sivakumar 2011 lesk et al 2016 thus understanding the mechanism and modelling of droughts has drawn much attention from ecologists meteorologists and agricultural scientists mishra and singh 2011 niu et al 2019 niu and chen 2014 drought is apparent after a long period lack of rainfall in a region but the onset duration and end of it is difficult to determine an effective way to monitor drought condition is by utilizing drought indices many indices have been developed to monitor predict and assess the severity of drought such as the palmer drought index pdsi which is a landmark in the history of drought indices the pdsi incorporates antecedent precipitation moisture supply and moisture demand into a hydrologic accounting system plamer 1965 richard and heim 2002 multi scalar indices have been developed to improve the existing ones such as the standard precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 making the monitoring of drought more comparable both temporally and spatially the calculation procedure of the spi and spei is relatively simple compared to the existing drought indices and it has the advantage of flexible time scales making it widely employed in droughts related studies the most important difference of the two indices is that spei is calculated using precipitation and pet potential evapotranspiration in other words it considers a simple water balance in a specific area which is particularly suited to detect the consequences of global warming on drought conditions vicente serrano et al 2010 crop yield loss is one of the most devastating consequences of droughts on the water carbon cycle increasing frequency of dry hot episodes can lead to reduced yields and greater yield variability for crops thus resulting in higher costs for farmers potop et al 2010 food security is becoming a hot spot in china due to the extensive attention to climate change as a country with a large agriculture land china is prone to costly drought impacts e g the average area that affected by drought is up to 20 900 km2 year 1 and the direct economic losses are up to 32 billion chinese yuan year 1 over the period 1949 2013 zhai et al 2014 qin et al 2015 drought indices have been reported to be widely used in the explanations of crop yield losses kola et al 2014 arshad et al 2013 peña gallardo et al 2019 and it is proved that multi scalar drought indices have better performance than other drought indices in identifying the impacts of drought on crop yields vicente serrano et al 2012 wang et al 2016 as it is difficult to get accurate long term crop yield data model simulated data and satellite based data are also utilized in the relevant studies liu et al 2015 studied the relation between pdsi and crop yield simulated by epic model in an agricultural region in northwest china and found that droughts in april july and september are more responsible for yield loss of spring and winter wheat in recent years statistical methods have been applied feasibly by arrange of researches lobell et al 2011 tack et al 2015 for the flexibility and easy access previous studies have investigated how drought impact on crop growth and found that drought in the earlier growing period has larger influences on crop yields mkhabela et al 2010 found that drought indices based on water demand are more correlated to yield and quality of canadian prairie spring wheat than other kinds of indices and drought indices accumulated from planting to anthesis were superior to those accumulated from anthesis to maturity prabnakorn et al 2018 used spei to study the relation between drought and rice yield in the mun river basin and found that the 1 month spei has stronger correlation with rice yield than other timescales and rainfall the hexi corridor located in the typical arid region of northwestern china is an important crop production base and is very sensitive to climate change niu et al 2019 however few studies have investigated the impact of drought on crop yield in this area thus it is of great importance to investigate the current and future drought condition and study the inter relationship between drought indices and food production in this area the objectives of this study are to 1 analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of historical droughts over the period 1970 2015 2 project future drought condition by calculating the drought indices spei and spi form the year 2017 to 2050 and 3 investigate the relationship between drought indices and crop production and propose adaptive strategies according to the projection results 2 study area the hexi corridor lies in the typical arid region in the northwest of china between longitudes 92 12 and 104 20 e and latitudes 37 17 n and 42 48 n spanning over 1000 km from east to west see fig 1 with a total area of 270 000 km2 the three main rivers of the hexi corridor from west to east are the shule river heihe river and shiyang river originating from the qilian mountain this region is one of the most important commodity grain bases in northwestern china due to its abundant land light and heat resources fu et al 2018 and shows typical features of arid zones with annual mean precipitation of 50 150 mm and annual mean pan evaporation of 1500 2500 mm li et al 2016 more than 60 of the crop planting area is occupied by cereal crops in the high production counties such like yongchang wuwei etc the main cereal crop types in the hexi corridor are spring wheat and spring corn of which the growing season is during april to september with the shortage of rainfall water resources scarcity is the limiting factor for regional prosperity and economic development in the hexi corridor 3 data and methods 3 1 climatic data meteorological data containing the historically observed daily precipitation mean temperature relative air humidity were obtained from the china meteorological administration for 13 gauging stations within the hexi corridor over the period of 1970 2015 the monthly bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd data from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 are utilized for the simulated historical and projected future data the gcms are downscaled by mainly two steps 1 bias correction using a quantile mapping technique on a monthly and location specific basis after regridded to a targeted resolution 2 spatially translation of the biased gcms to the targeted resolution wood et al 2004 four sets of gcms see table 1 are chosen from the previously validated datasets that are suitable to simulate future precipitation and temperature variations in the hexi corridor zhang et al 2015 however the monthly projections of gcms contain considerable uncertainties especially for precipitation fu et al 2013 thus the linear scaling ls method is employed for bias correction of both the precipitation and temperature outputs of the downscaled gcms as follows 1 p cor m p raw m μ p obs m μ p raw m 2 t cor m t raw m μ t obs m μ t raw m where pcor m and tcor m are corrected precipitation and temperature of the mth month and praw m and traw m are the raw precipitation and temperature of the mth month μrepresents the mean value of precipitation and temperature of the given month m during the period 1970 2015 3 2 crop yield data the original crop yield data of the period 1981 2012 were obtained from the china economic and social development statistical database http tongji cnki net kns55 index aspx gansu water statistical yearbook collected by department of water management and agriculture in statistical studies on the relationship between long term crop yields and climatic factors it is particularly important to separate trend yield and obtain accurate climatic yield this is also vital to our study because the drought indices we utilized are calculated based on meteorological factors the actual crop production is separated into three components niu et al 2018 fang 2011 trend yield climatic yield and the random error the trend yield is the long period output component that reflects the development level of productive forces in the historical period climatic yield is the component of the fluctuating part that is influenced by the short term changing factors mainly agricultural and meteorological disasters dominated by climate variables trend yield is obtained by 5 yr moving average of the annual crop yield and climatic yield is calculated as the difference between actual yield and trend yield random error is neglected 3 3 calculation of drought indices the drought extent is described by drought indices in this study we employ the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei meanwhile to assess the role that global warming plays in the drought evolution in the study area the standardized precipitation index spi is also calculated for comparison the calculation procedures of spei are as follows 1 potential evapotranspiration calculation thornthwaite 1948 3 pet 16 k 10 t i m where t is the monthly mean temperature i is a heat index calculated by i 12 t 5 1 514 and m is a coefficient depending on i m 6 75

j the calculated dj values are aggregated at different time scales the difference d i j k in a given month j and year i depends on the chosen time scale k for example the accumulated difference for one month in a particular year i with a 12 month time scale is calculated using 5 x i j k l 13 k j 12 d i 1 l l 1 j d i l if j k 6 x i j k l j k 1 j d i l if j k where di l is the p pet difference in the first month of the year i 3 normalize the water balance to obtain the spei index series a three parameter log logistic distribution is used with the probability density function expressed as 7 f x β α x γ α β 1 1 x γ α β 2 where α β and γ are scale shape and origin parameters respectively for d values in the range γ d the probability distribution function of the d series is given by 8 f x 1 α x γ β 1 with f x the spei can easily be obtained as the standardized values of f x 9 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 where w 2 ln p for p 0 5 and p is the probability of exceeding a determined d value p 1 f x if p 0 5 then p is replaced by 1 p and the sign of the resultant spei is reversed the constants are c0 2 515517 c1 0 802853 c2 0 010328 d1 1 432788 d2 0 189269 and d3 0 001308 the process of spi calculation can be summarized into the following steps 1 choose the aggregation temporal scale denoted by k and the monthly precipitation is aggregated to the time scale k with the same procedure as dj in spei 2 a gamma probability density function pdf is performed separately for each month the pdf g x and the cumulative distribution function g x are listed below 10 g x 1 β α γ α x a 1 e x β for x 0 11 g x 1 β α γ α 0 x t a 1 e t β d t for x 0 12 h x q 1 q g x where α β are shape and scale parameters estimated by the maximum likelihood method and x is the cumulative

monteith pet pm methods thornthwaite 1948 burke et al 2006 shuttleworth 1992 we adopt the thornthwaite method considering that the gcms only provide precipitation and temperature information and we want to make the pet results consistent and comparable in both historical and future time horizons in addition previous studies e g ke and wang 2013 have shown that the differences of pet th and pet pm are small in northwestern china and the trends of the regional averaged pet th and pet pm are similar in the past decades trend analysis of climatic factors and drought indices utilizes the mann kendall method mann 1945 kendall 1975 3 4 correlation between climatic yield and drought index correlation analysis is commonly used when revealing the relationship between two variables ichii et al 2002 correlation between drought indices and decomposed crop yields are assessed using the pearson correlation coefficient which is calculated as follows 15 r x y x x y y x x 2 y y 2 where x and y are the time series of two variables x and y are the mean values of the two series the correlation coefficient r x y ranges from 1 to 1 with 1 indicating that the two variables are perfectly negatively correlated and 1 indicating a perfect positive correlation in this study the correlation was computed between the time series of crop yield and 1 3 12 month drought indices spi and spei as shown in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 changes of meteorological factors and drought severity in recent decades annual rainfall in the hexi corridor is about 130 mm which is far below the average situation of other agricultural regions in china especially the eastern and southern parts of china the average rainfall during the period of 1970 2005 is 122 mm year 1 but the value has risen to 142 mm year 1 during 2006 2015 which indicates that the annual precipitation has increased by about 16 in the last decade an turning point can be observed around the year 2000 fig 2 b that moving average value of mean temperature exceeded the average of the year 1970 2015 the average of tmean in the hexi corridor is 7 2 c before 2000 and 8 4 c after 2000 which increased by 1 2 c during the study period it is considered that the wetness dryness trend is mainly determined by the water balance in a region the anomaly of temperature results in the consistent increase of potential evapotranspiration pet a significant shift around year 1997 and stays at a high level in the recent two decades the relative air humidity has been fluctuating between 44 and 51 during the period 1970 2010 and shows a significant drop from year 2010 among which the value is below 41 in 2013 this may become an indicator of the drought situation in the recent years in the hexi corridor fig 3 shows the temporal evolutions of regional averaged spei and spi with different time scales 1 3 and 12 month shorter time scale drought indices can detect more drought events for that taking consider into only the current month 1 month scale and the previous 2 months 3 month scale their responses to the change of climatic variables are more instant but to investigate the long term changing pattern of drought condition a longer time scale is more appropriate and have a more intuitive presentation of the trend in the early stage of the 12 month drought evolution see fig 3 c drought condition indicated by spi is severer than that of spei which is because precipitation anomaly is more significant than that of temperature over that period in the middle stage the variations of the two indices are almost consistent however continuous drought in the recent years is displayed by spei as a result of the significant increase of temperature while spi exhibits an improved situation of drought events because of the positive precipitation anomaly given that the variation of pet is larger than that of the rainfall over the study period we consider that in the arid regions like the hexi corridor where evaporation is large spei is more appropriate than spi to characterize drought features spatial distribution of trends for spei and spi over the historical stage is shown in fig 4 the southeast of the corridor which is occupied by some important crop production districts such as minqin yongchang and wuwei counties shows upward trends both indicated by spi and spei during the period of 1970 2015 fig 4 which may be conductive to crop growth in these districts a large proportion of the region shows significant wet trend showed by the two indices in the last decades which is correspondent to the finding of some previous studies that also point out the significant trends toward wet conditions were mainly observed in the northwestern part of china shi et al 2003 tao et al 2014 zhai et al 2014 the performances of spei and spi are different in terms of describing drought condition spatially the difference between the two indices is small in the relatively humid area of the study region i e the southeast part but in the northwest part where the environment is more arid spei and spi show large difference or even the opposite result in the county anxi 4 2 response of crop production to meteorological droughts in the hexi corridor correlation coefficients between climatic crop production and drought indices for the crop growing season are studied during the period 1985 2012 fig 5 it is evident that correlation between spei and crop yields is higher than that of spi for all the months during april to september which reveals that drought caused by evaporation anomaly is the most possible reason for the loss of crop production in the hexi corridor the changing patterns of correlation coefficients are unimodal curves with the correlation increasing first and then decreasing as time scale gets larger it is observed from fig 5 3 month scale growing season spei is most related to crop growth which indicates that crop growth is most influenced by seasonal drought condition and in addition the correlation of spei value for the month july is highest among the 3 month spei named as spei3 7 below this is reasonable because the calculation of spei3 7 utilizes climatic variables in may june and july when cereal crops are during the seedling jointing and anthesis period which is proved by field experiments that water deficit during these periods has the greatest impact on crop yield of corn in northwestern china wang et al 2019 different from the study of correlation between rice yield and drought which finds that crop yield is most related to 1 month spei prabnakorn et al 2018 rice grown in thailand is rainfed while crops in the hexi corridor rely greatly on irrigation regime situation of crop does not change immediately with climatic changes in order to apply this correlation to regional management we also analyze the correlation between regional spei values with regional climatic yields fig 6 in the northwest part of the study area county subei dunhuang etc the correlation is low and even negative which is due to the topography those areas are mainly alpine or desert where crops are seldom planted however the spei value is station based while the crop yield is officially recorded in a county level so datasets are not matched enough to reflect the real relationship between drought and crop yield the highly correlated areas are mainly distributed in the agricultural developed area in the east part of the corridor such like yongchang shandan wuwei and minqin named as d1 d4 in fig 6 etc though the county anxi tianzhu and yumen also show high correlations between spei and climatic yield they excluded in the analysis for that the crop planting area is too small compared to the total land area and the topography is mountainous area and desert making it incomparable with other places that are located in the oasis and plain thus a preliminary conclusion can be drawn that extreme events significantly influence crop production in the hexi corridor the objective of the investigation of relationship between drought indices and climatic crop yield is to identify the pattern of yield change with drought condition variation caused by climatic change which is also helpful to reveal the ecological vulnerability of cultivated lands in the high crop yield districts i e d1 d4 the results of linear regression of the 3 month spei value for july spei3 7 and climatic yield of different districts are shown in fig 7 climatic yield increases as the drought condition detected by spei3 7 gets wetter which means that yield loss gets larger as drought becomes severer the intersections of each regression line and the x axis are the critical points i e defined as speic intercept slope indicating the impact of the climate induced drought on annual crop yield beyond which climate is beneficial to crop growth of the year this critical point speic represents the different extent of vulnerability of the studied district and the drought resistance ability of the cereal crops in that district as the figure shows speic is different for different area for example climate will do harm to annual crop yield of the county yongchang d1 when spei reaches 0 77 while crop yield will be negatively affected after spei reaches around 1 35 1 27 for shandan and minqin and 1 02 for the county wuwei indicating that crops in shandan and minqin have better drought resistance or the water management activities like irrigation is more effective there the impact of drought do not perform equally through all growth stages and regions geng et al 2016 peña gallardo et al 2018 because it is proved that local climatology and water availability are also important in the responding pattern of crop yield to drought peña gallardo et al 2019 thus though the changing patterns are similar among the four districts speic value is unequally distributed across the region as a result of different planting structure crop types and water managing strategies 4 3 projections of climate change and drought indices in the future possible changes of projected precipitation and mean temperature during the period 2017 2050 by different gcms are displayed in fig 8 for precipitation rcp4 5 emission scenario in the rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 emission scenarios slightly decreases were observed during year 2034 2050 compared to the period 2017 2033 but precipitation for rcp8 5 increased in the latter time period temperature for all the three emission scenarios show a significant increase in the period of 2034 2050 this can also be revealed by the evolution of drought indices for the future period fig 9 potential evapotranspiration shows the similar trend to the variation of temperature in the former time period the variation ranges of pet are between 2 12 for different rcp scenarios and in the latter period the trend expands to 12 23 among which the rcp8 5 scenario shows the most significant increase a significant downward trend over the period 2030 2050 is illustrated by spei indicating that temperature anomaly is significant and difference between the three emission scenarios is small among which rcp2 6 demonstrates the most serious drought condition during the period the pattern of drought frequency change is also different between spei and spi but consistent across rcps for spei drought events will occur more frequently in the latter time stage as indicated by all the three emission scenarios and drought frequency change between the two future stages is largest for the rcp2 6 scenario what can be seen by combining the two figures of spei is that climate change in the future will make drought more frequent but less severe across the region for spi there is a fluctuation around 0 over the study period by all the scenarios but drought frequency decreases in the latter period of the two future stages fig 10 shows the change of spei and spi between 2017 2033 and 2034 2050 in the hexi corridor it is evident that values of spei decrease in all the 13 sites among which the differences are larger than 1 in 5 stations but in contrast the differences between the two future stages are all positive values for spi showing that the condition is wetter in the future decades overall the two drought indices behave more differently when the temperature variation becomes larger both temporally and spatially which can be attributed to the role of changes in pet thus it can be concluded that as global warming becomes severer in the future the role of evapotranspiration cannot be ignored anymore in the studies of drought monitoring for the region we can identify future drought events after obtaining the future drought evolution and the critical points speic value the red dash lines in fig 11 we can predict future drought events that have negative impact on crop yield for different emission scenarios after obtaining the spei value of different districts fig 11 shows the spei variation of the four districts selected for rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in general spei calculated by rcp4 5 detects the smallest amount of drought events for the four districts compared to the other two scenarios overall the studied districts are still exposed to high risk of crop production loss though the cereal crops in the hexi corridor are resistant to drought to some extent adaptative and crop management measures need to be seriously planned especially in the period of 2040 s 2050 s to avoid food disasters in the future 5 conclusion historical and future trends of meteorological data from 13 weather stations and 4 gcms over the hexi corridor and the period 1970 2050 were investigated a continuous increasing trend was detected in the variation of temperature which is a vital signal for the potential warming effect and aggravated drought condition over the study region as a result drought illustrated by spei shows a significant downward trend by analyzing the relationship between spei and the decomposed climatic yield the critical points of the spei production curves which might be used to forecast future food disasters can be identified for the important food producing areas different spei value for each critical point are reflections of the ecological vulnerabilities of different districts and 2040 s and 2050 s are found to be most exposed to food disaster for d1 4 in the three future decades which can perform as references for future water management for this region drought indices have been widely used in drought monitoring worldwide due to its easy access and this study reveals the fact that drought index considering water demand evapotranspiration has better performance in monitoring drought condition and higher correlation with crop growth in arid and semiarid regions like the hexi corridor which is consistent with the findings of mkhabela et al 2010 thus compared to spi that focuses only on water supply precipitation spei is more appropriate to be utilized in analyzing the impact of drought on crop yield as indicated by the drought indices though precipitation and temperature have both been increasing in the late 20th century and early 21st century over the hexi corridor recorded as a trend toward warm and wet by some previous studies the drought condition detected by spei is getting severer considering water balance in the area there is still a high risk of severer drought conditions in the future and policies should be made to avoid big crop losses such like introducing more drought tolerant varieties and further improving water use efficiency in the water scarce districts however there still exists various data related and methodological challenges to be addressed for an accurate estimation of drought impacts on crop productivity siebert et al 2017 though errors exist in different steps of this study and it is necessary to perform some further analysis in the study of drought production relations by employing more accurate datasets and more robust research methods the information provided in this research is still valuable in guiding the agricultural management in arid and semiarid

6076,drought is one of the costliest natural hazards and the main factor of concern impacting crop growth in the arid hexi corridor in northwest china however the inter relationship between meteorological drought severity and crop yield is seldom studied across this region in this study two multi scalar drought indices the standardized precipitation index spi and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei are employed to monitor the evolution of drought condition in the hexi corridor we examined a the historical drought evolution of the hexi corridor since 1970s b the possible future drought tendency under different rcp scenarios and c the multi scale correlation between climatic crop yield and drought indices the results indicate that the studied area experienced a trend towards warmer and wetter conditions during the last 4 decades and this trend last until the middle 2030s indicated by spei the feasibility of spei and spi for quantifying drought condition and evaluating production loss was tested in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest of china and spei was found more reliable correlation analysis between climatic yield and drought indices revealed that the drought condition of the month july detected by 3 month spei was the most relevant for the observed changes in climate yield in the hexi corridor by obtaining the critical point of each spei climatic yield curve we found the different levels of yield vulnerability for the four selected districts according to which we are able to gain an early prediction of the crop production crisis corresponding to the future drought events keywords drought spi spei crop yield climate change 1 introduction drought is an important kind of extreme events that severely damages the agriculture ecology water resources and human lives around the world being one of the costliest and most widespread natural hazards wilhite and glantz 1985 dai 2011 niu et al 2015 under the changing environment water scarcity which is being further compounded by droughts is posing increasingly larger threats to the carbon cycle and food production sivakumar 2011 lesk et al 2016 thus understanding the mechanism and modelling of droughts has drawn much attention from ecologists meteorologists and agricultural scientists mishra and singh 2011 niu et al 2019 niu and chen 2014 drought is apparent after a long period lack of rainfall in a region but the onset duration and end of it is difficult to determine an effective way to monitor drought condition is by utilizing drought indices many indices have been developed to monitor predict and assess the severity of drought such as the palmer drought index pdsi which is a landmark in the history of drought indices the pdsi incorporates antecedent precipitation moisture supply and moisture demand into a hydrologic accounting system plamer 1965 richard and heim 2002 multi scalar indices have been developed to improve the existing ones such as the standard precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 making the monitoring of drought more comparable both temporally and spatially the calculation procedure of the spi and spei is relatively simple compared to the existing drought indices and it has the advantage of flexible time scales making it widely employed in droughts related studies the most important difference of the two indices is that spei is calculated using precipitation and pet potential evapotranspiration in other words it considers a simple water balance in a specific area which is particularly suited to detect the consequences of global warming on drought conditions vicente serrano et al 2010 crop yield loss is one of the most devastating consequences of droughts on the water carbon cycle increasing frequency of dry hot episodes can lead to reduced yields and greater yield variability for crops thus resulting in higher costs for farmers potop et al 2010 food security is becoming a hot spot in china due to the extensive attention to climate change as a country with a large agriculture land china is prone to costly drought impacts e g the average area that affected by drought is up to 20 900 km2 year 1 and the direct economic losses are up to 32 billion chinese yuan year 1 over the period 1949 2013 zhai et al 2014 qin et al 2015 drought indices have been reported to be widely used in the explanations of crop yield losses kola et al 2014 arshad et al 2013 peña gallardo et al 2019 and it is proved that multi scalar drought indices have better performance than other drought indices in identifying the impacts of drought on crop yields vicente serrano et al 2012 wang et al 2016 as it is difficult to get accurate long term crop yield data model simulated data and satellite based data are also utilized in the relevant studies liu et al 2015 studied the relation between pdsi and crop yield simulated by epic model in an agricultural region in northwest china and found that droughts in april july and september are more responsible for yield loss of spring and winter wheat in recent years statistical methods have been applied feasibly by arrange of researches lobell et al 2011 tack et al 2015 for the flexibility and easy access previous studies have investigated how drought impact on crop growth and found that drought in the earlier growing period has larger influences on crop yields mkhabela et al 2010 found that drought indices based on water demand are more correlated to yield and quality of canadian prairie spring wheat than other kinds of indices and drought indices accumulated from planting to anthesis were superior to those accumulated from anthesis to maturity prabnakorn et al 2018 used spei to study the relation between drought and rice yield in the mun river basin and found that the 1 month spei has stronger correlation with rice yield than other timescales and rainfall the hexi corridor located in the typical arid region of northwestern china is an important crop production base and is very sensitive to climate change niu et al 2019 however few studies have investigated the impact of drought on crop yield in this area thus it is of great importance to investigate the current and future drought condition and study the inter relationship between drought indices and food production in this area the objectives of this study are to 1 analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of historical droughts over the period 1970 2015 2 project future drought condition by calculating the drought indices spei and spi form the year 2017 to 2050 and 3 investigate the relationship between drought indices and crop production and propose adaptive strategies according to the projection results 2 study area the hexi corridor lies in the typical arid region in the northwest of china between longitudes 92 12 and 104 20 e and latitudes 37 17 n and 42 48 n spanning over 1000 km from east to west see fig 1 with a total area of 270 000 km2 the three main rivers of the hexi corridor from west to east are the shule river heihe river and shiyang river originating from the qilian mountain this region is one of the most important commodity grain bases in northwestern china due to its abundant land light and heat resources fu et al 2018 and shows typical features of arid zones with annual mean precipitation of 50 150 mm and annual mean pan evaporation of 1500 2500 mm li et al 2016 more than 60 of the crop planting area is occupied by cereal crops in the high production counties such like yongchang wuwei etc the main cereal crop types in the hexi corridor are spring wheat and spring corn of which the growing season is during april to september with the shortage of rainfall water resources scarcity is the limiting factor for regional prosperity and economic development in the hexi corridor 3 data and methods 3 1 climatic data meteorological data containing the historically observed daily precipitation mean temperature relative air humidity were obtained from the china meteorological administration for 13 gauging stations within the hexi corridor over the period of 1970 2015 the monthly bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd data from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 are utilized for the simulated historical and projected future data the gcms are downscaled by mainly two steps 1 bias correction using a quantile mapping technique on a monthly and location specific basis after regridded to a targeted resolution 2 spatially translation of the biased gcms to the targeted resolution wood et al 2004 four sets of gcms see table 1 are chosen from the previously validated datasets that are suitable to simulate future precipitation and temperature variations in the hexi corridor zhang et al 2015 however the monthly projections of gcms contain considerable uncertainties especially for precipitation fu et al 2013 thus the linear scaling ls method is employed for bias correction of both the precipitation and temperature outputs of the downscaled gcms as follows 1 p cor m p raw m μ p obs m μ p raw m 2 t cor m t raw m μ t obs m μ t raw m where pcor m and tcor m are corrected precipitation and temperature of the mth month and praw m and traw m are the raw precipitation and temperature of the mth month μrepresents the mean value of precipitation and temperature of the given month m during the period 1970 2015 3 2 crop yield data the original crop yield data of the period 1981 2012 were obtained from the china economic and social development statistical database http tongji cnki net kns55 index aspx gansu water statistical yearbook collected by department of water management and agriculture in statistical studies on the relationship between long term crop yields and climatic factors it is particularly important to separate trend yield and obtain accurate climatic yield this is also vital to our study because the drought indices we utilized are calculated based on meteorological factors the actual crop production is separated into three components niu et al 2018 fang 2011 trend yield climatic yield and the random error the trend yield is the long period output component that reflects the development level of productive forces in the historical period climatic yield is the component of the fluctuating part that is influenced by the short term changing factors mainly agricultural and meteorological disasters dominated by climate variables trend yield is obtained by 5 yr moving average of the annual crop yield and climatic yield is calculated as the difference between actual yield and trend yield random error is neglected 3 3 calculation of drought indices the drought extent is described by drought indices in this study we employ the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei meanwhile to assess the role that global warming plays in the drought evolution in the study area the standardized precipitation index spi is also calculated for comparison the calculation procedures of spei are as follows 1 potential evapotranspiration calculation thornthwaite 1948 3 pet 16 k 10 t i m where t is the monthly mean temperature i is a heat index calculated by i 12 t 5 1 514 and m is a coefficient depending on i m 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 79 10 2 i 0 492 and k is a correction coefficient calculated as a function of the latitude and month 2 a simple measure of water surplus for the analyzed month 4 d j p j p e t j the calculated dj values are aggregated at different time scales the difference d i j k in a given month j and year i depends on the chosen time scale k for example the accumulated difference for one month in a particular year i with a 12 month time scale is calculated using 5 x i j k l 13 k j 12 d i 1 l l 1 j d i l if j k 6 x i j k l j k 1 j d i l if j k where di l is the p pet difference in the first month of the year i 3 normalize the water balance to obtain the spei index series a three parameter log logistic distribution is used with the probability density function expressed as 7 f x β α x γ α β 1 1 x γ α β 2 where α β and γ are scale shape and origin parameters respectively for d values in the range γ d the probability distribution function of the d series is given by 8 f x 1 α x γ β 1 with f x the spei can easily be obtained as the standardized values of f x 9 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 where w 2 ln p for p 0 5 and p is the probability of exceeding a determined d value p 1 f x if p 0 5 then p is replaced by 1 p and the sign of the resultant spei is reversed the constants are c0 2 515517 c1 0 802853 c2 0 010328 d1 1 432788 d2 0 189269 and d3 0 001308 the process of spi calculation can be summarized into the following steps 1 choose the aggregation temporal scale denoted by k and the monthly precipitation is aggregated to the time scale k with the same procedure as dj in spei 2 a gamma probability density function pdf is performed separately for each month the pdf g x and the cumulative distribution function g x are listed below 10 g x

monteith pet pm methods thornthwaite 1948 burke et al 2006 shuttleworth 1992 we adopt the thornthwaite method considering that the gcms only provide precipitation and temperature information and we want to make the pet results consistent and comparable in both historical and future time horizons in addition previous studies e g ke and wang 2013 have shown that the differences of pet th and pet pm are small in northwestern china and the trends of the regional averaged pet th and pet pm are similar in the past decades trend analysis of climatic factors and drought indices utilizes the mann kendall method mann 1945 kendall 1975 3 4 correlation between climatic yield and drought index correlation analysis is commonly used when revealing the relationship between two variables ichii et al 2002 correlation between drought indices and decomposed crop yields are assessed using the pearson correlation coefficient which is calculated as follows 15 r x y x x y y x x 2 y y 2 where x and y are the time series of two variables x and y are the mean values of the two series the correlation coefficient r x y ranges from 1 to 1 with 1 indicating that the two variables are perfectly negatively correlated and 1 indicating a perfect positive correlation in this study the correlation was computed between the time series of crop yield and 1 3 12 month drought indices spi and spei as shown in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 changes of meteorological factors and drought severity in recent decades annual rainfall in the hexi corridor is about 130 mm which is far below the average situation of other agricultural regions in china especially the eastern and southern parts of china the average rainfall during the period of 1970 2005 is 122 mm year 1 but the value has risen to 142 mm year 1 during 2006 2015 which indicates that the annual precipitation has increased by about 16 in the last decade an turning point can be observed around the year 2000 fig 2 b that moving average value of mean temperature exceeded the average of the year 1970 2015 the average of tmean in the hexi corridor is 7 2 c before 2000 and 8 4 c after 2000 which increased by 1 2 c during the study period it is considered that the wetness dryness trend is mainly determined by the water balance in a region the anomaly of temperature results in the consistent increase of potential evapotranspiration pet a significant shift around year 1997 and stays at a high level in the recent two decades the relative air humidity has been fluctuating between 44 and 51 during the period 1970 2010 and shows a significant drop from year 2010 among which the value is below 41 in 2013 this may become an indicator of the drought situation in the recent years in the hexi corridor fig 3 shows the temporal evolutions of regional averaged spei and spi with different time scales 1 3 and 12 month shorter time scale drought indices can detect more drought events for that taking consider into only the current month 1 month scale and the previous 2 months 3 month scale their responses to the change of climatic variables are more instant but to investigate the long term changing pattern of drought condition a longer time scale is more appropriate and have a more intuitive presentation of the trend in the early stage of the 12 month drought evolution see fig 3 c drought condition indicated by spi is severer than that of spei which is because precipitation anomaly is more significant than that of temperature over that period in the middle stage the variations of the two indices are almost consistent however continuous drought in the recent years is displayed by spei as a result of the significant increase of temperature while spi exhibits an improved situation of drought events because of the positive precipitation anomaly given that the variation of pet is larger than that of the rainfall over the study period we consider that in the arid regions like the hexi corridor where evaporation is large spei is more appropriate than spi to characterize drought features spatial distribution of trends for spei and spi over the historical stage is shown in fig 4 the southeast of the corridor which is occupied by some important crop production districts such as minqin yongchang and wuwei counties shows upward trends both indicated by spi and spei during the period of 1970 2015 fig 4 which may be conductive to crop growth in these districts a large proportion of the region shows significant wet trend showed by the two indices in the last decades which is correspondent to the finding of some previous studies that also point out the significant trends toward wet conditions were mainly observed in the northwestern part of china shi et al 2003 tao et al 2014 zhai et al 2014 the performances of spei and spi are different in terms of describing drought condition spatially the difference between the two indices is small in the relatively humid area of the study region i e the southeast part but in the northwest part where the environment is more arid spei and spi show large difference or even the opposite result in the county anxi 4 2 response of crop production to meteorological droughts in the hexi corridor correlation coefficients between climatic crop production and drought indices for the crop growing season are studied during the period 1985 2012 fig 5 it is evident that correlation between spei and crop yields is higher than that of spi for all the months during april to september which reveals that drought caused by evaporation anomaly is the most possible reason for the loss of crop production in the hexi corridor the changing patterns of correlation coefficients are unimodal curves with the correlation increasing first and then decreasing as time scale gets larger it is observed from fig 5 3 month scale growing season spei is most related to crop growth which indicates that crop growth is most influenced by seasonal drought condition and in addition the correlation of spei value for the month july is highest among the 3 month spei named as spei3 7 below this is reasonable because the calculation of spei3 7 utilizes climatic variables in may june and july when cereal crops are during the seedling jointing and anthesis period which is proved by field experiments that water deficit during these periods has the greatest impact on crop yield of corn in northwestern china wang et al 2019 different from the study of correlation between rice yield and drought which finds that crop yield is most related to 1 month spei prabnakorn et al 2018 rice grown in thailand is rainfed while crops in the hexi corridor rely greatly on irrigation regime situation of crop does not change immediately with climatic changes in order to apply this correlation to regional management we also analyze the correlation between regional spei values with regional climatic yields fig 6 in the northwest part of the study area county subei dunhuang etc the correlation is low and even negative which is due to the topography those areas are mainly alpine or desert where crops are seldom planted however the spei value is station based while the crop yield is officially recorded in a county level so datasets are not matched enough to reflect the real relationship between drought and crop yield the highly correlated areas are mainly distributed in the agricultural developed area in the east part of the corridor such like yongchang shandan wuwei and minqin named as d1 d4 in fig 6 etc though the county anxi tianzhu and yumen also show high correlations between spei and climatic yield they excluded in the analysis for that the crop planting area is too small compared to the total land area and the topography is mountainous area and desert making it incomparable with other places that are located in the oasis and plain thus a preliminary conclusion can be drawn that extreme events significantly influence crop production in the hexi corridor the objective of the investigation of relationship between drought indices and climatic crop yield is to identify the pattern of yield change with drought condition variation caused by climatic change which is also helpful to reveal the ecological vulnerability of cultivated lands in the high crop yield districts i e d1 d4 the results of linear regression of the 3 month spei value for july spei3 7 and climatic yield of different districts are shown in fig 7 climatic yield increases as the drought condition detected by spei3 7 gets wetter which means that yield loss gets larger as drought becomes severer the intersections of each regression line and the x axis are the critical points i e defined as speic intercept slope indicating the impact of the climate induced drought on annual crop yield beyond which climate is beneficial to crop growth of the year this critical point speic represents the different extent of vulnerability of the studied district and the drought resistance ability of the cereal crops in that district as the figure shows speic is different for different area for example climate will do harm to annual crop yield of the county yongchang d1 when spei reaches 0 77 while crop yield will be negatively affected after spei reaches around 1 35 1 27 for shandan and minqin and 1 02 for the county wuwei indicating that crops in shandan and minqin have better drought resistance or the water management activities like irrigation is more effective there the impact of drought do not perform equally through all growth stages and regions geng et al 2016 peña gallardo et al 2018 because it is proved that local climatology and water availability are also important in the responding pattern of crop yield to drought peña gallardo et al 2019 thus though the changing patterns are similar among the four districts speic value is unequally distributed across the region as a result of different planting structure crop types and water managing strategies 4 3 projections of climate change and drought indices in the future possible changes of projected precipitation and mean temperature during the period 2017 2050 by different gcms are displayed in fig 8 for precipitation rcp4 5 emission scenario in the rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 emission scenarios slightly decreases were observed during year 2034 2050 compared to the period 2017 2033 but precipitation for rcp8 5 increased in the latter time period temperature for all the three emission scenarios show a significant increase in the period of 2034 2050 this can also be revealed by the evolution of drought indices for the future period fig 9 potential evapotranspiration shows the similar trend to the variation of temperature in the former time period the variation ranges of pet are between 2 12 for different rcp scenarios and in the latter period the trend expands to 12 23 among which the rcp8 5 scenario shows the most significant increase a significant downward trend over the period 2030 2050 is illustrated by spei indicating that temperature anomaly is significant and difference between the three emission scenarios is small among which rcp2 6 demonstrates the most serious drought condition during the period the pattern of drought frequency change is also different between spei and spi but consistent across rcps for spei drought events will occur more frequently in the latter time stage as indicated by all the three emission scenarios and drought frequency change between the two future stages is largest for the rcp2 6 scenario what can be seen by combining the two figures of spei is that climate change in the future will make drought more frequent but less severe across the region for spi there is a fluctuation around 0 over the study period by all the scenarios but drought frequency decreases in the latter period of the two future stages fig 10 shows the change of spei and spi between 2017 2033 and 2034 2050 in the hexi corridor it is evident that values of spei decrease in all the 13 sites among which the differences are larger than 1 in 5 stations but in contrast the differences between the two future stages are all positive values for spi showing that the condition is wetter in the future decades overall the two drought indices behave more differently when the temperature variation becomes larger both temporally and spatially which can be attributed to the role of changes in pet thus it can be concluded that as global warming becomes severer in the future the role of evapotranspiration cannot be ignored anymore in the studies of drought monitoring for the region we can identify future drought events after obtaining the future drought evolution and the critical points speic value the red dash lines in fig 11 we can predict future drought events that have negative impact on crop yield for different emission scenarios after obtaining the spei value of different districts fig 11 shows the spei variation of the four districts selected for rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in general spei calculated by rcp4 5 detects the smallest amount of drought events for the four districts compared to the other two scenarios overall the studied districts are still exposed to high risk of crop production loss though the cereal crops in the hexi corridor are resistant to drought to some extent adaptative and crop management measures need to be seriously planned especially in the period of 2040 s 2050 s to avoid food disasters in the future 5 conclusion historical and future trends of meteorological data from 13 weather stations and 4 gcms over the hexi corridor and the period 1970 2050 were investigated a continuous increasing trend was detected in the variation of temperature which is a vital signal for the potential warming effect and aggravated drought condition over the study region as a result drought illustrated by spei shows a significant downward trend by analyzing the relationship between spei and the decomposed climatic yield the critical points of the spei production curves which might be used to forecast future food disasters can be identified for the important food producing areas different spei value for each critical point are reflections of the ecological vulnerabilities of different districts and 2040 s and 2050 s are found to be most exposed to food disaster for d1 4 in the three future decades which can perform as references for future water management for this region drought indices have been widely used in drought monitoring worldwide due to its easy access and this study reveals the fact that drought index considering water demand evapotranspiration has better performance in monitoring drought condition and higher correlation with crop growth in arid and semiarid regions like the hexi corridor which is consistent with the findings of mkhabela et al 2010 thus compared to spi that focuses only on water supply precipitation spei is more appropriate to be utilized in analyzing the impact of drought on crop yield as indicated by the drought indices though precipitation and temperature have both been increasing in the late 20th century and early 21st century over the hexi corridor recorded as a trend toward warm and wet by some previous studies the drought condition detected by spei is getting severer considering water balance in the area there is still a high risk of severer drought conditions in the future and policies should be made to avoid big crop losses such like introducing more drought tolerant varieties and further improving water use efficiency in the water scarce districts however there still exists various data related and methodological challenges to be addressed for an accurate estimation of drought impacts on crop productivity siebert et al 2017 though errors exist in different steps of this study and it is necessary to perform some further analysis in the study of drought production relations by employing more accurate datasets and more robust research methods the information provided in this research is still valuable in guiding the agricultural management in arid and semiarid

6077,inadequate characterization of variability in natural tracers of submarine groundwater discharge sgd introduces large errors into tracer derived sgd estimates to address this gap we investigated spatial variability in the natural sgd tracers 223ra 224ra 226ra 228ra and 222rn using a high density array of piezometers and seepage meters over a nearshore area where discharging groundwater transitioned from fresh to saline seepage meters and piezometers were used to sample groundwater and to quantify fluxes and salinity a series of spatial patterns was distinguished beyond the normal salinity impact on ra activity the discharge in the interface between saltwater and freshwater was characterized by higher activities of the longer lived isotopes 226ra and 228ra while areas dominated by benthic exchange had higher activities of the shorter lived isotopes 223ra and 224ra spatial differences in ra activities were associated with variation in salinity and residence time in the aquifer and were indicative of underlying hydrogeological processes at the freshwater saltwater interface fresh discharge is driven by terrestrial hydraulic gradients and saline discharge is driven by density gradients both result in long residence times in the aquifer benthic exchange of saltwater has shorter residence times much less than required to enrich long lived isotopes and reach secular equilibrium the highest activities of 222rn were detected in the fresh discharge zone and the lowest activities in areas dominated by benthic exchange direct sampling at discharge points allowed comparison between groundwater collected from inland wells and the water discharging to the bay and indicated significant differences in the activities despite the short distance from wells to the discharge area substantial spatial variability in ra and rn was observed on the meter scale with trends that reflected groundwater origin and residence time inadequate characterization of variability trends and fluxes introduces large errors into tracer derived estimates of submarine groundwater discharge thus the study of submarine groundwater discharge with radioactive tracers requires adequate hydrogeological knowledge to identify processes that have strong impacts on ra and rn activities and associated fluxes to the ocean keywords submarine groundwater discharge radium radon spatial variability seepage meters 1 introduction the use of naturally occurring radioactive tracers for quantifying submarine groundwater discharge sgd has become a standard method within the scientific community over the last two decades since its first use moore 1996 these tracers have been applied in coastal locations around the world notable improvements in analytical techniques e g moore 2008 molina porras et al 2017 have been made and our understanding of the processes that must be considered when using a mass balance based on radioactive tracers continues to improve quantification of groundwater discharge is required for investigation of ocean budgets of constituents such as silica tréguer and de la rocha 2013 calcium carbonate milliman 1993 and excess nutrients kelly and moran 2002 krest et al 2000 rapaglia et al 2010 sadat noori et al 2016 that are usually associated with anthropogenic sources such as fertilizers and wastewater nutrient and other sgd borne pollution inputs can severely impair coastal ecosystems johannes 1980 valiela et al 1990 however sgd can be one of the most challenging terms in the water budget to quantify sgd is usually not visible and occurs under the sea so indirect methods are required to detect and measure it sgd can be especially important on oceanic islands e g kim and kim 2011 knee et al 2016 and in arid coastal environments where freshwater resources are scarce gallardo 2019 and groundwater is essential for water management duque et al 2018a eissa et al 2018 the most common natural tracers used for estimating water budgets in coastal areas are 223ra 224ra 226ra 228ra and 222rn the four ra isotopes are generated from the disintegration chains of u and th present in rocks and sediment grains and therefore they are generally more abundant in groundwater relative to seawater rama and moore 1996 or meteoric freshwater ra decays but otherwise generally behaves conservatively once released into marine and surface waters charette et al 2001 222rn is the daughter of 226ra as a noble gas it does not react with sediments or water when transported in groundwater but it can evade to the atmosphere ellins et al 1990 properties that make ra and rn effective tracers include their natural origin reliability of measurements and the potential to integrate processes that can be highly heterogeneous burnett et al 2006 stieglitz et al 2008 the usual natural tracer methodology consists of a mass balance defining the sources and sinks for the surface water body that is being studied burnett et al 2010 cable et al 1996 ra sources and sinks include generation by alpha recoil and desorption from benthic or suspended sediments radioactive decay adsorption or co precipitation mixing with other waters with different compositions for example in bays with the ocean water river inputs and sgd generally the sources and sinks other than sgd are calculated based on assumptions or data and the input of the tracer from sgd is then estimated by difference in order to calculate the sgd flux the tracer concentration in discharge must be known this is termed the endmember endmembers may include one or more types of discharging groundwater open ocean water and or river water finally the residence time of water in the receiving water body is estimated either using ra based or other methods and used to calculate the water input from sgd cable et al 1996 corbett et al 1999 ellins et al 1990 rama and moore 1996 accurately estimating the groundwater endmember ra or rn concentration is critical for obtaining an accurate sgd calculation but it can be difficult to accomplish in a review of 116 studies in different world locations girault et al 2016 showed 9 and 6 orders of magnitude variation in the activities of samples for 222rn and 226ra respectively similar results were found by dragović et al 2012 related to the geological and environmental conditions of samples in serbia for 226ra and by zhuo et al 2001 whose inventory of 552 groundwater samples in southwest china showed several orders of magnitude variability in 222rn activity at local scales substantial heterogeneity has also been observed gonneea et al 2008 sadat noori et al 2015 stachelhaus et al 2012 this variability has been highlighted as one of the main challenges in defining the groundwater endmember krest and harvey 2003 michael et al 2011 and the main source of uncertainty both for rn atkins et al 2013 dimova et al 2013 peterson et al 2010 and ra hughes et al 2015 kim et al 2005 tracer methods there are several causes for the ra and rn variability in groundwater one is a difference in generation rates due to heterogeneity in sediment composition burnett and dulaiova 2003 michael et al 2011 this has been shown through lab experiments using sediment cores gonneea et al 2008 where layers 1 m apart interacted differently with water salinity is another factor that substantially affects sorption desorption processes for ra rama and moore 1996 swarzenski 2007 in coastal areas salinity plays a key role since freshwater transitions to saltwater in both surface water and groundwater often over short distances other geochemical variations can also affect ra behavior such as ph lauria et al 2004 sanchez and rodriguez alvarez 1999 redox conditions sturchio et al 2001 vinson et al 2009 and major dissolved ions onishchenko et al 2010 the difficulty in defining the groundwater endmember is also a problem of scale because activities differ over short distances a few meters or less schmidt et al 2009 smith et al 2008 using the mean value of a few isolated samples can be unreliable several studies address the problem of the required number of samples for decreasing uncertainties in the definition of the groundwater endmembers charette 2007 makings et al 2014 santos et al 2014 sadat noori et al 2015 tested how results varied with an increasing number of rn samples n 27 in groundwater in their study area they found that 20 samples adequately represented the average regional rn activity another issue is that the activity of natural tracers in coastal discharging groundwater often does not just have a unimodal distribution with a high variance rather it is a multimodal distribution because it is composed of varying proportions of groundwater types with different origins and chemistries three primary mechanisms drive groundwater discharge in coastal areas discharge of freshwater from inland recharge fig 1 flow 1 convective saltwater circulation driven by density gradients fig 1 flow 2 and small scale saltwater circulation or benthic exchange due to processes such as tides waves and currents e g russoniello et al 2018 santos et al 2012 sawyer et al 2013 fig 1 flow 3 in the case of ra average activities even considering overall variability are generally significantly different among groundwater of different origin e g liu et al 2018 michael et al 2011 ra activities are often very low and similar to surface water in fresh groundwater making the tracer useless for this portion of sgd highest in brackish groundwater and intermediate in saline groundwater thus in order to define a single endmember it would be necessary to define the tracer concentration in each type of groundwater and determine the proportion of flux contributed by each despite all of these complications and the importance of knowing the endmember value it is common in the literature to find the definition of endmembers based on between a few and a dozen samples generally due to practical limitations such as the availability of wells or the possibility of obtaining a large enough sample i e garcia solsona et al 2008 additionally relevant geochemical data such as salinity is often missing in most cases authors do not discuss how representative the groundwater samples are from a hydrogeological perspective for example cho and kim 2016 indicated the possibility of a global overestimation of sgd rates due to the frequent use of endmembers with lower salinity that would transport a lower amount of ra possibly because inland wells are generally drilled to obtain freshwater and not saltwater michael et al 2011 further ra activities in sampled inland groundwater may be quite different than in discharging groundwater due to geochemical alteration along flowpaths the definition of the groundwater ra and rn endmember has a critical impact on the results obtained but this aspect of the research is often minimized compared with the typically more thorough characterization of the ra and rn distributions in surface water even with the wide application of these tracer methods and the difficulty in endmember estimation few studies have systematically measured discharging groundwater discharge directly to characterize the spatial variability of radioactive tracer activities studies with higher spatial resolution have been limited to cross sections i e dimova et al 2013 dulaiova et al 2008 liu et al 2018 michael et al 2011 that consider onshore to offshore variability related to flowpaths salinity or water origin but cannot capture aquifer heterogeneity that results in small scale and alongshore variations in this work we characterize tracer activities in discharging water using seepage meters and piezometers arranged in a dense 2d grid to understand meter scale variability in ra and rn activities and fluxes the measured activities of 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra and 222rn were compared with measured sgd fluxes and salinity and knowledge of the associated flow system to investigate the association between hydrogeological processes and radioactive tracer distributions this understanding is essential to improve the application of these widely used tracer methods and to obtain more accurate estimates of sgd and associated chemical fluxes to oceans and surface water bodies 2 study area two field campaigns were conducted at holts landing state park delaware usa on the southern shore of indian river bay fig 2 a 37 km2 shallow 3 m maximum depth microtidal mean tide range 0 82 m estuary on delaware s atlantic coast topography in the 223 km2 watershed is subdued with a maximum elevation of 16 5 m russoniello et al 2016 a mean annual precipitation of 1140 mm is distributed throughout the year air temperature varies considerably between summer mean 25 c and winter mean 2 c noaa ncdc 2010 resulting in variable recharge due to changes in evapotranspiration rates that drive annual water table fluctuations of several meters andres et al 2015 the ecological health of the watershed has declined in recent decades as high nutrient loads from development and agricultural practices have caused eutrophication bratton et al 2004 high hydraulic conductivity of shallow sediments throughout the watershed results a significant seaward nutrient transport via groundwater e g andres 1992 russoniello et al 2016 the geology of the area is dominated by a thick series of sedimentary units 2500 m which are topped by the pleistocene beaverdam formation fm ramsey 2010 in many places the silty sands of the beaverdam fm have been eroded and infilled with holocene estuarine peats and clays chrzastowski 1986 krantz et al 2004 russoniello et al 2013 these paleovalley fill sequences act as low hydraulic conductivity k caps that prevent nearshore sgd whereas in interfluve areas without clay caps the discharge is more focused along the shoreline e g bratton et al 2004 russoniello et al 2013 sawyer et al 2014 in holts landing state park a series of breakwaters was constructed meters away from the shore to prevent erosion of the coastline this has created a fringe where the deposition of fine sediments has been enhanced especially during low tide generating another cap layer fig 2 along the shoreline with low hydraulic conductivity that prevents the discharge of groundwater close to the shore and causes groundwater to discharge on the other side of the breakwater the intertidal circulation of saltwater due to tide and wave action observed at other locations e g heiss and michael 2014 michael et al 2005 robinson et al 2007 xin et al 2010 is absent at this field site because of the breakwater and the low k fringe this situation is fortuitous for the measurement of sgd because the relatively deep 1m and flat area of bayfloor with soft sediments and low wave action is an ideal location for the installation of seepage meters in most coastal areas no cap layer exists near the shore so sgd occurs right at the shoreline where variable water depth wave action and a steeper slope make the use of seepage meters more difficult in the proximity of the shore line we selected a study area in the interfluve with relatively homogenous hydrogeology unaffected by the presence of paleochannels so only the effect of intra unit heterogeneity within the beaverdam fm was considered this information was provided by previous studies using geophysics and seepage meters krantz et al 2004 russoniello et al 2013 the location of the seepage meter grid was aligned with the flow direction from one of the wells inland well 4 fig 2 and it was also in close proximity to the other wells fig 2 this facilitated comparisons between the chemistry of inland groundwater and discharging groundwater collected from seepage meters 3 methods two field sampling campaigns were conducted a preliminary survey on october 26 30 2015 and a complete survey on july 13 17 2016 to measure spatial variations in sgd rates and chemistry submarine groundwater discharge measurements were made with 30 lee type seepage meters lee 1977 constructed from steel 55 gallon drums with a diameter of 58 cm following the recommendations of previous studies michael et al 2003 russoniello and michael 2015 detailed descriptions and images of the design and function of these seepage meters are presented elsewhere i e duque et al 2018b rosenberry 2005 seepage meters were painted on all sides to prevent corrosion seepage meters were deployed in a rectangular grid with 5 rows cross shore direction and 6 columns along shore direction with approximately 3 m spacing in both campaigns fig 2 seepage meter locations were based on knowledge of sgd patterns at the field site russoniello et al 2013 sawyer et al 2014 and were measured with a trimble rtk gps with centimeter horizontal precision seepage meters were deployed for the second campaign in approximately the same location as the first campaign in both instances seepage meters were installed several days prior to commencement of the campaign to allow discharging groundwater to flush the seepage meter headspace before measurements were made electrical conductivity temperature and depth sensors ctd in situ aquatroll 100 were deployed in three seepage meters to verify that groundwater fully flushed the seepage meter headspace by the commencement of the campaign seepage meter samples were collected in thin walled durable plastic autoclave bags during the first campaign in october 2015 the bags were prefilled with 2 l of ra free tap water to allow measurement of groundwater recharge and to prevent bag induced measurement artifacts e g murdoch and kelly 2003 shaw and prepas 1989 during the july 2016 campaign the bags were attached empty because high discharge and zero recharge had been observed in the previous campaign and bag induced flow measurement artifacts were considered minor compared with the potential influence on salinity and tracer concentrations considering the overall high discharge rates during the october 2015 campaign seepage meters were sampled three times over a half tidal cycle at 2 h intervals 10 00 12 00 12 00 14 00 14 00 16 00 during the july 2016 campaign each seepage meter was sampled five times over a half tidal cycle 9 00 11 00 11 00 13 00 13 00 15 00 15 00 17 00 17 00 19 00 after each interval the sample bag was removed and a previously prepared bag was immediately affixed to prevent inflow of bay water to the seepage meter during the bag exchange each bag had a valve so that it could be closed during removal and while unattached this bag exchange was completed by 3 5 operators to obtain an approximately simultaneous sampling of all the seepage meters the total time for sample collection and bag replacement never exceeded 30 min electrical conductivity ec corrected to 25 c of seepage meter samples groundwater and surface water samples was measured by using a ysi ec300 handheld conductivity instrument expected error less than 1 of the reading for seawater at a given temperature ec and salinity are directly proportional to each other and for ease of comparison with other studies we present the equivalent salinity value for key ec measurements the percentage of freshwater and saltwater flux for each discharge sample was calculated by assuming an electrical conductivity of 0 7 ms cm salinity 1 g l for the fresh water endmember based on the ec of the well closest to the discharge area and conductivity for the saline endmember equal to that measured for bay water on the day of sampling range 41 47ms cm or 26 2 30 5 g l discharge accumulated in each seepage meter was retained for ra analysis differing sgd rates to each seepage meter resulted in different water volumes collected for ra analysis sample volumes ranged from 6 5 to 17 l in october 2015 and from 9 to 83 l in july 2016 in october 2015 19 l buckets were used to transport samples back to the lab for analysis necessitating a fraction of large volume samples to be discarded however in july 2016 the entire collected volume of each sample was processed on site rn sampling was done by extracting groundwater with a pushpoint minipiezometer diameter 5 mm and screen of 3 cm m h e products east tawas mi at 25 cm depth during sample collection the insertion process did not allow groundwater into the piezometer until the screen was located at the correct depth but a 50 100 ml volume 2 5 5 times the volume in the sampler for a 25 cm water column was discarded before the sample was collected to guarantee a representative sample of groundwater extraction was accomplished by slow suction with a tube attached to a syringe keeping the sample at constant extraction pressure to prevent degassing or mixing with atmospheric air samples were collected in 250 ml gas tight bottles which were filled from bottom to top and overflowed prior to capping to prevent degassing and atmospheric exchange if bubbles were generated during sampling the sample was discarded and a new bubble free sample was collected samples were analyzed within four days and generally within less than 24 h using a rad7 radon detector with rad h2o accessory durridge co billerica ma the wat250 measurement protocol was used except that counting time was extended from the default of 30 min to 3 h per sample to reduce uncertainty resulting from low sample activity for analysis of ra isotopes ra was pre concentrated by adsorption from each water sample onto mn oxide coated acrylic fiber dulaiova and burnett 2004 kim et al 2001 moore and reid 1973 water was aerated before ra adsorption to cause degassing and oxidation that would help ensure quantitative extraction dulaiova and burnett 2004 turbidity was negligible and water was not filtered water was passed slowly 1 l per minute by gravity feed through ¼ inch plastic tubing into the inlet of a 100 cm3 flow through cartridge containing 14 g of mn coated acrylic fiber scientific computer instruments columbia sc which adsorbed ra from the water after draining and removal from the cartridge the fiber was transferred to a labeled plastic zip loc bag for transport to the laboratory extraction efficiency was evaluated by passing water through two columns in series and no detectable ra was found in the downstream column indicating essentially quantitative removal by the first column for short lived isotope 223ra and 224ra analysis mn fibers were rinsed with fresh tap water and air dried to achieve a water to fiber weight ratio of between 0 4 and 1 1 for optimum counting efficiency moore 2008 sun and torgersen 1998 short lived ra isotope activities were then measured on a radium delayed coincidence counter radecc system at american university using the protocols described by knee et al 2008 and street et al 2008 based on techniques developed by moore 1976 and moore and arnold 1996 initial 223ra and 224ra measurements were made within 10 days of collection and all samples were run a second time 3 6 weeks after collection to correct for 228th supported 224ra activity the error associated with each short lived ra isotope measurement was calculated using methods described by garcia solsona et al 2008 median relative errors were 37 and 18 of sample activity for 223ra and 224ra respectively and any measurements with relative errors 100 corresponding to low activities close to the lower limit of detection n 3 for 223ra and n 1 for 224ra respectively were considered to have an activity of half the lower limit of detection this lower limit was estimated as 0 1 dpm 100 l for 223ra and 1 dpm 100 l for 224ra the estimate for the lower limit of detection was based on the uncertainty which is itself a function of the number of decays counted over the maximum 4 h run time and the background counts per minute recorded by the radecc system as the number of counts decreases the relative uncertainty increases and approaches 100 which is interpreted as the lower detection limit the number of counts is influenced by the sample activity as well as the sample volume and the time elapsed between collecting and running the sample in this case we inspected the calculated activity and relative uncertainty of each sample estimated the activity when relative uncertainty was equal to 100 and assumed that to be the lower detection limit for 226ra and 228ra the mn fiber samples were ashed at 700 c and sealed after cooling in labeled 7 ml polypropylene vials two high purity ge gamma spectrometers model gwl 170 15 lb awt with 15 mm well diameter eg g ortec ametek inc were used to measure sample gamma emissions at the university of delaware 226ra was measured from its emission at 186 2 kev and 228ra through the 228ac gamma emission at 911 3 kev reference measurements were calibrated with certified nist 4965 and nist 4339b standard radium solutions us national institute of standards and technology specific activities and one sigma errors were calculated using standard counting techniques mook 2001 and are reported in units of becquerels per kilogram bq kg and converted to dpm 100 l activities were corrected for detector background and for decay that occurred between sample collection and analysis on the gamma spectrometer the limit of detection for each radionuclide was defined as three times the standard deviation of the background under the peak used for the activity quantification reported analytical errors are 1 standard deviation based on counting statistics five nearby onshore wells were sampled to estimate ra and rn activities in the groundwater endmember s as it is usual in sgd studies wells were purged by pumping three times the volume stored in the well prior to each sampling these wells had different salinities due to the intersection of the saltwater freshwater interface at different depths a ctd logger was installed in a well located 70 m inland of the shoreline to record changes in the water table elevation and ec at 10 to 15 min intervals a ctd was also installed beneath a nearby pier to record the tide level of bay water a barometer installed at the well allowed for atmospheric corrections to be made to measurements from both sensors groundwater below the area covered by the seepage meters along a transect was collected with samplers every 25 cm up to 1 5 m depth ec was measured to establish how freshwater transitions to saltwater in the aquifer below the bay and verify the results obtained with the seepage meters here we present results from the july 2016 sampling campaign because it was more complete for 2015 only 10 samples were collected for 222rn the analytical methods were corrected and adapted to the characteristics of this zone analytical uncertainties were reduced by increasing sample volumes and or increasing the counting time and the field methods were tested and improved after the 2015 reconnaissance survey a system for ra extraction of samples in situ was constructed and two rad7s were used for in situ analysis of 222rn in spite of the improvements in the methodologies it was possible to detect that the general trends observed in 2015 were similar in 2016 indicating that the results presented here are consistent during longer periods of time and not only applicable to the specific time of sampling 4 results 4 1 salinity and flux distribution the samples collected from the seepage meter bags and from direct sampling with the pushpoint sampler in the aquifer adjacent to each seepage meter showed a salinity distribution that reflected the location of the freshwater saltwater interface the seepage meter grid spanned an area where freshwater was dominant another where saltwater was dominant and the transition or interface zone between them the measured ec ranged from fresh 2 ms cm salinity 1 g l to saline 40 ms cm salinity 25 5 g l over a distance of less than 6 m the interface zone was 3 5 m wide fig 3 a the sampling locations were classified as freshwater saltwater or interface dominated based on the salinities measured and the spatial distribution the first two rows 12 sampling points were classified as freshwater 7 points as freshwater saltwater interface and 11 points located mostly in the last two rows were classified as saltwater two or three points classified as interface could also have been classified as saltwater fig 3c the flux distribution varied somewhat with salinity in general higher fluxes were measured in the freshwater and interface areas table 1 compared to the saltwater area further offshore fig 3b the highest fluxes were associated with the saltwater freshwater interface fig 3c similar distributions have been observed in other studies at different sites duque et al 2018b michael et al 2005 4 2 tracer results rn and ra activities duque et al 2019 were characterized for each zone with descriptive statistics tables 1 and 2 the mean analytical error compared with the mean value was highest for 226ra 41 and lower for the other ra isotopes 223ra 36 224ra 25 and 228ra 3 table 2 measurements were highly variable ranging from below detection limit to high values due to the different environments variations in salinity flow paths fluxes that were captured in the samples tables 1 and 2 ra activity varied strongly between categories with much lower values in fresher discharge table 2 in the interface zone groundwater fluxes activities and standard deviations of 226ra and 228ra were greatest 222rn activities were highest in fresh discharge and lowest in the saltwater zone table 1 while 222rn activities are not affected by salinity differences between freshwater zone and saltwater zone were observed differences in rn and ra activity among the salinity categories were evaluated fig 4 table s1 using a two sample student s t test were completed by testing the null hypothesis that the means each pair of categories saltwater freshwater saltwater interface interface freshwater were the same if the null hypothesis was rejected the interpretation is that the two categories had significantly different mean values the t test is a standard and widely used statistical method for 223ra 224ra and 228ra saltwater activity was significantly higher 3 4 times higher than that of freshwater the minimum values near the lower detection limit were all located in the freshwater zone for 223ra and 224ra freshwater and saltwater were significantly different sw fw 223ra p 2 6 10 3 224ra p 1 7 10 4 while the interface was not statistically distinct from the saltwater zone sw int 223ra p 4 2 10 1 224ra p 4 4 10 1 for 226ra and 228ra the distinction between saltwater and freshwater is clear sw fw 226ra p value 9 2 10 2 224ra p 1 2 10 9 the t test could not statistically differentiate between saltwater and interface zones sw int 226ra p 1 9 10 1 228ra p 3 5 10 1 probably due to the high variability of concentrations in the interface zone fig 4 222rn activity showed a gradual transition from the location where freshwater was dominant high values to the saltwater areas low values and a t test confirmed that freshwater n 12 had significantly higher 222rn than saltwater n 11 p 1 2 10 3 rn and ra activities in inland wells varied over a large range although they are located at variable distances from the shore fig 1 and at different depths they are all within 120 m of the seepage meter grid and in the same geological unit wells 1 2 and 3 are nested at different depths in the same location and the screens intersect different parts of the salinity interface detailed information about the wells and their characteristics can be found in andres et al 2015 thus differences in ra table 3 are related to the depth and salinity well 4 is closest to the location of the seepage meter grid and probably in the same flow line of groundwater discharging to the bay fig 1 hence it was selected to compare groundwater in wells with that discharging to the bay 4 3 spatial distribution ra activities generally increased from the fresh to saline portions of the sampling grid which is expected due higher mobility of ra with higher salinity elsinger and moore 1984 however within salinity zones there was strong spatial variability in ra over short distances fig 5 the lowest ra activities generally occurred in the row of seepage meters located closest to the shoreline where there was the greatest proportion of freshwater but the highest activities did not occur in the most offshore row for all the ra isotopes in the case of long lived isotopes 228ra and 226ra the maxima were located in the freshwater saltwater interface zone but activities were highly variable for the short lived isotopes 223ra and 224ra there was a more gradual transition from the freshwater sampling points where activities were near 0 to the maximum values located in the saltwater area fig 5 comparison between 228ra and 222rn with respect to electrical conductivity shows the differences between the tracers fig 6 the highest activity of 222rn was located in the freshwater zone closest to shore it was much lower near the lower detection limit in the saltwater zone 222rn activity decreased systematically with salinity unlike ra which peaked at intermediate salinity there was also spatial variability in the activities measured for each of the salinity zones defined the activity of 222rn for samples collected in the freshwater area ranged from 25 to 200 pci l and from 0 to 100 pci l for samples collected in the saltwater area 228ra activities ranged from 0 to 50 dpm 100l for freshwater samples and 50 300 dpm 100l for saltwater samples fig 6 5 discussion 5 1 spatial variability of ra and rn these results illustrate the meter scale spatial variability of natural sgd tracer activities the sampling points were located 3 m apart and the maximum distance within the study area was less than 20 m nevertheless the observed activities varied by up to a factor of 1000 even for this small area a key controlling factor was salinity or groundwater origin as the variability in activity is reduced when samples of 222rn and ra are compared only within areas dominated by freshwater or saltwater this observed heterogeneity complicates endmember definition in the application of these tracers to more extensive areas for example with the utilization of isolated samples that can introduce large errors into estimations of the average activity of ra and rn in sgd the spatial variability of ra has been observed and described previously based on cross sectional studies knee et al 2008 liu et al 2018 michael et al 2005 street et al 2008 however in this case it is possible to see that there is also high lateral variability along shore in principle the observed differences between activities of different ra isotopes are related to their half lives and the abundances of their parent isotopes in the u and th series since the chemical behavior of the isotopes is identical thus variation in water flow paths and residence times are likely to control the differential behavior of ra isotopes in groundwater e g michael et al 2011 5 2 salinity changes in groundwater and impact over radioactive tracers the freshwater saltwater interface will be present in any coastal area where there is freshwater discharge accounting for the salinity distribution when developing a sampling plan for characterizing radioisotope concentrations in endmembers will help to reduce bias and uncertainty this is illustrated by the samples that were collected from the inland wells wells 1 2 and 3 are all located the same distance from shore but at different depths the ra activities for each of the wells were distinct due to the salinity changes with depth produced by the saltwater freshwater interface location each of the wells would be more representative of freshwater or saltwater so an optimal approach would be to select the sample that is more representative of the desired endmember i e freshwater or saltwater discharge and to characterize its uncertainty the challenge in defining representative endmembers associated with salinity distributions can also be temporal the freshwater saltwater interface location is affected by transient processes such as water abstraction for irrigation and supply changes in inland recharge and climatic oscillations this complicates sampling in longer term studies since it cannot be assumed that endmember activities are constant cerdà domènech et al 2017 this would have a direct impact for example in regions with marked seasonal oscillations that could lead to an apparent higher ra activity in the dry seasons than in the wet season if the same wells were sampled without considering movement of the saltwater freshwater interface changes in the inland water table can also alter the position of the salinity discharge zones offshore which would need to be considered for the appropriate placement of seepage meters a second complication in defining endmembers is the variation in activities along flowpaths a simple comparison of the arithmetic mean of the dataset collected in the seepage meters with the measurements in well 4 located along the flow line of the discharging water at a distance of less than 100 m showed an enrichment from well 4 to discharge point of 175 278 20 and 374 of the seepage meter average for 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra respectively the cause for this may be differences in the water sources or geochemical processes along the flowpath prior to discharge since the ec in the well was similar to the discharging freshwater ec 0 6 ms cm or salinity 1 g l the same comparison can be done with only the freshwater samples in the seepage meters with these results 75 73 25 and 69 for 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra respectively seepage meter samples collected in the freshwater zone were fairly similar in terms of ec to well water well 3 had the highest ec 20 ms cm or salinity 12 making it the most comparable to saline seepage meter samples despite having similar ec to these saline seepage meter samples table 2 the well had ra activities 5 25 times higher this may reflect saline wedge interception in the well and or that the well and the groundwater discharge zone are along different flowpaths the well is located around 120 m to the west of the sampling area in general these comparisons indicate that groundwater samples from wells may not adequately represent sgd to the surface water body the distance between the well and discharge point is critical and large differences can occur over short distances for this reason direct sampling from discharging water is recommended 5 3 flow paths and ra distribution coastal groundwater flow and mixing processes occur on a range of time scales similar to the range in ra half lives which are proportional to production rate as a result ra isotope ratios can potentially be used to understand flow processes in coastal groundwater systems 226ra and 228ra have half lives of 1600 years and 5 8 years respectively therefore if they are removed by any process it will take a long time to reach a new equilibrium the half lives of 223ra and 224ra are much shorter 11 4 and 3 6 days respectively and while long lived isotopes reflect an integrated value of the processes taking place in the system the short lived isotopes are more sensitive to the immediate environment rama and moore 1996 assuming that variations in the underlying geology do not affect ra isotope production in the study area a relatively high 223ra 228ra or 224ra 228ra ratio would indicate the dominance of short residence time processes since short lived isotopes respond more quickly to changes than long lived isotopes rama and moore 1996 previous studies with analytical simulation of the generation of ra isotopes michael et al 2011 tamborski et al 2017 showed that it takes 20 30 days to fully regenerate the short lived isotopes of ra and much longer years for 226ra and 228ra therefore these results would be indicative of processes that are shorter or longer than about one month charette 2007 michael et al 2011 moore 2003 here we refer to these as fast and slow processes respectively saltwater recirculation benthic exchange is a fast process that does not allow enough time for the longer lived isotopes of ra 226ra and 228ra to build up in groundwater a longer flow path such as that along the saltwater freshwater interface driven by density gradients would allow for generation of 228ra and potentially 226ra depending on the ratio of residence time to production rate and would be considered slow considering this conceptualization 226ra and 228ra activities were highest in the interface zone between fresh and saline groundwater figs 4 and 5 two different underlying mechanisms could produce this pattern one possibility is that the freshwater saltwater interface moves back and forth seasonally during wet periods ra would accumulate by adsorption to the surfaces of sediments in the freshwater part of the aquifer then during drier periods the saltwater freshwater interface would retreat and saltwater would flow into this part of the aquifer increasing the desorption of ra and allowing it to be flushed out the accumulation and release of ra connected to the changes in water table and the oscillations of the saltwater freshwater interface has been described as an explanation for the changes in ra activity along vertical profiles dulaiova et al 2008 the reasons for changes in the saltwater freshwater interface position are connected to inland recharge which oscillates seasonally in this temperate zone due primarily to evapotranspiration and precipitation changes e g michael et al 2005 a second potential reason for high long lived isotope activities along the interface is that discharge in this zone is a result of longer groundwater flow paths with greater residence time density driven flow induces groundwater to follow a circulation path downward and then upwards along the freshwater saltwater interface kohout 1964 this hydrogeological process causes groundwater to circulate for a longer time in contact with the sediments increasing the content of 228ra and potentially 226ra the spatial distribution of ra isotope ratios support this interpretation the ratios of short lived to long lived isotopes 223ra 228ra and 224ra 228ra are greatest in the areas where saltwater is dominant and lower in interface areas fig 7 this reflects the difference in residence time between discharge driven only by benthic exchange short residence time as expected in the saltwater only zone and discharge driven by density gradients longer residence time a short groundwater residence time results in a higher short lived to long lived isotope ratio than a long residence time the 228ra 226ra ratios have a more homogeneous distribution in the saltwater areas fig 7 since both isotopes are indicators of regional processes in the system and they are not as useful for resolving processes occurring on shorter time scales 5 4 222rn salinity has a minor effect in the solubility of 222rn schubert et al 2012 usually it is assumed that 222rn is transported by groundwater once it is generated by decay of 226ra as a consequence of its high solubility in water relative to its production rate stellato et al 2013 since it would be equally enriched in fresh or saline groundwater mulligan and charette 2006 sadat noori et al 2015 it is considered a tracer of total groundwater discharge however in the sampling completed for this work there are differences in rn activity among the three discharge zones based on ec these may be explained by differences in the residence time of groundwater similar to ra isotopes 222rn accumulates over time according to its half life requiring approximately three weeks to approach equilibrium with 226ra in this case 222rn is highest in fresh discharge intermediate in the interface and lowest in the saline discharge zone fresh discharge should have long months to decades residence times discharge in the interface should be a mix of density driven brackish groundwater with a long weeks to decades residence time and short flowpath saline benthic exchange that reflects a shorter term process hours to days in addition ra adsorption to sediments is greater under freshwater conditions than under saltwater conditions and this likely leads to higher 222rn production in freshwater aquifers than in more saline aquifers where the ra tends to be desorbed and flushed out 5 5 implications for endmembers based on this conceptualization the use of 222rn as a total sgd tracer and ra as primarily a saline sgd tracer can present issues for the definition of the endmember since both ra and rn accumulate in groundwater over time and therefore vary in groundwater with different flowpaths concentrations in discharging groundwater cannot be adequately represented by a single endmember value even if a range corresponding to uncertainty is included rather the discharging groundwater represents a continuum of endmembers and the best way to capture its characteristics may be a discharge rate weighted average for example using our rn and seepage meter data the arithmetic mean of water fluxes and 222rn activity was calculated for the first nearest shore and last row most distant from shore the 222rn activity decreased from 94 5 to 23 2 pci l when moving offshore almost a factor of 4 while the flow was reduced only to half from 38 4 cm d to 17 8 cm d thus the application of 222rn activity for the quantification of fluxes in the bay would lead to an underestimation of sgd rate there could also be differences in endmember activities of different types of groundwater if there are heterogeneities in the abundances of parent isotopes and other aquifer characteristics that control inputs of ra isotopes and rn to the water for the correct definition of endmembers if one component is not dominant in terms of tracer contribution it is necessary to know a priori the proportion of groundwater discharge contributed by each component of discharge the results presented in this study show that ra isotope ratios can reflect the dominant flow mechanisms aiding in sample classification and quantification of fluxes alternatively they can be a tool for the definition of the hydrogeological conditions for example ra activity ratios can aid in the study of nutrient discharge to coastal areas and contaminant processes because the origin and circulation path of groundwater would be indicators of potential biochemical processes in each zone 5 6 field sampling implications the mixing of different water types in coastal areas and the necessity of a sufficient volume of sample for measuring ra can hinder the detection of the patterns presented to locate the different type of hydrogeological processes affecting to ra and rn as our data set demonstrates the saltwater freshwater interface is a diffuse boundary that can be highly irregular due to heterogeneity in aquifer hydraulic properties this interface can be difficult to detect by direct measurements unless an extensive 2d monitoring network is used as in this experiment a strategy for the optimization of sampling would be the use of small and surficial geophysical surveys to determine the predominance of different types of water i e kinnear et al 2013 the measurement of salinity is highly recommended not only for sampling but also for the construction of conceptual models of freshwater saltwater discharge duque et al 2018b michael et al 2005 to help in the interpretation of the data collected and assess the relevance or the impact assigned to each sample the use of cluster sampling with several samples in small areas instead of a unique sample can help to provide an estimate of variability and uncertainty due to the natural spatial variability of the systems without excessively increasing the analytical and field work in the case of sampling including seasonal variation the changes in the hydrogeological conditions i e water table can lead to modifications of the saltwater freshwater interface affecting both endmembers in wells and measurements in discharge areas the different flow paths and hydrogeological processes taking place in coastal areas play an important role in the activities of radioactive tracers characterizing them requires additional field measurements but this effort would be worthwhile because it would substantially reduce misinterpretations and erroneous estimates of sgd so far this is the first study to directly measure the spatial distribution of radioactive tracers in discharging groundwater and compare it to that in nearby wells we think that this type of work should be more frequent in the application of these tracers instead of an anomaly 6 conclusions ra activity in coastal groundwater is highly variable due to the salinity differences within the saltwater freshwater interface even over short distances such as those presented in this study and under apparent homogeneous hydrogeological conditions and sedimentary composition considerable spatial variability occurs ra activity is affected by the hydrogeological processes taking place in coastal areas the freshwater zone is defined by the lower salinity and lower ra activity the interface zone presents higher activities in 226ra and 228ra due to the longer flow path as a consequence of density driven flow and higher activities of 223ra and 224ra are measured in the zones dominated by recirculation of saline water applying 222rn as a total sgd tracer can be problematic when short term circulation patterns dominate the hydrological conditions because this type of circulation was associated with lower rn activity in groundwater the results presented in this work showed a higher 222rn activity in the areas dominated by freshwater due to the longer groundwater residence time in the aquifer and greater concentration of adsorbed ra on aquifer surfaces the use of seepage meters for sampling submarine groundwater discharge has several advantages used in clusters measurement can be a useful alternative for the definition of spatially variable endmembers and can enable better assessment of uncertainty our results indicate that a grid of seepage meters provides a more accurate characterization of the discharging groundwater endmember compared with wells the use of inland wells as groundwater endmembers can introduce potentially large errors since various processes that affect natural tracer concentrations can take place along the flow path between the well location and the coastal discharge area the main challenge in using seepage meters is the restrictions associated with installation and the amount of manual labor required while radium and radon isotopes are useful tools as demonstrated in multiple sgd studies they must be used carefully the very large impacts of the origin and flowpaths of discharging groundwater on tracer concentrations should be a major consideration in their application because it can reduce their reliability or even render them useless as indicators of hydrologic processes moving forward the community must recognize these dependencies and make every effort to apply radiochemical tracers in the most accurate way possible even if that means making more measurements conducting uncertainty analyses and collaborating across disciplines taking into consideration the hydrogeological conditions saltwater freshwater interface seasonal changes residence times the design of sampling surveys considering the discharge conceptual models and the natural spatial variability will lead to more accurate results in the estimation of

6077,inadequate characterization of variability in natural tracers of submarine groundwater discharge sgd introduces large errors into tracer derived sgd estimates to address this gap we investigated spatial variability in the natural sgd tracers 223ra 224ra 226ra 228ra and 222rn using a high density array of piezometers and seepage meters over a nearshore area where discharging groundwater transitioned from fresh to saline seepage meters and piezometers were used to sample groundwater and to quantify fluxes and salinity a series of spatial patterns was distinguished beyond the normal salinity impact on ra activity the discharge in the interface between saltwater and freshwater was characterized by higher activities of the longer lived isotopes 226ra and 228ra while areas dominated by benthic exchange had higher activities of the shorter lived isotopes 223ra and 224ra spatial differences in ra activities were associated with variation in salinity and residence time in the aquifer and were indicative of underlying hydrogeological processes at the freshwater saltwater interface fresh discharge is driven by terrestrial hydraulic gradients and saline discharge is driven by density gradients both result in long residence times in the aquifer benthic exchange of saltwater has shorter residence times much less than required to enrich long lived isotopes and reach secular equilibrium the highest activities of 222rn were detected in the fresh discharge zone and the lowest activities in areas dominated by benthic exchange direct sampling at discharge points allowed comparison between groundwater collected from inland wells and the water discharging to the bay and indicated significant differences in the activities despite the short distance from wells to the discharge area substantial spatial variability in ra and rn was observed on the meter scale with trends that reflected groundwater origin and residence time inadequate characterization of variability trends and fluxes introduces large errors into tracer derived estimates of submarine groundwater discharge thus the study of submarine groundwater discharge with radioactive tracers requires adequate hydrogeological knowledge to identify processes that have strong impacts on ra and rn activities and associated fluxes to the ocean keywords submarine groundwater discharge radium radon spatial variability seepage meters 1 introduction the use of naturally occurring radioactive tracers for quantifying submarine groundwater discharge sgd has become a standard method within the scientific community over the last two decades since its first use moore 1996 these tracers have been applied in coastal locations around the world notable improvements in analytical techniques e g moore 2008 molina porras et al 2017 have been made and our understanding of the processes that must be considered when using a mass balance based on radioactive tracers continues to improve quantification of groundwater discharge is required for investigation of ocean budgets of constituents such as silica tréguer and de la rocha 2013 calcium carbonate milliman 1993 and excess nutrients kelly and moran 2002 krest et al 2000 rapaglia et al 2010 sadat noori et al 2016 that are usually associated with anthropogenic sources such as fertilizers and wastewater nutrient and other sgd borne pollution inputs can severely impair coastal ecosystems johannes 1980 valiela et al 1990 however sgd can be one of the most challenging terms in the water budget to quantify sgd is usually not visible and occurs under the sea so indirect methods are required to detect and measure it sgd can be especially important on oceanic islands e g kim and kim 2011 knee et al 2016 and in arid coastal environments where freshwater resources are scarce gallardo 2019 and groundwater is essential for water management duque et al 2018a eissa et al 2018 the most common natural tracers used for estimating water budgets in coastal areas are 223ra 224ra 226ra 228ra and 222rn the four ra isotopes are generated from the disintegration chains of u and th present in rocks and sediment grains and therefore they are generally more abundant in groundwater relative to seawater rama and moore 1996 or meteoric freshwater ra decays but otherwise generally behaves conservatively once released into marine and surface waters charette et al 2001 222rn is the daughter of 226ra as a noble gas it does not react with sediments or water when transported in groundwater but it can evade to the atmosphere ellins et al 1990 properties that make ra and rn effective tracers include their natural origin reliability of measurements and the potential to integrate processes that can be highly heterogeneous burnett et al 2006 stieglitz et al 2008 the usual natural tracer methodology consists of a mass balance defining the sources and sinks for the surface water body that is being studied burnett et al 2010 cable et al 1996 ra sources and sinks include generation by alpha recoil and desorption from benthic or suspended sediments radioactive decay adsorption or co precipitation mixing with other waters with different compositions for example in bays with the ocean water river inputs and sgd generally the sources and sinks other than sgd are calculated based on assumptions or data and the input of the tracer from sgd is then estimated by difference in order to calculate the sgd flux the tracer concentration in discharge must be known this is termed the endmember endmembers may include one or more types of discharging groundwater open ocean water and or river water finally the residence time of water in the receiving water body is estimated either using ra based or other methods and used to calculate the water input from sgd cable et al 1996 corbett et al 1999 ellins et al 1990 rama and moore 1996 accurately estimating the groundwater endmember ra or rn concentration is critical for obtaining an accurate sgd calculation but it can be difficult to accomplish in a review of 116 studies in different world locations girault et al 2016 showed 9 and 6 orders of magnitude variation in the activities of samples for 222rn and 226ra respectively similar results were found by dragović et al 2012 related to the geological and environmental conditions of samples in serbia for 226ra and by zhuo et al 2001 whose inventory of 552 groundwater samples in southwest china showed several orders of magnitude variability in 222rn activity at local scales substantial heterogeneity has also been observed gonneea et al 2008 sadat noori et al 2015 stachelhaus et al 2012 this variability has been highlighted as one of the main challenges in defining the groundwater endmember krest and harvey 2003 michael et al 2011 and the main source of uncertainty both for rn atkins et al 2013 dimova et al 2013 peterson et al 2010 and ra hughes et al 2015 kim et al 2005 tracer methods there are several causes for the ra and rn variability in groundwater one is a difference in generation rates due to heterogeneity in sediment composition burnett and dulaiova 2003 michael et al 2011 this has been shown through lab experiments using sediment cores gonneea et al 2008 where layers 1 m apart interacted differently with water salinity is another factor that substantially affects sorption desorption processes for ra rama and moore 1996 swarzenski 2007 in coastal areas salinity plays a key role since freshwater transitions to saltwater in both surface water and groundwater often over short distances other geochemical variations can also affect ra behavior such as ph lauria et al 2004 sanchez and rodriguez alvarez 1999 redox conditions sturchio et al 2001 vinson et al 2009 and major dissolved ions onishchenko et al 2010 the difficulty in defining the groundwater endmember is also a problem of scale because activities differ over short distances a few meters or less schmidt et al 2009 smith et al 2008 using the mean value of a few isolated samples can be unreliable several studies address the problem of the required number of samples for decreasing uncertainties in the definition of the groundwater endmembers charette 2007 makings et al 2014 santos et al 2014 sadat noori et al 2015 tested how results varied with an increasing number of rn samples n 27 in groundwater in their study area they found that 20 samples adequately represented the average regional rn activity another issue is that the activity of natural tracers in coastal discharging groundwater often does not just have a unimodal distribution with a high variance rather it is a multimodal distribution because it is composed of varying proportions of groundwater types with different origins and chemistries three primary mechanisms drive groundwater discharge in coastal areas discharge of freshwater from inland recharge fig 1 flow 1 convective saltwater circulation driven by density gradients fig 1 flow 2 and small scale saltwater circulation or benthic exchange due to processes such as tides waves and currents e g russoniello et al 2018 santos et al 2012 sawyer et al 2013 fig 1 flow 3 in the case of ra average activities even considering overall variability are generally significantly different among groundwater of different origin e g liu et al 2018 michael et al 2011 ra activities are often very low and similar to surface water in fresh groundwater making the tracer useless for this portion of sgd highest in brackish groundwater and intermediate in saline groundwater thus in order to define a single endmember it would be necessary to define the tracer concentration in each type of groundwater and determine the proportion of flux contributed by each despite all of these complications and the importance of knowing the endmember value it is common in the literature to find the definition of endmembers based on between a few and a dozen samples generally due to practical limitations such as the availability of wells or the possibility of obtaining a large enough sample i e garcia solsona et al 2008 additionally relevant geochemical data such as salinity is often missing in most cases authors do not discuss how representative the groundwater samples are from a hydrogeological perspective for example cho and kim 2016 indicated the possibility of a global overestimation of sgd rates due to the frequent use of endmembers with lower salinity that would transport a lower amount of ra possibly because inland wells are generally drilled to obtain freshwater and not saltwater michael et al 2011 further ra activities in sampled inland groundwater may be quite different than in discharging groundwater due to geochemical alteration along flowpaths the definition of the groundwater ra and rn endmember has a critical impact on the results obtained but this aspect of the research is often minimized compared with the typically more thorough characterization of the ra and rn distributions in surface water even with the wide application of these tracer methods and the difficulty in endmember estimation few studies have systematically measured discharging groundwater discharge directly to characterize the spatial variability of radioactive tracer activities studies with higher spatial resolution have been limited to cross sections i e dimova et al 2013 dulaiova et al 2008 liu et al 2018 michael et al 2011 that consider onshore to offshore variability related to flowpaths salinity or water origin but cannot capture aquifer heterogeneity that results in small scale and alongshore variations in this work we characterize tracer activities in discharging water using seepage meters and piezometers arranged in a dense 2d grid to understand meter scale variability in ra and rn activities and fluxes the measured activities of 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra and 222rn were compared with measured sgd fluxes and salinity and knowledge of the associated flow system to investigate the association between hydrogeological processes and radioactive tracer distributions this understanding is essential to improve the application of these widely used tracer methods and to obtain more accurate estimates of sgd and associated chemical fluxes to oceans and surface water bodies 2 study area two field campaigns were conducted at holts landing state park

park a series of breakwaters was constructed meters away from the shore to prevent erosion of the coastline this has created a fringe where the deposition of fine sediments has been enhanced especially during low tide generating another cap layer fig 2 along the shoreline with low hydraulic conductivity that prevents the discharge of groundwater close to the shore and causes groundwater to discharge on the other side of the breakwater the intertidal circulation of saltwater due to tide and wave action observed at other locations e g heiss and michael 2014 michael et al 2005 robinson et al 2007 xin et al 2010 is absent at this field site because of the breakwater and the low k fringe this situation is fortuitous for the measurement of sgd because the relatively deep 1m and flat area of bayfloor with soft sediments and low wave action is an ideal location for the installation of seepage meters in most coastal areas no cap layer exists near the shore so sgd occurs right at the shoreline where variable water depth wave action and a steeper slope make the use of seepage meters more difficult in the proximity of the shore line we selected a study area in the interfluve with relatively homogenous hydrogeology unaffected by the presence of paleochannels so only the effect of intra unit heterogeneity within the beaverdam fm was considered this information was provided by previous studies using geophysics and seepage meters krantz et al 2004 russoniello et al 2013 the location of the seepage meter grid was aligned with the flow direction from one of the wells inland well 4 fig 2 and it was also in close proximity to the other wells fig 2 this facilitated comparisons between the chemistry of inland groundwater and discharging groundwater collected from seepage meters 3 methods two field sampling campaigns were conducted a preliminary survey on october 26 30 2015 and a complete survey on july 13 17 2016 to measure spatial variations in sgd rates and chemistry submarine groundwater discharge measurements were made with 30 lee type seepage meters lee 1977 constructed from steel 55 gallon drums with a diameter of 58 cm following the recommendations of previous studies michael et al 2003 russoniello and michael 2015 detailed descriptions and images of the design and function of these seepage meters are presented elsewhere i e duque et al 2018b rosenberry 2005 seepage meters were painted on all sides to prevent corrosion seepage meters were deployed in a rectangular grid with 5 rows cross shore direction and 6 columns along shore direction with approximately 3 m spacing in both campaigns fig 2 seepage meter locations were based on knowledge of sgd patterns at the field site russoniello et al 2013 sawyer et al 2014 and were measured with a trimble rtk gps with centimeter horizontal precision seepage meters were deployed for the second campaign in approximately the same location as the first campaign in both instances seepage meters were installed several days prior to commencement of the campaign to allow discharging groundwater to flush the seepage meter headspace before measurements were made electrical conductivity temperature and depth sensors ctd in situ aquatroll 100 were deployed in three seepage meters to verify that groundwater fully flushed the seepage meter headspace by the commencement of the campaign seepage meter samples were collected in thin walled durable plastic autoclave bags during the first campaign in october 2015 the bags were prefilled with 2 l of ra free tap water to allow measurement of groundwater recharge and to prevent bag induced measurement artifacts e g murdoch and kelly 2003 shaw and prepas 1989 during the july 2016 campaign the bags were attached empty because high discharge and zero recharge had been observed in the previous campaign and bag induced flow measurement artifacts were considered minor compared with the potential influence on salinity and tracer concentrations considering the overall high discharge rates during the october 2015 campaign seepage meters were sampled three times over a half tidal cycle at 2 h intervals 10 00 12 00 12 00 14 00 14 00 16 00 during the july 2016 campaign each seepage meter was sampled five times over a half tidal cycle 9 00 11 00 11 00 13 00 13 00 15 00 15 00 17 00 17 00 19 00 after each interval the sample bag was removed and a previously prepared bag was immediately affixed to prevent inflow of bay water to the seepage meter during the bag exchange each bag had a valve so that it could be closed during removal and while unattached this bag exchange was completed by 3 5 operators to obtain an approximately simultaneous sampling of all the seepage meters the total time for sample collection and bag replacement never exceeded 30 min electrical conductivity ec corrected to 25 c of seepage meter samples groundwater and surface water samples was measured by using a ysi ec300 handheld conductivity instrument expected error less than 1 of the reading for seawater at a given temperature ec and salinity are directly proportional to each other and for ease of comparison with other studies we present the equivalent salinity value for key ec measurements the percentage of freshwater and saltwater flux for each discharge sample was calculated by assuming an electrical conductivity of 0 7 ms cm salinity 1 g l for the fresh water endmember based on the ec of the well closest to the discharge area and conductivity for the saline endmember equal to that measured for bay water on the day of sampling range 41 47ms cm or 26 2 30 5 g l discharge accumulated in each seepage meter was retained for ra analysis differing sgd rates to each seepage meter resulted in different water volumes collected for ra analysis sample volumes ranged from 6 5 to 17 l in october 2015 and from 9 to 83 l in july 2016 in october 2015 19 l buckets were used to transport samples back to the lab for analysis necessitating a fraction of large volume samples to be discarded however in july 2016 the entire collected volume of each sample was processed on site rn sampling was done by extracting groundwater with a pushpoint minipiezometer diameter 5 mm and screen of 3 cm m h e products east tawas mi at 25 cm depth during sample collection the insertion process did not allow groundwater into the piezometer until the screen was located at the correct depth but a 50 100 ml volume 2 5 5 times the volume in the sampler for a 25 cm water column was discarded before the sample was collected to guarantee a representative sample of groundwater extraction was accomplished by slow suction with a tube attached to a syringe keeping the sample at constant extraction pressure to prevent degassing or mixing with atmospheric air samples were collected in 250 ml gas tight bottles which were filled from bottom to top and overflowed prior to capping to prevent degassing and atmospheric exchange if bubbles were generated during sampling the sample was discarded and a new bubble free sample was collected samples were analyzed within four days and generally within less than 24 h using a rad7 radon detector with rad h2o accessory durridge co billerica ma the wat250 measurement protocol was used except that counting time was extended from the default of 30 min to 3 h per sample to reduce uncertainty resulting from low sample activity for analysis of ra isotopes ra was pre concentrated by adsorption from each water sample onto mn oxide coated acrylic fiber dulaiova and burnett 2004 kim et al 2001 moore and reid 1973 water was aerated before ra adsorption to cause degassing and oxidation that would help ensure quantitative extraction dulaiova and burnett 2004 turbidity was negligible and water was not filtered water was passed slowly 1 l per minute by gravity feed through ¼ inch plastic tubing into the inlet of a 100 cm3 flow through cartridge containing 14 g of mn coated acrylic fiber scientific computer instruments columbia sc which adsorbed ra from the water after draining and removal from the cartridge the fiber was transferred to a labeled plastic zip loc bag for transport to the laboratory extraction efficiency was evaluated by passing water through two columns in series and no detectable ra was found in the downstream column indicating essentially quantitative removal by the first column for short lived isotope 223ra and 224ra analysis mn fibers were rinsed with fresh tap water and air dried to achieve a water to fiber weight ratio of between 0 4 and 1 1 for optimum counting efficiency moore 2008 sun and torgersen 1998 short lived ra isotope activities were then measured on a radium delayed coincidence counter radecc system at american university using the protocols described by knee et al 2008 and street et al 2008 based on techniques developed by moore 1976 and moore and arnold 1996 initial 223ra and 224ra measurements were made within 10 days of collection and all samples were run a second time 3 6 weeks after collection to correct for 228th supported 224ra activity the error associated with each short lived ra isotope measurement was calculated using methods described by garcia solsona et al 2008 median relative errors were 37 and 18 of sample activity for 223ra and 224ra respectively and any measurements with relative errors 100 corresponding to low activities close to the lower limit of detection n 3 for 223ra and n 1 for 224ra respectively were considered to have an activity of half the lower limit of detection this lower limit was estimated as 0 1 dpm 100 l for 223ra and 1 dpm 100 l for 224ra the estimate for the lower limit of detection was based on the uncertainty which is itself a function of the number of decays counted over the maximum 4 h run time and the background counts per minute recorded by the radecc system as the number of counts decreases the relative uncertainty increases and approaches 100 which is interpreted as the lower detection limit the number of counts is influenced by the sample activity as well as the sample volume and the time elapsed between collecting and running the sample in this case we inspected the calculated activity and relative uncertainty of each sample estimated the activity when relative uncertainty was equal to 100 and assumed that to be the lower detection limit for 226ra and 228ra the mn fiber samples were ashed at 700 c and sealed after cooling in labeled 7 ml polypropylene vials two high purity ge gamma spectrometers model gwl 170 15 lb awt with 15 mm well diameter eg g ortec ametek inc were used to measure sample gamma emissions at the university of delaware 226ra was measured from its emission at 186 2 kev and 228ra through the 228ac gamma emission at 911 3 kev reference measurements were calibrated with certified nist 4965 and nist 4339b standard radium solutions us national institute of standards and technology specific activities and one sigma errors were calculated using standard counting techniques mook 2001 and are reported in units of becquerels per kilogram bq kg and converted to dpm 100 l activities were corrected for detector background and for decay that occurred between sample collection and analysis on the gamma spectrometer the limit of detection for each radionuclide was defined as three times the standard deviation of the background under the peak used for the activity quantification reported analytical errors are 1 standard deviation based on counting statistics five nearby onshore wells were sampled to estimate ra and rn activities in the groundwater endmember s as it is usual in sgd studies wells were purged by pumping three times the volume stored in the well prior to each sampling these wells had different salinities due to the intersection of the saltwater freshwater interface at different depths a ctd logger was installed in a well located 70 m inland of the shoreline to record changes in the water table elevation and ec at 10 to 15 min intervals a ctd was also installed beneath a nearby pier to record the tide level of bay water a barometer installed at the well allowed for atmospheric corrections to be made to measurements from both sensors groundwater below the area covered by the seepage meters along a transect was collected with samplers every 25 cm up to 1 5 m depth ec was measured to establish how freshwater transitions to saltwater in the aquifer below the bay and verify the results obtained with the seepage meters here we present results from the july 2016 sampling campaign because it was more complete for 2015 only 10 samples were collected for 222rn the analytical methods were corrected and adapted to the characteristics of this zone analytical uncertainties were reduced by increasing sample volumes and or increasing the counting time and the field methods were tested and improved after the 2015 reconnaissance survey a system for ra extraction of samples in situ was constructed and two rad7s were used for in situ analysis of 222rn in spite of the improvements in the methodologies it was possible to detect that the general trends observed in 2015 were similar in 2016 indicating that the results presented here are consistent during longer periods of time and not only applicable to the specific time of sampling 4 results 4 1 salinity and flux distribution the samples collected from the seepage meter bags and from direct sampling with the pushpoint sampler in the aquifer adjacent to each seepage meter showed a salinity distribution that reflected the location of the freshwater saltwater interface the seepage meter grid spanned an area where freshwater was dominant another where saltwater was dominant and the transition or interface zone between them the measured ec ranged from fresh 2 ms cm salinity 1 g l to saline 40 ms cm salinity 25 5 g l over a distance of less than 6 m the interface zone was 3 5 m wide fig 3 a the sampling locations were classified as freshwater saltwater or interface dominated based on the salinities measured and the spatial distribution the first two rows 12 sampling points were classified as freshwater 7 points as freshwater saltwater interface and 11 points located mostly in the last two rows were classified as saltwater two or three points classified as interface could also have been classified as saltwater fig 3c the flux distribution varied somewhat with salinity in general higher fluxes were measured in the freshwater and interface areas table 1 compared to the saltwater area further offshore fig 3b the highest fluxes were associated with the saltwater freshwater interface fig 3c similar distributions have been observed in other studies at different sites duque et al 2018b michael et al 2005 4 2 tracer results rn and ra activities duque et al 2019 were characterized for each zone with descriptive statistics tables 1 and 2 the mean analytical error compared with the mean value was highest for 226ra 41 and lower for the other ra isotopes 223ra 36 224ra 25 and 228ra 3 table 2 measurements were highly variable ranging from below detection limit to high values due to the different environments variations in salinity flow paths fluxes that were captured in the samples tables 1 and 2 ra activity varied strongly between categories with much lower values in fresher discharge table 2 in the interface zone groundwater fluxes activities and standard deviations of 226ra and 228ra were greatest 222rn activities were highest in fresh discharge and lowest in the saltwater zone table 1 while 222rn activities are not affected by salinity differences between freshwater zone and saltwater zone were observed differences in rn and ra activity among the salinity categories were evaluated fig 4 table s1 using a two sample student s t test were completed by testing the null hypothesis that the means each pair of categories saltwater freshwater saltwater interface interface freshwater were the same if the null hypothesis was rejected the interpretation is that the two categories had significantly different mean values the t test is a standard and widely used statistical method for 223ra 224ra and 228ra saltwater activity was significantly higher 3 4 times higher than that of freshwater the minimum values near the lower detection limit were all located in the freshwater zone for 223ra and 224ra freshwater and saltwater were significantly different sw fw 223ra p 2 6 10 3 224ra p 1 7 10 4 while the interface was not statistically distinct from the saltwater zone sw int 223ra p 4 2 10 1 224ra p 4 4 10 1 for 226ra and 228ra the distinction between saltwater and freshwater is clear sw fw 226ra p value 9 2 10 2 224ra p 1 2 10 9 the t test could not statistically differentiate between saltwater and interface zones sw int 226ra p 1 9 10 1 228ra p 3 5 10 1 probably due to the high variability of concentrations in the interface zone fig 4 222rn activity showed a gradual transition from the location where freshwater was dominant high values to the saltwater areas low values and a t test confirmed that freshwater n 12 had significantly higher 222rn than saltwater n 11 p 1 2 10 3 rn and ra activities in inland wells varied over a large range although they are located at variable distances from the shore fig 1 and at different depths they are all within 120 m of the seepage meter grid and in the same geological unit wells 1 2 and 3 are nested at different depths in the same location and the screens intersect different parts of the salinity interface detailed information about the wells and their characteristics can be found in andres et al 2015 thus differences in ra table 3 are related to the depth and salinity well 4 is closest to the location of the seepage meter grid and probably in the same flow line of groundwater discharging to the bay fig 1 hence it was selected to compare groundwater in wells with that discharging to the bay 4 3 spatial distribution ra activities generally increased from the fresh to saline portions of the sampling grid which is expected due higher mobility of ra with higher salinity elsinger and moore 1984 however within salinity zones there was strong spatial variability in ra over short distances fig 5 the lowest ra activities generally occurred in the row of seepage meters located closest to the shoreline where there was the greatest proportion of freshwater but the highest activities did not occur in the most offshore row for all the ra isotopes in the case of long lived isotopes 228ra and 226ra the maxima were located in the freshwater saltwater interface zone but activities were highly variable for the short lived isotopes 223ra and 224ra there was a more gradual transition from the freshwater sampling points where activities were near 0 to the maximum values located in the saltwater area fig 5 comparison between 228ra and 222rn with respect to electrical conductivity shows the differences between the tracers fig 6 the highest activity of 222rn was located in the freshwater zone closest to shore it was much lower near the lower detection limit in the saltwater zone 222rn activity decreased systematically with salinity unlike ra which peaked at intermediate salinity there was also spatial variability in the activities measured for each of the salinity zones defined the activity of 222rn for samples collected in the freshwater area ranged from 25 to 200 pci l and from 0 to 100 pci l for samples collected in the saltwater area 228ra activities ranged from 0 to 50 dpm 100l for freshwater samples and 50 300 dpm 100l for saltwater samples fig 6 5 discussion 5 1 spatial variability of ra and rn these results illustrate the meter scale spatial variability of natural sgd tracer activities the sampling points were located 3 m apart and the maximum distance within the study area was less than 20 m nevertheless the observed activities varied by up to a factor of 1000 even for this small area a key controlling factor was salinity or groundwater origin as the variability in activity is reduced when samples of 222rn and ra are compared only within areas dominated by freshwater or saltwater this observed heterogeneity complicates endmember definition in the application of these tracers to more extensive areas for example with the utilization of isolated samples that can introduce large errors into estimations of the average activity of ra and rn in sgd the spatial variability of ra has been observed and described previously based on cross sectional studies knee et al 2008 liu et al 2018 michael et al 2005 street et al 2008 however in this case it is possible to see that there is also high lateral variability along shore in principle the observed differences between activities of different ra isotopes are related to their half lives and the abundances of their parent isotopes in the u and th series since the chemical behavior of the isotopes is identical thus variation in water flow paths and residence times are likely to control the differential behavior of ra isotopes in groundwater e g michael et al 2011 5 2 salinity changes in groundwater and impact over radioactive tracers the freshwater saltwater interface will be present in any coastal area where there is freshwater discharge accounting for the salinity distribution when developing a sampling plan for characterizing radioisotope concentrations in endmembers will help to reduce bias and uncertainty this is illustrated by the samples that were collected from the inland wells wells 1 2 and 3 are all located the same distance from shore but at different depths the ra activities for each of the wells were distinct due to the salinity changes with depth produced by the saltwater freshwater interface location each of the wells would be more representative of freshwater or saltwater so an optimal approach would be to select the sample that is more representative of the desired endmember i e freshwater or saltwater discharge and to characterize its uncertainty the challenge in defining representative endmembers associated with salinity distributions can also be temporal the freshwater saltwater interface location is affected by transient processes such as water abstraction for irrigation and supply changes in inland recharge and climatic oscillations this complicates sampling in longer term studies since it cannot be assumed that endmember activities are constant cerdà domènech et al 2017 this would have a direct impact for example in regions with marked seasonal oscillations that could lead to an apparent higher ra activity in the dry seasons than in the wet season if the same wells were sampled without considering movement of the saltwater freshwater interface changes in the inland water table can also alter the position of the salinity discharge zones offshore which would need to be considered for the appropriate placement of seepage meters a second complication in defining endmembers is the variation in activities along flowpaths a simple comparison of the arithmetic mean of the dataset collected in the seepage meters with the measurements in well 4 located along the flow line of the discharging water at a distance of less than 100 m showed an enrichment from well 4 to discharge point of 175 278 20 and 374 of the seepage meter average for 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra respectively the cause for this may be differences in the water sources or geochemical processes along the flowpath prior to discharge since the ec in the well was similar to the discharging freshwater ec 0 6 ms cm or salinity 1 g l the same comparison can be done with only the freshwater samples in the seepage meters with these results 75 73 25 and 69 for 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra respectively seepage meter samples collected in the freshwater zone were fairly similar in terms of ec to well water well 3 had the highest ec 20 ms cm or salinity 12 making it the most comparable to saline seepage meter samples despite having similar ec to these saline seepage meter samples table 2 the well had ra activities 5 25 times higher this may reflect saline wedge interception in the well and or that the well and the groundwater discharge zone are along different flowpaths the well is located around 120 m to the west of the sampling area in general these comparisons indicate that groundwater samples from wells may not adequately represent sgd to the surface water body the distance between the well and discharge point is critical and large differences can occur over short distances for this reason direct sampling from discharging water is recommended 5 3 flow paths and ra distribution coastal groundwater flow and mixing processes occur on a range of time scales similar to the range in ra half lives which are proportional to production rate as a result ra isotope ratios can potentially be used to understand flow processes in coastal groundwater systems 226ra and 228ra have half lives of 1600 years and 5 8 years respectively therefore if they are removed by any process it will take a long time to reach a new equilibrium the half lives of 223ra and 224ra are much shorter 11 4 and 3 6 days respectively and while long lived isotopes reflect an integrated value of the processes taking place in the system the short lived isotopes are more sensitive to the immediate environment rama and moore 1996 assuming that variations in the underlying geology do not affect ra isotope production in the study area a relatively high 223ra 228ra or 224ra 228ra ratio would indicate the dominance of short residence time processes since short lived isotopes respond more quickly to changes than long lived isotopes rama and moore 1996 previous studies with analytical simulation of the generation of ra isotopes michael et al 2011 tamborski et al 2017 showed that it takes 20 30 days to fully regenerate the short lived isotopes of ra and much longer years for 226ra and 228ra therefore these results would be indicative of processes that are shorter or longer than about one month charette 2007 michael et al 2011 moore 2003 here we refer to these as fast and slow processes respectively saltwater recirculation benthic exchange is a fast process that does not allow enough time for the longer lived isotopes of ra 226ra and 228ra to build up in groundwater a longer flow path such as that along the saltwater freshwater interface driven by density gradients would allow for generation of 228ra and potentially 226ra depending on the ratio of residence time to production rate and would be considered slow considering this conceptualization 226ra and 228ra activities were highest in the interface zone between fresh and saline groundwater figs 4 and 5 two different underlying mechanisms could produce this pattern one possibility is that the freshwater saltwater interface moves back and forth seasonally during wet periods ra would accumulate by adsorption to the surfaces of sediments in the freshwater part of the aquifer then during drier periods the saltwater freshwater interface would retreat and saltwater would flow into this part of the aquifer increasing the desorption of ra and allowing it to be flushed out the accumulation and release of ra connected to the changes in water table and the oscillations of the saltwater freshwater interface has been described as an explanation for the changes in ra activity along vertical profiles dulaiova et al 2008 the reasons for changes in the saltwater freshwater interface position are connected to inland recharge which oscillates seasonally in this temperate zone due primarily to evapotranspiration and precipitation changes e g michael et al 2005 a second potential reason for high long lived isotope activities along the interface is that discharge in this zone is a result of longer groundwater flow paths with greater residence time density driven flow induces groundwater to follow a circulation path downward and then upwards along the freshwater saltwater interface kohout 1964 this hydrogeological process causes groundwater to circulate for a longer time in contact with the sediments increasing the content of 228ra and potentially 226ra the spatial distribution of ra isotope ratios support this interpretation the ratios of short lived to long lived isotopes 223ra 228ra and 224ra 228ra are greatest in the areas where saltwater is dominant and lower in interface areas fig 7 this reflects the difference in residence time between discharge driven only by benthic exchange short residence time as expected in the saltwater only zone and discharge driven by density gradients longer residence time a short groundwater residence time results in a higher short lived to long lived isotope ratio than a long residence time the 228ra 226ra ratios have a more homogeneous distribution in the saltwater areas fig 7 since both isotopes are indicators of regional processes in the system and they are not as useful for resolving processes occurring on shorter time scales 5 4 222rn salinity has a minor effect in the solubility of 222rn schubert et al 2012 usually it is assumed that 222rn is transported by groundwater once it is generated by decay of 226ra as a consequence of its high solubility in water relative to its production rate stellato et al 2013 since it would be equally enriched in fresh or saline groundwater mulligan and charette 2006 sadat noori et al 2015 it is considered a tracer of total groundwater discharge however in the sampling completed for this work there are differences in rn activity among the three discharge zones based on ec these may be explained by differences in the residence time of groundwater similar to ra isotopes 222rn accumulates over time according to its half life requiring approximately three weeks to approach equilibrium with 226ra in this case 222rn is highest in fresh discharge intermediate in the interface and lowest in the saline discharge zone fresh discharge should have long months to decades residence times discharge in the interface should be a mix of density driven brackish groundwater with a long weeks to decades residence time and short flowpath saline benthic exchange that reflects a shorter term process hours to days in addition ra adsorption to sediments is greater under freshwater conditions than under saltwater conditions and this likely leads to higher 222rn production in freshwater aquifers than in more saline aquifers where the ra tends to be desorbed and flushed out 5 5 implications for endmembers based on this conceptualization the use of 222rn as a total sgd tracer and ra as primarily a saline sgd tracer can present issues for the definition of the endmember since both ra and rn accumulate in groundwater over time and therefore vary in groundwater with different flowpaths concentrations in discharging groundwater cannot be adequately represented by a single endmember value even if a range corresponding to uncertainty is included rather the discharging groundwater represents a continuum of endmembers and the best way to capture its characteristics may be a discharge rate weighted average for example using our rn and seepage meter data the arithmetic mean of water fluxes and 222rn activity was calculated for the first nearest shore and last row most distant from shore the 222rn activity decreased from 94 5 to 23 2 pci l when moving offshore almost a factor of 4 while the flow was reduced only to half from 38 4 cm d to 17 8 cm d thus the application of 222rn activity for the quantification of fluxes in the bay would lead to an underestimation of sgd rate there could also be differences in endmember activities of different types of groundwater if there are heterogeneities in the abundances of parent isotopes and other aquifer characteristics that control inputs of ra isotopes and rn to the water for the correct definition of endmembers if one component is not dominant in terms of tracer contribution it is necessary to know a priori the proportion of groundwater discharge contributed by each component of discharge the results presented in this study show that ra isotope ratios can reflect the dominant flow mechanisms aiding in sample classification and quantification of fluxes alternatively they can be a tool for the definition of the hydrogeological conditions for example ra activity ratios can aid in the study of nutrient discharge to coastal areas and contaminant processes because the origin and circulation path of groundwater would be indicators of potential biochemical processes in each zone 5 6 field sampling implications the mixing of different water types in coastal areas and the necessity of a sufficient volume of sample for measuring ra can hinder the detection of the patterns presented to locate the different type of hydrogeological processes affecting to ra and rn as our data set demonstrates the saltwater freshwater interface is a diffuse boundary that can be highly irregular due to heterogeneity in aquifer hydraulic properties this interface can be difficult to detect by direct measurements unless an extensive 2d monitoring network is used as in this experiment a strategy for the optimization of sampling would be the use of small and surficial geophysical surveys to determine the predominance of different types of water i e kinnear et al 2013 the measurement of salinity is highly recommended not only for sampling but also for the construction of conceptual models of freshwater saltwater discharge duque et al 2018b michael et al 2005 to help in the interpretation of the data collected and assess the relevance or the impact assigned to each sample the use of cluster sampling with several samples in small areas instead of a unique sample can help to provide an estimate of variability and uncertainty due to the natural spatial variability of the systems without excessively increasing the analytical and field work in the case of sampling including seasonal variation the changes in the hydrogeological conditions i e water table can lead to modifications of the saltwater freshwater interface affecting both endmembers in wells and measurements in discharge areas the different flow paths and hydrogeological processes taking place in coastal areas play an important role in the activities of radioactive tracers characterizing them requires additional field measurements but this effort would be worthwhile because it would substantially reduce misinterpretations and erroneous estimates of sgd so far this is the first study to directly measure the spatial distribution of radioactive tracers in discharging groundwater and compare it to that in nearby wells we think that this type of work should be more frequent in the application of these tracers instead of an anomaly 6 conclusions ra activity in coastal groundwater is highly variable due to the salinity differences within the saltwater freshwater interface even over short distances such as those presented in this study and under apparent homogeneous hydrogeological conditions and sedimentary composition considerable spatial variability occurs ra activity is affected by the hydrogeological processes taking place in coastal areas the freshwater zone is defined by the lower salinity and lower ra activity the interface zone presents higher activities in 226ra and 228ra due to the longer flow path as a consequence of density driven flow and higher activities of 223ra and 224ra are measured in the zones dominated by recirculation of saline water applying 222rn as a total sgd tracer can be problematic when short term circulation patterns dominate the hydrological conditions because this type of circulation was associated with lower rn activity in groundwater the results presented in this work showed a higher 222rn activity in the areas dominated by freshwater due to the longer groundwater residence time in the aquifer and greater concentration of adsorbed ra on aquifer surfaces the use of seepage meters for sampling submarine groundwater discharge has several advantages used in clusters measurement can be a useful alternative for the definition of spatially variable endmembers and can enable better assessment of uncertainty our results indicate that a grid of seepage meters provides a more accurate characterization of the discharging groundwater endmember compared with wells the use of inland wells as groundwater endmembers can introduce potentially large errors since various processes that affect natural tracer concentrations can take place along the flow path between the well location and the coastal discharge area the main challenge in using seepage meters is the restrictions associated with installation and the amount of manual labor required while radium and radon isotopes are useful tools as demonstrated in multiple sgd studies they must be used carefully the very large impacts of the origin and flowpaths of discharging groundwater on tracer concentrations should be a major consideration in their application because it can reduce their reliability or even render them useless as indicators of hydrologic processes moving forward the community must recognize these dependencies and make every effort to apply radiochemical tracers in the most accurate way possible even if that means making more measurements conducting uncertainty analyses and collaborating across disciplines taking into consideration the hydrogeological conditions saltwater freshwater interface seasonal changes residence times the design of sampling surveys considering the discharge conceptual models and the natural spatial variability will lead to more accurate results in the estimation of

6078,fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom has a significant influence on global inland water carbon cycling and biogeochemical processes the alpine lakes on tibet qinghai plateau tqp are exposed to high intensity ultraviolet radiation long retention time with less anthropogenic influences yet limited studies were conducted on fdom of lakes on the highest plateau in the world with unique aquatic environments spatiotemporal variations of fdom components from 63 lakes 32 fresh lakes n 135 31 brackish lakes n 109 were grouped according to salinity across the tqp collected during 2014 2017 fdom were examined using excitation emission matrix spectra eem and fluorescence regional integration fri cdom absorption and fdom fluorescence indices average fluorescence intensities of the five fluorescent components φi i i ii iii iv v and total fluorescence intensities φt are significantly different between brackish and freshwater lakes p 0 05 high correlations 0 51 r 0 86 p 0 01 were revealed between fdom and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations with salinity 10 a comparatively prolonged retention time and terrestrial allochthonous inputs caused higher doc accumulation in brackish water strong uv radiation resulted in an important effect on cdom photo absorption characteristics and that contributed to doc variability and fate likewise average cdom spectroscopic indices in each basin with different land covers showed a moderate correlation between doc and normalized humic like φv for 20 basins r 0 46 p 0 01 the results suggest that studies on the highest alpine lakes across the tqp should focus on the impact of the evapo concentration ultraviolet irradiance and landscape features within different basins on fdom characteristics it demonstrated that the fdom was dominated by the allochthonous sources in brackish lakes from the tqp and had a similarity to those observed in marine environments keywords cdom tibet qinghai plateau fluorescence brackish lakes fri 1 introduction inland lakes have a direct link between the terrestrial and atmospheric co2 pools and they have an indirect link between the oceans via rivers inland lakes play a vital role in transportation transformation and storage of carbon from terrestrially imported substances cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 carbon flux and biogeochemical processes of lakes have a significant influence on the global carbon cycle and they affect regional climate battin et al 2009 jiao et al 2010 ran et al 2013 carlson et al 2011 it is therefore important to investigate biogeochemical cycling of carbon in lakes in different regions that have distinct properties cole et al 2007 song et al 2018a b 2019 the tibet qinghai plateau tqp commonly known as the third pole and the asian water tower has an average elevation over 4500 m song et al 2016 due to the dry and thin aerosol with a low concentration of ozone in this area there are strong ultraviolet b uv b radiation penetration inhibiting properties ren et al 1997 prolonged sunshine and arid environment make some terminal lakes on the tqp have a high salt content the high salinity lakes often paralleled with accumulation of doc and dissolved organic matter zhao et al 2016 song et al 2018a b the tqp is therefore of particular interest for environmental evolution and the carbon cycling this attributed to accumulated doc and dom contents in arid environment are also strongly affected by intensified uv b radiation penetration particularly these environmental influences could change photochemical degradation rate for doc dom spencer et al 2012 yao et al 2011 song et al 2017a to date cdom optical characteristics and their effect on carbon budget contribution have been reported in plateaus and high mountain lakes wen et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 however little is currently known about cdom in waters located in the tqp in addition land cover types within the lake catchment affect soil runoff and leaching having a non negligible effect on doc dom inputs and dissolved solids wen et al 2016 these effects may result in obvious differences in physiochemical properties between the lakes heinz et al 2015 song et al 2013 in particular there are less anthropogenic activities due to high elevation of the tqp more grass and un used land were distributed in this region consequently these special environmental characteristics make the doc dom different from other regions contributing to the relatively high average carbon budget of inland waters hanson et al 2014 song et al 2017a 2018a chromophoric dom cdom typically 0 22 μm is a light absorbing substance in aquatic environments cdom originates from the decomposition of algae by microorganisms autochthonous and surrounding allochthonous environment singh et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 chemical properties cause cdom to absorb light and re emit it as fluorescent dom fdom stedmon et al 2003 zhang et al 2010 due to the high selectivity and sensitivity of fdom fluorescence spectroscopy have provided detailed insights into its composition and components stedmon et al 2003 zhang et al 2010 three dimensional excitation emission matrices eems are widely used to quantify fdom the intensity of fdom from single sample is given as a function of excitation and emission wavelengths hudson et al 2007 then the intensity of fdom show a relative fluorescent concentration ishii and boyer 2012 zhao et al 2016 then we can follow and retrieve the evolved fingerprint of fdom based on the types and locations of eems peaks stedmon et al 2003 to date eems is a simple and effective technique which is commonly used to evaluate fdom by visual inspection zhang et al 2011a b zhao et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 multivariate statistical parameters and tools i e spectroscopic characterization specific ultraviolet absorbance and spectral slope ratio humification index hix fluorescence index fi parallel factor analysis parafac and fluorescence regional integration fri have been utilized to identify bio geochemically meaningful components of cdom of different sources coble 1996 chen et al 2003 helms et al 2008 stedmon et al 2003 zhang et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 particularly eem parafac and eem fri techniques were widely used in determination of the fdom components they can transfer complex eems into independent fluorescent components which have been widely used in the fdom studies of inland waters zhang et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 eem fri a quantitative technique can integrate the volumes beneath defined by regions of eem largely based on supporting literature chen et al 2003 this is a function of the wavelength ranges associated with different fluorescence peaks in each eem then eem fri covers continuous fluorescence intensity at excitation emission wavelength of divided regions for further analysis chen et al 2003 compared to other fluorescence tools eem parafac eem fri could calculate the volumetric signal i e φt n the eem fri technique is more robust because it encompasses the entire eem region comprising emission scans and not just a single emission scan chen et al 2003 zhao et al 2017 this investigation examined sources and fate of cdom in brackish 31 lakes and fresh lakes 32 lakes across the tqp using eem fri the specific objectives are to 1 characterize the differences in fdom among the brackish and fresh lakes using eem fri technology 2 evaluate the dynamics of each fdom components under spatial variations 3 link the five fdom components by fri with cdom parameters and water quality and 4 assess the effects on fdom caused by salinity solar radiation and land cover 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of lakes on the tqp as the highest and extensive plateau in the world the tqp in china covers an area about 2 5 million km2 total lake areas on the tqp account for about 49 in china zhang et al 2011a b which store about 68 of lakes waters in china song et al 2018b generally lakes of the tqp are mainly formed by erosion and melting of glaciers tectonic activity or barriers present on the land surface the tqp has unique environmental characteristics e g high elevation low atmospheric density low solid impurity content and water vapor less cloud and low ozone concentration these attribute to a higher dose of solar radiation fig s1 further the tqp also has more prolonged sunshine duration and sunny days in summer than other regions in china fig s1 li et al 2011 reported that tqp has an average annual solar radiation intensity about 6000 8000 mj m2 the highest region in china and second worldwide after the sahara desert annual precipitation in this region ranges from 100 to 1300 mm the majority of precipitation occurs during the summer period june to september owing to high altitude and thin air this region has less atmospheric counter radiation thus the average temperature is lower than other regions in china even in summer season fig s1 2 2 field samplings most of lakes in the tqp are in the depopulated zone in north tibet and it is a natural reserve for wild animals due to the geographical conditions and government management it is difficult to reach these remote lakes thereby we selected representative lakes based on their sizes a priori knowledge wang and hongsheng 1998 accessibility and salinity gradient a total of 244 water samples were collected in ice free seasons june to september from 63 lakes across the tqp from 2014 to 2017 some lakes were revisited for multiple times and some were just once due to the remote distances and less accessibility table s1 lakes were divided into two groups e g 32 fresh lakes n 135 and 31 brackish lakes n 109 according to salinity electrical conductivity table s1 sample locations for each lake were recorded using a gps receiver fig 1 more details about the name size surface area elevation latitude longitude land cover type and retention time of each lake can be found in table s1 water samples were collected from lake surfaces 0 50 cm with two 1 l acid cleaned plastic bottles the filtering process was conducted in the field and these filtered samples were filled into brown plastic bottles every day the bulk samples and filtered samples were transported back to the laboratory with portable ice cooler with ice packs these filtered samples were stored at 4 c until analysis within 2 days in the laboratory 2 3 water quality measurements water turbidity was determined using the shimadzu uv 2600 pc spectrophotometer with a matching 3 cm quartz cells at room temperature 20 c 2 and milli q water as the reference uv talk letter 2013 zhao et al 2016 electrical conductivity ec was measured using a portable multi parameter water quality analyzer ysi exo1 us samples were first filtered through a pre combusted whatman gf f filter pore size 0 7 μm under a low vacuum in the field then the doc concentrations were determined by high temperature catalytic oxidation 680 c using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan in the laboratory potassium hydrogen phthalate was used in doc analysis as a reference chlorophyll a chl a analysis was undertaken by initially filtering the water samples through whatman cellulose acetone filters 0 45 µm the filters were extracted with 90 acetone and measured at 664 647 630 and 750 nm wavelengths using a shimadzu uv 2006 pc spectrophotometer total suspended matter tsm was determined by gravimetrical analysis song et al 2013 total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured following methods highlighted in standard methods apha 1998 2 4 cdom absorption measurements and parameters the collected water samples were first filtered through a pre combusted whatman gf f filter 0 7 μm then they were further filtered through a pre rinsed 25 mm millipore membrane cellulose filter 0 22 μm into brown plastic bottles zhao et al 2016 in the laboratory the absorption spectra of filtered samples were measured between 200 and 800 nm at 1 nm increments using a shimadzu uv 2006 pc spectrophotometer with a 1 cm or 5 cm quartz cuvette and milli q water as a reference the absorption coefficient a λ was calculated from cdom absorption od λ 1 a λ 2 303od λ γ where od λ is the corrected optical density at wavelength λ γ is the cuvette path length 0 01 or 0 05 m and the factor of 2 303 converts the results from a base 10 to a base natural logarithm zhang et al 2011a b 2 5 excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem spectra of cdom were measured at room temperature 20 2 c using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer with a 700 v xenon lamp scanning band pass widths of excitation and emission spectra were obtained using wavelengths of 220 450 nm with intervals of 5 nm and 250 600 nm 1 nm intervals respectively with a scanning speed of 2400 nm min 1 a milli q water blank was analyzed the result of which was subtracted from the resulting eem of the water sample spectrum to eliminate raman scatter peaks in order to eliminate the inner filter effect the eems were normalized by subtracting the integral area under the curve of the milli q water raman peak zhang et al 2010 zhou et al 2016 these eem spectra were then calibrated in quinine sulfate units qsu lawaetz and stedmon 2009 2 6 cdom absorption parameters and fluorescence indices according to table s2 uv absorption

at 250 nm and 365 nm which is denoted as m e250 e365 it provides further insights into the average characteristics chemistry source and diagenesis of cdom than absorption values alone de haan and de boer 1987 in addition to the above parameters cdom absorption spectral slopes s at 275 295 nm was used to describe the ratio of fulvic acids to humic acids gonnelli et al 2013 helms et al 2008 the humification index hix was calculated from fluorescence eems as indices for the humification degree and dom sources zhang et al 2010 then the fluorescence indices fi 370 and fi 310 introduced by mcknight et al 2001 were used to characterize cdom source more details of absorption and fluorescence parameters could be found in table s2 2 7 eem fluorescence regional integration eem fluorescence regional integration eem fri divides eem boundaries into five regions associated with humic like tyrosine like tryptophan like or phenol like organic compounds chen et al 2003 more details about the peak locations and descriptions could be found in table s3 the integrated area beneath the eem spectra can be calculated using 2 φ i ex em i λ ex λ em δ λ ex δ λ em where δλex is ex interval 5 nm δλem

shown in fig 4 a d according to chen et al 2003 emm fri divides the eem signal into five regions i ii iii iv and v fig 4a and table s3 the excitation emission area volumes φi i i ii ii iv v and their proportion to total fluorescence intensity p i i i ii iii iv v were also shown in fig 4 e and f a significant difference p 0 05 of total fluorescence intensity φt was observed between the brackish and fresh lakes in this study φt ranged from 1 94 108 nm to 3 5 1010 nm for brackish lakes with an average of 1 44 1010 nm 8 1 109 sd as for fresh lakes φt ranged from 3 54 108 nm to 3 5 1010 nm with an average of 1 38 1010 nm 7 9 109 sd for all the samples the area volume of φi in the five integrated regions identified by eem fri were φv humic like φiii fulvic like φiv microbial protein like φi tyrosine like φii tryptophan like furthermore a significant difference for the fluorescence intensities of φv and φiii was found in brackish lakes and fresh lakes p 0 05 the p v 62 4 14 6 in brackish

five normalized eem fri fluorescent components exhibited positive factor 1 loadings fig 6a factor analysis showed pca factor 1 and factor 2 was associated with five cumulative volumes φ i i i ii iii

fulvic like φ v humic like and φ iv microbial protein like showed a positive factor 1 loading and concurrently showed negative factor 2 loading this correlation result indicated that pca could separate normalized cumulative volume φi by eem fri into two groups group 1 φ iii fulvic like φ v humic like φ iv microbial protein like and group 2 φ i tyrosine like φ ii tryptophan like this finding was contrary to the results from zhao et al 2017 yao et al 2011 and yamashita et al 2010 from other water bodies 3 6 correlation analysis of cdom spectroscopic indices strong correlations between

wen et al 2016 for brackish lakes in other arid and semi arid regions these results can be explained by evapo concentration and accumulation processes of doc and cdom from terminal lakes in arid regions curtis and adams 1995 song et al 2013 2017a spencer et al 2014 addressed that doc was also around 525 675 ybp ybp years before present in tibetan alpine lakes they attributed this to either inputs of pre aged organics from glacier runoff direct deposition or to the aging of organics in situ i e a radiocarbon reservoir effect high salinity has a direct or indirect impact on water quality

inner mongolia plateau only regression analysis r 2 0 72 p 0 01 wen et al 2016 have been previously noted generally organic carbon with different sources allochthonous or autochthonous and composition may result in different relationships existing between doc and salinity ec curtis and adams 1995 spencer et al 2012 in our study area it indicated that regional hydrogeological and climatic conditions play an important role in driving doc variability song et al 2017a further salinity was divided into four groups 10 6 2 1 in brackish lakes table 3 the normalized cumulative volume φ i φ i φ ii φ iv and φ v of water samples with a salinity 10 average ec 23764 μs cm 1 by eem fri showed moderate correlations with doc concentrations r ranged from 0 51 to 0 86 r2 ranged from 0 59 to 0 75 both r and r2 values showed a consistent decreasing tendency with salinity or ec table 3 dom could accumulate via soil leaching and runoff passing through various landscapes in terminal brackish lakes song et al 2013 these allochthonous dom could be available for the microorganisms or be sink to the bottom or be transformed into inorganic carbon including co2 cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 more allochthonous inputs make small humic like molecules saturated in terminal brackish lakes and form colloidal particles chin et al 1998 they could continue to form macromolecular structures globular aggregates and ring like in high ionic strength environments myneni et al 1999 in our highest salinity group increasing salinity ec could increase doc cdom solubility by contrast it can be seen that the inflow rivers of a specific lake generally showed lower doc concentrations than that inside the lakes fig s3 in addition the high salinity could also limit microbial activity due to a decrease of osmotic potential mavi et al 2012 pagano et al 2014 verified that the high ec and alkalinity in brackish lakes was disadvantageous for microorganism production of autochthonous cdom components arts et al 2000 reported that increasing salinity could limit the microbial activity by reducing cell permeability therefore doc cdom accumulates in brackish terminal waters at significantly higher rates than those in fresh open waters duarte and prairie 2005 in addition p i of eem fri in brackish and fresh lakes also showed significant differences p 0 001 normalized humic like φ v and fulvic like φ iii were terrestrial sources accounting for p iii v 77 7 10 1 sd in brackish lakes and 77 7 7 3 sd in fresh lakes protein like fluorescence including tyrosine like and tryptophan like φ i ii recorded a greater proportion in brackish water p i ii 6 47 2 6 sd than in fresh lakes p i ii 22 3 4 0 sd fig 5c and d likewise we found a higher humic like averaged percentage p v 60 2 by normalized eem fri in brackish lakes compared with freshwater lakes 51 8 fig 5 this result implied that a greater formation of macromolecular structures from humic like substances in brackish lakes prevail 4 2 solar radiation and elevation versus doc and cdom the tqp possesses a markedly high altitude and a thin atmosphere compared to other studies ren et al 1997 fig 1c and fig s1 these environmental factors may have an important influence on the photochemical oxidation processes of cdom and the mineralization of doc duarte and prairie 2005 tobias and böhlke 2011 among the 63 lakes n 244 the brackish lakes for average m e250 e365 s 275 295 and suva254 were distinctly different from fresh lake results n 135 fig 2 suva254 values for brackish lakes recorded lower values than those recorded in terminal water from the inner mongolia plateau suva254 1 90 0 57 mg c 1 m 1 or in brackish lakes of northeast china 2 8 5 7 mg c 1 m 1 zhao et al 2016 wen et al 2016 this indicated that brackish lakes on the tqp were predominated with lower aromatic moieties of cdom and average molecular weight of doc compared within fresh lakes the average m e250 e365 s 275 295 and suva254 in the brackish lakes n 109 showed similar results of boehme et al 2004 in the gulf of mexico in addition our results also highlight significant differences in total fluorescence intensities φt and φ t between brackish lakes and fresh lakes p 0 001 figs 4 and 5 respectively we found that the average normalized total fluorescence intensities φ t between brackish and fresh lakes showed opposite vitiation tendency this finding may account for relatively higher colorless doc present in the brackish lakes compared with the fresh lakes which is a function of solar radiation and prolonged hydraulic retention time table s1 and fig s1 song et al 2017b reported the regression model slopes for doc vs a cdom 275 ranged from extremely low 0 33 highly saline lakes to 1 03 urban waters and 3 01 river waters their results demonstrated that strong photo degradation due to less cloud cover longer water residence time and sunshine hours on the tqp in order to evaluate the influence of solar irradiance to cdom optical characteristics fig 10 solar irradiance was divided into three groups 2900 h 2800 h 2600 h strong solar radiance and time could accelerate chromophores associated with high molecular weight being reduced mcknight et al 2001 hu et al 2017 by chemical bond rupture high molecular weight substances were transferred to low molecular weight pools this photolysis process could be accelerated by a prolonged hydraulic retention time and intensive solar radiation hu et al 2017 mcknight et al 2001 song et al 2017b however for water samples with a solar radiance 2900 h averaged solar irradiance hours doc recorded a moderate positive correlation with a 254 concentrations r 0 87 r2 0 76 t test p 0 01 and a correlation with fi 370 r 0 69 r2 0 48 t test p 0 01 this indicated that on the tqp with intensive uv b radiation solar irradiance 2900 h parts of the cdom mainly from allochthonous inputs have similar sources with doc the pca result of φ i exhibited that φ iv microbial protein like was consistent with φ v humic like and φ iii fuvic like fig 6 this suggests that they have common sources likewise a positive correlation n 109 between the total normalized cumulative volume φ iii iv v and φ i ii r 0 87 r2 0 76 t test p 0 01 were found in brackish lakes these results also demonstrated that microbial protein like fdom in brackish lakes associated with products from terrestrial microbial decomposition fig 7 zhang et al 2013 also identified correlations between total bacterial community structure and altitude on the tqp for the lakes on the tqp sources and compositions of cdom exhibited a similar to those in marine environment intensive solar radiance has the potential to enhance photochemical degradation of allochthonous cdom on the tqp this process resulted in absorption parameters with the production of low molecular weight cdom these findings are contrary to those recorded from rivers in intermontane plateaus in the usa spencer et al 2012 lakes in the songnen plain china song et al 2013 hulun lake china wen et al 2016 and basin rivers in china zhao et al 2016 in arid and semi arid regions brackish lakes commonly support highly active biological communities they can actively break down refractory organic matter into doc and accumulate in waters wen et al 2016 however due to strong uv b radiation on the tqp long sunlight duration may result in photobleaching of cdom which will limit microbial activities and increase mineralization of doc granéli et al 1996 duarte and prairie 2005 differences in results from our study and previous investigations may be due to the majority of the microbial protein like fdom being derived from terrestrial microbial decomposition water samples from brackish lakes were generally distributed in the range of 1 to 1 for both pca factor scores this finding confirms that the contributions of allochthonous substances including microbial protein like were obvious in brackish lakes in addition pca results could be attributed to both source differences and photo degradation process the characteristics of cdom and doc in brackish lakes on the tqp is similar to that in marine environments zhang et al 2013 reported that the majority of lakes on the tqp were affiliated with sar11 iii clade similar to observations from chesapeake bay bacterial plankton it suggests that solar radiation has an important effect on cdom photo absorption characteristics and it also contributes to doc variability and fate 4 3 the effect of land cover on doc and cdom fig 9 indicated that tqp land covers are associated with cdom and doc but it is not as important as the effects of salinity and solar radiation do the tqp is located in an arid climatic zone with low rainfall and the inflow of lakes mainly depends on surface runoff generally grasslands and forests are characterized by high nitrogen and organic matter export rates heinz et al 2015 high doc concentrations in the lake waters highlight the organic rich nature of these ecosystems these results can be explained by doc flux related to physical chemical properties hydrology and land cover within a specific drainage watershed for each lake heinz et al 2015 li et al 2018 table s4 listed the temporal variations and anova of averaged cdom and doc characteristics from lakes with twice sampling period in tqp in most of the case no significant difference was observed in different sampling years except lake xingxinghai which is a shallow lake and strongly disturbed by herding cattle and sheep thus cdom and doc may show fluctuations due to variation of slope runoff as a result of climatic and geographical conditions these environment factors may change the optical characteristic of cdom and water quality on the tqp however it should be highlighted that hydrology retention time and strong solar radiation are the key factors for lake cdom and doc variations on the tqp 4 4 limitation and future implications the tqp is a unique geographic environmental with less anthropogenic activities high elevation and strong ultraviolet radiation in their dry environments terminal brackish lakes generally exhibit high salinity due to the evapocondensed effect this signified that there were a accumulation in doc concentrations and less unit cdom these detailed doc and cdom characteristics data in this study is helpful to improve and understand our knowledge of lakes carbon characteristics on the tqp however timko et al 2015 found that ph effects on fdom also attibuted to the measurements and irradiation experiments of dom as well as dissolved iron concentrations and other water quality parameters investigations have shown that ph could change the charge of molecules by protonation deprotonation for inland waters sutton and sposito 2005 timko et al 2015 given the variations of ph in fresh or brackish lakes further systematic examination of ph and fdom is needed in future studies paralleled with investigations by others the cdom doc characteristics linked with various and dynamic changes of environmrntal factors e g eutrophication status sediments and underground waters song et al 2018a b zhang et al 2010 zhou et al 2016 only the spatial variations of cdom doc were analyzed with respect to arid environments on the tqp in this work although there were only temporal differences between fdom parameters in lakes table s4 p 0 05 terrestrial inputs by hyrological processes in temporal scales is also important for carbon flux which is worth to investigate in the further study as demonstrated by this study cdom and doc in brackish lakes in the study area is similar to that in marine environments thus it should be noted that the dynamic carbon role of saline lakes is worthy of future consideration in a view of termporal and spatial it is also a challage that an interface between converging environmental factors with comprehensive data sets particularly for those waters located in remote areas and harsh environments with less accessibility song et al 2018a 5 conclusions high elevation strong ultraviolet radiation long sunshine hours arid climate and terminal waters with low anthropogenic impact make the unique environmental conditions for cdom and doc studies on the tqp currently little is known about doc cdom fluorescence and its relationship with aquatic biogeochemical characteristics in lakes across the tqp in order to fill this study gap 244 samples collected from brackish and fresh water lakes across the tqp to examine doc cdom spatial variation and its link with environmental factors eem fri was applied to characterize cdom spatial variations between brackish lakes salinity 1 and fresh lakes salinity 1 significant differences of cdom spectroscopic indices normalized φ t and doc concentrations were found between fresh and brackish waters p 0 05 and lower average molecular weight of dom in brackish lakes are prevailing this investigation revealed that significant correlations were observed between the average doc and cdom fluorescence with salinity 10 however the correlation coefficients exhibited a decreasing tendency with salinity lower than 10 further significant correlations between the average doc and a 254 with annual total sunshine hours 2900 h were also observed and also a strong association between dco and fi 370 while the r and r2 values of regression analysis had a decreasing tendency with sunshine hours 2900 h finally moderate relationship between normalized φ v and doc concentration was observed r 0 46 r2 0 54 t test p 0 01 for different land cover types mainly grass in 20 basins across the tqp our findings also highlight that salinity solar hours and land cover primarily contribute to cdom and doc properties in lakes on the tqp these special characteristic of cdom and doc from brackish lakes in the study area is similar to that tracked in marine environments declaration of competing

6078,fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom has a significant influence on global inland water carbon cycling and biogeochemical processes the alpine lakes on tibet qinghai plateau tqp are exposed to high intensity ultraviolet radiation long retention time with less anthropogenic influences yet limited studies were conducted on fdom of lakes on the highest plateau in the world with unique aquatic environments spatiotemporal variations of fdom components from 63 lakes 32 fresh lakes n 135 31 brackish lakes n 109 were grouped according to salinity across the tqp collected during 2014 2017 fdom were examined using excitation emission matrix spectra eem and fluorescence regional integration fri cdom absorption and fdom fluorescence indices average fluorescence intensities of the five fluorescent components φi i i ii iii iv v and total fluorescence intensities φt are significantly different between brackish and freshwater lakes p 0 05 high correlations 0 51 r 0 86 p 0 01 were revealed between fdom and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations with salinity 10 a comparatively prolonged retention time and terrestrial allochthonous inputs caused higher doc accumulation in brackish water strong uv radiation resulted in an important effect on cdom photo absorption characteristics and that contributed to doc variability and fate likewise average cdom spectroscopic indices in each basin with different land covers showed a moderate correlation between doc and normalized humic like φv for 20 basins r 0 46 p 0 01 the results suggest that studies on the highest alpine lakes across the tqp should focus on the impact of the evapo concentration ultraviolet irradiance and landscape features within different basins on fdom characteristics it demonstrated that the fdom was dominated by the allochthonous sources in brackish lakes from the tqp and had a similarity to those observed in marine environments keywords cdom tibet qinghai plateau fluorescence brackish lakes fri 1 introduction inland lakes have a direct link between the terrestrial and atmospheric co2 pools and they have an indirect link between the oceans via rivers inland lakes play a vital role in transportation transformation and storage of carbon from terrestrially imported substances cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 carbon flux and biogeochemical processes of lakes have a significant influence on the global carbon cycle and they affect regional climate battin et al 2009 jiao et al 2010 ran et al 2013 carlson et al 2011 it is therefore important to investigate biogeochemical cycling of carbon in lakes in different regions that have distinct properties cole et al 2007 song et al 2018a b 2019 the tibet qinghai plateau tqp commonly known as the third pole and the asian water tower has an average elevation over 4500 m song et al 2016 due to the dry and thin aerosol with a low concentration of ozone in this area there are strong ultraviolet b uv b radiation penetration inhibiting properties ren et al 1997 prolonged sunshine and arid environment make some terminal lakes on the tqp have a high salt content the high salinity lakes often paralleled with accumulation of doc and dissolved organic matter zhao et al 2016 song et al 2018a b the tqp is therefore of particular interest for environmental evolution and the carbon cycling this attributed to accumulated doc and dom contents in arid environment are also strongly affected by intensified uv b radiation penetration particularly these environmental influences could change photochemical degradation rate for doc dom spencer et al 2012 yao et al 2011 song et al 2017a to date cdom optical characteristics and their effect on carbon budget contribution have been reported in plateaus and high mountain lakes wen et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 however little is currently known about cdom in waters located in the tqp in addition land cover types within the lake catchment affect soil runoff and leaching having a non negligible effect on doc dom inputs and dissolved solids wen et al 2016 these effects may result in obvious differences in physiochemical properties between the lakes heinz et al 2015 song et al 2013 in particular there are less anthropogenic activities due to high elevation of the tqp more grass and un used land were distributed in this region consequently these special environmental characteristics make the doc dom different from other regions contributing to the relatively high average carbon budget of inland waters hanson et al 2014 song et al 2017a 2018a chromophoric dom cdom typically 0 22 μm is a light absorbing substance in aquatic environments cdom originates from the decomposition of algae by microorganisms autochthonous and surrounding allochthonous environment singh et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 chemical properties cause cdom to absorb light and re emit it as fluorescent dom fdom stedmon et al 2003 zhang et al 2010 due to the high selectivity and sensitivity of fdom fluorescence spectroscopy have provided detailed insights into its composition and components stedmon et al 2003 zhang et al 2010 three dimensional excitation emission matrices eems are widely used to quantify fdom the intensity of fdom from single sample is given as a function of excitation and emission wavelengths hudson et al 2007 then the intensity of fdom show a relative fluorescent concentration ishii and boyer 2012 zhao et al 2016 then we can follow and retrieve the evolved fingerprint of fdom based on the types and locations of eems peaks stedmon et al 2003 to date eems is a simple and effective technique which is commonly used to evaluate fdom by visual inspection zhang et al 2011a b zhao et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 multivariate statistical parameters and tools i e

et al 2017 particularly eem parafac and eem fri techniques were widely used in determination of the fdom components they can transfer complex eems into independent fluorescent components which have been widely used in the fdom studies of inland waters zhang et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 eem fri a quantitative technique can integrate the volumes beneath defined by regions of eem largely based on supporting literature chen et al 2003 this is a function of the wavelength ranges associated with different fluorescence peaks in each eem then eem fri covers continuous fluorescence intensity at excitation emission wavelength of divided regions for further analysis chen et al 2003 compared to other fluorescence tools eem parafac eem fri could calculate the volumetric signal i e φt n the eem fri technique is more robust because it encompasses the entire eem region comprising emission scans and not just a single emission scan chen et al 2003 zhao et al 2017 this investigation examined sources and fate of cdom in brackish 31 lakes and fresh lakes 32 lakes across the tqp using eem fri the specific objectives are to 1 characterize the differences in fdom among the brackish and fresh lakes using eem fri technology 2 evaluate the dynamics of each fdom components under spatial variations 3 link the five fdom components by fri with cdom parameters and water quality and 4 assess the effects on fdom caused by salinity solar radiation and land cover 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of lakes on the tqp as the highest and extensive plateau in the world the tqp in china covers an area about 2 5 million km2 total lake areas on the tqp account for about 49 in china zhang et al 2011a b which store about 68 of lakes waters in china song et al 2018b generally lakes of the tqp are mainly formed by erosion and melting of glaciers tectonic activity or barriers present on the land surface the tqp has unique environmental characteristics e g high elevation low atmospheric density low solid impurity content and water vapor less cloud and low ozone concentration these attribute to a higher dose of solar radiation fig s1 further the tqp also has more prolonged sunshine duration and sunny days in summer than other regions in china fig s1 li et al 2011 reported that tqp has an average annual solar radiation intensity about 6000 8000 mj m2 the highest region in china and second worldwide after the sahara desert annual precipitation in this region ranges from 100 to 1300 mm the majority of precipitation occurs during the summer period june to september owing to high altitude and thin air this region has less atmospheric counter radiation thus the average temperature is lower than other regions in china even in summer season fig s1 2 2 field samplings most of lakes in the tqp are in the depopulated zone in north tibet and it is a natural reserve for wild animals due to the geographical conditions and government management it is difficult to reach these remote lakes thereby we selected representative lakes based on their sizes a priori knowledge wang and hongsheng 1998 accessibility and salinity gradient a total of 244 water samples were collected in ice free seasons june to september from 63 lakes across the tqp from 2014 to 2017 some lakes were revisited for multiple times and some were just once due to the remote distances and less accessibility table s1 lakes were divided into two groups e g 32 fresh lakes n 135 and 31 brackish lakes n 109 according to salinity electrical conductivity table s1 sample locations for each lake were recorded using a gps receiver fig 1 more details about the name size surface area elevation latitude longitude land cover type and retention time of each lake can be found in table s1 water samples were collected from lake surfaces 0 50 cm with two 1 l acid cleaned plastic bottles the filtering process was conducted in the field and these filtered samples were filled into brown plastic bottles every day the bulk samples and filtered samples were transported back to the laboratory with portable ice cooler with ice packs these filtered samples were stored at 4 c until analysis within 2 days in the laboratory 2

samples through whatman cellulose acetone filters 0 45 µm the filters were extracted with 90 acetone and measured at 664 647 630 and 750 nm wavelengths using a shimadzu uv 2006 pc spectrophotometer total suspended matter tsm was determined by gravimetrical analysis song et al 2013 total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured following methods highlighted in standard methods apha 1998 2 4 cdom absorption measurements and parameters the collected water samples were first filtered through a pre combusted whatman gf f filter 0 7 μm then they were further filtered through a pre rinsed 25 mm millipore membrane cellulose filter 0 22 μm into brown plastic bottles zhao et al 2016 in the laboratory the absorption spectra of filtered samples were measured between 200 and 800 nm at 1 nm increments using a shimadzu uv 2006 pc spectrophotometer with a 1 cm or 5 cm quartz cuvette and milli q water as a reference the absorption coefficient a λ was calculated from cdom absorption od λ 1 a λ 2 303od λ γ where od λ is the corrected optical density at wavelength λ γ is the cuvette path length 0 01 or 0 05 m and the factor of 2 303 converts the results from a base 10 to a base natural logarithm zhang et al 2011a b 2 5 excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem spectra of cdom were measured at room temperature 20 2 c using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer with a 700 v xenon lamp scanning band pass widths of excitation and emission spectra were obtained using wavelengths of 220 450 nm with intervals of 5 nm and 250 600 nm 1 nm intervals respectively with a scanning speed of 2400 nm min 1 a milli q water blank was analyzed the result of which was subtracted from the resulting eem of the water sample spectrum to eliminate raman scatter peaks in order to eliminate the inner filter effect the eems were normalized by subtracting the integral area under the curve of the milli q water raman peak zhang et al 2010 zhou et al 2016 these eem spectra were then calibrated in quinine sulfate units qsu lawaetz and stedmon 2009 2 6 cdom absorption parameters and fluorescence indices according to table s2 uv absorption

boer 1987 in addition to the above parameters cdom absorption spectral slopes s at 275 295 nm was used to describe the ratio of fulvic acids to humic acids gonnelli et al 2013 helms et al 2008 the humification index hix was calculated from fluorescence eems as indices for the humification degree and dom sources zhang et al 2010 then the fluorescence indices fi 370 and fi 310 introduced by mcknight et al 2001 were used to characterize cdom source more details of absorption and fluorescence parameters could be found in table s2 2 7 eem fluorescence regional integration eem fluorescence regional integration eem fri divides eem boundaries into five regions associated with humic like tyrosine like tryptophan like or phenol like organic compounds chen et al 2003 more details about the peak locations and descriptions could be found in table s3 the integrated area beneath the eem spectra can be calculated using 2 φ i ex em i λ ex λ em δ λ ex δ λ em where δλex is ex interval 5 nm δλem

shown in fig 2 a significant higher s 275 295 value p 0 05 in brackish lakes 0 0380 0 009 nm 1 were exhibited than that in fresh lakes 0 0324 0 01 nm 1 3 3 fluorescence indices as shown in fig 3 fi

fi 370 of fresh lakes ranged from 0 11 lake trc 38 to 2 87 lake wz 1 36 with a mean value of 0 79 0 75 sd fi 310 of fresh lakes ranged from 0 57 lake wz 1 36 to 2 38 lake lac 37 with a mean value of 1

lakes showed a significantly higher p 0 05 than that in brackish lakes 1 8 1 7 3 4 eem fri and its difference analysis typical eems of cdom for four water samples obtained from lakes on the tqp were shown in fig 4 a d according to chen et al 2003 emm fri divides the eem signal into five regions i ii iii iv and v fig 4a and table s3 the excitation emission area volumes φi i i ii ii iv v and their proportion to total fluorescence intensity p i i i ii iii iv v were also shown in fig 4 e and f a significant difference p 0 05 of total fluorescence intensity φt was observed between the brackish and fresh lakes in this study φt ranged from 1 94 108 nm to 3 5 1010 nm for brackish lakes with an average of 1 44 1010 nm 8 1 109 sd as for fresh lakes φt ranged from 3 54 108 nm to 3 5 1010 nm with an average of 1 38 1010 nm 7 9 109 sd for all the samples the area volume of φi in the five integrated regions identified by eem fri were φv humic like φiii fulvic like φiv microbial protein like φi tyrosine like φii tryptophan like furthermore a significant difference for the fluorescence intensities of φv and φiii was found in brackish lakes and fresh lakes p 0 05 the p v 62 4 14 6 in brackish lakes ranged from 34 1 in lake gmc 16 to 96 8 in lake ccl 1 fresh lakes recorded a range of 32 8 lake grc 2 43 to 87 5 lake clq 47 with an average p v of 53 7 13 0 in addition the fulvic like fluorescence intensities also showed a significant difference p 0 05 between p iii in fresh lakes 24 8 7 4 and that in brackish lakes 15 9 8 8 the fluorescence intensities for φiv microbial protein like accounted for a greater proportion in brackish lakes 15 5 8 2 than that in fresh lakes 12 5 6 8 fdom components in different lakes showed spatial heterogeneity in order to eliminate the influence of spatial heterogeneity the cumulative volumes beneath the eem φi values were normalized to a doc concentration of 1 mg l 1 fig 5 the average normalized total fluorescence intensities φ t in brackish lakes was 1 1 109 qsu nm2 mg l 1 c 8 8 with a maximum value of 3 3 109 qsu nm2 mg l 1 c in lake gzc 17 and a minimum value of 4 8 107 qsu nm2 mg l 1 c in lake qhh 7 the φ t for fresh lakes ranged from

fresh lakes p 0 001 which was opposite to the non normalized eem fri results exhibited in fig 4e 3 5 pca of normalized eem fri principal components analysis pca indicated that factor 1 and factor 2 axes could explain 92 8 of total variance for eem fri accounting for 66 9 and 25 9 respectively fig 6 the kaiser meyer olkin analysis showed that the statistical magnitude was larger than 0 8 thus the five normalized eem fri fluorescent components exhibited positive factor 1 loadings fig 6a factor analysis showed pca factor 1 and factor 2 was associated with five cumulative volumes φ i i i ii iii iv v in a linear formula factor 1 and factor 2 can be expressed as factor 1 0 543 φ i 1 35 φ ii 0 788 φ iii 0 856 φ iv 0 98 φ v factor 2 0 899 φ i 1 78 φ ii 0 559 φ iii 0 636 φ iv 0 774 φ v φ iii fulvic like φ v humic like and φ iv microbial protein like showed a positive factor 1 loading and concurrently showed negative factor 2 loading this correlation result indicated that pca could separate normalized cumulative volume φi by eem fri into two groups group 1 φ iii fulvic like φ v humic like φ iv microbial protein like and group 2 φ i tyrosine like φ ii tryptophan like this finding was contrary to the results from zhao et al 2017 yao et al 2011 and yamashita et al 2010 from other water bodies 3 6 correlation analysis of cdom spectroscopic indices strong correlations between tyrosine like φ i and tryptophan like φ ii in fresh r 0 93 r2 0 86 t test p 0 01 n 135 and brackish lakes r 0 90 r2 0 80 t test p 0 01 n 109 were revealed this suggested that they may have similar sources fig 7 a a moderate correlation between φ i and microbial protein like φ iv was observed in brackish lakes r 0 84 r2 0 70 t test p 0 01 n 109 and a weak correlation was recorded in fresh lakes r 0 76 r2 0 57 t test p 0 01 n 135 fig 7b it demonstrated that parts of the two fri fluorescent components might have some common sources in brackish lakes however strong correlations between tryptophan like φ ii and microbial protein like φ iv were not observed which was consistent with the results of chen et al 2003 and zhao et al 2017 furthermore eems can be divided into two groups in the pca results fig 6 a positive correlation between φ iii iv v and φ i ii r 0 87 r2 0 76 t test p 0 01 n 109 in brackish lakes fig 7c was revealed while a moderate correlation was revealed in fresh lakes r 0 74 r2 0 54 t test p 0 01 n 135 fig 7d in addition close correlations between the a 350 fi 370 and hix were observed in the fresh lakes r 0 79 r2 0 66 t test p 0 01 n 135 fig 7 e and f in brackish lakes a close association was exhibited between a 350 and hix r 0 80 r2 0 65 t test p 0 01 n 109 3 7 cdom versus water biogeochemistry redundancy analysis rda results showed that species environment correlations of brackish and fresh lakes were 0 41 and 0 28 respectively fig 8 for brackish lakes n 109 the first two rda axes accounted for 80 7 of total water biogeochemical variability

salinity and turbidity followed by s 275 295 and m e250 e365 for the fresh lakes n 135 the first two rda axes accounted for 75 5 of total variability axis one 59 4 axis two 16 1 similarly a 254 hix and a 350 were correlated with water quality parameters tn tp doc tsm chl a salinity and turbidity followed by fi 370 and normalized φ iv in addition correlation and regression analysis were undertaken between doc concentration and normalized cumulative volume φ i i i ii iii iv v for all water samples table 3 brackish lakes was divided into four groups with salinity as the criterion salinity 10 average ec 23764 μs cm 1 salinity 6 average ec 10945 μs cm 1 salinity 2 average ec 5708 μs cm 1 and salinity 1 average ec 2119 μs cm 1 generally salinity 1 was consistent with that of fresh lakes average ec 586 μs cm 1 moderately positive correlations between the normalized cumulative volume φ i i i ii iv v and doc concentration were exhibited 3 8 cdom fluorescence versus land cover twenty basins b1 b20 were extracted to assess the relationship between fdom fluorescence and land cover the proportion of different land cover types to total basin area was shown in fig s3 on the tqp grassland with plentiful organic rich ecosystems were the major land cover type fig s3 cdom spectroscopic indices of lake samples in each basin were averaged to analyze the influence of land cover the results showed a moderate correlation between doc and normalized humic like φ v for 20 basins r 0 46 r2 0 54 t test p 0 01 fig 9 d normalized φ iii φ iv and φ v in basins with large grassland areas average area 14876 km2 n 10 basins exhibited higher values than in basins with small grassland areas averaged area 1976 km2 n 10 basins anova p 0 05 similar results were also found for forest and unused land although they only accounted for small proportions of total area in each basin fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of ec salinity on doc and cdom comparing with fresh lakes doc 7 94 12 05 mg l 1 brackish lakes with longer retention time showed higher doc concentrations 35 69 43 52 mg l 1 on the tqp table 1 and table s1 likewise substantial variations for both doc and cdom spectroscopic parameters were also observed between the fresh and brackish lakes p 0 05 table 1 and fig 2 our results were in agreement with the findings of song et al 2013 2017a zhao et al 2016 and wen et al 2016 for brackish lakes in other arid and semi arid regions these results can be explained by evapo concentration and accumulation processes of doc and cdom from terminal lakes in arid regions curtis and adams 1995 song et al 2013 2017a spencer et al 2014 addressed that doc was also around 525 675 ybp ybp years before present in tibetan alpine lakes they attributed this to either inputs of pre aged organics from glacier runoff direct deposition or to the aging of organics in situ i e a radiocarbon reservoir effect high salinity has a direct or indirect impact on water quality of brackish lakes and they highlighted different structures and composition of dom wen et al 2016 it was also found that the aquatic biogeochemical parameters of brackish lakes were slightly higher than the average values for brackish lakes in northeast china average tp 0 11 mg l 1 and tn 4 07 mg l 1 from zhao et al 2017 and lakes average tp 0 033 mg l 1 and tn 0 59 mg l 1 in yungui plateau of china zhang et al 2010 but lower than those in hulun lake average tp 1 52 mg l 1and tn 4 58 mg l 1 wen et al 2016 in addition rda results of brackish lakes also indicated that cdom showed a relatively higher correlation with water quality tn tp doc tsm chl a salinity and turbidity fig 8 zhao et al 2016 reported that the formed macromolecular structures of humic like substances could regulate the solubility of ions and organic pollutants however with correlation and regression analysis the affined characteristics of brackish lakes in our study area could be due to a weak connection between salinity ec and doc un exhibited r 0 49 and r 2 0 24 t test p 0 01 comparably opposite results from brackish lakes in the northeastern china plain r 0 97 r 2 0 93 p 0 01 zhao et al 2016 and on the inner mongolia plateau only regression analysis r 2 0 72 p 0 01 wen et al 2016 have been previously noted generally organic carbon with different sources allochthonous or autochthonous and composition may result in different relationships existing between doc and salinity ec curtis and adams 1995 spencer et al 2012 in our study area it indicated that regional hydrogeological and climatic conditions play an important role in driving doc variability song et al 2017a further salinity was divided into four groups 10 6 2 1 in brackish lakes table 3 the normalized cumulative volume φ i φ i φ ii φ iv and φ v of water samples with a salinity 10 average ec 23764 μs cm 1 by eem fri showed moderate correlations with doc concentrations r ranged from 0 51 to 0 86 r2 ranged from 0 59 to 0 75 both r and r2 values showed a consistent decreasing tendency with salinity or ec table 3 dom could accumulate via soil leaching and runoff passing through various landscapes in terminal brackish lakes song et al 2013 these allochthonous dom could be available for the microorganisms or be sink to the bottom or be transformed into inorganic carbon including co2 cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 more allochthonous inputs make small humic like molecules saturated in terminal brackish lakes and form colloidal particles chin et al 1998 they could continue to form macromolecular structures globular aggregates and ring like in high ionic strength environments myneni et al 1999 in our highest salinity group increasing salinity ec could increase doc cdom solubility by contrast it can be seen that the inflow rivers of a specific lake generally showed lower doc concentrations than that inside the lakes fig s3 in addition the high salinity could also limit microbial activity due to a decrease of osmotic potential mavi et al 2012 pagano et al 2014 verified that the high ec and alkalinity in brackish lakes was disadvantageous for microorganism production of autochthonous cdom components arts et al 2000 reported that increasing salinity could limit the microbial activity by reducing cell permeability therefore doc cdom accumulates in brackish terminal waters at significantly higher rates than those in fresh open waters duarte and prairie 2005 in addition p i of eem fri in brackish and fresh lakes also showed significant differences p 0 001 normalized humic like φ v and fulvic like φ iii were terrestrial sources accounting for p iii v 77 7 10 1 sd in brackish lakes and 77 7 7 3 sd in fresh lakes protein like fluorescence including tyrosine like and tryptophan like φ i ii recorded a greater proportion in brackish water p i ii 6 47 2 6 sd than in fresh lakes p i ii 22 3 4 0 sd fig 5c and d likewise we found a higher humic like averaged percentage p v 60 2 by normalized eem fri in brackish lakes compared with freshwater lakes 51 8 fig 5 this result implied that a greater formation of macromolecular structures from humic like substances in brackish lakes prevail 4 2 solar radiation and elevation versus doc and cdom the tqp possesses a markedly high altitude and a thin atmosphere compared to other studies ren et al 1997 fig 1c and fig s1 these environmental factors may have an important influence on the photochemical oxidation processes of cdom and the mineralization of doc duarte and prairie 2005 tobias and böhlke 2011 among the 63 lakes n 244 the brackish lakes for average m e250 e365 s 275 295 and suva254 were distinctly different from fresh lake results n 135 fig 2 suva254 values for brackish lakes recorded lower values than those recorded in terminal water from the inner mongolia plateau suva254 1 90 0 57 mg c 1 m 1 or in brackish lakes of northeast china 2 8 5 7 mg c 1 m 1 zhao et al 2016 wen et al 2016 this indicated that brackish lakes on the tqp were predominated with lower aromatic moieties of cdom and average molecular weight of doc compared within fresh lakes the average m e250 e365 s 275 295 and suva254 in the brackish lakes n 109 showed similar results of boehme et al 2004 in the gulf of mexico in addition our results also highlight significant differences in total fluorescence intensities φt and φ t between brackish lakes and fresh lakes p 0 001 figs 4 and 5 respectively we found that the average normalized total fluorescence intensities φ t between brackish and fresh lakes showed opposite vitiation tendency this finding may account for relatively higher colorless doc present in the brackish lakes compared with the fresh lakes which is a function of solar radiation and prolonged hydraulic retention time table s1 and fig s1 song et al 2017b reported the regression model slopes for doc vs a cdom 275 ranged from extremely low 0 33 highly saline lakes to 1 03 urban waters and 3 01 river waters their results demonstrated that strong photo degradation due to less cloud cover longer water residence time and sunshine hours on the tqp in order to evaluate the influence of solar irradiance to cdom optical characteristics fig 10 solar irradiance was divided into three groups 2900 h 2800 h 2600 h strong solar radiance and time could accelerate chromophores associated with high molecular weight being reduced mcknight et al 2001 hu et al 2017 by chemical bond rupture high molecular weight substances were transferred to low molecular weight pools this photolysis process could be accelerated by a prolonged hydraulic retention time and intensive solar radiation hu et al 2017 mcknight et al 2001 song et al 2017b however for water samples with a solar radiance 2900 h averaged solar irradiance hours doc recorded a moderate positive correlation with a 254 concentrations r 0 87 r2 0 76 t test p 0 01 and a correlation with fi 370 r 0 69 r2 0 48 t test p 0 01 this indicated that on the tqp with intensive uv b radiation solar irradiance 2900 h parts of the cdom mainly from allochthonous inputs have similar sources with doc the pca result of φ i exhibited that φ iv microbial protein like was consistent with φ v humic like and φ iii fuvic like fig 6 this suggests that they have common sources likewise a positive correlation n 109 between the total normalized cumulative volume φ iii iv v and φ i ii r 0 87 r2 0 76 t test p 0 01 were found in brackish lakes these results also demonstrated that microbial protein like fdom in brackish lakes associated with products from terrestrial microbial decomposition fig 7 zhang et al 2013 also identified correlations between total bacterial community structure and altitude on the tqp for the lakes on the tqp sources and compositions of cdom exhibited a similar to those in marine environment intensive solar radiance has the potential to enhance photochemical degradation of allochthonous cdom on the tqp this process resulted in absorption parameters with the production of low molecular weight cdom these findings are contrary to those recorded from rivers in intermontane plateaus in the usa spencer et al 2012 lakes in the songnen plain china song et al 2013 hulun lake china wen et al 2016 and basin rivers in china zhao et al 2016 in arid and semi arid regions brackish lakes commonly support highly active biological communities they can actively break down refractory organic matter into doc and accumulate in waters wen et al 2016 however due to strong uv b radiation on the tqp long sunlight duration may result in photobleaching of cdom which will limit microbial activities and increase mineralization of doc granéli et al 1996 duarte and prairie 2005 differences in results from our study and previous investigations may be due to the majority of the microbial protein like fdom being derived from terrestrial microbial decomposition water samples from brackish lakes were generally distributed in the range of 1 to 1 for both pca factor scores this finding confirms that the contributions of allochthonous substances including microbial protein like were obvious in brackish lakes in addition pca results could be attributed to both source differences and photo degradation process the characteristics of cdom and doc in brackish lakes on the tqp is similar to that in marine environments zhang et al 2013 reported that the majority of lakes on the tqp were affiliated with sar11 iii clade similar to observations from chesapeake bay bacterial plankton it suggests that solar radiation has an important effect on cdom photo absorption characteristics and it also contributes to doc variability and fate 4 3 the effect of land cover on doc and cdom fig 9 indicated that tqp land covers are associated with cdom and doc but it is not as important as the effects of salinity and solar radiation do the tqp is located in an arid climatic zone with low rainfall and the inflow of lakes mainly depends on surface runoff generally grasslands and forests are characterized by high nitrogen and organic matter export rates heinz et al 2015 high doc concentrations in the lake waters highlight the organic rich nature of these ecosystems these results can be explained by doc flux related to physical chemical properties hydrology and land cover within a specific drainage watershed for each lake heinz et al 2015 li et al 2018 table s4 listed the temporal variations and anova of averaged cdom and doc characteristics from lakes with twice sampling period in tqp in most of the case no significant difference was observed in different sampling years except lake xingxinghai which is a shallow lake and strongly disturbed by herding cattle and sheep thus cdom and doc may show fluctuations due to variation of slope runoff as a result of climatic and geographical conditions these environment factors may change the optical characteristic of cdom and water quality on the tqp however it should be highlighted that hydrology retention time and strong solar radiation are the key factors for lake cdom and doc variations on the tqp 4 4 limitation and future implications the tqp is a unique geographic environmental with less anthropogenic activities high elevation and strong ultraviolet radiation in their dry environments terminal brackish lakes generally exhibit high salinity due to the evapocondensed effect this signified that there were a accumulation in doc concentrations and less unit cdom these detailed doc and cdom characteristics data in this study is helpful to improve and understand our knowledge of lakes carbon characteristics on the tqp however timko et al 2015 found that ph effects on fdom also attibuted to the measurements and irradiation experiments of dom as well as dissolved iron concentrations and other water quality parameters investigations have shown that ph could change the charge of molecules by protonation deprotonation for inland waters sutton and sposito 2005 timko et al 2015 given the variations of ph in fresh or brackish lakes further systematic examination of ph and fdom is needed in future studies paralleled with investigations by others the cdom doc characteristics linked with various and dynamic changes of environmrntal factors e g eutrophication status sediments and underground waters song et al 2018a b zhang et al 2010 zhou et al 2016 only the spatial variations of cdom doc were analyzed with respect to arid environments on the tqp in this work although there were only temporal differences between fdom parameters in lakes table s4 p 0 05 terrestrial inputs by hyrological processes in temporal scales is also important for carbon flux which is worth to investigate in the further study as demonstrated by this study cdom and doc in brackish lakes in the study area is similar to that in marine environments thus it should be noted that the dynamic carbon role of saline lakes is worthy of future consideration in a view of termporal and spatial it is also a challage that an interface between converging environmental factors with comprehensive data sets particularly for those waters located in remote areas and harsh environments with less accessibility song et al 2018a 5 conclusions high elevation strong ultraviolet radiation long sunshine hours arid climate and terminal waters with low anthropogenic impact make the unique environmental conditions for cdom and doc studies on the tqp currently little is known about doc cdom fluorescence and its relationship with aquatic biogeochemical characteristics in lakes across the tqp in order to fill this study gap 244 samples collected from brackish and fresh water lakes across the tqp to examine doc cdom spatial variation and its link with environmental factors eem fri was applied to characterize cdom spatial variations between brackish lakes salinity 1 and fresh lakes salinity 1 significant differences of cdom spectroscopic indices normalized φ t and doc concentrations were found between fresh and brackish waters p 0 05 and lower average molecular weight of dom in brackish lakes are prevailing this investigation revealed that significant correlations were observed between the average doc and cdom fluorescence with salinity 10 however the correlation coefficients exhibited a decreasing tendency with salinity lower than 10 further significant correlations between the average doc and a 254 with annual total sunshine hours 2900 h were also observed and also a strong association between dco and fi 370 while the r and r2 values of regression analysis had a decreasing tendency with sunshine hours 2900 h finally moderate relationship between normalized φ v and doc concentration was observed r 0 46 r2 0 54 t test p 0 01 for different land cover types mainly grass in 20 basins across the tqp our findings also highlight that salinity solar hours and land cover primarily contribute to cdom and doc properties in lakes on the tqp these special characteristic of cdom and doc from brackish lakes in the study area is similar to that tracked in marine environments declaration of competing

6079,a packed column experiment was carried out to study the migration process of modified nano zero valent iron nzvi in porous media and the change process of hydraulic characteristics of porous media in view of the complexity of the migration mechanism of modified nzvi in porous media an unsteady variable parameter mathematical model considering the effects of interception brownian diffusion gravity settling and the change of porous media properties was established by fitting the model with the experimental data the changes of various mechanisms in the experimental process were studied the results show that the higher the injection flow rate the higher the concentration at the outlet and the lower the injection concentration the higher the throughput the distribution of iron particles in porous media is not uniform the maximum at the entrance and the lowest at the exit the model fits the test results well under various test conditions the model analysis shows that in the process of particle injection the particle size is small at the beginning and the particles are mainly attached to the surface of the medium due to brownian motion as the experiment proceeds the particle size increases the brownian motion effect decreases but the interception and gravity settlement effect strengthens in addition during the whole process the porosity of the medium decreases gradually and the probability of collision between particles and porous media increases which leads to the increase of the deposition rate coefficient keywords modified nanoscale zero valent iron migration distribution laboratory test mathematical model 1 introduction nano scale zero valent nzvi has strong reducibility large specific surface area and high reactivity choe et al 2001 liu et al 2010 it has good removal effect for nitrobenzene chlorohydrocarbons and other organic matters and has become one of the more promising and effective remediation materials in the field of underground environmental remediation efecan et al 2009 li et al 2019 ponder et al 2000 qu et al 2019 scott et al 2011 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 injecting nzvi suspension into underground can effectively degrade most chlorinated organic pollutants inorganic anions and toxic heavy metals dissolved in solution elliott and zhang 2003 o carroll et al 2013 quinn et al 2005 tosco et al 2014 wei et al 2010 nevertheless there are some major problems that prevent the effective application of nzvi in groundwater remediation an important obstacle to the wide application of nzvi is the tendency of rapid aggregation and settling of nzvi particles in aqueous suspension kocur et al 2014 because of the strong magnetic force and van der waals force between particles nzvi particles are easy to agglomerate when suspended in water forming a dendritic or reticular structure which may be much larger than the micron scale this results in the aggregation and adhesion of nzvi particles on the surface of environmental particles during injection which limits the mobility of nzvi in addition the reaction rate with pollutants is also reduced due to the reduction of specific surface area li et al 2006 phenrat et al 2007 schrick et al 2004 shen et al 2011 in recent years the research on modification technology of nzvi has been emerging which greatly improves the migration of nzvi by adding organic dispersants such as poly acrylic acid paa and carboxymethyl starch cellulose cmc into nzvi suspension the van der waals force between particles is reduced the steric hindrance is increased and the polymerization probability is reduced comba and sethi 2009 fatisson et al 2010 he et al 2010 he and zhao 2005 jiemvarangkul et al 2011 kim et al 2009 the migration distance of organic dispersants stabilized nzvi in porous media has been greatly increased relative to that of bare nzvi however compared with stable solutions the stability of modified nzvi is still limited and its migration characteristics in porous media still remains to be explored the fluidity of nzvi particles is too large to uniformly distribute in polluted groundwater which may also cause secondary pollution to the environment krol et al 2013 li et al 2018 ren et al 2017 because of the active nature of nzvi iron ions and iron oxides are easily released into the environment which will have unpredictable and serious toxic effects on organisms and even ecosystems at present most studies focus on the toxicity of nzvi to microorganisms chaithawiwat et al 2016 li et al 2010 however some scholars have found that nzvi can also affect barley el temsah and joner 2012b earthworms el temsah and joner 2012a and fish chen et al 2011 and further observations have found that nzvi can even change the physical and chemical properties of the environment cullen et al 2011 tilston et al 2013 understanding the migration of nzvi in porous media is essential to evaluate the potential of nzvi to travel from injection points to untargeted environmental compartments and to assess the microbial community exposure to nzvi lefevre et al 2016 the study of the migration and distribution of modified nzvi in porous media can provide theoretical basis for the occurrence and development of plugging in the process of injecting nzvi suspension into porous media the numerical model can simulate and reproduce the migration process of nzvi in porous media and quantitatively predict the distribution of nzvi in porous media in different periods it is of great significance for the development of nzvi with adjustable migration distance and the prediction of the underground injection process of nzvi in site scale test transport and deposition of particle suspensions in porous media and the effects on porous media have been discussed in previous studies these studies suggested that the deposition of suspended particles through porous media mainly includes three functions interception sedimentation and brownian diffusion bai and tien 2000 herzig et al 1970 rajagopalan and tien 1976 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 yao et al 1971 bai and tien bai and tien 2000 suggested that when particle suspension passes through porous media the structure and surface conditions of the medium undergo continuous changes the parameters of the medium change which in turn affect the filtration or deposition rate therefore particle suspension through porous media is essentially an unsteady process and the hydraulic parameters and effluent concentration of porous media usually change with time yao et al 1971 proposed a conceptual model of water and wastewater filtration process by means of micro analysis method and compared it with laboratory test results it is proposed that smaller particles are intercepted by diffusion while larger particles are intercepted by interception and settlement tufenkji and elimelech tufenkji and elimelech 2004 proposed an equation for predicting the single collector contact efficiency η 0 in physicochemical particle filtration in saturated porous media the correlation equation is developed assuming that the overall single collector efficiency can be calculated as the sum of the contributions of the individual transport mechanisms brownian diffusion interception and gravitational sedimentation the migration and distribution characteristics of modified nzvi in porous media

et al 2012 investigated the transport and deposition of carboxymethyl cellulose cmc modified zero valent iron nzvi nanoparticles in laboratory scale sand filled columns a modified colloid transport model which couples the governing transport equation to the aggregation kinetics equation was developed however the effect of the variation of porous media parameters on migration process is not considered the migration of nzvi will affect the hydraulic characteristics of porous media which conversely affects the nzvi migration the parameters are time varied therefore a non stationary

experimental breakthrough curves the parameter change process of brownian motion interception and settlement caused by the change of particle size and hydraulic characteristics of porous media during paa nzvi migration were analyzed based on this model 2 materials and methods 2 1 migration experiment scheme 2 1 1 synthesis of paa nzvi in this study nzvi was prepared by chemical reduction and poly acrylic acid paa was used as dispersant sun et al 2007 the specific operation is as follows take ferrous sulfate g heptahydrate in three flasks add 350 ml of anaerobic water to dissolve it and add 1 ml of paa optimal dosage jiemvarangkul et al 2011 during which nitrogen is continuously injected for 10 min to ensure deoxidation while continuously stirring to ensure the uniformity of the dispersant then the sodium borohydride solution with 150 ml concentration was dripped at the speed of 10 ml min the theoretical concentration of iron in the suspension prepared by this method is 1 g l modified nano zero valent iron suspension with different concentration can be prepared by changing the amount of reagent 2 1 2 packed column experiments the experimental device is shown in fig 1 in order to ensure the uniformity of water distribution glass beads with a diameter of 0 3 cm were filled in the inlet and outlet of the column with a size of 2 cm the rest is filled with quartz sand with particle size of 0 5 0 7 mm pressure gauges are set at the inlet and outlet to monitor the inlet and outlet pressure after filling deoxidized water is pumped into the column by a peristaltic pump to get rid of the gas in the column and obtain a stable flow pattern nine groups of penetration experiments were carried out with 12 ml min 8 ml min and 4 ml min as injection flow rates and the concentration of injected suspension was 3 g l 1 g l and 0 3 g l the ph value of the suspension is 7 4 0 4 and the temperature is 278 k the concentration of iron in the effluent was measured as well as the change of inlet and outlet pressure during the whole process was monitored the total iron concentrations were measured by atomic absorption aa method jiemvarangkul et al 2011 in order to quantitatively analyze the occurrence of plugging in porous media during the injection process and explain the migration characteristics of nzvi particles in the medium in detail the distribution of residual iron particles in the medium during the injection of modified nano zero valent iron was measured by parallel experiments among the six groups of packed columns with the same parameters 1 g l and 8 ml min were injected into the suspension and the experiments were stopped at the injection volumes of 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 pore volumes pvs respectively the quartz sand in the column was taken out and divided into 10 parts every 3 cm the concentration of iron in the solution was measured after soaking with dilute hydrochloric acid in a certain volume and the solid phase concentration in the medium at that time was calculated 2 2 numerical simulation method the migration of modified nano zero valent iron in porous media is a complex process with the deposition in porous media the structure and surface conditions of the medium undergo continuous changes the parameters of the medium change which in turn affect the filtration or deposition rate therefore the migration of paa nzvi in porous media is essentially an unsteady process hydraulic parameters of porous media and effluent concentration or filtrate mass usually change with time in this paper the following methods are used to establish the mathematical model 2 2 1 basic equation of solute transport in porous media in porous media traditional migration is usually described in eq 1 1 c t d 2 c x 2 v c x k dep c 2 ρ c

listed in table 1 2 2 3 effect on porous media residual nano zero valent iron in porous media will lead to changes in hydraulic characteristics of the media thus affecting the concentration of effluent there is a certain relationship among solid concentration porosity and permeability suspended particles deposit in the pore of aquifer medium and occupy part of the pore space resulting in the decrease of porosity of medium which can be described as 8 ε ε 0 σ c s where ε is the porosity at a certain time after injection ε 0 is the initial porosity and σ is the volume of pore blocked by suspended particles per unit mass the relationship between permeability and porosity is expressed by kozeny carmen equation nooruddin and hossain 2011 9 k t k 0 ε 3 1 ε 2 1 ε 0 2 ε 0 3 where k t is the permeability coefficient at t moment after injection k 0 is the initial permeability coefficient 2 2 4 polymerization of particles the migration of nano zero valent iron in porous media is accompanied by the process of particle aggregation raychoudhury et al 2012 because of particle aggregation the particle size increases which has a great influence on the deposition rate coefficient of particles k dep the agglomeration kinetics of nzvi particles can be described by the eq 10 lee et al 2000 10 d n k dt 1 2 α pp i j k β i j n i n j α pp n k i 1 z β i k n i where n i n j and n k is the i j and k mer particle number concentrations z is the maximum number of size categories the first term on the right side of the equation indicates that the k mer particle number concentrations is increased by the aggregation of i mer particles and j mer particles and the second term indicates that the k mer particle number concentrations is decreased as a result of collisions that lead to further aggregation aggregation kinetics is controlled by the particle particle attachment efficiency α pp which is the fraction of particle particle collisions resulting in attachment and is dependent on solution chemistry β i j represents the reaction constants between order i and j under brownian motion β br fluid shear β sh and differential settlement β ds which are derived from the calculation method in table 2 β i j is computed using the coalesced fractal sphere model lee et al 2000 as eq 11 11 β β br β sh β ds the particle size of aggregates is measured by the following equation gierczycki and al rashed 2008 maximova and dahl 2006 12 d p i n i 1 d f d p i 1 where n i is the number of particles forming aggregates d f is the fractal dimension of the formed aggregates which is adopted 2 raychoudhury et al 2012 d p i is the diameter of the polymer formed by n i particles and d p i 1 represents the diameter of a single particle 2 2 5 implementation of model algorithms the finite difference method is used to solve the eqs 1 2 and 10 the sand column is discretized into 30 grids with a length of 1 cm and time step is 20 s for each time step eqs 10 12 is first solved to obtain the particle size distribution at that time based on this particle size the deposition coefficient k dep is calculated by eqs 3 9 finally k dep is introduced into eqs 1 and 2 to calculate the concentration at that time step the calculation process is shown in the fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results under various conditions the iron concentration penetration curve at the outlet of the packed column is shown in fig 3 and the permeability coefficient of the test column is shown in fig 4 it can be seen that under various conditions the penetration curves show similar trends with the experiment proceeding the injection volume increases the nzvi suspension penetrates the packed column gradually the outlet concentration gradually increases to the maximum and then the outlet concentration gradually decreases this is because with the injection of nano zero valent iron the residual particles in porous media gradually increase and occupy the pore volume the deposition efficiency of nano zero valent iron in porous media increases so the concentration at the outlet decreases gradually the injection rate and concentration have different effects on the penetration curve the larger the injection flow rate and the higher the concentration at the outlet the smaller the residual amount of nano zero valent iron particles in the sand column when the injection flow rate is 12 ml min the maximum relative concentration at the exit reaches 0 70 0 62 and 0 59 respectively while at the injection flow rate of 4 ml s it is only 0 28 0 27 and 0 19 with the injection concentration of 3 g l 1 g l and 0 3 g l the injection rate and concentration also have some influence on the change of permeability coefficient generally speaking when the flow rate is low and the concentration is high the particles intercept quickly in porous media and the permeability coefficient decreases rapidly and vice versa when the injection flow rate is 4 ml min and 12 ml min the permeability coefficient of the packed column reaches 0 6 of the initial permeability coefficient when the injection volume is 1 pv 4 pv 8 pv and 3 5 pv 7 pv and 10 pv respectively with the injection concentration of 3 g l 1 g l and 0 3 g l when the injection concentration is 0 3 g l and 3 g l the permeability coefficient of the packed column reaches 0 6 at 8pv 9pv 13pv and 0 6pv 1 7pv and 3 5pv respectively with the injection flow of 4 ml min 8 ml min and 12 ml min this is because when the injection flow rate is large the shear effect of water flow on suspension particles is larger fewer iron particles are intercepted and adhered to the surface of porous media and the permeability coefficient decreases slowly when the injection concentration is high there are more suspended particles in the water flow because of the higher basic concentration the amount of iron remaining in porous media increases rapidly and permeability coefficient decreases faster 3 2 model fitting results the numerical model is established by using the method described in section 2 2 the model parameters are shown in table 3 among them parameters α pc and α pp were obtained by fitting and adjusting parameters and particle size was obtained by tem electron microscopy the other parameters are all worthwhile according to the actual measurement the fitting results show that the collision efficiency between particles and media α pc is higher when the concentration is high as well as between particles and particles α pp injection flow has little effect on α pp but has a greater impact on α pc the larger the injection flow the lower the α pc the fitting of the measured and simulated data of the change of outlet concentration and permeability coefficient under different experimental conditions is shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively it can be seen from the graph that when the injection concentration is 0 3 g l the concentration at the exit of the whole process does not change much and the larger the flow rate the higher the stable concentration when the injection concentration is 1 g l the penetration curve has a gradual downward trend and the concentration of effluent decreases gradually when the injection concentration is 3 g l the concentration of effluent decreases rapidly this is because the higher the concentration the more collisions between nzvi particles and porous media particles the faster the particles occupy the pore volume resulting in the rapid growth of k dep in addition the higher the particle concentration the more collisions between nzvi particles and the faster the particles aggregate into large scale aggregates resulting in further increase of k dep the simulated permeability is close to 0 at a small pv especially in the condition of 4 ml min and 3 g l while it still remains 0 1 0 2 when pv is large for the experimental results this is due to the serious blockage of the test column at high injection concentration under the action of water flow scouring the nzvi particles attached to the porous media surface flow out again with the water the process is complex and random involving many mechanisms such as shear torque desorption and so on the injection volume and concentration will be controlled in field application to avoid such a situation so it is not considered in this article 3 3 spatial distribution of nzvi in medium in order to quantitatively analyze the whole process the following conditions are selected to further analyze the whole process injection concentration of 1 g l with flow rate of 8 ml min the experimental and simulated results of the distribution of iron in the medium is shown in fig 7 at different times from the graph the simulation results of the model fit the test results well the amount of iron retained in the medium increases gradually with the experiment the distribution of iron is not uniform it is the largest at the entrance and the lowest at the exit with the increase of injection volume most of the iron is intercepted at the entrance this is because the interception begins at the entrance and with the increase of interception the interception rate increases leading to a further increase in the gap 3 4 process mechanism according to the model of this method the reaction coefficient is mainly affected by porosity and particle size the deposition rate coefficients of different particle sizes and porosity are calculated according to eqs 3 7 as shown in fig 8 the deposition rate coefficient decreases first and then increases with the increase of particle size and increases with the decrease of porosity forming a surface as shown in the figure the model established in this study describes the deposition and transport process of the nzvi particles in porous media as shown in fig 9 when nzvi particles pass through the packed column some particles flow out with water some are intercepted by porous media and the interception rate is controlled by the parameter k dep because of the limited dispersion stability of particles particles will gather together to form polymer which makes the particle size increase particle polymerization process is described by polymerization kinetics and controlled by parameter α pp with the injection of nzvi particle suspension the intercepted nzvi particles gradually increase occupying more pore volume and the deposition rate coefficient k dep increases the change of k dep in the process of change is shown in fig 10 a and the change of each mechanism is shown in fig 10 b d respectively it can be seen from the graph that with the injection of nzvi the particles gradually occupy the pore space of porous media making the pore volume gradually reduce at the beginning of the experiment the particle size of nzvi particles is smaller and the brownian motion is stronger which makes the k dep higher the nzvi particles are easy to adsorb on the surface of porous media with the experiment proceeding the reaction coefficient has a rapid decline process which is due to the aggregation of nzvi which makes the average particle size increase and the diffusion effect decrease at this stage the diffusion effect of nzvi gradually weakens and the pore space of porous media is not occupied too much nzvi particles are most likely to migrate with water flow as the experiment continues the particle size continues to increase the interception and sedimentation effects increase and the impact efficiency increases with the decrease of porosity therefore the reaction coefficient increases and the nzvi is difficult to pass through 4 conclusions the migration of modified nzvi in porous media was studied by packed column experiments an unsteady coupled model considering the polymerization between nzvi particles and the influence of nzvi attachment on the hydraulic properties of porous media was established the migration process of modified nzvi in porous media was analyzed by combining experiment with model the main conclusions are as follows 1 the flow rate and the concentration of iron have great influence on the migration of modified nzvi in porous media under the experimental conditions of this study when the flow rate is high the residual amount of nzvi in porous media is less the hydraulic characteristics of porous media change slowly and the rate of iron passage is higher when the concentration is high the residual amount of nzvi in porous media is large the hydraulic characteristics of the packed column change rapidly the passing rate of iron is low 2 the distribution of nzvi in porous media is not uniform there are more nzvi at the entrance and it decreases with the increase of distance the main reason for this phenomenon is that interception begins at the entrance and with the increase of interception the interception rate increases leading to a further increase in the gap 3 in the initial stage of migration the particle size is small and the particles are easy to diffuse and adsorb to the surface of the medium as well as the aggregation between particles is strong with the progress of the experiment the particle size increases and the brownian motion decreases mainly gravity sedimentation and interception declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

6079,a packed column experiment was carried out to study the migration process of modified nano zero valent iron nzvi in porous media and the change process of hydraulic characteristics of porous media in view of the complexity of the migration mechanism of modified nzvi in porous media an unsteady variable parameter mathematical model considering the effects of interception brownian diffusion gravity settling and the change of porous media properties was established by fitting the model with the experimental data the changes of various mechanisms in the experimental process were studied the results show that the higher the injection flow rate the higher the concentration at the outlet and the lower the injection concentration the higher the throughput the distribution of iron particles in porous media is not uniform the maximum at the entrance and the lowest at the exit the model fits the test results well under various test conditions the model analysis shows that in the process of particle injection the particle size is small at the beginning and the particles are mainly attached to the surface of the medium due to brownian motion as the experiment proceeds the particle size increases the brownian motion effect decreases but the interception and gravity settlement effect strengthens in addition during the whole process the porosity of the medium decreases gradually and the probability of collision between particles and porous media increases which leads to the increase of the deposition rate coefficient keywords modified nanoscale zero valent iron migration distribution laboratory test mathematical model 1 introduction nano scale zero valent nzvi has strong reducibility large specific surface area and high reactivity choe et al 2001 liu et al 2010 it has good removal effect for nitrobenzene chlorohydrocarbons and other organic matters and has become one of the more promising and effective remediation materials in the field of underground environmental remediation efecan et al 2009 li et al 2019 ponder et al 2000 qu et al 2019 scott et al 2011 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 injecting nzvi suspension into underground can effectively degrade most chlorinated organic pollutants inorganic anions and toxic heavy metals dissolved in solution elliott and zhang 2003 o carroll et al 2013 quinn et al 2005 tosco et al 2014 wei et al 2010 nevertheless there are some major problems that prevent the effective application of nzvi in groundwater remediation an important obstacle to the wide application of nzvi is the tendency of rapid aggregation and settling of nzvi particles in aqueous suspension kocur et al 2014 because of the strong magnetic force and van der waals force between particles nzvi particles are easy to agglomerate when suspended in water forming a dendritic or reticular structure which may be much larger than the micron scale this results in the aggregation and adhesion of nzvi particles on the surface of environmental particles during injection which limits the mobility of nzvi in addition the reaction rate with pollutants is also reduced due to the reduction of specific surface area li et al 2006 phenrat et al 2007 schrick et al 2004 shen et al 2011 in recent years the research on modification technology of nzvi has been emerging which greatly improves the migration of nzvi by adding organic dispersants such as poly acrylic acid paa and carboxymethyl starch cellulose cmc into nzvi suspension the van der waals force between particles is reduced the steric hindrance is increased and the polymerization probability is reduced comba and sethi 2009 fatisson et al 2010 he et al 2010 he and zhao 2005 jiemvarangkul et al 2011 kim et al 2009 the migration distance of organic dispersants stabilized nzvi in porous media has been greatly increased relative to that of bare nzvi however compared with stable solutions the stability of modified nzvi is still limited and its migration characteristics in porous media still remains to be explored the fluidity of nzvi particles is too large to uniformly distribute in polluted groundwater which may also cause secondary pollution to the environment krol et al 2013 li et al 2018 ren et al 2017 because of the active nature of nzvi iron ions and iron oxides are easily released into the environment which will have unpredictable and serious toxic effects on organisms and even ecosystems at present most studies focus on the toxicity of nzvi to microorganisms chaithawiwat et al 2016 li et al 2010 however some scholars have found that nzvi can also affect barley el temsah and joner 2012b earthworms el temsah and joner 2012a and fish chen et al 2011 and further observations have found that nzvi can even change the physical and chemical properties of the environment cullen et al 2011 tilston et al 2013 understanding the migration of nzvi in porous media is essential to evaluate the potential of nzvi to travel from injection points to untargeted environmental compartments and to assess the microbial community exposure to nzvi lefevre et al 2016 the study of the migration and distribution of modified nzvi in porous media can provide theoretical basis for the occurrence and development of plugging in the process of injecting nzvi suspension into porous media the numerical model can simulate and reproduce the migration process of nzvi in porous media and quantitatively predict the distribution of nzvi in porous media in different periods it is of great significance for the development of nzvi with adjustable migration distance and the prediction of the underground injection process of nzvi in site scale test transport and deposition of particle suspensions in porous media and the effects on porous media have been discussed in previous studies these studies suggested that the deposition of suspended particles through porous media mainly includes three functions interception sedimentation and brownian diffusion bai and tien 2000 herzig et al 1970 rajagopalan and tien 1976 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 yao et al 1971 bai and tien bai and tien 2000 suggested that when particle suspension passes through porous media the structure and surface conditions of the medium undergo continuous changes the parameters of the medium change which in turn affect the filtration or deposition rate therefore particle suspension through porous media is essentially an unsteady process and the hydraulic parameters and effluent concentration of porous media usually change with time yao et al 1971 proposed a conceptual model of water and wastewater filtration process by means of micro analysis method and compared it with laboratory test results it is proposed that smaller particles are intercepted by diffusion while larger particles are intercepted by interception and settlement tufenkji and elimelech tufenkji and elimelech 2004 proposed an equation for predicting the single collector contact efficiency η 0 in

which is adopted 2 raychoudhury et al 2012 d p i is the diameter of the polymer formed by n i particles and d p i 1 represents the diameter of a single particle 2 2 5 implementation of model algorithms the finite difference method is used to solve the eqs 1 2 and 10 the sand column is discretized into 30 grids with a length of 1 cm and time step is 20 s for each time step eqs 10 12 is first solved to obtain the particle size distribution at that time based on this particle size the deposition coefficient k dep is calculated by eqs 3 9 finally k dep is introduced into eqs 1 and 2 to calculate the concentration at that time step the calculation process is shown in the fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results under various conditions the iron concentration penetration curve at the outlet of the packed column is shown in fig 3 and the permeability coefficient of the test column is shown in fig 4 it can be seen that under various conditions the penetration curves show similar trends with the experiment proceeding the injection volume increases the nzvi suspension penetrates the packed column gradually the outlet concentration gradually increases to the maximum and then the outlet concentration gradually decreases this is because with the injection of nano zero valent iron the residual particles in porous media gradually increase and occupy the pore volume the deposition efficiency of nano zero valent iron in porous media increases so the concentration at the outlet decreases gradually the injection rate and concentration have different effects on the penetration curve the larger the injection flow rate and the higher the concentration at the outlet the smaller the residual amount of nano zero valent iron particles in the sand column when the injection flow rate is 12 ml min the maximum relative concentration at the exit reaches 0 70 0 62 and 0 59 respectively while at the injection flow rate of 4 ml s it is only 0 28 0 27 and 0 19 with the injection concentration of 3 g l 1 g l and 0 3 g l the injection rate and concentration also have some influence on the change of permeability coefficient generally speaking when the flow rate is low and the concentration is high the particles intercept quickly in porous media and the permeability coefficient decreases rapidly and vice versa when the injection flow rate is 4 ml min and 12 ml min the permeability coefficient of the packed column reaches 0 6 of the initial permeability coefficient when the injection volume is 1 pv 4 pv 8 pv and 3 5 pv 7 pv and 10 pv respectively with the injection concentration of 3 g l 1 g l and 0 3 g l when the injection concentration is 0 3 g l and 3 g l the permeability coefficient of the packed column reaches 0 6 at 8pv 9pv 13pv and 0 6pv 1 7pv and 3 5pv respectively with the injection flow of 4 ml min 8 ml min and 12 ml min this is because when the injection flow rate is large the shear effect of water flow on suspension particles is larger fewer iron particles are intercepted and adhered to the surface of porous media and the permeability coefficient decreases slowly when the injection concentration is high there are more suspended particles in the water flow because of the higher basic concentration the amount of iron remaining in porous media increases rapidly and permeability coefficient decreases faster 3 2 model fitting results the numerical model is established by using the method described in section 2 2 the model parameters are shown in table 3 among them parameters α pc and α pp were obtained by fitting and adjusting parameters and particle size was obtained by tem electron microscopy the other parameters are all worthwhile according to the actual measurement the fitting results show that the collision efficiency between particles and media α pc is higher when the concentration is high as well as between particles and particles α pp injection flow has little effect on α pp but has a greater impact on α pc the larger the injection flow the lower the α pc the fitting of the measured and simulated data of the change of outlet concentration and permeability coefficient under different experimental conditions is shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively it can be seen from the graph that when the injection concentration is 0 3 g l the concentration at the exit of the whole process does not change much and the larger the flow rate the higher the stable concentration when the injection concentration is 1 g l the penetration curve has a gradual downward trend and the concentration of effluent decreases gradually when the injection concentration is 3 g l the concentration of effluent decreases rapidly this is because the higher the concentration the more collisions between nzvi particles and porous media particles the faster the particles occupy the pore volume resulting in the rapid growth of k dep in addition the higher the particle concentration the more collisions between nzvi particles and the faster the particles aggregate into large scale aggregates resulting in further increase of k dep the simulated permeability is close to 0 at a small pv especially in the condition of 4 ml min and 3 g l while it still remains 0 1 0 2 when pv is large for the experimental results this is due to the serious blockage of the test column at high injection concentration under the action of water flow scouring the nzvi particles attached to the porous media surface flow out again with the water the process is complex and random involving many mechanisms such as shear torque desorption and so on the injection volume and concentration will be controlled in field application to avoid such a situation so it is not considered in this article 3 3 spatial distribution of nzvi in medium in order to quantitatively analyze the whole process the following conditions are selected to further analyze the whole process injection concentration of 1 g l with flow rate of 8 ml min the experimental and simulated results of the distribution of iron in the medium is shown in fig 7 at different times from the graph the simulation results of the model fit the test results well the amount of iron retained in the medium increases gradually with the experiment the distribution of iron is not uniform it is the largest at the entrance and the lowest at the exit with the increase of injection volume most of the iron is intercepted at the entrance this is because the interception begins at the entrance and with the increase of interception the interception rate increases leading to a further increase in the gap 3 4 process mechanism according to the model of this method the reaction coefficient is mainly affected by porosity and particle size the deposition rate coefficients of different particle sizes and porosity are calculated according to eqs 3 7 as shown in fig 8 the deposition rate coefficient decreases first and then increases with the increase of particle size and increases with the decrease of porosity forming a surface as shown in the figure the model established in this study describes the deposition and transport process of the nzvi particles in porous media as shown in fig 9 when nzvi particles pass through the packed column some particles flow out with water some are intercepted by porous media and the interception rate is controlled by the parameter k dep because of the limited dispersion stability of particles particles will gather together to form polymer which makes the particle size increase particle polymerization process is described by polymerization kinetics and controlled by parameter α pp with the injection of nzvi particle suspension the intercepted nzvi particles gradually increase occupying more pore volume and the deposition rate coefficient k dep increases the change of k dep in the process of change is shown in fig 10 a and the change of each mechanism is shown in fig 10 b d respectively it can be seen from the graph that with the injection of nzvi the particles gradually occupy the pore space of porous media making the pore volume gradually reduce at the beginning of the experiment the particle size of nzvi particles is smaller and the brownian motion is stronger which makes the k dep higher the nzvi particles are easy to adsorb on the surface of porous media with the experiment proceeding the reaction coefficient has a rapid decline process which is due to the aggregation of nzvi which makes the average particle size increase and the diffusion effect decrease at this stage the diffusion effect of nzvi gradually weakens and the pore space of porous media is not occupied too much nzvi particles are most likely to migrate with water flow as the experiment continues the particle size continues to increase the interception and sedimentation effects increase and the impact efficiency increases with the decrease of porosity therefore the reaction coefficient increases and the nzvi is difficult to pass through 4 conclusions the migration of modified nzvi in porous media was studied by packed column experiments an unsteady coupled model considering the polymerization between nzvi particles and the influence of nzvi attachment on the hydraulic properties of porous media was established the migration process of modified nzvi in porous media was analyzed by combining experiment with model the main conclusions are as follows 1 the flow rate and the concentration of iron have great influence on the migration of modified nzvi in porous media under the experimental conditions of this study when the flow rate is high the residual amount of nzvi in porous media is less the hydraulic characteristics of porous media change slowly and the rate of iron passage is higher when the concentration is high the residual amount of nzvi in porous media is large the hydraulic characteristics of the packed column change rapidly the passing rate of iron is low 2 the distribution of nzvi in porous media is not uniform there are more nzvi at the entrance and it decreases with the increase of distance the main reason for this phenomenon is that interception begins at the entrance and with the increase of interception the interception rate increases leading to a further increase in the gap 3 in the initial stage of migration the particle size is small and the particles are easy to diffuse and adsorb to the surface of the medium as well as the aggregation between particles is strong with the progress of the experiment the particle size increases and the brownian motion decreases mainly gravity sedimentation and interception declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
