13220,this work evaluated the removal of hospital derived antibiotic resistant bacteria arb from source using peracetic acid paa four pilot experiments two using raw hospital wastewater and two using municipal wastewater were conducted using three paa concentrations at different contact times these contact times were selected in order to mimic the retention time of wastewater in a pipe running from a hospital to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp with high and low flows in order to confirm the paa dose delivered in the pilot experiments comparable paa treatments were made in parallel in batch experiments on the untreated wastewater paa degradation was swift in the pilot and batch experiments and no adverse effects were envisioned for the wwtp from the residual paa the numbers of multi resistant and ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria were higher in the hospital wastewater compared to the municipal ww as the hospital was the point source of arb the estimated cost of 0 06 is needed to remove 99 9 ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria using 50 mg l paa and 20 min contact time similarity on the removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria from the pilot experiment and batch experiments performed in the laboratory was observed and it increased based on increasing contact time and paa concentration the method appears to be an ideal technology to minimise the risk arb poses to sewage workers when new centralised super hospitals are being constructed in denmark and utilise an unbranched direct wastewater pipe from the hospital to the wwtp graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria disinfection hospital wastewater peracetic acid wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb in the environment is increasing due to the excessive use of antibiotics in humans animals and plants 1 2 which in turn has caused a considerable reduction in the effectiveness of antibiotic based therapeutic treatment 3 among many environmental conduits known to spread arb wastewater has been reported as an important vehicle 4 one study reported that approximately 50 to90 of antibiotics administered to humans or animals are discharged through urine and excrement 5 6 multi resistant bacteria are non susceptible to at least one antibiotic in three or more families and they can be gram positive as well as gram negative bacteria 7 resistance to multiple types of antibiotics is now commonplace and it is increasing for some of the major bacterial pathogens thus limiting medical treatment alternatives 8 9 multi resistant bacteria are known for their high capacity to spread epidemics and hospitals are seen as major point sources denmark s national hospital service is currently being centralised into super hospitals servicing entire regions and replacing many local hospitals this centralisation is leading to higher arb concentrations in hospital wastewater and fewer sewers and treatment plants which might pose increased risks to workers servicing these wastewater treatment plants furthermore increased concentrations of arb can be expected in effluent and any overflow that occur during heavy precipitation in combined sewers servicing these super hospitals to mitigate this wastewater issue several new super hospitals have constructed separate wastewater pipes linking them with wastewater treatment plants in order to limit the spread of pathogens and resistant bacteria to combined sewers these combined sewer systems in established cities are aging and require frequent maintenance and reconstruction work in addition they suffer from occasional overflows after heavy precipitation causing the release of arb emissions into the environment however dedicated pipes do not prevent the drastic increases in arb concentrations caused by hospital centralisation at the wwtp or effluent resulting in increased exposure of workers and persons in contact with water close to the wwtp effluent when arb are exposed to different disinfectants the bacteria and their antibiotic resistance genes args present in both bacterial genomes and in free dna are capable of persisting and even spreading in the environment 10 aquatic mediums have been recognized as a perfect environment for the dissemination and acquisition of arb and args 11 studies on the occurrence and diversity of arb and arg in hospital wastewater is still scarce 12 their dissemination pose a human health risk which needs to be further investigated since it is not yet possible to quantitatively evaluate it 11 several disinfection technologies are available and can be used to reduce these bacteria chlorine is not suitable for disinfection of raw wastewater as it reacts with organic matter forming high concentration of organohalogens and with nitrogen compounds forming chloramines chloramines are acutely toxic to many aquatic organisms 13 and many organohalogen byproducts are toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic 14 21 disinfection using chlorination can cause the release of args from damaged cells 2 and the transfer of args to pathogenic bacteria 22 24 is also of concern since it poses a severe health risk campo et al 25 showed that the arb population increases after chlorination treatment peracetic acid paa is an ideal candidate for the removal of arb but to our knowledge studies on the efficiency of paa in eliminating arb in raw wastewater are limited since most of the research performed to date has only focused on the effect of paa on cultivable bacterial populations paa is a strong disinfectant with a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity it was introduced to the wastewater treatment process approximately 30 years ago 26 27 and is used to disinfect combined sewer overflows 28 29 throughout disinfection paa oxidises sulphur and sulfhydryl bonds in enzymes and proteins 30 and it acts with an inactivation mechanism to disrupt the chemiosmotic function of the microbial cell by breaking the cell wall and altering its transport systems a secondary inactivation mechanism can also be attributed via the formation of hydroxyl radicals 31 commercial paa is available as an acidic quaternary equilibrium mixture of paa hydrogen peroxide acetic acid and water residues remaining after paa use are acetic acid hydrogen peroxide and water acetic acid is further biodegraded into carbon dioxide whilst hydrogen peroxide degrades to oxygen and water neither of which is considered toxic to aquatic life ciprofloxacin is the most commonly used antibiotics in denmark and found in high concentration in the untreated wastewater regardless if it was associated with hospital wastewater or not 32 as the purpose of this study was to optimize peracetic acid treatment to eliminate antibiotic resistant bacteria from the wastewater it was important to identify a model organism present in large concentrations so log reductions due to treatment would be evident other antibiotic resistant bacteria such as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus vancomycin resistant enterococcus extended spectrum beta lactamase e coli and carbapenemase producing organisms can also be monitored from the wastewater however the concentration of these resistant bacteria would be present in very low numbers compared to ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria 33 36 to determine the optimal disinfection dose numbers of organisms should be consistent in measurable concentrations for quantification to obtain better determination of the removal effectiveness the aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of using paa to reduce arb concentration in hospital wastewater before it reaches the wastewater treatment plant using a dedicated sewage pipe as a reaction chamber for the disinfection this in turn will remove excess arb load for receiving wwtps servicing the new super hospitals ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria were used as indicator bacteria to study the disinfection process since they are abundant in wastewater both connected and not connected with hospital wastewater thus leading to measurable concentrations that help monitor the effects of disinfection 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sulfuric acid 95 w v ciprofloxacin cefuroxime sodium salt gentamicin sulphate salt sulfamethoxazole abts 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6

chemicals were reagent grade paa solution containing 15 w w of commercial grade disinfectant was supplied by novadan kolding denmark from this a working solution of 10 g l of paa was made actual paa and hydrogen peroxide concentrations in the stock solution were quantified by iodometric titration 2 2 peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide quantification paa concentration in wastewater was determined via the colorimetric method described in 37 in short 350 μl of the sample 350 μl of 1 m acetic acid ph 3 5 and 350 μl of abts 1 g l were added to a 1 0 cm polypropylene cuvette paa was measured at 405 nm after a 10 min waiting time hydrogen peroxide was determined by adding a 2 ml sample to 0 2 ml of a 5 sulfuric acid solution and 0 2 ml of potassium titanium oxide oxalate 50 g l in a 1 0 cm polypropylene cuvette reaction products were measured at 400 nm after a 1 min reaction time 2 3 standardisation of paa stock solution by iodometric titration two step titration was carried out to determine h2o2 and paa concentrations in the stock solution based on the procedures described originally by 38 in short 100 200 mg samples were weighed into a titration vessel containing 10 ml of 5 h2so4 solution one piece of ice was added to maintain the temperature of the aliquot solution at under 10 c in all 40 ml h2so4 solution and three drops of ferroin indicator were added and the sample was titrated with 0 1 n nh4 4ce so4 4 solution from orange to light blue to determine paa concentration 5 ml of the 10 ki solution three drops of the ammonium heptamolybdate solution and 1 ml of the starch solution were added to the aliquot solution from which h2o2 was titrated the liberated iodine was titrated with a 0 1 n na2s2o3 solution from a dark brown colour to orange 2 4 microbiological analysis raw and paa disinfected wastewater samples were collected from hillerød hospital located in the northern part of copenhagen denmark samples were processed within 2 h after collection paa residues were neutralised by adding 100 mg l sodium thiosulfate followed by adding 50 mg l catalase to destroy any hydrogen peroxide total heterotrophic bacteria ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria and multi resistant bacteria were enumerated on compactdry plates nissui pharmaceutical tokyo japan using the spread plate technique compact dry tc is a medium for total viable bacterial count which contains nutrient agar 0 5 peptone 0 25 yeast extract 0 1 glucose and 1 5 agar the colonies grown on compact dry tc are red due to the redox indicator tetrazolium which makes it easy to identify and differentiate colonies from possible sample residues for enumeration of total heterotrophic bacteria serial dilutions of each sample were prepared in sterilized sterile phosphate buffer saline pbs and 1 ml of diluted samples were added onto the compactdry plate in duplicate and incubated for 24 h at 37 1 c for enumeration of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria serial dilutions of each sample were prepared in a solution with 4 mg l ciprofloxacin mixed with sterile pbs and 1 ml of diluted samples were added onto the compactdry plate in duplicate and incubated for 24 h at 37 1 c bacteria counts were expressed as colony forming units per ml cfu ml with the limit of quantification loq of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria equal to 10 cfu ml multi resistant bacteria multidrug resistant bacteria were enumerated using the spread plate technique serial dilutions of each sample were prepared in a solution mixed with 4 mg l ciprofloxacin 15 mg l gentamicin 20 mg l cefuroxime and 0 6 mg l sulfamethoxazole with sterile pbs diluted samples were added onto the compactdry plate in duplicate and incubated for 24 h at 37 1 c antibiotic concentrations were chosen based on study conducted by nielsen et al 34 for danish environmental protection agency nielsen et al 24 already conducted validation and quality control of antimicrobial susceptibility of antibiotics therefore it was not repeated and presented in this study 2 5 batch experiments batch experiments were performed in parallel with the pilot experiments to ensure the same conditions for both tests and to avoid changes in wastewater such as hydrolysis over a prolonged storage time different paa concentrations 25 50 75 100 and 150 mg l paa were spiked into the raw municipal wastewater whereas the raw hospital wastewater was spiked with 50 75 and 100 mg l paa samples were collected for paa and h2o2 quantification and microbiological analysis at different contact times contact times were selected based on paa degradation for batch experiments contact times range from 20 to 120 min whereas for pilot experiments between 20 and 60 min 2 6 pilot unit pilot experiments were conducted in a 20 ft container containing a long pipe folded into the container thereby reflecting the retention time of wastewater running from a hospital to a wastewater treatment plant the pipe served as a reaction tank facilitating plug flow and provided different sampling points the system was equipped with a submersible centrifugal feed pump and a peristaltic dosing pump to aid the continuous addition of disinfectant a static mixer downstream of the dosing point ensured that the disinfectant was thoroughly mixed with the wastewater paa concentrations and contact times were adjusted by adjusting the flows of the dosing pump and the feed pump 2 7 experiments this study was divided into two experiments experiment i was a laboratory design experiment pre experiment to determine the range of paa dose that resulted in a reasonable disinfection level and experiment ii was a pilot experiment set up to examine in situ disinfection whilst conducting the pilot experiments on municipal and hospital raw wastewater the batch experiment was performed in parallel in order to confirm the paa dose delivered in the pilot experiment pre experiments were carried out by spiking 50 100 and 150 mg l paa of raw municipal wastewater in separate bottles to study concentration profiles and removal efficiency pre experiments were repeated on two different days one week apart to test wastewater quality variability pilot experiments were conducted in a pilot unit described in section 2 6 consisting of a plug flow reactor into which raw wastewater from the wwtp and hospital were pumped for paa disinfection the first pilot experiment was conducted by using 25 50 and 75 mg l paa doses with three contact times pilot experiments with municipal and hospital untreated wastewater were carried out on two different days one month apart batch experiments were conducted the same day as the pilot experiments were carried out using the same paa concentrations and contact time after different contact times were applied for the pilot and batch experiments a fraction of each sample was collected to enumerate ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria in parallel paa concentrations were quantified until 60 min in the remaining sample for pilot experiments whilst in batch experiments paa quantification was done until complete degradation was observed furthermore raw wastewater was collected at the inlet of the pilot container prior to the beginning and the end of the experiment to enumerate the initial number of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria multi resistant bacteria heterotrophic bacteria ph and cod 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentration profiles of paa paa degradation in the raw wastewater from hillerød wwtp and hillerød hospital was first done in a laboratory designed experiment pre experiment to study the removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria based on different paa dosages in both pre experiments half of the paa concentration was degraded between 1 and 5 min fig 1a b in the first pre experiment complete paa degradation was observed after the first 30 min when 50 and 100 mg l paa was used whilst this phenomenon was also observed after 120 min contact time when 150 mg l paa was used in the second pre experiment complete paa degradation was observed after 10 min when 50 and 100 mg l paa was used and after 60 min contact times when 150 mg l paa was used the differences for both paa concentration profiles in the pre experiments can be explained by different physico chemical factors affecting the decay of paa these factors tend to be related to the presence of suspended solids ss ph temperature cod salinity and water hardness 39 40 cod and ph of raw municipal wastewater from hillerød wwtp was 349 mg l and 7 3 respectively whilst cod and ph of wastewater from hillerød hospital was 445 mg l and 7 8 respectively the ph and cod was not analysed in the raw municipal wastewater used in the pre experiments in the pilot experiment using municipal wastewater paa and hydrogen peroxide concentrations were measured after 20 40 and 60 min low cod was measured in the ww resulting in the slow degradation of paa in the pilot experiment whilst complete degradation was observed after 120 min in the batch experiment fig 2 c d and s1 three paa dosages 25 50 and 75 mg l paa were used in the pilot and batch experiments based on cod measurements and the fact that municipal wastewater contains less ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria compared to hospital wastewater thus a lower paa dose would be needed for ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria inactivation the pilot experiment using wastewater from hillerød hospital was performed using 50 75 and 100 mg l of paa concentrations of paa and hydrogen peroxide were measured after 1 5 10 and 20 min fast paa degradation was observed at a concentration less than 0 5 mg l after 10 min however around 40 of the initial hydrogen peroxide remained when measured after 40 min contact time fig 1e s2 s3 a similar degradation of paa and hydrogen peroxide was observed in the batch experiment fig 1f s2 s3 the faster decay of paa in the raw hospital wastewater was observed which might be due to higher cod content than found in the municipal wastewater dominguez henao et al 41 revealed a correlation between soluble matter and paa consumption and demonstrated that higher the soluble cod faster the paa degradation with an additive effect to the influence of total suspended solids in paa consumption the study conducted by koivunen heinonen tanski 42 showed the need for higher paa doses in primary effluent than in secondary and tertiary effluent whereas this study used higher paa doses as the quality of raw wastewater was different raw wastewater consists of high cod tss and turbidity factors known to affect paa degradation and thus disinfection 3 2 ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria removal in the pre experiment ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria were removed below the detection limit 10 cfu ml after 3 min of exposure to 50 mg l paa fig 2b d the pre experiments carried out on different days achieved similar removal results when inactivating the ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria the numbers of ciprofloxacin and multi resistant bacteria fig 2a present in the raw wastewater 0 7 and 0 1 respectively from the first pre experiment were similar to the second pre experiment 0 8 and 0 3 respectively fig 2c multi resistant bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria were enumerated from the raw hospital wastewater and municipal wastewater together with ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria fig 3a d there were more multi resistant bacteria in the hospital wastewater compared to the municipal wastewater as the hospital is the point source for multi resistant arb moreover ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria were more abundant than multi resistant bacteria in both municipal and hospital wastewater results from the pilot experiment using municipal wastewater demonstrated the progressive removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria with a paa dose of 25 mg l with 60 min contact time the removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was 1 9 log whilst at dosages of 50 and 75 mg l paa the removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was under the detection limit after a contact time of 60 min fig 3b better effects in this regard were observed in the batch experiment in that after 20 min exposure to 25 mg l paa ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria were under the detection limit fig 3c koivunen and heinonen tanski 42 demonstrated that the inactivation of bacteria occurred in two phases in the disinfection process in the first phase a steep decline in the total number of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was observed this is a known outcome at the beginning of the disinfection process when mainly free swimming microbes are inactivated the first phase was observed when 50 mg l paa with 1 min contact time removed 85 of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria fig 3e this steep decline of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was also observed in the batch experiment with hospital wastewater at 1 min reaction time with different paa concentrations fig 3f in the second phase which is the most stable phase the inactivation rate decreases tailing of the inactivation curve is present in fig 3b e and f tailing of the inactivation curve was observed in the pilot experiment with municipal wastewater fig 3b where the log removal increases only by 0 3 log between 20 and 60 min when 25 mg l paa was used for disinfection these two bacterial inactivation phases were observed in the pilot experiments using wastewater from hillerød hospital and municipal wastewater fig 3b e as well as in the batch experiment with hospital wastewater fig 3f studies by domínguez henao et al 43 koivunen and heinonen tanski 42 suggested the possibility that bacteria might aggregate to survive paa disinfection or that the presence of suspended solids might protect bacteria against disinfection however this can be overcome with a higher paa dose or a longer contact time this bacteria protection by aggregating itself was not observed in the batch experiment with municipal wastewater fig 3c likely due to the better and continuous mixing of the wastewater and paa moreover first sample was taken after 20 min reaction time fig 3c and therefore it could be possible that the two bacterial inactivation phases where missed that could have been observed in the first minute of disinfection the removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria increased in line with an increase in contact time the removal rate was 0 8 log when 50 mg l of paa was used and with 1 min of contact time this increased to 2 4 log when 50 m g l of paa was used along with a 10 min contact time fig 3e when paa concentration increased more ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria were removed the number of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was less than 10 cfu ml under detection limit and the log removal was more than 3 7 log when 75 mg l paa was used for disinfection of hospital wastewater with a 10 min contact time fig 3e similar and better removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was observed in the batch experiment likely due to the better mixing of wastewater and paa compared to only initial mixing in the pilot experiment the amount of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was reduced from 5 104 cfu ml to 1 101 cfu ml under detection level by applying 75 mg l paa fig 3e over a 10 min contact time even though paa concentration was consumed after the first 10 min the disinfection process continued due to the remaining concentration of h2o2 which is known as a supplementary source for hydroxyl radicals and a weak disinfectant if dosed alone resulting in ineffective disinfection since the catalase enzyme will protect the microorganisms from the h2o2 39 in this case the catalase first has to be inactivated by peracetic acid in order to accomplish combined disinfection with h2o2 kitis 27 established that paa can cause different levels of specific damage to biomolecules paa will oxidise sulfhydryl disulphide enzymes and double bonds in proteins paa has the ability to cause protein denaturation and make dna bases react adversely furthermore paa can inactivate the peroxidase enzyme the damage paa causes to bacteria makes them incapable of recovery and no re growth occurs 44 in this study re growth of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was not studied furthermore disinfected wastewater ends up in the inlet of wwtp and treated further therefore recovery of injured bacteria will be negligible profaizer 45 described a survival curve consisting of three stages an initial resistance phase the exponential inactivation of bacteria and finally asymptotic inactivation the initial resistance phase is attributed by resistance of paa diffusion through the cellular membrane which results in an inactivation lag 46 this survival curve is present in paa concentrations lower than 5 mg l at higher paa concentrations the resistance of paa to the cell membrane is reported as being insignificant 46 the initial resistance phase was not observed in these experiments since the lowest concentration used was 25 mg l paa the cost for removing ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria 99 9 from the raw hospital wastewater using 50 mg l paa with 20 min contact is estimated to be 0 06 m3 4 conclusion the findings of this study demonstrate that the paa disinfection of wastewater constitutes a promising treatment technology for the elimination of selected hospital derived arb paa can be used to treat hospital wastewater at source thereby enabling a retention time through structures that transport the wastewater from the hospital to the wwtp inlet four pilot experiments using wastewater from two different sources were performed with different paa concentrations and contact times in parallel to the pilot experiments in order to confirm the paa dose comparable paa treatments were applied in batch experiments on the untreated wastewater the degradation of paa was fast in the pilot and batch experiments thus ensuring no residual paa effect on wastewater treatment plant processes similar results for the removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria from the pilot and the batch experiments were observed when different paa concentrations were used the removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria increased in line with an increase in contact time and paa concentration to remove 99 9 ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria it is estimated 50 mg l paa and 20 min contact time would be needed and 75 mg l paa would be needed if only 10 min contact time was available in summary arb disinfection in hospital wastewater at source hospital using paa seems a feasible method for reducing the numbers of arb and thus minimising the risk of infection from arb for plant workers when new centralised super hospitals are constructed in denmark and direct wastewater connection are established between the

was not repeated and presented in this study 2 5 batch experiments batch experiments were performed in parallel with the pilot experiments to ensure the same conditions for both tests and to avoid changes in wastewater such as hydrolysis over a prolonged storage time different paa concentrations 25 50 75 100 and 150 mg l paa were spiked into the raw municipal wastewater whereas the raw hospital wastewater was spiked with 50 75 and 100 mg l paa samples were collected for paa and h2o2 quantification and microbiological analysis at different contact times contact times were selected based on paa degradation for batch experiments contact times range from 20 to 120 min whereas for pilot experiments between 20 and 60 min 2 6 pilot unit pilot experiments were conducted in a 20 ft container containing a long pipe folded into the container thereby reflecting the retention time of wastewater running from a hospital to a wastewater treatment plant the pipe served as a reaction tank facilitating plug flow and provided different sampling points the system was equipped with a submersible centrifugal feed pump and a peristaltic dosing pump to aid the continuous addition of disinfectant a static mixer downstream of the dosing point ensured that the disinfectant was thoroughly mixed with the wastewater paa concentrations and contact times were adjusted by adjusting the flows of the dosing pump and the feed pump 2 7 experiments this study was divided into two experiments experiment i was a laboratory design experiment pre experiment to determine the range of paa dose that resulted in a reasonable disinfection level and experiment ii was a pilot experiment set up to examine in situ disinfection whilst conducting the pilot experiments on municipal and hospital raw wastewater the batch experiment was performed in parallel in order to confirm the paa dose delivered in the pilot experiment pre experiments were carried out by spiking 50 100 and 150 mg l paa of raw municipal wastewater in separate bottles to study concentration profiles and removal efficiency pre experiments were repeated on two different days one week apart to test wastewater quality variability pilot experiments were conducted in a pilot unit described in section 2 6 consisting of a plug flow reactor into which raw wastewater from the wwtp and hospital were pumped for paa disinfection the first pilot experiment was conducted by using 25 50 and 75 mg l paa doses with three contact times pilot experiments with municipal and hospital untreated wastewater were carried out on two different days one month apart batch experiments were conducted the same day as the pilot experiments were carried out using the same paa concentrations and contact time after different contact times were applied for the pilot and batch experiments a fraction of each sample was collected to enumerate ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria in parallel paa concentrations were quantified until 60 min in the remaining sample for pilot experiments whilst in batch experiments paa quantification was done until complete degradation was observed furthermore raw wastewater was collected at the inlet of the pilot container prior to the beginning and the end of the experiment to enumerate the initial number of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria multi resistant bacteria heterotrophic bacteria ph and cod 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentration profiles of paa paa degradation in the raw wastewater from hillerød wwtp and hillerød hospital was first done in a laboratory designed experiment pre experiment to study the removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria based on different paa dosages in both pre experiments half of the paa concentration was degraded between 1 and 5 min fig 1a b in the first pre experiment complete paa degradation was observed after the first 30 min when 50 and 100 mg l paa was used whilst this phenomenon was also observed after 120 min contact time when 150 mg l paa was used in the second pre experiment complete paa degradation was observed after 10 min when 50 and 100 mg l paa was used and after 60 min contact times when 150 mg l paa was used the differences for both paa concentration profiles in the pre experiments can be explained by different physico chemical factors affecting the decay of paa these factors tend to be related to the presence of suspended solids ss ph temperature cod salinity and water hardness 39 40 cod and ph of raw municipal wastewater from hillerød wwtp was 349 mg l and 7 3 respectively whilst cod and ph of wastewater from hillerød hospital was 445 mg l and 7 8 respectively the ph and cod was not analysed in the raw municipal wastewater used in the pre experiments in the pilot experiment using municipal wastewater paa and hydrogen peroxide concentrations were measured after 20 40 and 60 min low cod was measured in the ww resulting in the slow degradation of paa in the pilot experiment whilst complete degradation was observed after 120 min in the batch experiment fig 2 c d and s1 three paa dosages 25 50 and 75 mg l paa were used in the pilot and batch experiments based on cod measurements and the fact that municipal wastewater contains less ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria compared to hospital wastewater thus a lower paa dose would be needed for ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria inactivation the pilot experiment using wastewater from hillerød hospital was performed using 50 75 and 100 mg l of paa concentrations of paa and hydrogen peroxide were measured after 1 5 10 and 20 min fast paa degradation was observed at a concentration less than 0 5 mg l after 10 min however around 40 of the initial hydrogen peroxide remained when measured after 40 min contact time fig 1e s2 s3 a similar degradation of paa and hydrogen peroxide was observed in the batch experiment fig 1f s2 s3 the faster decay of paa in the raw hospital wastewater was observed which might be due to higher cod content than found in the municipal wastewater dominguez henao et al 41 revealed a correlation between soluble matter and paa consumption and demonstrated that higher the soluble cod faster the paa degradation with an additive effect to the influence of total suspended solids in paa consumption the study conducted by koivunen heinonen tanski 42 showed the need for higher paa doses in primary effluent than in secondary and tertiary effluent whereas this study used higher paa doses as the quality of raw wastewater was different raw wastewater consists of high cod tss and turbidity factors known to affect paa degradation and thus disinfection 3 2 ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria removal in the pre experiment ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria were removed below the detection limit 10 cfu ml after 3 min of exposure to 50 mg l paa fig 2b d the pre experiments carried out on different days achieved similar removal results when inactivating the ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria the numbers of ciprofloxacin and multi resistant bacteria fig 2a present in the raw wastewater 0 7 and 0 1 respectively from the first pre experiment were similar to the second pre experiment 0 8 and 0 3 respectively fig 2c multi resistant bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria were enumerated from the raw hospital wastewater and municipal wastewater together with ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria fig 3a d there were more multi resistant bacteria in the hospital wastewater compared to the municipal wastewater as the hospital is the point source for multi resistant arb moreover ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria were more abundant than multi resistant bacteria in both municipal and hospital wastewater results from the pilot experiment using municipal wastewater demonstrated the progressive removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria with a paa dose of 25 mg l with 60 min contact time the removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was 1 9 log whilst at dosages of 50 and 75 mg l paa the removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was under the detection limit after a contact time of 60 min fig 3b better effects in this regard were observed in the batch experiment in that after 20 min exposure to 25 mg l paa ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria were under the detection limit fig 3c koivunen and heinonen tanski 42 demonstrated that the inactivation of bacteria occurred in two phases in the disinfection process in the first phase a steep decline in the total number of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was observed this is a known outcome at the beginning of the disinfection process when mainly free swimming microbes are inactivated the first phase was observed when 50 mg l paa with 1 min contact time removed 85 of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria fig 3e this steep decline of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was also observed in the batch experiment with hospital wastewater at 1 min reaction time with different paa concentrations fig 3f in the second phase which is the most stable phase the inactivation rate decreases tailing of the inactivation curve is present in fig 3b e and f tailing of the inactivation curve was observed in the pilot experiment with municipal wastewater fig 3b where the log removal increases only by 0 3 log between 20 and 60 min when 25 mg l paa was used for disinfection these two bacterial inactivation phases were observed in the pilot experiments using wastewater from hillerød hospital and municipal wastewater fig 3b e as well as in the batch experiment with hospital wastewater fig 3f studies by domínguez henao et al 43 koivunen and heinonen tanski 42 suggested the possibility that bacteria might aggregate to survive paa disinfection or that the presence of suspended solids might protect bacteria against disinfection however this can be overcome with a higher paa dose or a longer contact time this bacteria protection by aggregating itself was not observed in the batch experiment with municipal wastewater fig 3c likely due to the better and continuous mixing of the wastewater and paa moreover first sample was taken after 20 min reaction time fig 3c and therefore it could be possible that the two bacterial inactivation phases where missed that could have been observed in the first minute of disinfection the removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria increased in line with an increase in contact time the removal rate was 0 8 log when 50 mg l of paa was used and with 1 min of contact time this increased to 2 4 log when 50 m g l of paa was used along with a 10 min contact time fig 3e when paa concentration increased more ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria were removed the number of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was less than 10 cfu ml under detection limit and the log removal was more than 3 7 log when 75 mg l paa was used for disinfection of hospital wastewater with a 10 min contact time fig 3e similar and better removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was observed in the batch experiment likely due to the better mixing of wastewater and paa compared to only initial mixing in the pilot experiment the amount of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was reduced from 5 104 cfu ml to 1 101 cfu ml under detection level by applying 75 mg l paa fig 3e over a 10 min contact time even though paa concentration was consumed after the first 10 min the disinfection process continued due to the remaining concentration of h2o2 which is known as a supplementary source for hydroxyl radicals and a weak disinfectant if dosed alone resulting in ineffective disinfection since the catalase enzyme will protect the microorganisms from the h2o2 39 in this case the catalase first has to be inactivated by peracetic acid in order to accomplish combined disinfection with h2o2 kitis 27 established that paa can cause different levels of specific damage to biomolecules paa will oxidise sulfhydryl disulphide enzymes and double bonds in proteins paa has the ability to cause protein denaturation and make dna bases react adversely furthermore paa can inactivate the peroxidase enzyme the damage paa causes to bacteria makes them incapable of recovery and no re growth occurs 44 in this study re growth of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria was not studied furthermore disinfected wastewater ends up in the inlet of wwtp and treated further therefore recovery of injured bacteria will be negligible profaizer 45 described a survival curve consisting of three stages an initial resistance phase the exponential inactivation of bacteria and finally asymptotic inactivation the initial resistance phase is attributed by resistance of paa diffusion through the cellular membrane which results in an inactivation lag 46 this survival curve is present in paa concentrations lower than 5 mg l at higher paa concentrations the resistance of paa to the cell membrane is reported as being insignificant 46 the initial resistance phase was not observed in these experiments since the lowest concentration used was 25 mg l paa the cost for removing ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria 99 9 from the raw hospital wastewater using 50 mg l paa with 20 min contact is estimated to be 0 06 m3 4 conclusion the findings of this study demonstrate that the paa disinfection of wastewater constitutes a promising treatment technology for the elimination of selected hospital derived arb paa can be used to treat hospital wastewater at source thereby enabling a retention time through structures that transport the wastewater from the hospital to the wwtp inlet four pilot experiments using wastewater from two different sources were performed with different paa concentrations and contact times in parallel to the pilot experiments in order to confirm the paa dose comparable paa treatments were applied in batch experiments on the untreated wastewater the degradation of paa was fast in the pilot and batch experiments thus ensuring no residual paa effect on wastewater treatment plant processes similar results for the removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria from the pilot and the batch experiments were observed when different paa concentrations were used the removal of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria increased in line with an increase in contact time and paa concentration to remove 99 9 ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria it is estimated 50 mg l paa and 20 min contact time would be needed and 75 mg l paa would be needed if only 10 min contact time was available in summary arb disinfection in hospital wastewater at source hospital using paa seems a feasible method for reducing the numbers of arb and thus minimising the risk of infection from arb for plant workers when new centralised super hospitals are constructed in denmark and direct wastewater connection are established between the

13221,agricultural based adsorbents have received an upsurge of interest in the water treatment industry especially in the area of adsorption they have been widely investigated as the next generation adsorbents due to their unique physio chemical properties and high affinity towards a wide variety of constituents ranging from organic compounds to heavy metal ions in addition agricultural based adsorbents are now a cheaper and sustainable option as opposed to non renewable and expensive adsorbents originating from coal polymers and petroleum residues among different agriculture wastes available walnut shells exhibit great potential as activated carbon precursor they have outstanding chemical stability high surface area and low ash content in this review walnut shell based adsorbents have been assessed in terms of their activation methods and preparation furthermore adsorbents resulting characteristics and factors influencing the adsorption capacity have been summarized and thoroughly analyzed it has been determined that the adsorption efficiency is heavily associated with the characteristics of the adsorbent including pore diameter surface area surface functional groups and the nature of the background solution including ph temperature and ionic strength this review identifies different activation methods reported in the literature including chemical and physical activation and chemical impregnation and functionalization the literature survey also entails a comprehensive discussion involving types of mechanisms and factors controlling adsorption behaviors towards targeted contaminants moreover a detailed analysis of adsorption isotherms and kinetics involved in the adsorption process is also included finally this review mentions future

zpa zeta potential analysis 1 introduction an economically feasible process of a large scale production of activated carbon ac from low cost precursors is primitively based on the abundance and availability of waste and by products commonly utilized feedstock for the production of ac includes coal wood peat polymers and petroleum residues all of which are non renewable and highly expensive 1 2 as a result many research works are headed towards the production of ac from sustainable alternatives such as agricultural waste including rice husk corn straw sludge and nuts among different agricultural based adsorbents the chemical composition of walnut shell ws exhibits great potential as a sustainable source of ac for the removal of target contaminants from aqueous solutions walnuts are produced from juglans regia l commonly known as the walnut tree and it is a native plant in central asia spreading through europe western china iran and afghanistan walnut production is the second largest nut production after almond nuts with a production over 3 7 million tons globally in 2019 3 the largest producer is china with an annual production of 1 06 million tons of walnuts followed by usa with a production around 600 tons and iran with a production close to 405 tons 4 ws make up 67 of the total weight of the fruit and they typically consist of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin 5 6 these agricultural wastes are normally discarded with no further use post cultivation or incinerated for heating purposes ws have proved effective in several applications including particle board industry they have been used as raw material for wood based particleboard which has been examined by pirayesh et al 7 embedding ws not only immensely improved the water resistance of the panels it also minimized the usage of virgin wood materials in turn saving natural resources during the industrial revolution the use of ws was initiated in more pressing applications such as the production of charcoal and activated carbon ac through pyrolysis 8 schroder et al experimented with different sources of biomass including ws rice wheat straw olive stones pistachio shells beech and hard coal 8 pyrolysis was performed at a temperature range of 500 600 c at a heating rate of 10 k min furthermore the biomass was activated through steam activation at temperatures between 800 and 900 c the results demonstrated that nut shells provide larger active surfaces than that of straw base materials signifying the presence of high amounts of carbon in nut shells and high ash content in straw base materials as of late ws are employed as precursors in the preparation of ac for the removal of hazardous materials from industrial wastewaters 9 13 hazardous contaminants commonly targeted in the experimental field include heavy metal ions and synthetic dyes however ac is the first adsorbent to be recognized and utilized in the industry for the removal of oil limited studies have been reported on the removal of oils using walnut based ac in the literature srinivasan et al reported that ws have a high affinity towards oils with uptake capacities ranging from 0 56 to 0 84 g g 14 however many reported the successful utilization of ws in the removal of organic compounds such as phenols methanol and polyaromatic compounds 15 17 generally nutshells have also been employed in its natural state without activation or further modification dias et al examined five different nutshells including walnuts hazelnuts peanuts pistachio and almonds shells for the removal of heavy metal ions 18 high efficiencies of 90 have been reported proving their ability in remediation of contaminated waters moreover ws have also used in enhanced removal of oil from oilfield wastewaters 19 employing raw biomass without further modification may not yield desired results due to their limited functionalities for example biomass prior to activation has relatively low pore properties inhibiting its ability to reach full capacity in the adsorption process thus there is an increasingly growing research interest in identifying new methods to improve chemical or physical properties of biochar pyrolysis temperature is one of many factors that can improve the yield of the resulting biochar demirbas et al studied the effect of temperature on pyrolysis products from four nut shells including hazelnut walnut almond and sunflower in a range of temperature between 500 and 1200 k in a cylindrical batch reactor 20 the results show that to maximize char yield a low temperature and heating rate is recommended increasing temperatures would only decrease char production chemical and physical activation also play major roles in the enhancement of properties of ws based adsorbents qiongfen et al prepared ws ac by chemical activation where the resulting surface area was 1636 m2 g competing with commercially available ones 17 walnut based adsorbents have been explored as the next generation adsorbents for the removal of emerging contaminants compounds that have been recently discovered including pharmaceutical drugs personal care products veterinary products herbicides food additives engineered nanomaterials and industrial compounds these contaminants have long existed in the environment however only recently their existence and effects are being identified latest studies show that ws have high affinity towards these contaminants 9 12 13 21 22 the adsorption efficiency of target contaminants by ws is maneuvered by several factors related to the type of the activation process of ws that is responsible for the creation of the pore structure and surface chemistry nature of the target compounds in addition to the chemistry of the water to be treated thus the aim of this review paper is to conduct a comprehensive review on peer reviewed articles on ws based adsorbents for the treatment of water or wastewaters the objectives are divided into two subcategories the first goal is to discuss the resulting properties of walnut shell based adsorbents with respect to different methods of enhancement including physical activation chemical activation and chemical impregnation the second goal is to examine and study the mechanisms and factors controlling the adsorption process of target contaminants onto ws based adsorbent for the purpose of this review paper target contaminants to be focused on can be broadly classified into heavy metal ions and organic compounds with a major focus on organic dyes 2 walnut shell chemical composition the lignocellulosic compounds account around 70 of the total biomass among different types of plant or wood biomasses 23 the main constituents of ws are very similar to that of wood biomass which include lignin cellulose hemicellulose and tannins that can be extracted and utilized to create other chemicals and materials 24 the elucidation of chemical components of ws is extremely difficult due to the presence of highly crosslinked polymeric structures in the shell since ws are used in a widespread of applications it is crucial to be able to identify its chemical components it has been reported that the approximate percentage chemical composition of ws consists of 50 3 lignin 22 4 hemicellulose 23 9 cellulose and 3 4 ash 25 however the percentage of each component can slightly vary depending on the source of the walnut plant genetics the environment where the plant was grown and processing conditions of the fruit fig 1 represents chemical composition of ws reported by different researchers in the literature reported ash and extracts percentages from different studies are similar with slight variations the chemical composition of ws are also presented in table s1 in the supplementary data file queiros et al characterized the shells of three different nuts in terms of their chemical and extract composition 4 all three nuts were produced in portugal and collected from different local supermarkets it was noted that ws contained 0 7 ash 10 6 total extractives 29 9 lignin and 49 7 polysaccharides detailed chemical compounds present in ws are presented in tables 1 and 2 ws composition differs from other nut shells in terms of hemicellulose where the contents are mainly xylans that are highly functionalized with acetyl groups and galacturonic acid overall ws can be characterized with high lignification sg lignin moderate content of polar extractives and low content of minerals 4 from table 2 it is noted that ws contain substantial amounts of calcium and potassium including magnesium and iron demirbas et al studied the effect of temperature on pyrolysis products from four different types of biomasses 20 biomasses experimented in the study originate from hazelnut walnut almond and sunflower zhai et al reported results of gc ms analysis of pyroligneous acids extracted from ws 26 main components included dominating compounds organic acids and phenols in addition to ketones aldehydes alcohols esters benzene and its derivatives and sugar and its derivatives similar results of ws pyroligneous acid have also been reported by jahanban esfahlan et al 24 another study reported the extraction and characterization of lignin compounds present in ws using gc ms and h nmr techniques 27 major compounds identified in this study include guaiacol 4 methylguaiacol 4 ethylguaiacol 4 propylguaiacol syringol 4 methylsyringol 4 ethylsyringol and 4 propylsyringol 3 characterization of walnut shell ws based adsorbents need to be thoroughly characterized before and after adsorption in order to have an insight into their distinctive properties and be able to identify the type of adsorption mechanism that takes place at the surface of the adsorbent adsorption of contaminants onto the adsorbent is a consequence of both surface chemistry and adsorbent morphology ws based adsorbents have been the subject of numerous adsorption studies especially for the removal of heavy metal ions furthermore they have been extensively tested for the removal of organic compounds where dye methylene blue has been commonly utilized as a model representation crucial chemical properties to be characterized include surface chemistry charge polarity and purity of the final effluent the morphology of the adsorbent includes specific surface area total pore volume pore size distribution texture and structural geometry principle techniques responsible for characterization that are commonly utilized according to the literature include brunauer emmett teller bet scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared ftir n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k and zeta potential analysis considering that ws based adsorbents are activated and functionalized using different techniques and functional groups it is highly likely that the specific surface area pore volume and average pore size will vary significantly most common characteristics reported in the literature are tabulated and presented in table 3 the bet technique is used to identify the specific surface area and the total pore volume can be calculated from the adsorbed volume of nitrogen near the saturation point p p0 the average pore size distribution is commonly obtained according to the method derived from barret joyner and halenda bjh 28 ashrafi et al removed brilliant green and congo red dyes from aqueous solution using ws modified with naoh 29 the modified ws adsorbent showed in increase in the specific surface area by a factor of 2 3 zhou et al used commercial activated carbon derived from ws for the removal of diazinon pesticide from aqueous solutions 30 the activated carbon was further modified with phosphoric acid to increase adsorption efficiency 30 the morphology of the adsorbent largely improved with an increase in specific surface area from 1076 to 1434 m2 g and a decrease in average pore diameter and total pore volume from 3 23 to 2 08 nm and 0 86 to 0 74 m3 g respectively li et al successfully introduced aspartic acid onto the surface of ws morphically enhancing the characteristics of ws where all three characteristics specific surface area total pore volume and average pore diameter increased from 1 04 to 2 33 m2 g 3 13 to 12 18 m3 g and 12 09 to 20 92 nm respectively zhou et al also reported an increase in specific surface area and total pore volume post functionalization of ws based adsorbent however average pore diameter remained the same 31 chunli et al reported that the porosity of the ws adsorbent massively improved through hydrothermal carbonization from 2 to 84 m2 g 10 according to pore size analysis the average pore size diameter of activated ws is located within the mesopore range 32 sem ftir and xrd all of which can provide further morphological characteristics of ws sem delivers an insight into the structure shape and surface of the ws based adsorbent the addition of functional groups onto the surface of the adsorbent can alter the chemistry of the surface by changing its hydrophobicity and consequently the additional functional groups can be described using ftir and xrd 33 luo et al synthesized a la oh 3 ws composite for the removal of phosphate ions 34 from the ftir analysis it can be observed that la oh 3 was successfully imbedded onto the surface of activated ws through the additional peaks that appeared in the ftir spectrum that were assigned to stretching vibrations of o h and la oh according to the xrd analysis ws has no characteristic absorption peaks indicating that ws is an amorphous substance however post functionalizing with la oh 3 the results showed that the phase was hexagonal in shape the way in which the adsorbent behaves when in contact with aqueous solutions highly depends on its point zero charge which can be measured using zeta potential analysis generally when the ph of the solution is above point zero charge the surface tends to be negatively charged conversely when ph of solution is below point zero charge the surface tends to become positively charged depending on target contaminant whether negatively or positively charged the surface chemistry can be controlled by altering the ph in order to enhance the adsorption process major adsorption mechanism plays a crucial role in such cases where it is dominated by electrostatic interactions between surface functional groups and target contaminant ashrafi et al reported the adsorption mechanism of pb2 ions onto modified ws was due to electrostatic interactions between positively charged lead ions and negatively charged functional groups coo and oh at ph values higher than the phzpc 35 4 overview of ws based adsorption studies the majority of ws studies follow the same pattern where the focus of study can be divided into three subdivisions the first section includes synthesis functionalization and characterization of ws the second area focuses on the adsorption process of organic compounds or heavy metal ions lastly the last area discusses the mechanism of adsorption and modeling of the behavior of contaminants towards the adsorbent nonetheless there still exists a need to fully comprehend the mechanism of adsorption towards ws and what are the major factors that influence the adsorption process for the purpose of this review paper 73 papers have been thoroughly examined and peer reviewed the established time frame for the papers to be selected in this study is between and including 2016 and 2021 target contaminants that have been studied in selected review papers can be broadly classified into two groups organic compounds and inorganic compounds most of the organic compounds studied are synthetic dyes with a major focus on methylene blue as a model for organic compounds a bubble plot has been developed on excel depicting all organic compounds utilized in this research and presented in fig 2 in total 29 different compounds have been examined 17 of which are synthetic dyes the second group of organic compounds focused on belong to emerging contaminants such as phenanthrene cephalexine and sulfamethozale antibiotics 12 22 polycyclic aromatic compounds such as naphthalene have also been studied 16 32 from fig 2 it is deduced that the molecular weight of most of the organic compounds studied fall within the range of 100 400 g mol heavy metal ions have also been a major focus in ws studies where the most studied element is pb fig 3 shows the number of studies that underwent the adsorption of heavy metals in total and it is evident that pb is in the lead with 7 papers followed by cu with 5 reported studies these studies are also presented in table s3 in the supplementary data file to further enhance the uptake capacity ws are further modified prior to experimental tests and as such a comparison between two experimental tests with two different modification techniques is difficile of the selected 73 papers 15 utilized ws as is with no further modification and a comparison between these tests is more practical a more detailed analysis is provided in the next sections supplementary data regarding those studies are presented in table s2 in the supplementary data file 5 ws preparation modification raw materials have limited ability to adsorb various contaminants especially in the field of water treatment thus in order to enhance the adsorption uptake or increase the affinity of target contaminant towards the adsorbent numerous measures have been employed to alter physiochemical properties of ws physical and chemical activation does not only improve physical chemical properties of the adsorbent but also expands the application of bio adsorbents to several fields outside the area of water treatment the enhancement can be observed in the increase of functional groups specific surface area and pore volume generally the modification of ws adsorbent normally undergoes a series of steps starting from the first stage of preparation in which raw ws is crushed to the desired size followed by a washing process with distilled water after which the material is dried at a temperature of 105 c overnight or for 24 h the next process is the activation process where chemical or physical activation is normally utilized then the carbonization procedure is performed during pyrolysis it can also be referred to as thermal treatment at an inert atmosphere where an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon flows at a predetermined flow rate and temperature in some cases pyrolysis is performed prior to the activation step finally the series of modifications ends with the functionalization process a detailed explanation of the activation and functionalization steps are provided in the sections to follow fig 4 provides a general idea of different methods of modification of ws available in the literature most of the research works is performed either through chemical activation or chemical modification impregnation in order to follow a path of less chemical usage and an environmentally friendly approach researchers are employing raw ws without any type of modification lastly physical activation is the least employed method of modification 5 1 physical activation physical activation is defined as the partial gasification of biomass using single or combination of gases such as steam air or carbon dioxide at predetermined conditions of temperature and gas flow rate 47 it is a two step process consisting of the carbonization step in a neutral atmosphere and then in the atmospheric oxidizing gases with increasing temperatures ranging from 800 to 1000 c 48 it has been reported that carbon dioxide yields a greater uniformity of pore structure and that the activation can be easily manipulated at temperatures around 800 c as activation is a slow reaction rate process 49 physical activation is performed before or after the pyrolysis step however in most cases it is performed after pyrolysis to further enhance the porosity of the biochar this method is an inexpensive method to yield activated carbon of high porosity and an environmentally friendly approach considering that it does not require the use of chemicals 50 however it is a time consuming and an energy intensive method 50 pazouki et al synthesized by co precipitation magnetic nanoparticle supported on ac from ws physical activation was performed using water vapor at 800 c 51 physical activation increased the oxidation resistance of supported magnetic particles a few studies have undergone the method of physical activation to activate ws and are listed in table 4 derdour et al prepared ac by physical activation with water vapor at different temperature to investigate the effect of the temperature on the char structure 52 contaminants removal increased with increasing activation temperature the optimum activation temperature reached is 900 c after which a decrease in adsorption capacity was observed roman et al experimented physical activation with air and carbon dioxide for the removal of fluoxetine and nicotinic acid 21 it was stated that the adsorption process is highly influenced by surface chemistry rather than the porous structure of the material maximum adsorption capacity reached for the removal of fluoxetine with air as the activating agent while for the removal of nicotinic acid the maximum adsorption capacity was reached with carbon dioxide activation carbon dioxide activation enhances surface basicity of the ac delocalizing basal plane electrons that provide a stronger π π interactions between the ac and nicotinic acid s aromatic rings 5 2 chemical activation chemical activation or wet oxidation involves the usage of chemicals at high temperatures 50 53 the starting material is usually a source of biomass that is a cellulose based material and is termed as an organic precursor there are various chemical agents used in the literature including phosphoric acid zinc chloride potassium hydroxide sodium hydroxide potassium carbonate and other emerging chemical activating agents chemical activation is a two step process the first step is the saturation of the raw material with oxidizing and highly dehydrating chemicals this step can be carried out via two methods which are the impregnation and physical mixing methods 53 impregnation involves the initial mixing of the precursor and the chemical activating agent in appropriate volumes this procedure is often performed in the presence of hydroxide agents and heated to a desired temperature until a brown colored sludge is developed after which the sample is then filtered and dried in physical mixing precursors are directly mixed with the activating agent in solid state in a furnace where activation occurs at temperatures ranging from 400 to 900 c carbonization or pyrolysis is the second step of the chemical activation process in some cases it is performed prior to the activation step finally the last step in the chemical activation procedure is the washing step this step is crucial as it removes chemical residues that occupy the porosity of the resulting ac 54 hence to further develop ac s porosity washing must be performed it is usually carried using acids or alkali agents depending on the chemical activator used followed by rinsing with water ac through chemical activation yields a more porous structure than ac formed through the physical activation process 55 chemical agents utilized in the chemical activation process are dehydrating agents thus they have the ability to alter pyrolytic decomposition by preventing the formation of tar increasing activated carbon content and in turn developing a highly porous structure of carbon material 56 moreover surface area is enhanced through the penetration of chemical activating agents into the carbon structure forming micropores in the process 55 it is more economical as it requires lower activation temperatures and it is less time consuming in contrast to physical activation processes that are energy intensive and time consuming however the disadvantage of employing chemical activation is the generation of chemical waste during the washing process to eliminate chemical residues post activation process chemical activation can either be performed on carbonized carbon or on ws or other source of biomass at its raw or pre carbonized state among chemical activators h3po4 and zncl2 can be performed on raw materials cellulose is known to be resistant to hydrolysis of acid thus allowing lignocellulosic materials to react with h3po4 53 a number of studies have performed chemical activation on ws using h3po4 30 36 40 57 60 zheng et al reported that activating with h3po4 results in a mesoporous surface on ac 40 sem images of a fresh ac exhibited an irregular clear pore structure from the xps survey spectrum p was detected due to the impregnation process major peaks from the ftir spectrum demonstrated the presence of aromatic rings carboxyl groups alkoxy groups hydroxyl groups all of which played a major role in the adsorption process through the π π interactions and interactions between phenanthrene studied contaminant and oxygen containing functional groups h3po4 combines chemically within the lignocellulosic structures it has been proposed that there exists a link between porosity enhancement and the formation of cross linked structures in the form of phosphate esters when h3po4 is used bayat et al reported the presence of a peak from the fitr analysis that belongs to p ooh or the p o c linkage 30 moreover according to the ftir analysis h3po4 promotes pyrolytic decomposition of the starting material leading to the elimination of some functional groups creating a more grid structure in the process ojo et al conveyed that h3po4 modification improved the surface functional groups of ws leading to broader functional groups including carbonyl and hydroxyl groups that are key players in the adsorption process 58 a study conducted by donald et al revealed that h3po4 requires low activation energy usually ranging from 400 to 500 c 61 activation using h3po4 occurs through the formation of cross linked phosphate esters that reach their thermal stability at temperatures between 400 and 500 c consequently activation at higher temperatures will result in the breakdown of these links causing contraction and hence reduction in porosity development alimohammadi et al investigated the removal of reactive red dye 198 using both batch isotherms and fixed bed columns 57 two chemical activating agents were investigated in the study koh and h3po4 the type of activating agent and impregnation ratio heavily impacted the shape of n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at high h3po4 impregnation ratios the bet surface area and mesoporosity increased drastically a list of studies that employed h3po4 for activation of ws are presented in table 5 as can be seen almost all research studies employed an activation temperature between 400 and 500 c koh has also been widely employed as an activation agent for ws 17 32 37 62 63 the mechanism of activation of an alkali metal proceeds through implantation of the metal within the carbon lattice where the metal acts an electron donor initiating the reaction during activation 50 therefore creating pores in ac through evaporation of koh from previously occupied spaces 64 the intercalation of the metal within the carbon matrix results in a stabilized expansion of spaces between layered carbon atoms enhancing the efficiency of the adsorbent 65 ming et al investigated the effects of carbonization temperature activation temperature and the impregnation ratio of koh to ws 17 it has been reported that increasing the carbonization and activation temperature from 500 to 700 c increases bet surface area and micropore volume percentage however at 800 c and above a decline of both bet surface area and micropore volume is observed the increase in bet surface area and micropore volume is attributed to the continuous evolution of volatile compounds from the precursor that allows for the development of the elementary pore structure of the char nonetheless at extreme temperatures excessive burn offs occur reducing the yield of ac as for the impregnation ratio bet surface area and micropore volume increase with koh ratio with an optimum ratio of 3 1 beyond which a decrease is detected wu et al reported that koh activation promotes pore development and expansion which is demonstrated in the sem images where it is revealed that koh activated ac has highly developed overall pores structure and rough surface with a uniform distribution of micropores over the surface 62 similarly alimohammadi et al investigated the effect of increasing the koh impregnation ratio on the chemical activation of ws 57 it was reported at high koh impregnation ratios the shape of the isotherm curve exhibited a typical type iv isotherm indicating a pore size distribution in the mesopore range the presence of koh at larger amounts caused stronger release of volatiles in the activation process thus converting micropores into mesopores it has been reported that activation with koh will result in a positively charged ac which is advantageous for the removal of negatively charged contaminants 66 shao et al successfully synthesized cu doped ws based ac cu ws ac for the removal of malachite green 67 in the presented study ws was mixed with cu ch3coo 2 h2o solution and carbonized at a temperature of 600 c after which chemical activation with koh took place the surface morphology of the adsorbent was characterized using sem a large number of dispersed cu particles are exposed on the surface of the adsorbent indicating the successful introduction of cu particles due to the surface complexation interaction that occurred between cu0 cu2 and the malachite cationic dye a high adsorption capacity of 2477 mg g was achieved table 6 presents studies that used koh for the activation of ws a comparison study between chemical activation with koh and h3po4 was performed by alimohammadi et al for the removal of reactive red dye 198 57 the study was performed with different impregnation ratios ranging from 1 to 3 5 the bet analysis demonstrated that the shape of n2 adsorption desorption isotherms is highly affected by the activating agent and the impregnation ration at lower impregnation ratios pore structure showed is mostly microporous however at higher impregnation ratios the structure shows a higher percentage of mesoporosity this phenomenon applied to both activating agents conversely acs exhibited reverse effects on the specific surface area when altering impregnation ratios sbet of the koh revealed an inverse relationship between sbet and impregnation ratio at high impregnation ratios lower sbet values were recorded h3po4 showed a direct relationship between impregnation ratios and sbet values h3po4 is known to inhibit the formation of tar that acts as barricade towards pore formation the sem analysis revealed that both acs have different structures koh ac displayed large holes with a honeycomb surface according to boehm titration samples activated with koh have more basic groups ftir analysis spectra was different for both acs where the main difference is the characteristic peak of c h aromatic stretching samples activated with h3po4 had carbonyl groups that are relatively intense koh activated samples had higher content of aromatic c h stretches similar to h3po4 zncl2 combines with raw biomass material and carbonized biomass and is also widely applied for the production of ac chemical activation transpires by the swelling effect of zncl2 where inter and intra voids materialize due to lateral bonds breaking in the cellulose molecules henceforth microporosity is developed through the interspaces between carbon layers induced by zncl2 50 in addition it has been reported that zncl2 acts as a lewis acid 68 in other words polymerization reactions occur due to aromatic condensation initiated by zncl2 that allows molecular hydrogen deformation from the hydroaromatic structure of the biomass and thereby creating active sites on adjacent molecules although zncl2 cultivates a highly porous and well developed ac it is not recommended by food and pharmaceutical companies due to it being a hazardous and a non environmentally friendly material various studies have undergone the zncl2 activation with promising results 12 13 69 72 teimouri et al reported the effect of carbonization time and atmosphere on the ac 70 it was stated that highest carbon yield obtained was at 30 min after which a decline in efficiency was observed furthermore it was reported during carbonization the rate controlling step of the gas solid reaction is the diffusion of co through the porous media the overall carbonization rate increases when increasing the gasification rate nazari et al also reported the investigation of chemically activated ws using zncl2 for the removal of cephalexin where the ac showed a highly porous structure where a remarkable yield of 41 3 was achived 13 li et al reported that due to zncl2 activation the structure of the ws precursor went from being a low porous structure to being a heterogenous surface filled with ledges and cavities with pores of different sizes and shapes 72 table 7 shows the performance and properties of ws based ac chemically activated with zncl2 it is noteworthy to mention that since zncl2 and h3po4 can react with raw ws the extra step needed to carbonize the precursor which is the case with other chemical activation agents is eliminated thus saving energy and time in the process potassium carbonate has also been used for the production of ac from ws 22 73 in contrast to koh and naoh k2co3 is not harmful if used in food and pharmaceutical supplements activation occurs as the potassium compound penetrates into the carbon matrix expanding and creating new pores in the process 74 wang et al performed a study with a two step activation using k2co3 73 activation was performed by mixing k2co3 with ws and then heated to a temperature of 600 c with a dwell time of 1 h the mixture was then heated again to temperature of 800 c for another 1 h resulting sem images displayed a heterogeneous surface with irregular cavities activated ws exhibited a high micropore content it was stated by ozcimen et al that porosity development is highly linked to the raw material of the ac 75 a higher cellulose content produces more micropores whereas higher lignin content produces more macropores ws is a material with high lignin content as such produced ac from ws is highly macroporous wang et al also noted that ac produced from one step activation yields a higher total pore volume than that by two step activation 73 teixeira also performed activation of ws using k2co3 for the removal of antibiotics 22 table 8 depicts the performance of studies present in the literature review that utilized k2co3 for the chemical activation step fig 5 shows chemical activating agents used for the preparation of ac from ws in the literature the most commonly used activating agents are zinc chloride and phosphoric acid the production of quality ac relies heavily on the operating parameters of the activation process xu et al reported that the porosity is heavily influenced by impregnation ratio and activation temperature and less influenced by activation time 76 prolonged activation time leads to a disordered arrangement and the formation of intermediates that may block pore or collapse part of pore walls an increase in the impregnation ratio results in an increase in porosity 77 nowicki et al illustrated the influence of the method of activation temperature of activation and heating mode on the reactivity of ws based adsorbents 78 the resulting activated carbons show that carbon chemically activated with koh have better textural properties than those physically activated with co2 as for temperature of activation the structural parameters increased with activation temperature regardless of method of activation in addition sorption capacities described by the iodine number demonstrated that samples chemically activated have the highest sorption capacities while physically activated samples were the least effective sorbents figs 6 and 7 represent bet surface area and total pore volume as a function of pyrolysis temperature it is observed that both entities increase with pyrolysis temperature up to a certain point after which a decreased is observed this is attributed to the fact that at increasingly high temperatures pyrolysis ceases to occur and the gasification process is initiated instead leading to the disruption of internal pores and a decrease in carbon yield surface area and total pore volume as such it is not recommended to perform pyrolysis at high temperatures in the case of ws roughly saying above 600 c table 9 provides a list of research works that used the chemical activation method for the activation process 5 3 chemical impregnation apart from chemical and physical activation chemical impregnation using different chemical compounds for the improvement of adsorption capacities is also commonly practiced among researchers various chemicals have been employed including maleic anhydride 83 different fatty acids 16 acetic acid 42 epichlorohydrin and alkaline solution 39 titanium and zinc oxide 84 triethylene tetramine 79 triethylamine 85 levulinic acid 81 isopropylidene malonate 35 and diethylenetriamine 86 kocaman successfully developed an environmentally friendly approach for the removal of methylene blue dye using wa modified with levulinic acid la 81 ws were mixed with 0 25 g of la in n hexane containing a few drops of sulfuric acid as the catalyst 81 the mixture was then refluxed at temperature of 65 c for 8 h the synthesized adsorbents proved to be efficient in the removal of methylene blue as the adsorption process turned out to be spontaneous with an adsorption capacity of 294 1 mg g faraji et al effectively introduced quaternary ammonium using epichlorohydrin and trimethylamine to ws 85 a decrease in the bet surface area and total pore volume was observed due to the presence of amine groups constricting pore channels on the surface of the adsorbent liu et al successfully grafted triethylene tetramine teta onto ws for the removal of pb2 ions from aqueous solution 79 results of the thermal gravimetric analyzer tg for both unmodified and modified ws show that the thermal stability enhanced significantly due to strong intermolecular bond energy induced by teta 79 table 10 provides a summary of research works on modified ws using different chemical compounds it is deduced that chemical modification provides adequate adsorption capacities however outstanding morphological properties are produced only through chemical or physical activation 4 surface areas sbet resulting from chemical activation have reached around 2000 m2 g which is similar to commercially available ac produced from ws as specific surface areas of commercially produced acs typically range from 500 to 2000 m2 g this proves that ws based adsorbents synthesized in the lab can compete against commercially available ones another method to enhance the adsorption capacity of agricultural waste is through introducing conductive polymers polyaniline is a prominent example of conductive polymers due to its biocompatibility 87 imghran et al recently created an environmentally friendly method for industrial wastewater treatment through the synthesis of polyaniline modified ws biocomposites via in situ chemical polymerization for the removal of orange dye g 87 6 effect of operating conditions the adsorption of contaminants using ws is extensively investigated in the literature under different operating conditions it was observed from the literature that the parameters that mostly influenced the adsorption process were found to be ph of the solution temperature initial concentration of target contaminant and contact time 6 1 the effect of ph recent peer reviewed papers indicate that adsorption capacity is highly influenced by ph of the solution adsorption can be affected significantly by the surface properties of the adsorbent consequently using raw ws or chemically modifying them will have a huge impact on the adsorption capacity when altering ph of the solution depending on the point zero charge potential pzc the surface of the adsorbent can be positively charged or protonation of functional groups on the active sites of the adsorbent occurs when ph of the solution is lower than the pzc or negatively charged or deprotonation of functional groups on the active sites of the adsorbent occurs when the ph of the solution is higher than pzc depending on the charge of the target contaminant either electrostatic repulsion occurs leading to a depletion in the adsorption uptake or electrostatic attraction is induced between the adsorbent and adsorbate leading to an increase in the adsorption uptake 89 almost one quarter of the ws studies have employed ws without prior activation or modification 43 44 90 104 for the removal of organic compounds similar results were reported where the adsorption process is strongly ph dependent miyah et al investigated the removal of three dyes of different net charges methylene blue crystal violet cationic dyes and methyl orange an anionic dye 102 the results demonstrated at acidic ph values ph range from 2 5 to 5 5 adsorption efficiency was low towards cationic dyes and high towards the anionic dye studies that investigated the removal of methylene blue reported maximum adsorption at high ph values ranging from 6 5 to 12 90 92 98 being a cationic dye electrostatic repulsion between methylene blue and positively charged adsorbent occurs at low ph values subsequently reducing the adsorption capacity the effect of altering the ph of solution on the removal of heavy metal ions has also been extensively investigated in the literature effect of influence of ph on cr iv adsorption was investigated by banerjee et al 44 the results showed a maximum adsorption capacity at ph 2 the reason being at low ph values hcro4 cr3o10 2 cr2o7 2 are present in the solution thus creating a positive impact on the adsorption capacity due to attractive forces between the negatively charged ions and the positively charged surface of the ws adsorbent similarly celebi et al evaluated the removal of lead ions using ws and maximum adsorption capacity was achieved at low ph values from 2 to 6 94 optimum ph value determined was 4 after which a decreased in adsorption capacity was observed an opposing finding has been reported by najam et al for the removal of cu ii zn ii and cd ii 97 all three divalent cationic metals prevailed an increase in adsorption capacity while increasing the ph of solution the adsorption of heavy metal ions is the result of the presence of functional groups such as ketones aldehydes amines phenols alcohols and carboxyl groups that are normally found on the surface of the ws these groups tend to protonate at lower ph values and hence uptake of metals is low faraji et al studied the influence of ph on the removal of phosphate ions 85 the results revealed that an increase in adsorption capacity from ph 4 to 6 after which a decrease in capacity was reported beyond ph 6 this is attributed to the fact that deprotonation occurs at high ph values resulting in a decline in the electrostatic interactions in turn reduction in the uptake of phosphorous ions overall it is concluded that the adsorption capacity is strongly influenced by ph of solution due to its influence on the surface charge of the adsorbent and the degree of ionization and speciation of the adsorbate 6 2 the effect of temperature many researchers have reported the increase in the adsorption capacity with temperature emphasizing the endothermic nature of the adsorption process using ws based adsorbents miyah et al reported that the adsorption capacity increased with increasing temperature 92 it was mentioned that the adsorption process is endothermic in nature and the increase in adsorption capacity is due to the increase in mobility of the adsorbate at higher temperatures for the removal of cationic heavy metal ions adsorption capacity increases with increasing temperature najam et al also investigated the influence of temperature on the removal of cu ii zn ii and cd ii it was reported that adsorption process is endothermic in nature and the resulting gibb s free energy is negative indicating that ws has high affinity towards heavy metal ions pazouki et al studied the effect of temperature ranging from 25 to 45 c for the removal of mercury and the results indicated that the removal efficiency increased with increasing temperature displaying an endothermic nature of the adsorption phenomenon 51 li et al also investigated the effect of temperature on two types of dyes congo red and methylene blue and the results implied that the removal of dyes is strongly affected by the temperature of the solution 72 both dyes exhibited the same outcome stating that the dye adsorption capacity increased with temperature the interpretation of the given result was that the diffusion of dyes within the adsorbent increases giving way to more incessant interactions between dye molecules and active sites on the surface of the adsorbent thermodynamic parameters are evaluated to study the effect of temperature on the adsorption behavior on ws based adsorbents these parameters include gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs many research works have assessed and reported the values of those parameters in the literature nazari et al reported negative δg values between 4 96 and 9 51 kj mol δh for the removal of cephalexin antibiotic 12 negative values indicate that a spontaneous physisorption took place and the increase in negative values with temperature is an indication of the degree of spontaneity with temperature the endothermic nature of the process was confirmed with the determined positive value of δh the outcome of this research has been supported by the work of other researchers where a negative δg value and a positive δh value were evaluated indicating a spontaneous and endothermic adsorption process 58 on the contrary zheng et al and lie et al reported negative δh values implying that the adsorption process is exothermic in nature and that adsorption decreases with temperature 32 40 in addition ozdemir et al investigated the effect of temperature on the adsorption of methylene blue on ws 104 it was reported that the adsorption efficiency decreased with increasing temperature 104 a similar finding was reported by tang et al stating that the adsorption is exothermic in nature 90 6 3 the effect of ionic strength it is well documented that ionic strength influences the adsorption process onto ws ionic salts are known to participate in mechanisms and interactions that involve target molecules in solution and adsorbent surface in addition to altering the charge of the adsorbent surface 105 from the literature two distinct phenomena are recorded that can describe the effect of ionic strength on the adsorption process onto ws based adsorbents the first effect depends on the electrostatic nature and configuration of the target contaminant second the increase in salt concentration can induce an effect that is termed as squeeze out effect where excess salts penetrate into the inner pores of the carbonaceous adsorbent repelling the interactions between the adsorbate and adsorbent 106 moreover positive ionic salts can neutralize the negative charge of both adsorbents and adsorbates weakening the electrostatic interactions between them thus decreasing the adsorption capacity 106 several studies reported that the presence of cations affected the adsorption capacity negatively miyah et al and tang et al recorded a decrease in adsorption efficiency for the removal of methylene blue in the presence of cations 90 102 methylene blue is a cationic dye and it is only natural for cationic ions such as na to compete against the cationic dye for active sites on the adsorbent resulting in a deficiency in methylene blue uptake a similar finding has also been reported by li et al for the removal of hexavalent chromium 86 the presence of salts in the solution resulted in a negative impact on the uptake of chromium where it is perceived that ions in the solution compete against cr vi for the adsorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent weakening the electrostatic attraction between the adsorbent and the chromium ions luo et al studied the effect of coexisting ions for the adsorption of phosphate using ws based adsorbent modified with lanthanum chloride and sodium hydroxide 34 anions tested include cl no3 co3 2 and so4 2 all of which had no significant impact on the adsorption capacity except for so4 2 ion which interfered with adsorption of phosphate 7 adsorption mechanisms the mechanism of adsorption onto activated ws can be generally classified into physical and chemical adsorption where each category is based on the nature of interactions and affinity of target contaminant towards various functional groups for instance chemical adsorption is mediated by chemical reaction or the bonding of adsorbate and functional groups imbedded on the surface of the adsorbent these types of interactions are profound and the adsorbent can undergo chemical changes which are irreversible and not favored for regeneration due to high energy requirement on the other hand physical adsorption is governed by the weak van der waals interactions between target contaminant and the adsorbent and the adsorbent does not undergo chemical changes other mechanisms for the adsorption onto ws based adsorbent include hydrogen bonding ion exchange and electrostatic interactions adsorption mechanisms are highly influenced by the characteristics of the adsorbate and the chemistry of the background solution uddin et al reported a low adsorption capacity at low ph values and high adsorption capacity at high ph values for the removal of methylene blue dye using raw ws 98 the major interaction responsible for the removal is electrostatic interactions between the cationic dye and the functional groups on the surface of the adsorbent ph values higher than pzc results in a negatively charged surface thus intensifying the attraction forces towards methylene blue methylene blue is a cationic dye and as such it is only natural an electrostatic attraction is induced between a positively charged entity and a negatively charged surface the influence of ph on the adsorption of alizarin yellow gg on carbonized ws based adsorbent has been investigated by kaya et al 107 in contrast to methylene blue dye alizarin yellow gg is an anionic dye hence maximum adsorption capacity was achieved at ph value of 3 due to the heightened electrostatic interactions between the anionic dye and the positively charged surface of the adsorbent to determine whether other interactions are involved in the adsorption process studies were carried out at pzc to eliminate the involvement of electrostatic interactions due to surface charge however turns out that electrostatic interactions are solely or majorly responsible of the adsorption of the anionic dye this is attributed to the fact that negatively charged particles are naturally attracted to negatively charged surfaces and positively charged particles are normally attracted to negatively charged surfaces 107 it is possible that the adsorption process is a result of synergetic effect of several interactions occurring simultaneously zhou et al stated that π π electron donor acceptor eda mechanism for the adsorption of methylene blue onto ws magnetized with double salt of ammonium ferrous sulfate ds ac 31 ds ac acted as an electron donor due to its high π electron density and methylene blue is a π electron acceptor henceforth inducing the π π electron donor acceptor interactions resulting in the adsorption of methylene blue moreover strong van der waals contributed to the adsorption process due to the interaction between sp2 hybridized carbon with high π electron density domain of ds ac and the π electron acceptor of the aromatic ring structure of methylene blue in addition to these mentioned interactions zhou et al proposed the presence of fe fe3c particles in addition to the hierarchically porous structure which collectively enhanced the electron transfer through fe fe3c particles to fe2 while the generated h from 2h h2o could accelerate the dissociation of methylene blue the mechanism is explained through chemical reactions 1 through 4 starting with the adsorption of methylene blue onto the surface of the material followed by the release of cl ions through the reaction of methylene with fe fe3 c species then the release of fe2 and active h due to the combination of ionic h and fe fe3c c particles finally decolorization reaction occurs 1 fe fe 3 c c mb σ cl σ fe fe 3 c c mb σ cl 2 fe fe 3 c c mb σ cl σ e fe fe 3 c c mb cl 3 fe fe 3 c c 2h h 2 o fe 2 2h 2oh 4 fe fe 3 c c mb h fe fe 3 fe c redox reaction products qiongfen et al was able to deduce from the adsorption isotherms and thermodynamic that the phosphine adsorption onto metal oxide modified ws ac mwac is chemical in nature 108 according to the thermodynamical equilibrium analysis ph3 will react with o2 to produce h3po4 and small amounts of p2o5 2 when the molar ratio of o2 to ph3 in the solution is 2 and above the presence of cuo loaded onto the mwac plays a major role in acting as an oxygen carrier in the ph3 adsorption oxidation process possible mechanisms proposed for the study are presented in chemical reactions 5 through 10 the adsorption oxidation process is initiated by the physical adsorption of ph3 and o2 onto the active site of the adsorbent as presented reactions 5 and 6 eqs 7 and 8 present the rapid reaction that occurs between the lattice oxygen of the active components on the surface and adsorbed ph3 species to form h3po4 and p2o5 the produced p2o5 species consequently react with water to form h3po4 as seen in reaction 9 finally reaction 10 depicts the adsorption of generated p2o5 and h3po4 onto the adsorbent it is noteworthy that the high adsorption capacity of ph3 is due to the combined effects of the large surface area 1419 m2 g in addition to the high oxidation activity of mwac adsorbent in ph3 adsorption oxidation to h3po4 and p2o5 5 ph 3 x ph 3 x 6 o 2 x o 2 x 7 ph 3 x 4 om h 3 po 4 x 4 m 8 4ph 3 x 16 om p 2 o 5 2 x 6h 2 o 16 m 9 p 2 o 5 2 x 6h 2 o h 3 po 4 x 10 2 m o 2 x 2om x π π interactions resulting from the alteration of the adsorbent s surface chemistry is a primary enhancement element in the adsorption process zheng et al investigated the adsorption mechanism of phenanthrene dissolved in surfactant polysorbate 80 tween 80 using ws chemically activated with h3po4 40 the results of the xps analysis confirmed the presence of oxygen containing functional groups which was further confirmed by the results obtained from boehm titration the π π bonding occurs between cc double bonds or benzene rings of both the adsorbent and phenanthrene molecules the occurrence of the π π interactions was verified through the ftir analysis of the spent adsorbent where a shift and enhancement of the intensity of cc stretching of aromatic rings was observed additionally π π transitions in the aromatic rings signify the existence of π electron on the surface of the adsorbent due to the adsorption of phenanthrene which further cements the crucial role of π π interactions in the adsorption process wang et al suggested a holistic approach for the adsorption of sulfamethoxazole onto activate ws that includes three types of mechanisms including dispersive interaction of π π electron coupling between the graphitic structure of the ac and the aromatic rings of sulfamethoxazole the electron donor acceptor interaction between phenol aromatic ring of the contaminant and the oxygen functional groups on the surface of the ac and the large sbet and pore size distribution 73 fig 8 provides a brief illustration of the adsorption mechanism of sulfamethoxazole onto modified ws in addition to electrostatic interactions ph also plays a key role in hydrogen bonding electron exchange and π π dispersion interactions in solution 109 luo et al proposed that the mechanism of phosphate onto la oh 3 nanorod ws biochar composite ln wb is a combination of electrostatic interactions surface precipitation and ligand exchange 34 maximum adsorption capacity occurred at high ph values where all three forms of mechanisms took place phosphate ions exchanged positions with oh and co3 2 ions through ligand exchange at low ph values adsorption capacity decreased as electrostatic interactions ceased to occur in addition to the deprotonation of la oh and the replacement of oh and co3 2 ions fig 9 provides a brief schematic diagram of the proposed adsorption process to conclude electrostatic interactions π π and π π eda interactions surface precipitation ligand exchange ions exchange are all important mechanisms for the adsorption onto ws based adsorbents therefore providing a good analysis of the mechanism acquires a thorough characterization of both the adsorbent and adsorbate in addition nature of the background solution needs to be taken into consideration given that ph is a major key role player in the adsorption process furthermore surface functional groups also take part in the mechanism adsorption and the uptake efficiency 8 modeling of adsorption on ws 8 1 adsorption isotherm modeling adsorption is a phenomenon that can be briefly described by the transfer of substances from mobile phase liquid or gaseous to a solid phase 110 111 thus in order to describe and predict the mobility of these substances adsorption isotherm curves are utilized essentially isotherm curves govern the retention of liquid gas adsorbates on solid adsorbents while varying initial concentrations of target contaminant at predetermined operating conditions 111 112 furthermore isotherm curves provide insights into the adsorbent s surface properties adsorption mechanism and the degree of affinity during the adsorption process there are several empirical models used however the focus will be on two commonly used isotherm models the langmuir and freundlich isotherms as they were adopted in various sorption studies in the literature to determine the maximum adsorption capacities and predict the type of adsorption mechanism the langmuir model is given by eq 11 113 11 q e q max b c e 1 b c e where qe is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium per unit weight of adsorbent mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate in the liquid phase mg l qmax and b are the langmuir constants and are referred to as the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and affinity parameter of the adsorption system equations are often linearized for ease of plotting and is given by eq 12 12 1 q e 1 b q max c e 1 q ma x the assumptions of employing the langmuir isotherm include a homogenous adsorption process in other words the model assumes the adsorbent has a uniform surface with equivalent adsorption sites as in each molecule has the same activation energy no lateral interactions between neighboring adsorbed molecules and no immigration of molecules on the surface of the adsorbent 115 the freundlich isotherm is expressed using eq 13 where kf is the freundlich parameter that expresses the amount adsorbed mg g l mg 1 n and n represents the adsorption strength 114 the value of 1 n ranges between 0 and 1 values below 1 imply chemisorption and values above 1 indicate a cooperative adsorption unlike langmuir isotherm freundlich models assumes a multilayer adsorption with uneven distribution of heat and affinities over a heterogeneous surface energies 89 this isotherm model is criticized for its inability to abide by henry s law at low concentrations of the target contaminant 116 the freundlich model is given by eq 13 13 q e k f c e 1 n the corresponding linear form is given by eq 14 14 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e table 11 provides both empirical isotherm models applied to adsorption data in studies available in the literature for the adsorption of different contaminants on the ws based adsorbents adsorption isotherms are useful tools for the prediction of the relationship between the uptake capacity of the adsorbent and its equilibrium concentration in the aqueous phase uddin et al applied three isotherm models including langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevitch to investigate the adsorption process of methylene blue onto powdered ws 98 studied models were plotted in order to investigate the linear plots parameters belonging to the isotherm models were determined from the slope and intercept it was deduced from the mathematical calculation of the experimental results that the langmuir isotherm was the best fitted model moreover it can be concluded from the langmuir model that the adsorption mechanism of methylene blue onto powered ws is chemisorption in nature hsini et al applied langmuir and freundlich isotherms to evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity and to have an insight into the distribution of cr vi onto the active sites of the adsorbent using two synthesized adsorbents arginine doped polyaniline arg pani wns ws and ws modified with polyaniline in the absence of arginine pani wns 117 the latter isotherm resulted in a better fit than the former with a higher correlation value of 0 9901 and 0 9913 for arg pani wns and pani wns respectively this finding suggests the cr vi adsorption follows a multilayer pattern on a heterogenous adsorbent surface for both adsorbents a new adsorption isotherm regional analysis model arian model introduced by samiey was employed in this study 118 119 arian model follows the assumption that the adsorption process constitutes of four distinct regions the first region satisfies henry s law at low concentration ranges where the adsorption capacity against adsorbate equilibrium concentration is linear plot the second phase represents the conventional langmuir isotherm or tempkin where adsorption occurs in the form of a monolayer on the surface of the adsorbent the third region corresponds to the formation of the second layer of adsorbates on the surface of the adsorbent where the analysis of the equilibrium data is performed using the bilayer isotherm the fourth and last region depicts the adsorption system reaching a saturation plateau including reverse desorption the adsorption data of the study did not comply with henry s law as the equilibrium data exhibited a non linear trend the equilibrium data showed a good compatibility with the second and third regions starting with concentrations 140 34 mg l and 118 12 mg l for pani wns and arg pani wns respectively finally the fourth region was not perceived as the equilibrium plateau was not reached this result translates that the adsorption of cr vi onto pani wns and arg pani wns portrays a multi region profile that demonstrates there are different binding sites due to amine and imine groups originating from pani and arginine on the surface of the adsorbent liu et al investigated four isotherm models langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich to evaluate the adsorption behavior of naphthalene on commercial activated ws 32 the results suggested the following order of best fitting according to r2 values fruendlich langmuir temkin dubinin radushkevich moreover freundlich parameters were calculated and it was determined that the adsorption of naphthalene onto activated ws was a favorable one considering 1 n value lies within the range 0 1 and 3 the findings also reveal that the freundlich constant kf decreased with temperature signifying that the adsorption of naphthalene is an exothermic process conversely kaya et al examined two isotherm models langmuir and freundlich models by varying the temperature for the adsorption of alizarin yellow gg dye on raw ws 107 linear plots of ce qe vs ce and ln qe vs ln ce were retrieved at three different temperatures 25 35 and 45 c the results displayed that the freundlich model has a better fit according to the r2 value the freundlich constant increased with temperature implying that the adsorption process is endothermic in nature and 1 n value indicated that the adsorption of alizarin yellow is favorable in all experimented temperatures 8 2 adsorption kinetic modeling adsorption equilibrium and kinetics are employed in the design and scale up of the adsorption systems the development of kinetics is highly dependent on the theoretical complexity of the adsorption mechanisms 120 121 experimental kinetic data is collected by varying contact time for the adsorption process various models have been developed to predict the uptake rate of the adsorption system where the pseudo first order and pseudo second order are the most commonly used models in liquid phase adsorption studies pseudo first order is proposed by lagergren for the adsorption of oxalic and malonic acid onto charcoal and is expressed as in eq 15 122 15 q t q e q e e k 1 t linearizing eq 15 yields eq 16 16 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t qe mg g and qt mg g parameters represent adsorption capacities at equilibrium and time t respectively and k1 represents the rate parameter 1 min pseudo first order is known to be valid after the system has been running for long periods of time when the adsorption system is nearing equilibrium and at the initial stage of the adsorption 123 this model is applied to interpret data at small time intervals pseudo second order is used for large intervals and it predicts that the adsorption rate is second order function with respect to available active sites 124 it is represented mathematically in the form of eq 17 17 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t eq 18 represented the linearized of pseudo second order model 18 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the rate parameter in g mg min these model parameters are empirical constants with no distinct significance as no research works have been implemented to identify their underlying physico chemical phenomena when model fitting is finalized 120 the purpose behind fitting these models into kinetic studies is merely to compliment the adsorbent evaluation there are other kinetic models used in the literature including the elovich equation and the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model the compatibility of each model relies on several key factors including the characteristics of the adsorbent and adsorbate and the operating conditions many research works demonstrated multilinear curves within a studied time frame which depicts that multiple mechanisms can occur simultaneously with a controlling mechanism such as intraparticle diffusion or the transport of the adsorbate to the external surface of the adsorbent li et al performed a kinetic and equilibrium study for the removal of reactive brilliant blue using ws modified with epichlorohydrin and alkaline solution of aspartic acid 39 the findings revealed that the adsorption obeyed the pseudo seconder model where the calculated qe deviated the least from the experimental one it is also shown that as the temperature increased the deviation gap decreased between qe calculated and the experimental value reaching complete compatibility between the two values moreover the initial adsorption rate increased with temperature and the time required to reach 50 of the adsorption capacity decreased with temperature proving that faster adsorption rates take place at higher temperatures naghiadeh et al modified ws using titanium oxide and zinc oxide for the removal of humic acid from aqueous solutions 84 pseudo first and pseudo second models were applied to experimental data at different initial concentrations and the adsorption process was best described by latter model in addition the correlation r2 for the pseudo second model was excessively higher for both adsorbents it was demonstrated that the adsorption capacity increased with an increase in the initial concentration of humic acid liu et al also applied pseudo first and second models to experimental data using amino modified ws for the removal of pb 2 ions 79 similarly pseudo second order model also gave the best fit with r2 equal to 0 999 data where fitted to the linear forms of the equations where the plot of the pseudo second model portrayed a perfect straight line suggesting an agreement between the experimental and model values it was also indicated that chemisorption is the rate limiting step of the adsorption process halysh et al studied the removal of methylene blue using ws modified with acetic acid and a mixture of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide 42 experimental data were applied to validate different kinetic equations including pseudo first and second order and the intraparticle diffusion model the most compatible model according to the magnitude of r2 and slight deviation of qe experimental from theoretical is pseudo second order model the resulting r2 value 0 873 of the intraparticle diffusion model indicates the adsorption of methylene blue onto modified ws is a multi step process consisting of the dye adsorption on the surface and pore interior diffusion luo et al developed a la oh 3 nanorod ws biochar for reclaiming phosphate 34 three kinetic models were applied pseudo first pseudo second and intraparticle diffusion models the kinetic parameters suggested that pseudo second order yields a better fit to describe the kinetics for phosphate removal moreover data were applied to the linear form of the intraparticle diffusion model where the fitting lines did not pass through the origin implying that the internal diffusion is not the rate limiting step the fitting curves were divided into two parts emphasizing that the adsorption of phosphate is a multistage process the parameters of the model indicated the rate of the first stage was greater the second step hsini et al evaluated the mass transfer mechanism of the adsorption process by applying experimental data to the intraparticle diffusion model for the removal of cr vi using arginine doped polyaniline ws 117 according to the model the adsorption process took place in three consecutive steps the first step involves the mobility of cr vi ions from the solution to the external surface of the adsorbent the second step slower than the former one and controlled by rate of diffusion constitutes of the penetration of cr vi into the internal surface of the adsorbent finally the third step consists of the final adsorption equilibrium phase li et al only applied the pseudo second order to study the kinetics of cr vi uptake using unmodified and modified ws with diethylenetriamine 86 non linear regressive analysis was applied to fit the experimental data and modified ws showed a better fit that the unmodified one considering that modified ws has higher sbet area and pore volume the results indicate that morphological properties of the adsorbent are also responsible for fast adsorption rates the results depicted that the initial reaction stage increased rapidly while the second stage showed a decrease in the reaction rate this is attributed to the fact that at initial stages of the reaction cr vi species occupy empty sites promptly during the second stage less active sites become available decelerating the reaction rate until equilibrium is reached it is safe to say that there is no distinct correlation between the validity of kinetic models and target contaminants whether organic compounds or heavy metal ions furthermore pseudo second order is preferred over other kinetic models given that it is the most applied model in adsorption studies found in the literature to determine adsorption rates and capacities of studied adsorbents kinetic models and their parameters for the adsorption of different contaminants on ws based adsorbents are presented in table 12 9 industrial applications of ws in addition to bench scale laboratory works ws have also been utilized in the industry schlumburger designed a produced water downflow filtration system employing ws media filtration 125 as the liquid passes through the ws bed oils and suspended solids are proficiently retained by the filter the filtration system has the ability to remove 95 99 suspended solids and 90 99 of hydrocarbons originating from produced water sea surface and freshwater sources providing discharge levels of 5 ppm and lower it is noteworthy that backwash process takes place using a specifically designed rotating media scrubbing agitator rather than chemicals moreover ws are utilized in the oil and gas industry as lost circulation material due to problems associated with drilling mud losses 126 due to the recent stringent environmental regulations nutshell filters are the next generation technology ws are used to remove oil and grease and suspended solids from a variety of chemical plants and oil fields with efficacy of 99 127 very limited information is available online and as such it is difficult to provide more data on ws with regards to its industrial application it is crucial that this information is available as it aids in solving current issues being faced in the industry and advancing current research works several research works involving the preparation of ws based adsorbents have been patented cao jiashun invented a method for preparation of a cationic adsorbent from ws to be used in the adsorption of anionic dyes from wastewater originating from the printing and dye industry this method involved the use of epoxychloropropane as the etherifying agent and diethylenetraiamine as the crosslinking agent the process was carried out in an alkaline environment introducing the amino group in a two step modification process 128 it was reported that the resulting adsorbent has the ability to adsorb anionic azo dyes reaching a capacity of 500 mg g which is 9 times the unmodified ws 128 wang dong invented a method to modify ws using koh for the removal of methylene blue 129 the invention constituted of a simple process which involved the step of hydrothermally carbonizing ws after which it was mixed koh solution in the final step koh modified ws was placed in a tube furnace at a temperature of 800 c for two hours 129 another ws based adsorbent has been invented by gao jingfeng for the removal of methylene blue 130 however the method used is completely different from the one mentioned above prior to the carbonization process ws were soaked in a 30 zncl2 solution as for the carbonization process microwave irradiation technique has been utilized on 480 630 w 130 the resulting adsorbent was washed with hcl until neutral conditions achieved 10 conclusions and future perspectives in this review the focus was on recent studies for the application of ws based adsorbents for the removal of contaminants from water ws have been employed for several industrial activities and more recently in the water treatment industry due to their unique properties and naturally imbedded functional groups they have been successfully employed for the removal organic compounds and heavy metal ions according to the literature ws have been used in four different methods raw chemically activated physically activated and chemical modified or impregnated with different chemical compounds results indicated that chemical activation stemmed morphological properties superior to all other modification processes resulting sbet values reached 2000 m2 g competing with commercially available ac it has been noted that pyrolysis temperature should not exceed 500 to 600 c as increasingly high temperatures will result in lower sbet and total pore volumes studies discussed in this review paper are mainly batch isotherm systems for evaluating the performance of different ws based adsorbents in addition to the morphological properties of the adsorbent other entities that affect the mechanism of adsorption are the physicochemical properties and characteristics of target contaminants and the acidic basic nature of the background solution chemistry ph temperature and ionic strength are also key players in the adsorption process electrostatic interactions are the solely responsible for the adsorption of charged contaminants where altering ph changes surface chemistry inducing either repulsive or attractive forces between the adsorbent and adsorbate in addition the effect of ph greatly depends on the protonation deprotonation of functional groups on the contaminant other mechanisms reported are π π interactions and molecular configuration including size aromaticity and functional groups are all viable contributors to the adsorption mechanism most studies reported the adsorption studies are endothermic in nature and spontaneous moreover most systems followed the freundlich isotherm model and the pseudo second order kinetic study structure of the ac can be altered according to target contaminant for instance creating a mesoporous structure will aid in contaminants with high molecular weight to navigate towards the adsorbent s micropores thus improving adsorption efficacy essentially laboratory data provided a valuable insight to the adsorption mechanisms onto ws based adsorbents nonetheless more studies are needed to be conducted on nonionic organic compounds in order to evaluate other adsorption mechanisms besides electrostatic interactions column based and regeneration studies are limited and more tests should be conducted in both areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

13221,agricultural based adsorbents have received an upsurge of interest in the water treatment industry especially in the area of adsorption they have been widely investigated as the next generation adsorbents due to their unique physio chemical properties and high affinity towards a wide variety of constituents ranging from organic compounds to heavy metal ions in addition agricultural based adsorbents are now a cheaper and sustainable option as opposed to non renewable and expensive adsorbents originating from coal polymers and petroleum residues among different agriculture wastes available walnut shells exhibit great potential as activated carbon precursor they have outstanding chemical stability high surface area and low ash content in this review walnut shell based adsorbents have been assessed in terms of their activation methods and preparation furthermore adsorbents resulting characteristics and factors influencing the adsorption capacity have been summarized and thoroughly analyzed it has been determined that the adsorption efficiency is heavily associated with the characteristics of the adsorbent including pore diameter surface area surface functional groups and the nature of the background solution including ph temperature and ionic strength this review identifies different activation methods reported in the literature including chemical and physical activation and chemical impregnation and functionalization the literature survey also entails a comprehensive discussion involving types of mechanisms and factors controlling adsorption behaviors towards targeted contaminants moreover a detailed analysis of adsorption isotherms and kinetics involved in the adsorption process is also included finally this review mentions future

zpa zeta potential analysis 1 introduction an economically feasible process of a large scale production of activated carbon ac from low cost precursors is primitively based on the abundance and availability of waste and by products commonly utilized feedstock for the production of ac includes coal wood peat polymers and petroleum residues all of which are non renewable and highly expensive 1 2 as a result many research works are headed towards the production of ac from sustainable alternatives such as agricultural waste including rice husk corn straw sludge and nuts among different agricultural based adsorbents the chemical composition of walnut shell ws exhibits great potential as a sustainable source of ac for the removal of target contaminants from aqueous solutions walnuts are produced from juglans regia l commonly known as the walnut tree and it is a native plant in central asia spreading through europe western china iran and afghanistan walnut production is the second largest nut production after almond nuts with a production over 3 7 million tons globally in 2019 3 the largest producer is china with an annual production of 1 06 million tons of walnuts followed by usa with a production around 600 tons and iran with a production close to 405 tons 4 ws make up 67 of the total weight of the fruit and they typically consist of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin 5 6 these agricultural wastes are normally discarded with no further use post cultivation or incinerated for heating purposes ws have proved effective in several applications including particle board industry they have been used as raw material for wood based particleboard which has been examined by pirayesh et al 7 embedding ws not only immensely improved the water resistance of the panels it also minimized the usage of virgin wood materials in turn saving natural resources during the industrial revolution the use of ws was initiated in more pressing applications such as the production of charcoal and activated carbon ac through pyrolysis 8 schroder et al experimented with different sources of biomass including ws rice wheat straw olive stones pistachio shells beech and hard coal 8 pyrolysis was performed at a temperature range of 500 600 c at a heating rate of 10 k min furthermore the biomass was activated through steam activation at temperatures between 800 and 900 c the results demonstrated that nut shells provide larger active surfaces than that of straw base materials signifying the presence of high amounts of carbon in nut shells and high ash content in straw base materials as of late ws are employed as precursors in the preparation of ac for the removal of hazardous materials from industrial wastewaters 9 13 hazardous contaminants commonly targeted in the experimental field include heavy metal ions and synthetic dyes however ac is the first adsorbent to be recognized and utilized in the industry for the removal of oil limited studies have been reported on the removal of oils using walnut based ac in the literature srinivasan et al reported that ws have a high affinity towards oils with uptake capacities ranging from 0 56 to 0 84 g g 14 however many reported the successful utilization of ws in the removal of organic compounds such as phenols methanol and polyaromatic compounds 15 17 generally nutshells have also been employed in its natural state without activation or further modification dias et al examined five different nutshells including walnuts hazelnuts peanuts pistachio and almonds shells for the removal of heavy metal ions 18 high efficiencies of 90 have been reported proving their ability in remediation of contaminated waters moreover ws have also used in enhanced removal of oil from oilfield wastewaters 19 employing raw biomass without further modification may not yield desired results due to their limited functionalities for example biomass prior to activation has relatively low pore properties inhibiting its ability to reach full capacity in the adsorption process thus there is an increasingly growing research interest in identifying new methods to improve chemical or physical properties of biochar pyrolysis temperature is one of many factors that can improve the yield of the resulting biochar demirbas et al studied the effect of temperature on pyrolysis products from four nut shells including hazelnut walnut almond and sunflower in a range of temperature between 500 and 1200 k in a cylindrical batch reactor 20 the results show that to maximize char yield a low temperature and heating rate is recommended increasing temperatures would only decrease char production chemical and physical activation also play major roles in the enhancement of properties of ws based adsorbents qiongfen et al prepared ws ac by chemical activation where the resulting surface area was 1636 m2 g competing with commercially available ones 17 walnut based adsorbents have been explored as the next generation adsorbents for the removal of emerging contaminants compounds that have been recently discovered including pharmaceutical drugs personal care products veterinary products herbicides food additives engineered nanomaterials and industrial compounds these contaminants have long existed in the environment however only recently their existence and effects are being identified latest studies show that ws have high affinity towards these contaminants 9 12 13 21 22 the adsorption efficiency of target contaminants by ws is maneuvered by several factors related to the type of the activation process of ws that is responsible for the creation of the pore structure and surface chemistry nature of the target compounds in addition to the chemistry of the water to be treated thus the aim of this review paper is to conduct a comprehensive review on peer reviewed articles on ws based adsorbents for the treatment of water or wastewaters the objectives are divided into two subcategories the first goal is to discuss the resulting properties of walnut shell based adsorbents with respect to different methods of enhancement including physical activation chemical activation and chemical impregnation the second goal is to examine and study the mechanisms and factors controlling the adsorption process of target contaminants onto ws based adsorbent for the purpose of this review paper target contaminants to be focused on can be broadly classified into heavy metal ions and organic compounds with a major focus on organic dyes 2 walnut shell chemical composition the lignocellulosic compounds account around 70 of the total biomass among different types of plant or wood biomasses 23 the main constituents of ws are very similar to that of wood biomass which include lignin cellulose hemicellulose and tannins that can be extracted and utilized to create other chemicals and materials 24 the elucidation of chemical components of ws is extremely difficult due to the presence of highly crosslinked polymeric structures in the shell since ws are used in a widespread of applications it is crucial to be able to identify its chemical components it has been reported that the approximate percentage chemical composition of ws consists of 50 3 lignin 22 4 hemicellulose 23 9 cellulose and 3 4 ash 25 however the percentage of each component can slightly vary depending on the source of the walnut plant genetics the environment where the plant was grown and processing conditions of the fruit fig 1 represents chemical composition of ws reported by different researchers in the literature reported ash and extracts percentages from different studies are similar with slight variations the chemical composition of ws are also presented in table s1 in the supplementary data file queiros et al characterized the shells of three different nuts in terms of their chemical and extract composition 4 all three nuts were produced in portugal and collected from different local supermarkets it was noted that ws contained 0 7 ash 10 6 total extractives 29 9 lignin and 49 7 polysaccharides detailed chemical compounds present in ws are presented in tables 1 and 2 ws composition differs from other nut shells in terms of hemicellulose where the contents are mainly xylans that are highly functionalized with acetyl groups and galacturonic acid overall ws can be characterized with high lignification sg lignin moderate content of polar extractives and low content of minerals 4 from table 2 it is noted that ws contain substantial amounts of calcium and potassium including magnesium and iron demirbas et al studied the effect of temperature on pyrolysis products from four different types of biomasses 20 biomasses experimented in the study originate from hazelnut walnut almond and sunflower zhai et al reported results of gc ms analysis of pyroligneous acids extracted from ws 26 main components included dominating compounds organic acids and phenols in addition to ketones aldehydes alcohols esters benzene and its derivatives and sugar and its derivatives similar results of ws pyroligneous acid have also been reported by jahanban esfahlan et al 24 another study reported the extraction and characterization of lignin compounds present in ws using gc ms and h nmr techniques 27 major compounds identified in this study include guaiacol 4 methylguaiacol 4 ethylguaiacol 4 propylguaiacol syringol 4 methylsyringol 4 ethylsyringol and 4 propylsyringol 3 characterization of walnut shell ws based adsorbents need to be thoroughly characterized before and after adsorption in order to have an insight into their distinctive properties and be able to identify the type of adsorption mechanism that takes place at the surface of the adsorbent adsorption of contaminants onto the adsorbent is a consequence of both surface chemistry and adsorbent morphology ws based adsorbents have been the subject of numerous adsorption studies especially for the removal of heavy metal ions furthermore they have been extensively tested for the removal of organic compounds where dye methylene blue has been commonly utilized as a model representation crucial chemical properties to be characterized include surface chemistry charge polarity and purity of the final effluent the morphology of the adsorbent includes specific surface area total pore volume pore size distribution texture and structural geometry principle techniques responsible for characterization that are commonly utilized according to the literature include brunauer emmett teller bet scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared ftir n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k and zeta potential analysis considering that ws based adsorbents are activated and functionalized using different techniques and functional groups it is highly likely that the specific surface area pore volume and average pore size will vary significantly most common characteristics reported in the literature are tabulated and presented in table 3 the bet technique is used to identify the specific surface area and the total pore volume can be calculated from the adsorbed volume of nitrogen near the saturation point p p0 the average pore size distribution is commonly obtained according to the method derived from barret joyner and halenda bjh 28 ashrafi et al removed brilliant green and congo red dyes from aqueous solution using ws modified with naoh 29 the modified ws adsorbent showed in increase in the specific surface area by a factor of 2 3 zhou et al used commercial activated carbon derived from ws for the removal of diazinon pesticide from aqueous solutions 30 the activated carbon was further modified with phosphoric acid to increase adsorption efficiency 30 the morphology of the adsorbent largely improved with an increase in specific surface area from 1076 to 1434 m2 g and a decrease in average pore diameter and total pore volume from 3 23 to 2 08 nm and 0 86 to 0 74 m3 g respectively li et al successfully introduced aspartic acid onto the surface of ws morphically enhancing the characteristics of ws where all three characteristics specific surface area total pore volume and average pore diameter increased from 1 04 to 2 33 m2 g 3 13 to 12 18 m3 g and 12 09 to 20 92 nm respectively zhou et al also reported an increase in specific surface area and total pore volume post functionalization of ws based adsorbent however average pore diameter remained the same 31 chunli et al reported that the porosity of the ws adsorbent massively improved through hydrothermal carbonization from 2 to 84 m2 g 10 according to pore size analysis the average pore size diameter of activated ws is located within the mesopore range 32 sem ftir and xrd all of which can provide further morphological characteristics of ws sem delivers an insight into the structure shape and surface of the ws based adsorbent the addition of functional groups onto the surface of the adsorbent can alter the chemistry of the surface by changing its hydrophobicity and consequently the additional functional groups can be described using ftir and xrd 33 luo et al synthesized a la oh 3 ws composite for the removal of phosphate ions 34 from the ftir analysis it can be observed that la oh 3 was successfully imbedded onto the surface of activated ws through the additional peaks that appeared in the ftir spectrum that were assigned to stretching vibrations of o h and la oh according to the xrd analysis ws has no characteristic absorption peaks indicating that ws is an amorphous substance however post functionalizing with la oh 3 the results showed that the phase was hexagonal in shape the way in which the adsorbent behaves when in contact with aqueous solutions highly depends on its point zero charge which can be measured using zeta potential analysis generally when the ph of the solution is above point zero charge the surface tends to be negatively charged conversely when ph of solution is below point zero charge the surface tends to become positively charged depending on target contaminant whether negatively or positively charged the surface chemistry can be controlled by altering the ph in order to enhance the adsorption process major adsorption mechanism plays a crucial role in such cases where it is dominated by electrostatic interactions between surface functional groups and target contaminant ashrafi et al reported the adsorption mechanism of pb2 ions onto modified ws was due to electrostatic interactions between positively charged lead ions and negatively charged functional groups coo and oh at ph values higher than the phzpc 35 4 overview of ws based adsorption studies the majority of ws studies follow the same pattern where the focus of study can be divided into three subdivisions the first section includes synthesis functionalization and characterization of ws the second area focuses on the adsorption process of organic compounds or heavy metal ions lastly the last area discusses the mechanism of adsorption and modeling of the behavior of contaminants towards the adsorbent nonetheless there still exists a need to fully comprehend the mechanism of adsorption towards ws and what are the major factors that influence the adsorption process for the purpose of this review paper 73 papers have been thoroughly examined and peer reviewed the established time frame for the papers to be selected in this study is between and including 2016 and 2021 target contaminants that have been studied in selected review papers can be broadly classified into two groups organic compounds and inorganic compounds most of the organic compounds studied are synthetic dyes with a major focus on methylene blue as a model for organic compounds a bubble plot has been developed on excel depicting all organic compounds utilized in this research and presented in fig 2 in total 29 different compounds have been examined 17 of which are synthetic dyes the second group of organic compounds focused on belong to emerging contaminants such as phenanthrene cephalexine and sulfamethozale antibiotics 12 22 polycyclic aromatic compounds such as naphthalene have also been studied 16 32 from fig 2 it is deduced that the molecular weight of most of the organic compounds studied fall within the range of 100 400 g mol heavy metal ions have also been a major focus in ws studies where the most studied element is pb fig 3 shows the number of studies that underwent the adsorption of heavy metals in total and it is evident that pb is in the lead with 7 papers followed by cu with 5 reported studies these studies are also presented in table s3 in the supplementary data file to further enhance the uptake capacity ws are further modified prior to experimental tests and as such a comparison between two experimental tests with two different modification techniques is difficile of the selected 73 papers 15 utilized ws as is with no further modification and a comparison between these tests is more practical a more detailed analysis is provided in the next sections supplementary data regarding those studies are presented in table s2 in the supplementary data file 5 ws preparation modification raw materials have limited ability to adsorb various contaminants especially in the field of water treatment thus in order to enhance the adsorption uptake or increase the affinity of target contaminant towards the adsorbent numerous measures have been employed to alter physiochemical properties of ws physical and chemical activation does not only improve physical chemical properties of the adsorbent but also expands the application of bio adsorbents to several fields outside the area of water treatment the enhancement can be observed in the increase of functional groups specific surface area and pore volume generally the modification of ws adsorbent normally undergoes a series of steps starting from the first stage of preparation in which raw ws is crushed to the desired size followed by a washing process with distilled water after which the material is dried at a temperature of 105 c overnight or for 24 h the next process is the activation process where chemical or physical activation is normally utilized then the carbonization procedure is performed during pyrolysis it can also be referred to as thermal treatment at an inert atmosphere where an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon flows at a predetermined flow rate and temperature in some cases pyrolysis is performed prior to the activation step finally the series of modifications ends with the functionalization process a detailed explanation of the activation and functionalization steps are provided in the sections to follow fig 4 provides a general idea of different methods of modification of ws available in the literature most of the research works is performed either through chemical activation or chemical modification impregnation in order to follow a path of less chemical usage and an environmentally friendly approach researchers are employing raw ws without any type of modification lastly physical activation is the least employed method of modification 5 1 physical activation physical activation is defined as the partial gasification of biomass using single or combination of gases such as steam air or carbon dioxide at predetermined conditions of temperature and gas flow rate 47 it is a two step process consisting of the carbonization step in a neutral atmosphere and then in the atmospheric oxidizing gases with increasing temperatures ranging from 800 to 1000 c 48 it has been reported that carbon dioxide yields a greater uniformity of pore structure and that the activation can be easily manipulated at temperatures around 800 c as activation is a slow reaction rate process 49 physical activation is performed before or after the pyrolysis step however in most cases it is performed after pyrolysis to further enhance the porosity of the biochar this method is an inexpensive method to yield activated carbon of high porosity and an environmentally friendly approach considering that it does not require the use of chemicals 50 however it is a time consuming and an energy intensive method 50 pazouki et al synthesized by co precipitation magnetic nanoparticle supported on ac from ws physical activation was performed using water vapor at 800 c 51 physical activation increased the oxidation resistance of supported magnetic particles a few studies have undergone the method of physical activation to activate ws and are listed in table 4 derdour et al prepared ac by physical activation with water vapor at different temperature to investigate the effect of the temperature on the char structure 52 contaminants removal increased with increasing activation temperature the optimum activation temperature reached is 900 c after which a decrease in adsorption capacity was observed roman et al experimented physical activation with air and carbon dioxide for the removal of fluoxetine and nicotinic acid 21 it was stated that the adsorption process is highly influenced by surface chemistry rather than the porous structure of the material maximum adsorption capacity reached for the removal of fluoxetine with air as the activating agent while for the removal of nicotinic acid the maximum adsorption capacity was reached with carbon dioxide activation carbon dioxide activation enhances surface basicity of the ac delocalizing basal plane electrons that provide a stronger π π interactions between the ac and nicotinic acid s aromatic rings 5 2 chemical activation chemical activation or wet oxidation involves the usage of chemicals at high temperatures 50 53 the starting material is usually a source of biomass that is a cellulose based material and is termed as an organic precursor there are various chemical agents used in the literature including phosphoric acid zinc chloride potassium hydroxide sodium hydroxide potassium carbonate and other emerging chemical activating agents chemical activation is a two step process the first step is the saturation of the raw material with oxidizing and highly dehydrating chemicals this step can be carried out via two methods which are the impregnation and physical mixing methods 53 impregnation involves the initial mixing of the precursor and the chemical activating agent in appropriate volumes this procedure is often performed in the presence of hydroxide agents and heated to a desired temperature until a brown colored sludge is developed after which the sample is then filtered and dried in physical mixing precursors are directly mixed with the activating agent in solid state in a furnace where activation occurs at temperatures ranging from 400 to 900 c carbonization or pyrolysis is the second step of the chemical activation process in some cases it is performed prior to the activation step finally the last step in the chemical activation procedure is the washing step this step is crucial as it removes chemical residues that occupy the porosity of the resulting ac 54 hence to further develop ac s porosity washing must be performed it is usually carried using acids or alkali agents depending on the chemical activator used followed by rinsing with water ac through chemical activation yields a more porous structure than ac formed through the physical activation process 55 chemical agents utilized in the chemical activation process are dehydrating agents thus they have the ability to alter pyrolytic decomposition by preventing the formation of tar increasing activated carbon content and in turn developing a highly porous structure of carbon material 56 moreover surface area is enhanced through the penetration of chemical activating agents into the carbon structure forming micropores in the process 55 it is more economical as it requires lower activation temperatures and it is less time consuming in contrast to physical activation processes that are energy intensive and time consuming however the disadvantage of employing chemical activation is the generation of chemical waste during the washing process to eliminate chemical residues post activation process chemical activation can either be performed on carbonized carbon or on ws or other source of biomass at its raw or pre carbonized state among chemical activators h3po4 and zncl2 can be performed on raw materials cellulose is known to be resistant to hydrolysis of acid thus allowing lignocellulosic materials to react with h3po4 53 a number of studies have performed chemical activation on ws using h3po4 30 36 40 57 60 zheng et al reported that activating with h3po4 results in a mesoporous surface on ac 40 sem images of a fresh ac exhibited an irregular clear pore structure from the xps survey spectrum p was detected due to the impregnation process major peaks from the ftir spectrum demonstrated the presence of aromatic rings carboxyl groups alkoxy groups hydroxyl groups all of which played a major role in the adsorption process through the π π interactions and interactions between phenanthrene studied contaminant and oxygen containing functional groups h3po4 combines chemically within the lignocellulosic structures it has been proposed that there exists a link between porosity enhancement and the formation of cross linked structures in the form of phosphate esters when h3po4 is used bayat et al reported the presence of a peak from the fitr analysis that belongs to p ooh or the p o c linkage 30 moreover according to the ftir analysis h3po4 promotes pyrolytic decomposition of the starting material leading to the elimination of some functional groups creating a more grid structure in the process ojo et al conveyed that h3po4 modification improved the surface functional groups of ws leading to broader functional groups including carbonyl and hydroxyl groups that are key players in the adsorption process 58 a study conducted by donald et al revealed that h3po4 requires low activation energy usually ranging from 400 to 500 c 61 activation using h3po4 occurs through the formation of cross linked phosphate esters that reach their thermal stability at temperatures between 400 and 500 c consequently activation at higher temperatures will result in the breakdown of these links causing contraction and hence reduction in porosity development alimohammadi et al investigated the removal of reactive red dye 198 using both batch isotherms and fixed bed columns 57 two chemical activating agents were investigated in the study koh and h3po4 the type of activating agent and impregnation ratio heavily impacted the shape of n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at high h3po4 impregnation ratios the bet surface area and mesoporosity increased drastically a list of studies that employed h3po4 for activation of ws are presented in table 5 as can be seen almost all research studies employed an activation temperature between 400 and 500 c koh has also been widely employed as an activation agent for ws 17 32 37 62 63 the mechanism of activation of an alkali metal proceeds through implantation of the metal within the carbon lattice where the metal acts an electron donor initiating the reaction during activation 50 therefore creating pores in ac through evaporation of koh from previously occupied spaces 64 the intercalation of the metal within the carbon matrix results in a stabilized expansion of spaces between layered carbon atoms enhancing the efficiency of the adsorbent 65 ming et al investigated the effects of carbonization temperature activation temperature and the impregnation ratio of koh to ws 17 it has been reported that increasing the carbonization and activation temperature from 500 to 700 c increases bet surface area and micropore volume percentage however at 800 c and above a decline of both bet surface area and micropore volume is observed the increase in bet surface area and micropore volume is attributed to the continuous evolution of volatile compounds from the precursor that allows for the development of the elementary pore structure of the char nonetheless at extreme temperatures excessive burn offs occur reducing the yield of ac as for the impregnation ratio bet surface area and micropore volume increase with koh ratio with an optimum ratio of 3 1 beyond which a decrease is detected wu et al reported that koh activation promotes pore development and expansion which is demonstrated in the sem images where it is revealed that koh activated ac has highly developed overall pores structure and rough surface with a uniform distribution of micropores over the surface 62 similarly alimohammadi et al investigated the effect of increasing the koh impregnation ratio on the chemical activation of ws 57 it was reported at high koh impregnation ratios the shape of the isotherm curve exhibited a typical type iv isotherm indicating a pore size distribution in the mesopore range the presence of koh at larger amounts caused stronger release of volatiles in the activation process thus converting micropores into mesopores it has been reported that activation with koh will result in a positively charged ac which is advantageous for the removal of negatively charged contaminants 66 shao et al successfully synthesized cu doped ws based ac cu ws ac for the removal of malachite green 67 in the presented study ws was mixed with cu ch3coo 2 h2o solution and carbonized at a temperature of 600 c after which chemical activation with koh took place the surface morphology of the adsorbent was characterized using sem a large number of dispersed cu particles are exposed on the surface of the adsorbent indicating the successful introduction of cu particles due to the surface complexation interaction that occurred between cu0 cu2 and the malachite cationic dye a high adsorption capacity of 2477 mg g was achieved table 6 presents studies that used koh for the activation of ws a comparison study between chemical activation with koh and h3po4 was performed by alimohammadi et al for the removal of reactive red dye 198 57 the study was performed with different impregnation ratios ranging from 1 to 3 5 the bet analysis demonstrated that the shape of n2 adsorption desorption isotherms is highly affected by the activating agent and the impregnation ration at lower impregnation ratios pore structure showed is mostly microporous however at higher impregnation ratios the structure shows a higher percentage of mesoporosity this phenomenon applied to both activating agents conversely acs exhibited reverse effects on the specific surface area when altering impregnation ratios sbet of the koh revealed an inverse relationship between sbet and impregnation ratio at high impregnation ratios lower sbet values were recorded h3po4 showed a direct relationship between impregnation ratios and sbet values h3po4 is known to inhibit the formation of tar that acts as barricade towards pore formation the sem analysis revealed that both acs have different structures koh ac displayed large holes with a honeycomb surface according to boehm titration samples activated with koh have more basic groups ftir analysis spectra was different for both acs where the main difference is the characteristic peak of c h aromatic stretching samples activated with h3po4 had carbonyl groups that are relatively intense koh activated samples had higher content of aromatic c h stretches similar to h3po4 zncl2 combines with raw biomass material and carbonized biomass and is also widely applied for the production of ac chemical activation transpires by the swelling effect of zncl2 where inter and intra voids materialize due to lateral bonds breaking in the cellulose molecules henceforth microporosity is developed through the interspaces between carbon layers induced by zncl2 50 in addition it has been reported that zncl2 acts as a lewis acid 68 in other words polymerization reactions occur due to aromatic condensation initiated by zncl2 that allows molecular hydrogen deformation from the hydroaromatic structure of the biomass and thereby creating active sites on adjacent molecules although zncl2 cultivates a highly porous and well developed ac it is not recommended by food and pharmaceutical companies due to it being a hazardous and a non environmentally friendly material various studies have undergone the zncl2 activation with promising results 12 13 69 72 teimouri et al reported the effect of carbonization time and atmosphere on the ac 70 it was stated that highest carbon yield obtained was at 30 min after which a decline in efficiency was observed furthermore it was reported during carbonization the rate controlling step of the gas solid reaction is the diffusion of co through the porous media the overall carbonization rate increases when increasing the gasification rate nazari et al also reported the investigation of chemically activated ws using zncl2 for the removal of cephalexin where the ac showed a highly porous structure where a remarkable yield of 41 3 was achived 13 li et al reported that due to zncl2 activation the structure of the ws precursor went from being a low porous structure to being a heterogenous surface filled with ledges and cavities with pores of different sizes and shapes 72 table 7 shows the performance and properties of ws based ac chemically activated with zncl2 it is noteworthy to mention that since zncl2 and h3po4 can react with raw ws the extra step needed to carbonize the precursor which is the case with other chemical activation agents is eliminated thus saving energy and time in the process potassium carbonate has also been used for the production of ac from ws 22 73 in contrast to koh and naoh k2co3 is not harmful if used in food and pharmaceutical supplements activation occurs as the potassium compound penetrates into the carbon matrix expanding and creating new pores in the process 74 wang et al performed a study with a two step activation using k2co3 73 activation was performed by mixing k2co3 with ws and then heated to a temperature of 600 c with a dwell time of 1 h the mixture was then heated again to temperature of 800 c for another 1 h resulting sem images displayed a heterogeneous surface with irregular cavities activated ws exhibited a high micropore content it was stated by ozcimen et al that porosity development is highly linked to the raw material of the ac 75 a higher cellulose content produces more micropores whereas higher lignin content produces more macropores ws is a material with high lignin content as such produced ac from ws is highly macroporous wang et al also noted that ac produced from one step activation yields a higher total pore volume than that by two step activation 73 teixeira also performed activation of ws using k2co3 for the removal of antibiotics 22 table 8 depicts the performance of studies present in the literature review that utilized k2co3 for the chemical activation step fig 5 shows chemical activating agents used for the preparation of ac from ws in the literature the most commonly used activating agents are zinc chloride and phosphoric acid the production of quality ac relies heavily on the operating parameters of the activation process xu et al reported that the porosity is heavily influenced by impregnation ratio and activation temperature and less influenced by activation time 76 prolonged activation time leads to a disordered arrangement and the formation of intermediates that may block pore or collapse part of pore walls an increase in the impregnation ratio results in an increase in porosity 77 nowicki et al illustrated the influence of the method of activation temperature of activation and heating mode on the reactivity of ws based adsorbents 78 the resulting activated carbons show that carbon chemically activated with koh have better textural properties than those physically activated with co2 as for temperature of activation the structural parameters increased with activation temperature regardless of method of activation in addition sorption capacities described by the iodine number demonstrated that samples chemically activated have the highest sorption capacities while physically activated samples were the least effective sorbents figs 6 and 7 represent bet surface area and total pore volume as a function of pyrolysis temperature it is observed that both entities increase with pyrolysis temperature up to a certain point after which a decreased is observed this is attributed to the fact that at increasingly high temperatures pyrolysis ceases to occur and the gasification process is initiated instead leading to the disruption of internal pores and a decrease in carbon yield surface area and total pore volume as such it is not recommended to perform pyrolysis at high temperatures in the case of ws roughly saying above 600 c table 9 provides a list of research works that used the chemical activation method for the activation process 5 3 chemical impregnation apart from chemical and physical activation chemical impregnation using different chemical compounds for the improvement of adsorption capacities is also commonly practiced among researchers various chemicals have been employed including maleic anhydride 83 different fatty acids 16 acetic acid 42 epichlorohydrin and alkaline solution 39 titanium and zinc oxide 84 triethylene tetramine 79 triethylamine 85 levulinic acid 81 isopropylidene malonate 35 and diethylenetriamine 86 kocaman successfully developed an environmentally friendly approach for the removal of methylene blue dye using wa modified with levulinic acid la 81 ws were mixed with 0 25 g of la in n hexane containing a few drops of sulfuric acid as the catalyst 81 the mixture was then refluxed at temperature of 65 c for 8 h the synthesized adsorbents proved to be efficient in the removal of methylene blue as the adsorption process turned out to be spontaneous with an adsorption capacity of 294 1 mg g faraji et al effectively introduced quaternary ammonium using epichlorohydrin and trimethylamine to ws 85 a decrease in the bet surface area and total pore volume was observed due to the presence of amine groups constricting pore channels on the surface of the adsorbent liu et al successfully grafted triethylene tetramine teta onto ws for the removal of pb2 ions from aqueous solution 79 results of the thermal gravimetric analyzer tg for both unmodified and modified ws show that the thermal stability enhanced significantly due to strong intermolecular bond energy induced by teta 79 table 10 provides a summary of research works on modified ws using different chemical compounds it is deduced that chemical modification provides adequate adsorption capacities however outstanding morphological properties are produced only through chemical or physical activation 4 surface areas sbet resulting from chemical activation have reached around 2000 m2 g which is similar to commercially available ac produced from ws as specific surface areas of commercially produced acs typically range from 500 to 2000 m2 g this proves that ws based adsorbents synthesized in the lab can compete against commercially available ones another method to enhance the adsorption capacity of agricultural waste is through introducing conductive polymers polyaniline is a prominent example of conductive polymers due to its biocompatibility 87 imghran et al recently created an environmentally friendly method for industrial wastewater treatment through the synthesis of polyaniline modified ws biocomposites via in situ chemical polymerization for the removal of orange dye g 87 6 effect of operating conditions the adsorption of contaminants using ws is extensively investigated in the literature under different operating conditions it was observed from the literature that the parameters that mostly influenced the adsorption process were found to be ph of the solution temperature initial concentration of target contaminant and contact time 6 1 the effect of ph recent peer reviewed papers indicate that adsorption capacity is highly influenced by ph of the solution adsorption can be affected significantly by the surface properties of the adsorbent consequently using raw ws or chemically modifying them will have a huge impact on the adsorption capacity when altering ph of the solution depending on the point zero charge potential pzc the surface of the adsorbent can be positively charged or protonation of functional groups on the active sites of the adsorbent occurs when ph of the solution is lower than the pzc or negatively charged or deprotonation of functional groups on the active sites of the adsorbent occurs when the ph of the solution is higher than pzc depending on the charge of the target contaminant either electrostatic repulsion occurs leading to a depletion in the adsorption uptake or electrostatic attraction is induced between the adsorbent and adsorbate leading to an increase in the adsorption uptake 89 almost one quarter of the ws studies have employed ws without prior activation or modification 43 44 90 104 for the removal of organic compounds similar results were reported where the adsorption process is strongly ph dependent miyah et al investigated the removal of three dyes of different net charges methylene blue crystal violet cationic dyes and methyl orange an anionic dye 102 the results demonstrated at acidic ph values ph range from 2 5 to 5 5 adsorption efficiency was low towards cationic dyes and high towards the anionic dye studies that investigated the removal of methylene blue reported maximum adsorption at high ph values ranging from 6 5 to 12 90 92 98 being a cationic dye electrostatic repulsion between methylene blue and positively charged adsorbent occurs at low ph values subsequently reducing the adsorption capacity the effect of altering the ph of solution on the removal of heavy metal ions has also been extensively investigated in the literature effect of influence of ph on cr iv adsorption was investigated by banerjee et al 44 the results showed a maximum adsorption capacity at ph 2 the reason being at low ph values hcro4 cr3o10 2 cr2o7 2 are present in the solution thus creating a positive impact on the adsorption capacity due to attractive forces between the negatively charged ions and the positively charged surface of the ws adsorbent similarly celebi et al evaluated the removal of lead ions using ws and maximum adsorption capacity was achieved at low ph values from 2 to 6 94 optimum ph value determined was 4 after which a decreased in adsorption capacity was observed an opposing finding has been reported by najam et al for the removal of cu ii zn ii and cd ii 97 all three divalent cationic metals prevailed an increase in adsorption capacity while increasing the ph of solution the adsorption of heavy metal ions is the result of the presence of functional groups such as ketones aldehydes amines phenols alcohols and carboxyl groups that are normally found on the surface of the ws these groups tend to protonate at lower ph values and hence uptake of metals is low faraji et al studied the influence of ph on the removal of phosphate ions 85 the results revealed that an increase in adsorption capacity from ph 4 to 6 after which a decrease in capacity was reported beyond ph 6 this is attributed to the fact that deprotonation occurs at high ph values resulting in a decline in the electrostatic interactions in turn reduction in the uptake of phosphorous ions overall it is concluded that the adsorption capacity is strongly influenced by ph of solution due to its influence on the surface charge of the adsorbent and the degree of ionization and speciation of the adsorbate 6 2 the effect of temperature many researchers have reported the increase in the adsorption capacity with temperature emphasizing the endothermic nature of the adsorption process using ws based adsorbents miyah et al reported that the adsorption capacity increased with increasing temperature 92 it was mentioned that the adsorption process is endothermic in nature and the increase in adsorption capacity is due to the increase in mobility of the adsorbate at higher temperatures for the removal of cationic heavy metal ions adsorption capacity increases with increasing temperature najam et al also investigated the influence of temperature on the removal of cu ii zn ii and cd ii it was reported that adsorption process is endothermic in nature and the resulting gibb s free energy is negative indicating that ws has high affinity towards heavy metal ions pazouki et al studied the effect of temperature ranging from 25 to 45 c for the removal of mercury and the results indicated that the removal efficiency increased with increasing temperature displaying an endothermic nature of the adsorption phenomenon 51 li et al also investigated the effect of temperature on two types of dyes congo red and methylene blue and the results implied that the removal of dyes is strongly affected by the temperature of the solution 72 both dyes exhibited the same outcome stating that the dye adsorption capacity increased with temperature the interpretation of the given result was that the diffusion of dyes within the adsorbent increases giving way to more incessant interactions between dye molecules and active sites on the surface of the adsorbent thermodynamic parameters are evaluated to study the effect of temperature on the adsorption behavior on ws based adsorbents these parameters include gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs many research works have assessed and reported the values of those parameters in the literature nazari et al reported negative δg values between 4 96 and 9 51 kj mol δh for the removal of cephalexin antibiotic 12 negative values indicate that a spontaneous physisorption took place and the increase in negative values with temperature is an indication of the degree of spontaneity with temperature the endothermic nature of the process was confirmed with the determined positive value of δh the outcome of this research has been supported by the work of other researchers where a negative δg value and a positive δh value were evaluated indicating a spontaneous and endothermic adsorption process 58 on the contrary zheng et al and lie et al reported negative δh values implying that the adsorption process is exothermic in nature and that adsorption decreases with temperature 32 40 in addition ozdemir et al investigated the effect of temperature on the adsorption of methylene blue on ws 104 it was reported that the adsorption efficiency decreased with increasing temperature 104 a similar finding was reported by tang et al stating that the adsorption is exothermic in nature 90 6 3 the effect of ionic strength it is well documented that ionic strength influences the adsorption process onto ws ionic salts are known to participate in mechanisms and interactions that involve target molecules in solution and adsorbent surface in addition to altering the charge of the adsorbent surface 105 from the literature two distinct phenomena are recorded that can describe the effect of ionic strength on the adsorption process onto ws based adsorbents the first effect depends on the electrostatic nature and configuration of the target contaminant second the increase in salt concentration can induce an effect that is termed as squeeze out effect where excess salts penetrate into the inner pores of the carbonaceous adsorbent repelling the interactions between the adsorbate and adsorbent 106 moreover positive ionic salts can neutralize the negative charge of both adsorbents and adsorbates weakening the electrostatic interactions between them thus decreasing the adsorption capacity 106 several studies reported that the presence of cations affected the adsorption capacity negatively miyah et al and tang et al recorded a decrease in adsorption efficiency for the removal of methylene blue in the presence of cations 90 102 methylene blue is a cationic dye and it is only natural for cationic ions such as na to compete against the cationic dye for active sites on the adsorbent resulting in a deficiency in methylene blue uptake a similar finding has also been reported by li et al for the removal of hexavalent chromium 86 the presence of salts in the solution resulted in a negative impact on the uptake of chromium where it is perceived that ions in the solution compete against cr vi for the adsorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent weakening the electrostatic attraction between the adsorbent and the chromium ions luo et al studied the effect of coexisting ions for the adsorption of phosphate using ws based adsorbent modified with lanthanum chloride and sodium hydroxide 34 anions tested include cl no3 co3 2 and so4 2 all of which had no significant impact on the adsorption capacity except for so4 2 ion which interfered with adsorption of phosphate 7 adsorption mechanisms the mechanism of adsorption onto activated ws can be generally classified into physical and chemical adsorption where each category is based on the nature of interactions and affinity of target contaminant towards various functional groups for instance chemical adsorption is mediated by chemical reaction or the bonding of adsorbate and functional groups imbedded on the surface of the adsorbent these types of interactions are profound and the adsorbent can undergo chemical changes which are irreversible and not favored for regeneration due to high energy requirement on the other hand physical adsorption is governed by the weak van der waals interactions between target contaminant and the adsorbent and the adsorbent does not undergo chemical changes other mechanisms for the adsorption onto ws based adsorbent include hydrogen bonding ion exchange and electrostatic interactions adsorption mechanisms are highly influenced by the characteristics of the adsorbate and the chemistry of the background solution uddin et al reported a low adsorption capacity at low ph values and high adsorption capacity at high ph values for the removal of methylene blue dye using raw ws 98 the major interaction responsible for the removal is electrostatic interactions between the cationic dye and the functional groups on the surface of the adsorbent ph values higher than pzc results in a negatively charged surface thus intensifying the attraction forces towards methylene blue methylene blue is a cationic dye and as such it is only natural an electrostatic attraction is induced between a positively charged entity and a negatively charged surface the influence of ph on the adsorption of alizarin yellow gg on carbonized ws based adsorbent has been investigated by kaya et al 107 in contrast to methylene blue dye alizarin yellow gg is an anionic dye hence maximum adsorption capacity was achieved at ph value of 3 due to the heightened electrostatic interactions between the anionic dye and the positively charged surface of the adsorbent to determine whether other interactions are involved in the adsorption process studies were carried out at pzc to eliminate the involvement of electrostatic interactions due to surface charge however turns out that electrostatic interactions are solely or majorly responsible of the adsorption of the anionic dye this is attributed to the fact that negatively charged particles are naturally attracted to negatively charged surfaces and positively charged particles are normally attracted to negatively charged surfaces 107 it is possible that the adsorption process is a result of synergetic effect of several interactions occurring simultaneously zhou et al stated that π π electron donor acceptor eda mechanism for the adsorption of methylene blue onto ws magnetized with double salt of ammonium ferrous sulfate ds ac 31 ds ac acted as an electron donor due to its high π electron density and methylene blue is a π electron acceptor henceforth inducing the π π electron donor acceptor interactions resulting in the adsorption of methylene blue moreover strong van der waals contributed to the adsorption process due to the interaction between sp2 hybridized carbon with high π electron density domain of ds ac and the π electron acceptor of the aromatic ring structure of methylene blue in addition to these mentioned interactions zhou et al proposed the presence of fe fe3c particles in addition to the hierarchically porous structure which collectively enhanced the electron transfer through fe fe3c particles to fe2 while the generated h from 2h h2o could accelerate the dissociation of methylene blue the mechanism is explained through chemical reactions 1 through 4 starting with the adsorption of methylene blue onto the surface of the material followed by the release of cl ions through the reaction of methylene with fe fe3 c species then the release of fe2 and active h due to the combination of ionic h and fe fe3c c particles finally decolorization reaction occurs 1 fe fe 3 c c mb σ cl σ fe fe 3 c c mb σ cl 2 fe fe 3 c c mb σ cl σ e fe fe 3 c c mb cl 3 fe fe 3 c c 2h h 2 o fe 2 2h 2oh 4 fe fe 3 c c mb h fe fe 3 fe c redox reaction products qiongfen et al was able to deduce from the adsorption isotherms and thermodynamic that the phosphine adsorption onto metal oxide modified ws ac mwac is chemical in nature 108 according to the thermodynamical equilibrium analysis ph3 will react with o2 to produce h3po4 and small amounts of p2o5 2 when the molar ratio of o2 to ph3 in the solution is 2 and above the presence of cuo loaded onto the mwac plays a major role in acting as an oxygen carrier in the ph3 adsorption oxidation process possible mechanisms proposed for the study are presented in chemical reactions 5 through 10 the adsorption oxidation process is initiated by the physical adsorption of ph3 and o2 onto the active site of the adsorbent as presented reactions 5 and 6 eqs 7 and 8 present the rapid reaction that occurs between the lattice oxygen of the active components on the surface and adsorbed ph3 species to form h3po4 and p2o5 the produced p2o5 species consequently react with water to form h3po4 as seen in reaction 9 finally reaction 10 depicts the adsorption of generated p2o5 and h3po4 onto the adsorbent it is noteworthy that the high adsorption capacity of ph3 is due to the combined effects of the large surface area 1419 m2 g in addition to the high oxidation activity of mwac adsorbent in ph3 adsorption oxidation to h3po4 and p2o5 5 ph 3 x ph 3 x 6 o 2 x o 2 x 7 ph 3 x 4 om h 3 po 4 x 4 m 8 4ph 3 x 16 om p 2 o 5 2 x 6h 2 o 16 m 9 p 2 o 5 2 x 6h 2 o h 3 po 4 x 10 2 m o 2 x 2om x π π interactions resulting from the alteration of the adsorbent s surface chemistry is a primary enhancement element in the adsorption process zheng et al investigated the adsorption mechanism of phenanthrene dissolved in surfactant polysorbate 80 tween 80 using ws chemically activated with h3po4 40 the results of the xps analysis confirmed the presence of oxygen containing functional groups which was further confirmed by the results obtained from boehm titration the π π bonding occurs between cc double bonds or benzene rings of both the adsorbent and phenanthrene molecules the occurrence of the π π interactions was verified through the ftir analysis of the spent adsorbent where a shift and enhancement of the intensity of cc stretching of aromatic rings was observed additionally π π transitions in the aromatic rings signify the existence of π electron on the surface of the adsorbent due to the adsorption of phenanthrene which further cements the crucial role of π π interactions in the adsorption process wang et al suggested a holistic approach for the adsorption of sulfamethoxazole onto activate ws that includes three types of mechanisms including dispersive interaction of π π electron coupling between the graphitic structure of the ac and the aromatic rings of sulfamethoxazole the electron donor acceptor interaction between phenol aromatic ring of the contaminant and the oxygen functional groups on the surface of the ac and the large sbet and pore size distribution 73 fig 8 provides a brief illustration of the adsorption mechanism of sulfamethoxazole onto modified ws in addition to electrostatic interactions ph also plays a key role in hydrogen bonding electron exchange and π π dispersion interactions in solution 109 luo et al proposed that the mechanism of phosphate onto la oh 3 nanorod ws biochar composite ln wb is a combination of electrostatic interactions surface precipitation and ligand exchange 34 maximum adsorption capacity occurred at high ph values where all three forms of mechanisms took place phosphate ions exchanged positions with oh and co3 2 ions through ligand exchange at low ph values adsorption capacity decreased as electrostatic interactions ceased to occur in addition to the deprotonation of la oh and the replacement of oh and co3 2 ions fig 9 provides a brief schematic diagram of the proposed adsorption process to conclude electrostatic interactions π π and π π eda interactions surface precipitation ligand exchange ions exchange are all important mechanisms for the adsorption onto ws based adsorbents therefore providing a good analysis of the mechanism acquires a thorough characterization of both the adsorbent and adsorbate in addition nature of the background solution needs to be taken into consideration given that ph is a major key role player in the adsorption process furthermore surface functional groups also take part in the mechanism adsorption and the uptake efficiency 8 modeling of adsorption on ws 8 1 adsorption isotherm modeling adsorption is a phenomenon that can be briefly described by the transfer of substances from mobile phase liquid or gaseous to a solid phase 110 111 thus in order to describe and predict the mobility of these substances adsorption isotherm curves are utilized essentially isotherm curves govern the retention of liquid gas adsorbates on solid adsorbents while varying initial concentrations of target contaminant at predetermined operating conditions 111 112 furthermore isotherm curves provide insights into the adsorbent s surface properties adsorption mechanism and the degree of affinity during the adsorption process there are several empirical models used however the focus will be on two commonly used isotherm models the langmuir and freundlich isotherms as they were adopted in various sorption studies in the literature to determine the maximum adsorption capacities and predict the type of adsorption mechanism the langmuir model is given by eq 11 113 11 q e q max b c e 1 b c e where qe is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium per unit weight of adsorbent mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate in the liquid phase mg l qmax and b are the langmuir constants and are referred to as the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and affinity parameter of the adsorption system equations are often linearized for ease of plotting and is given by eq 12 12 1 q e 1 b q max c e 1 q ma x the assumptions of employing the langmuir isotherm include a homogenous adsorption process in other words the model assumes the adsorbent has a uniform surface with equivalent adsorption sites as in each molecule has the same activation energy no lateral interactions between neighboring adsorbed molecules and no immigration of molecules on the surface of the adsorbent 115 the freundlich isotherm is expressed using eq 13 where kf is the freundlich parameter that expresses the amount adsorbed mg g l mg 1 n and n represents the adsorption strength 114 the value of 1 n ranges between 0 and 1 values below 1 imply chemisorption and values above 1 indicate a cooperative adsorption unlike langmuir isotherm freundlich models assumes a multilayer adsorption with uneven distribution of heat and affinities over a heterogeneous surface energies 89 this isotherm model is criticized for its inability to abide by henry s law at low concentrations of the target contaminant 116 the freundlich model is given by eq 13 13 q e k f c e 1 n the corresponding linear form is given by eq 14 14 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e table 11 provides both empirical isotherm models applied to adsorption data in studies available in the literature for the adsorption of different contaminants on the ws based adsorbents adsorption isotherms are useful tools for the prediction of the relationship between the uptake capacity of the adsorbent and its equilibrium concentration in the aqueous phase uddin et al applied three isotherm models including langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevitch to investigate the adsorption process of methylene blue onto powdered ws 98 studied models were plotted in order to investigate the linear plots parameters belonging to the isotherm models were determined from the slope and intercept it was deduced from the mathematical calculation of the experimental results that the langmuir isotherm was the best fitted model moreover it can be concluded from the langmuir model that the adsorption mechanism of methylene blue onto powered ws is chemisorption in nature hsini et al applied langmuir and freundlich isotherms to evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity and to have an insight into the distribution of cr vi onto the active sites of the adsorbent using two synthesized adsorbents arginine doped polyaniline arg pani wns ws and ws modified with polyaniline in the absence of arginine pani wns 117 the latter isotherm resulted in a better fit than the former with a higher correlation value of 0 9901 and 0 9913 for arg pani wns and pani wns respectively this finding suggests the cr vi adsorption follows a multilayer pattern on a heterogenous adsorbent surface for both adsorbents a new adsorption isotherm regional analysis model arian model introduced by samiey was employed in this study 118 119 arian model follows the assumption that the adsorption process constitutes of four distinct regions the first region satisfies henry s law at low concentration ranges where the adsorption capacity against adsorbate equilibrium concentration is linear plot the second phase represents the conventional langmuir isotherm or tempkin where adsorption occurs in the form of a monolayer on the surface of the adsorbent the third region corresponds to the formation of the second layer of adsorbates on the surface of the adsorbent where the analysis of the equilibrium data is performed using the bilayer isotherm the fourth and last region depicts the adsorption system reaching a saturation plateau including reverse desorption the adsorption data of the study did not comply with henry s law as the equilibrium data exhibited a non linear trend the equilibrium data showed a good compatibility with the second and third regions starting with concentrations 140 34 mg l and 118 12 mg l for pani wns and arg pani wns respectively finally the fourth region was not perceived as the equilibrium plateau was not reached this result translates that the adsorption of cr vi onto pani wns and arg pani wns portrays a multi region profile that demonstrates there are different binding sites due to amine and imine groups originating from pani and arginine on the surface of the adsorbent liu et al investigated four isotherm models langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich to evaluate the adsorption behavior of naphthalene on commercial activated ws 32 the results suggested the following order of best fitting according to r2 values fruendlich langmuir temkin dubinin radushkevich moreover freundlich parameters were calculated and it was determined that the adsorption of naphthalene onto activated ws was a favorable one considering 1 n value lies within the range 0 1 and 3 the findings also reveal that the freundlich constant kf decreased with temperature signifying that the adsorption of naphthalene is an exothermic process conversely kaya et al examined two isotherm models langmuir and freundlich models by varying the temperature for the adsorption of alizarin yellow gg dye on raw ws 107 linear plots of ce qe vs ce and ln qe vs ln ce were retrieved at three different temperatures 25 35 and 45 c the results displayed that the freundlich model has a better fit according to the r2 value the freundlich constant increased with temperature implying that the adsorption process is endothermic in nature and 1 n value indicated that the adsorption of alizarin yellow is favorable in all experimented temperatures 8 2 adsorption kinetic modeling adsorption equilibrium and kinetics are employed in the design and scale up of the adsorption systems the development of kinetics is highly dependent on the theoretical complexity of the adsorption mechanisms 120 121 experimental kinetic data is collected by varying contact time for the adsorption process various models have been developed to predict the uptake rate of the adsorption system where the pseudo first order and pseudo second order are the most commonly used models in liquid phase adsorption studies pseudo first order is proposed by lagergren for the adsorption of oxalic and malonic acid onto charcoal and is expressed as in eq 15 122 15 q t q e q e e k 1 t linearizing eq 15 yields eq 16 16 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t qe mg g and qt mg g parameters represent adsorption capacities at equilibrium and time t respectively and k1 represents the rate parameter 1 min pseudo first order is known to be valid after the system has been running for long periods of time when the adsorption system is nearing equilibrium and at the initial stage of the adsorption 123 this model is applied to interpret data at small time intervals pseudo second order is used for large intervals and it predicts that the adsorption rate is second order function with respect to available active sites 124 it is represented mathematically in the form of eq 17 17 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t eq 18 represented the linearized of pseudo second order model 18 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the rate parameter in g mg min these model parameters are empirical constants with no distinct significance as no research works have been implemented to identify their underlying physico chemical phenomena when model fitting is finalized 120 the purpose behind fitting these models into kinetic studies is merely to compliment the adsorbent evaluation there are other kinetic models used in the literature including the elovich equation and the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model the compatibility of each model relies on several key factors including the characteristics of the adsorbent and adsorbate and the operating conditions many research works demonstrated multilinear curves within a studied time frame which depicts that multiple mechanisms can occur simultaneously with a controlling mechanism such as intraparticle diffusion or the transport of the adsorbate to the external surface of the adsorbent li et al performed a kinetic and equilibrium study for the removal of reactive brilliant blue using ws modified with epichlorohydrin and alkaline solution of aspartic acid 39 the findings revealed that the adsorption obeyed the pseudo seconder model where the calculated qe deviated the least from the experimental one it is also shown that as the temperature increased the deviation gap decreased between qe calculated and the experimental value reaching complete compatibility between the two values moreover the initial adsorption rate increased with temperature and the time required to reach 50 of the adsorption capacity decreased with temperature proving that faster adsorption rates take place at higher temperatures naghiadeh et al modified ws using titanium oxide and zinc oxide for the removal of humic acid from aqueous solutions 84 pseudo first and pseudo second models were applied to experimental data at different initial concentrations and the adsorption process was best described by latter model in addition the correlation r2 for the pseudo second model was excessively higher for both adsorbents it was demonstrated that the adsorption capacity increased with an increase in the initial concentration of humic acid liu et al also applied pseudo first and second models to experimental data using amino modified ws for the removal of pb 2 ions 79 similarly pseudo second order model also gave the best fit with r2 equal to 0 999 data where fitted to the linear forms of the equations where the plot of the pseudo second model portrayed a perfect straight line suggesting an agreement between the experimental and model values it was also indicated that chemisorption is the rate limiting step of the adsorption process halysh et al studied the removal of methylene blue using ws modified with acetic acid and a mixture of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide 42 experimental data were applied to validate different kinetic equations including pseudo first and second order and the intraparticle diffusion model the most compatible model according to the magnitude of r2 and slight deviation of qe experimental from theoretical is pseudo second order model the resulting r2 value 0 873 of the intraparticle diffusion model indicates the adsorption of methylene blue onto modified ws is a multi step process consisting of the dye adsorption on the surface and pore interior diffusion luo et al developed a la oh 3 nanorod ws biochar for reclaiming phosphate 34 three kinetic models were applied pseudo first pseudo second and intraparticle diffusion models the kinetic parameters suggested that pseudo second order yields a better fit to describe the kinetics for phosphate removal moreover data were applied to the linear form of the intraparticle diffusion model where the fitting lines did not pass through the origin implying that the internal diffusion is not the rate limiting step the fitting curves were divided into two parts emphasizing that the adsorption of phosphate is a multistage process the parameters of the model indicated the rate of the first stage was greater the second step hsini et al evaluated the mass transfer mechanism of the adsorption process by applying experimental data to the intraparticle diffusion model for the removal of cr vi using arginine doped polyaniline ws 117 according to the model the adsorption process took place in three consecutive steps the first step involves the mobility of cr vi ions from the solution to the external surface of the adsorbent the second step slower than the former one and controlled by rate of diffusion constitutes of the penetration of cr vi into the internal surface of the adsorbent finally the third step consists of the final adsorption equilibrium phase li et al only applied the pseudo second order to study the kinetics of cr vi uptake using unmodified and modified ws with diethylenetriamine 86 non linear regressive analysis was applied to fit the experimental data and modified ws showed a better fit that the unmodified one considering that modified ws has higher sbet area and pore volume the results indicate that morphological properties of the adsorbent are also responsible for fast adsorption rates the results depicted that the initial reaction stage increased rapidly while the second stage showed a decrease in the reaction rate this is attributed to the fact that at initial stages of the reaction cr vi species occupy empty sites promptly during the second stage less active sites become available decelerating the reaction rate until equilibrium is reached it is safe to say that there is no distinct correlation between the validity of kinetic models and target contaminants whether organic compounds or heavy metal ions furthermore pseudo second order is preferred over other kinetic models given that it is the most applied model in adsorption studies found in the literature to determine adsorption rates and capacities of studied adsorbents kinetic models and their parameters for the adsorption of different contaminants on ws based adsorbents are presented in table 12 9 industrial applications of ws in addition to bench scale laboratory works ws have also been utilized in the industry schlumburger designed a produced water downflow filtration system employing ws media filtration 125 as the liquid passes through the ws bed oils and suspended solids are proficiently retained by the filter the filtration system has the ability to remove 95 99 suspended solids and 90 99 of hydrocarbons originating from produced water sea surface and freshwater sources providing discharge levels of 5 ppm and lower it is noteworthy that backwash process takes place using a specifically designed rotating media scrubbing agitator rather than chemicals moreover ws are utilized in the oil and gas industry as lost circulation material due to problems associated with drilling mud losses 126 due to the recent stringent environmental regulations nutshell filters are the next generation technology ws are used to remove oil and grease and suspended solids from a variety of chemical plants and oil fields with efficacy of 99 127 very limited information is available online and as such it is difficult to provide more data on ws with regards to its industrial application it is crucial that this information is available as it aids in solving current issues being faced in the industry and advancing current research works several research works involving the preparation of ws based adsorbents have been patented cao jiashun invented a method for preparation of a cationic adsorbent from ws to be used in the adsorption of anionic dyes from wastewater originating from the printing and dye industry this method involved the use of epoxychloropropane as the etherifying agent and diethylenetraiamine as the crosslinking agent the process was carried out in an alkaline environment introducing the amino group in a two step modification process 128 it was reported that the resulting adsorbent has the ability to adsorb anionic azo dyes reaching a capacity of 500 mg g which is 9 times the unmodified ws 128 wang dong invented a method to modify ws using koh for the removal of methylene blue 129 the invention constituted of a simple process which involved the step of hydrothermally carbonizing ws after which it was mixed koh solution in the final step koh modified ws was placed in a tube furnace at a temperature of 800 c for two hours 129 another ws based adsorbent has been invented by gao jingfeng for the removal of methylene blue 130 however the method used is completely different from the one mentioned above prior to the carbonization process ws were soaked in a 30 zncl2 solution as for the carbonization process microwave irradiation technique has been utilized on 480 630 w 130 the resulting adsorbent was washed with hcl until neutral conditions achieved 10 conclusions and future perspectives in this review the focus was on recent studies for the application of ws based adsorbents for the removal of contaminants from water ws have been employed for several industrial activities and more recently in the water treatment industry due to their unique properties and naturally imbedded functional groups they have been successfully employed for the removal organic compounds and heavy metal ions according to the literature ws have been used in four different methods raw chemically activated physically activated and chemical modified or impregnated with different chemical compounds results indicated that chemical activation stemmed morphological properties superior to all other modification processes resulting sbet values reached 2000 m2 g competing with commercially available ac it has been noted that pyrolysis temperature should not exceed 500 to 600 c as increasingly high temperatures will result in lower sbet and total pore volumes studies discussed in this review paper are mainly batch isotherm systems for evaluating the performance of different ws based adsorbents in addition to the morphological properties of the adsorbent other entities that affect the mechanism of adsorption are the physicochemical properties and characteristics of target contaminants and the acidic basic nature of the background solution chemistry ph temperature and ionic strength are also key players in the adsorption process electrostatic interactions are the solely responsible for the adsorption of charged contaminants where altering ph changes surface chemistry inducing either repulsive or attractive forces between the adsorbent and adsorbate in addition the effect of ph greatly depends on the protonation deprotonation of functional groups on the contaminant other mechanisms reported are π π interactions and molecular configuration including size aromaticity and functional groups are all viable contributors to the adsorption mechanism most studies reported the adsorption studies are endothermic in nature and spontaneous moreover most systems followed the freundlich isotherm model and the pseudo second order kinetic study structure of the ac can be altered according to target contaminant for instance creating a mesoporous structure will aid in contaminants with high molecular weight to navigate towards the adsorbent s micropores thus improving adsorption efficacy essentially laboratory data provided a valuable insight to the adsorption mechanisms onto ws based adsorbents nonetheless more studies are needed to be conducted on nonionic organic compounds in order to evaluate other adsorption mechanisms besides electrostatic interactions column based and regeneration studies are limited and more tests should be conducted in both areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

wastewater and alleviate water scarcity 2 3 membrane processes such as reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf are considered more practical and efficient than conventional technologies due to their superior separation efficiency low cost of contaminant removal and outstanding mechanical properties 4 5 uf membranes are commonly used for a wide range of applications including the separation of organic matter from wastewater 6 7 the search for renewable biodegradable materials in the field of polymeric membranes has received a great deal of attention due to the non recyclable nature of petroleum based materials which have had catastrophic effects on the environment and public health 8 the use of green solvents in membrane fabrication gained great attention due to their low toxicity when compared to commonly used organic solvents 9 unlike synthetic polymers biodegradable polymeric membranes can be easily disposed of at the end of their life reducing any negative impacts they might have on the environment polylactic acid pla is a biodegradable polymer that has the potential to replace conventional fossil based materials used in membrane fabrication with the advantage of being recyclable through composting processes 10 thermodynamic studies on the compatibility of blended polymers were reported in literature 11 13 zhang et al 14 studied the thermodynamic interaction parameters between pla and polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp based on the study the composition dependent variations in the glass transition temperature tg and degree of crystallinity xc of the pla phase showed that pla and pvp were immiscible at different ranges membrane fouling is considered a critical problem because it significantly affects the performance of treatment processes 15 16 several studies have focused on improving the performance and anti fouling properties of pla membranes for example shen et al 17 demonstrated that blending of hollow fiber pla membranes with polyethylene glycol polylactic acid copolymers showed an improvement in the anti fouling properties jiang et al 18 incorporated polyaniline nanoparticles pani through which the pla pani composite membranes demonstrated an increase in water flux protein rejection and high anti fouling performance with bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha reporting a flux recovery ratio frr of 50 and 70 respectively in another study minbu et al 19 investigated the performance of pla mf membranes modified with tween 80 surfactant using the non solvent induced phase separation method they demonstrated that the fabricated membranes performed better than membranes modified with other surfactants the results revealed that the mf membrane fabricated using 10 wt pla with 10 wt tween 80 showed high bacterial retention up to 90 the prepared membranes were mechanically stable at 25 c but degraded at 60 c in wet conditions furthermore jiang et al 20 examined the influence of pla concentration and solvent evaporation on the anti fouling performance of membranes the study indicated a decrease in water flux from 125 to 10 l m2 h and an improvement in anti fouling properties when the pla concentration increased from 5 to 20 wt this was attributed to the increase in the dope solution viscosity from 2 to 70 pa s which has led to the formation of denser membrane structures with tear like macrovoids a study conducted by abdel karim et al 21 focused on fabricating mixed matrix membranes from blending of both polyethersulfone pes and cu fe3o4 core shell nanostructure using facile wet phase inversion method the addition of cu fe3o4 core shell nanostructure inside the pes polymer matrix enhanced the antifouling property of the membranes reporting up to 90 bsa rejection in

ring the active membrane area used for filtration was around 12 56 cm2 the feed solution was placed into the filtration cell and stirred at 300 rpm using a magnetic stirrer 2 3 membrane characterization scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 250 esem was used to analyze the morphological nature of the surface and cross section as well as the structure of the pla membranes produced all membrane samples were coated with a 10 nm gold palladium layer to collect good quality images and to protect the membranes from charging during the test moreover cross sectional samples were

studied using netzsch sta 449 f3 jupiter thermogravimetric analyzer tga weight loss was obtained in a temperature range of 25 800 c the samples were loaded into a platinum sample holding pan while a heating rate of 10 c min was used to increase the temperature to 800 c gradually the hydrophilicity of the prepared membranes was assessed by measuring the water contact angle using the contact angle krüss germany all membranes were cut into tiny pieces placed on a glass plate top side up and fixed with tape subsequently a microsyringe was used to drop a 5 μl droplet of di water on the membrane

were calculated the porosity of the membranes was determined by the dry wet method initially membrane samples with a total area of 5 cm2 were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 24 h and their weights were recorded wd the samples were then dipped in water for another 24 h to measure the weight of the membranes after removing excessive water w w porosity was calculated using eq 1 24 1 ɛ w w w d a ρ

the guerout elford ferry eq 2 2 r n 2 9 1 75 ɛ 8 ηδq ɛaδp where q is the water flux η is the water viscosity and δp is the operational pressure 2 4 assessing membrane performance using synthetic wastewater the fabricated pla membranes were tested for the removal of bsa from synthetic wastewater the feed solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of bsa in 1 l of 10 mm phosphate buffer solution that contains anhydrous disodium hydrogen and sodium dihydrogen phosphate with a ph of 7 2 25 the prepared solution has an initial bsa concentration of 1000 mg l the ph of the solution was adjusted to 7 by adding 0 1 m hydrochloric acid or 0 1 m sodium hydroxide 26 to evaluate membrane performance a stirred dead end uf unit sterlitech uhp 43 usa was used before any measurement each membrane was first cut into an area of 12 56 cm2 then compacted at 30 psi using pure water for 30 min to ensure that the membranes achieved steady flux conditions 27 filtration experiments were then carried out at 20 psi for 60 min in which readings were recorded every 10 min the membrane pure water flux jw1 was calculated using eq 3 3 j w 1 v a t where v is the volume of permeate a is the effective area of the membrane and t is the filtration time the permeability of pure water pwp was calculated according to eq 4 4 pwp j w 1 p where p is the pressure applied to the membrane permeate samples were collected after 90 min and analyzed using the uv vis to determine the bsa concentration eq 5 5 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf are the concentrations of bsa protein in the permeate and feed respectively for membrane cleaning the membranes were flushed with pure water for 10 min followed by water flux readings recorded at 20 psi for 60 min with 10 min intervals the fouling resistance of the pla membranes was determined using the flux recovery ratio frr eq 6 28 6 frr j w 2 j w 1 100 where jw2 is the membrane pure water flux after bsa filtration to further illustrate the fouling phenomena of the fabricated membranes the total protein fouling tendency rt of the pla membranes after the filtration of bsa solution was obtained using eq 7 29 7 r t j w 1 j p j w 1 100 reversible and irreversible protein fouling rr and rir were calculated using eqs 8 and 9 respectively 29 8 r r j w 2 j p j w 1 100 9 r ir j w 1 j w 2 j w 1 100 where jp is the flux of bsa solution during filtration to further examine the anti fouling properties of the pla membranes static bsa adsorption was performed by cutting the membranes into very small square pieces with an active surface area of 16 cm2 and soaking them in 100 ml of bsa solution 1000 mg l for 48 h 30 the bsa adsorption capacities of the membranes were calculated by measuring the concentration difference of bsa before and after adsorption obtained from the 595 nm uv absorbance using hach dr3900 uv vis spectrophotometer 31 the equilibrium adsorption quantity q was calculated using eq 10 10 q 10 3 c b c a v 2 a where cb and ca are the bsa concentrations before and after adsorption respectively 18 2 5 assessing membrane performance using raw municipal wastewater according to the synthetic wastewater results the performance and fouling behavior of the best performing pla membrane were evaluated through five consecutive filtration cycles after each cycle the membrane was physically washed with di water and cod concentration in the feed and filtrate samples was measured using hach dr3900 uv vis spectrophotometer fouling properties were also evaluated as in section 2 4 raw municipal wastewater having a cod concentration conductivity and ph of 318 mg l 8 3 ms cm and 7 2 respectively was collected from a local wwtp in abu dhabi uae and stored in the refrigerator at 4 c before use filtration experiments were performed without feed pretreatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 testing of fabricated pla membranes using synthetic wastewater 3 1 1 membrane morphology pore size hydrophilicity and porosity the sem surface images of pla membranes including pla 1 pla 2 pla 3 and pla 4 with different polymer concentrations are shown in fig 2 a b the results indicated that the pores size of the membranes decreased as the polymer concentration increased the mean pore size for the pla 1 pla 2 pla 3 and pla 4 membranes was reduced from 88 6 to 73 3 to 56 9 and to 42 9 nm respectively this is due to the change in the membrane s structure in which they became denser moreover increasing the polymer content can influence the interconnectivity of membrane pores leading to the formation of smaller pores 32 the sem cross sectional images of the fabricated pla membranes confirmed the asymmetric features of the prepared membranes with top dense layer and sublayer with finger like cavities as shown in fig 2b the formation of long finger like and macrovoid structures was expected due to the difference in solubility between organic additives and pla 33 the increase in the polymer concentration increased the viscosity of the dope solution which led to higher mass transfer resistance during the phase inversion process thus resulting in the gradual disappearance of the macrovoid structure of the membrane as shown in the pla 3 and pla 4 images they have denser structures compared to pla 1 and pla 2 34 the hydrophilicity of the membranes was investigated using water contact angle analysis the obtained values of the static contact angles and porosity of the membranes are presented in fig 3 the results revealed that there is an increase in the hydrophilicity of pla 1 pla 2 and pla 4 membranes as the static contact angle values decreased from 82 1 0 9 to 34 1 0 3 the porosity of the membranes decreased from 79 2 1 6 to 57 1 0 4 with the increase in the polymer concentration fig 3 it can be concluded that an increase in the polymer concentration decreases the size and number of pores this could be attributed to the retardation in the solvent exchange rate with the non solvent by the high viscosity polymer blended solution 35 3 1 2 membrane thermal stability and surface chemistry the thermal stability of the fabricated pla membranes was analyzed using tga fig 4 represents the exothermic peaks of the thermal decomposition of pla membranes the thermal decomposition of the pla membrane can be divided into three stages pla dehydration thermal fracture of the molecular chain and thermal scission of adjacent co bonds based on the obtained tga curves the thermal stability of pla membranes can reach up to 350 c and then rapidly degrade at 450 c 36 the results obtained showed very similar behavior for all pla membranes at different polymer concentrations 37 the surface chemistry of the prepared membranes pla 1 and pla 3 was examined using ft ir before and after bsa filtration and after membrane washing fig 5a illustrates the pla 1 and pla 3 ft ir spectra of the prepared pla membranes with different concentrations before bsa filtration therefore the characteristic absorption peaks were found at 1751 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of co and at 1260 cm 1 which is consistent with the bending vibration of the ch ch3 plane furthermore the banding vibration at 1090 cm 1 was obtained due to the presence of ester groups co of pla 38 in addition to the band at 724 cm 1 which represents the cc stretching vibration based on the obtained spectrum analyses the successful fabrication of pla membranes was confirmed which also agrees with the reported literature 9 28 furthermore the xrd patterns for the fabricated pla 1 and pla 3 membranes are shown in fig 5b pla 1 and pla 3 tend to have an intensity with peaks appearing at approximately 2θ 16 24 and 27 in the range of 10 to 30 a similar pattern trend was observed in the literature for pla which confirmed that pla has a semicrystalline phase 27 29 3 1 3 performance assessment uf tests were carried out to assess the performance of the prepared pla membrane performance using synthetic wastewater as the polymer content of the membranes increased the hydrophilicity increased and the pore size was reduced during the phase inversion process causing the water flux of the membranes to decline as shown in fig 6 it was observed that the water flux of the membranes was strongly affected by the change in polymer concentration with the highest achieved for pla 1 due to the formation of wider pores compared to the other membranes with higher polymer concentrations a similar trend was obtained by tiron et al who focused on examining the effects of changing the polymer concentration on membrane performance in wastewater treatment 35 the outcome confirmed that the change in the polymer content of the membranes positively enhanced the removal of bsa rejection the maximum percentage of bsa removal was around 91 for pla 3 and pla 4 membranes which could be attributed to their morphological structure and their small pore size values compared to other prepared membranes high bsa rejection using pla 3 and pla 4 membranes can be interpreted based on size exclusion mechanism combined with charge steric effect therefore the negative surface charge of fabricated membranes increased as the polymer concentration increased subsequently membrane repulsion forces were improved to remove negative bsa protein 6 table 2 shows the comparison between the results obtained from this research and literature 3 1 4 membrane anti fouling the dynamic fouling resistance of the fabricated pla membranes was investigated by testing their filtration performance using the bsa foulant model the membranes were cleaned after the filtering of bsa solution and pure water flux was measured table 3 shows the anti fouling properties profile of the prepared pla membranes in general the anti fouling properties of the membrane were influenced by its hydrophilicity surface charge porosity and surface pore size in fact improvement in membrane hydrophilicity decreased the tendency for membrane fouling this was due to the formation of the hydration layer which prevents the absorption of protein molecules on the top layer of the membrane surface on the other hand membranes with larger pore sizes could easily suffer from severe pore clogging or pore adsorption by bsa protein molecules compared to those with smaller surface pore sizes therefore the membrane with increased hydrophilicity and smaller pores is favorable for better anti fouling properties as illustrated in fig 7 the results revealed that the pla 1 membrane had a low frr value during the first cycle due to its large surface pore size which makes the bsa molecules easily accumulate and block its surface pores frr values for the second cycle decreased for all membranes due to the accumulation of bsa foulants on the membrane surface 28 more critical irreversible fouling was formed on the prepared membrane with a lower pla concentration due to its large surface pore size 43 furthermore the anti fouling properties of the pla membranes were tested using the static adsorption method as shown in table 4 based on the calculated q values increasing the polymer concentration decreased the equilibrium adsorption quantity the adsorption amount of membranes was shown to be highly linked with their hydrophilicity therefore increasing the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface ultimately reduces its adsorption amount 18 the equilibrium adsorption quantity measured for pla 1 in this study is close to the one obtained by jiang et al 18 in which the equilibrium adsorption quantity for the 15 wt was around 131 2 μg cm2 3 1 5 membrane post filtration characterization after bsa filtration and membrane washing sem surface images of the pla 1 and pla 3 membranes were captured fig 8 the results indicated a high potential for pore clogging and fouling tendency when having large membrane pores such as in pla 1 fig 8a ft ir spectra after bsa filtration revealed binding interactions between the bsa protein and the membrane surface which was further revealed by the band shifting of the amide group at 1633 cm 1 nh stretch fig 9a 44 the results after the washing indicated that physical membrane cleaning with di water was sufficient to overcome reversible fouling caused by the deposition of bsa molecules on the membrane surface that is no bsa peaks were detected fig 9b the xrd results show that the intensity of the membranes changes slightly due to the presence of bsa protein particles on the surface of the membranes see fig 10 a b on the other hand the intensity of the peaks in fig 10b is similar to the intensity of the peaks in fig 6 which confirms the enhancement of the anti fouling properties of the fabricated membranes including pla 1 and pla 3 3 2 evaluating the performance of the pla 3 membrane using raw municipal wastewater to investigate the performance and fouling behavior of the best performing membrane i e pla 3 influent raw wastewater was collected from a local wwtp and evaluated by five consecutive filtration cycles the membrane was physically washed with di water and cod removal was determined after each filtration cycle the cod results revealed a stable performance of the pla 3 membrane with a slight reduction observed in the 5th cycle fig 11 cod rejection was also observed to be higher when synthetic wastewater was used which can be attributed to the complex nature of the raw wastewater matrix fig 12 to deeply evaluate the anti fouling characteristics of the pla 3 membrane and its reusability the water permeability before and post raw wastewater filtration were recorded to measure the effectiveness of the cleaning process as shown in table 5 the results showed that after the first filtration cycle the pla 3 membrane had a high frr 89 revealing sufficient physical cleaning of the membrane surface with di water the obtained results are consistent with the static bsa adsorption outcome the hydrophilic nature of the pla 3 membrane confirmed by water contact angle analysis could reduce the hydrophobic interface between the organic matter and the membrane surface and consequently suppress the formation of a fouling layer significantly moreover the appearance of fouling is unavoidable after five filtration cycles the frr values of pla 3 decreased from 89 to 60 which was attributed to the accumulation of organic fouling molecules on the membrane surface over time 28 4 conclusion pla based green biodegradable membranes have shown great potential for the removal of organics from wastewater increasing the polymer concentration has a great impact on enhancing the anti fouling properties of the membranes via reducing the pore size at the surface and increasing the surface wettability of the membranes the frr values of the fabricated membranes increased from 57 to 93 with increasing polymer concentration from pla 1 to pla 4 in addition the pla 3 and pla 4 membranes exhibited superior bsa rejection of 90 and 92 respectively from synthetic wastewater however the water flux of the fabricated membranes decreased with increasing polymer concentration moreover the pla 3 membrane showed a good anti fouling tendency even when used to treat raw wastewater the frr was nearly 89 with only hydraulic washing up to cycle 3 the results of this study show great potential for the use of pla membranes in real

membranes fouling phase inversion 1 introduction population growth and industrialization have led to global water scarcity a major challenge humanity is currently facing in the 21st century 1 the discharge of municipal waste into water bodies has caused a decline in water quality continuous developments in wastewater treatment technologies have been made to maximize the ability to reuse wastewater and alleviate water scarcity 2 3 membrane processes such as reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf are considered more practical and efficient than conventional technologies due to their superior separation efficiency low cost of contaminant removal and outstanding mechanical properties 4 5 uf membranes are commonly used for a wide range of applications including the separation of organic matter from wastewater 6 7 the search for renewable biodegradable materials in the field of polymeric membranes has received a great deal of attention due to the non recyclable nature of petroleum based materials which have had catastrophic effects on the environment and public health 8 the use of green solvents in membrane fabrication gained great attention due to their low toxicity when compared to commonly used organic solvents 9 unlike synthetic polymers biodegradable polymeric membranes can be easily disposed of at the end of their life reducing any negative impacts they might have on the environment polylactic acid pla is a biodegradable polymer that has the potential to replace conventional fossil based materials used in membrane fabrication with the advantage of being recyclable through composting processes 10 thermodynamic studies on the compatibility of blended polymers were reported in literature 11 13 zhang et al 14 studied the thermodynamic interaction parameters between pla and polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp based on the study the composition dependent variations in the glass transition temperature tg and degree of crystallinity xc of the pla phase showed that pla and pvp were immiscible at different ranges membrane fouling is considered a critical problem because it significantly affects the performance of treatment processes 15 16 several studies have focused on improving the performance and anti fouling properties of pla membranes for example shen et al 17 demonstrated that blending of hollow fiber pla membranes with polyethylene glycol polylactic acid copolymers showed an improvement in the anti fouling properties jiang et al 18 incorporated polyaniline nanoparticles pani through which the pla pani composite membranes demonstrated an increase in water flux protein rejection and high anti fouling performance with bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha reporting a flux recovery ratio frr of 50 and 70 respectively in another study minbu et al 19 investigated the performance of pla mf membranes modified with tween 80 surfactant using the non solvent induced phase separation method they demonstrated that the fabricated membranes performed better than membranes modified with other surfactants the results revealed that the mf membrane fabricated using 10 wt pla with 10 wt tween 80 showed high bacterial retention up to 90 the prepared membranes were mechanically stable at 25 c but degraded at 60 c in wet conditions furthermore jiang et al 20 examined the influence of pla concentration and solvent evaporation on the anti fouling performance of membranes the study indicated a decrease in water flux from 125 to 10 l m2 h and an improvement in anti fouling properties when the pla concentration increased from 5 to 20 wt this was attributed to the increase in the dope solution viscosity from 2 to 70 pa s which has led to the formation of denser membrane structures with tear like macrovoids a study conducted by abdel karim et al 21 focused on fabricating mixed matrix membranes from blending of both polyethersulfone pes and cu fe3o4 core shell nanostructure using facile wet phase inversion method the addition of cu fe3o4 core shell nanostructure inside the pes polymer matrix enhanced the antifouling property of the membranes reporting up to 90 bsa rejection in

ring the active membrane area used for filtration was around 12 56 cm2 the feed solution was placed into the filtration cell and stirred at 300 rpm using a magnetic stirrer 2 3 membrane characterization scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 250 esem was used to analyze the morphological nature of the surface and cross section as well as the structure of the pla membranes produced all membrane samples were coated with a 10 nm gold palladium layer to collect good quality images and to protect the membranes from charging during the test moreover cross sectional samples were fractured using liquid nitrogen and attached to the sem holder ft ir analysis was performed to study the chemical structure of the fabricated membranes the functional groups of the prepared membranes

diffractometer xrd panalytical empyrean 40 kv and 35 ma was used to test the chemical composition and crystallinity of the prepared membranes the thermal degradation properties of all membranes were studied using netzsch sta 449 f3 jupiter thermogravimetric analyzer tga weight loss was obtained in a temperature range of 25 800 c the samples were loaded into a platinum sample holding pan while a heating rate of 10 c min was used to increase the temperature to 800 c gradually the hydrophilicity of the prepared membranes was assessed by measuring the water contact angle using the contact angle krüss germany all membranes were cut into tiny pieces placed on a glass plate top side up and fixed with tape subsequently a microsyringe was used to drop a 5 μl droplet of di water on the membrane

were calculated the porosity of the membranes was determined by the dry wet method initially membrane samples with a total area of 5 cm2 were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 24 h and their weights were recorded wd the samples were then dipped in water for another 24 h to measure the weight of the membranes after removing excessive water w w porosity was calculated using eq 1 24 1 ɛ w w w d a ρ

the guerout elford ferry eq 2 2 r n 2 9 1 75 ɛ 8 ηδq ɛaδp where q is the water flux η is the water viscosity and δp is the operational pressure 2 4 assessing membrane performance using synthetic wastewater the fabricated pla membranes were tested for the removal of bsa from synthetic wastewater the feed solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of bsa in 1 l of 10 mm phosphate buffer solution that contains anhydrous disodium hydrogen and sodium dihydrogen phosphate with a ph of 7 2 25 the prepared solution has an initial bsa concentration of 1000 mg l the ph of the solution was adjusted to 7 by adding 0 1 m hydrochloric acid or 0 1 m sodium hydroxide 26 to evaluate membrane performance a stirred dead end uf unit sterlitech uhp 43 usa was used before any measurement each membrane was first cut into an area of 12 56 cm2 then compacted at 30 psi using pure water for 30 min to ensure that the membranes achieved steady flux conditions 27 filtration experiments were then carried out at 20 psi for 60 min in which readings were recorded every 10 min the membrane pure water flux jw1 was calculated using eq 3 3 j w 1 v a t where v is the volume of permeate a is the effective area of the membrane and t is the filtration time the permeability of pure water pwp was calculated according to eq 4 4 pwp j w 1 p where p is the pressure applied to the membrane permeate samples were collected after 90 min and analyzed using the uv vis to determine the bsa concentration eq 5 5 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf are the concentrations of bsa protein in the permeate and feed respectively for membrane cleaning the membranes were flushed with pure water for 10 min followed by water flux readings recorded at 20 psi for 60 min with 10 min intervals the fouling resistance of the pla membranes was determined using the flux recovery ratio frr eq 6 28 6 frr j w 2 j w 1 100 where jw2 is the membrane pure water flux after bsa filtration to further illustrate the fouling phenomena of the fabricated membranes the total protein fouling tendency rt of the pla membranes after the filtration of bsa solution was obtained using eq 7 29 7 r t j w 1 j p j w 1 100 reversible and irreversible protein fouling rr and rir were calculated using eqs 8 and 9 respectively 29 8 r r j w 2 j p j w 1 100 9 r ir j w 1 j w 2 j w 1 100 where jp is the flux of bsa solution during filtration to further examine the anti fouling properties of the pla membranes static bsa adsorption was performed by cutting the membranes into very small square pieces with an active surface area of 16 cm2 and soaking them in 100 ml of bsa solution 1000 mg l for 48 h 30 the bsa adsorption capacities of the membranes were calculated by measuring the concentration difference of bsa before and after adsorption obtained from the 595 nm uv absorbance using hach dr3900 uv vis spectrophotometer 31 the equilibrium adsorption quantity q was calculated using eq 10 10 q 10 3 c b c a v 2 a where cb and ca are the bsa concentrations before and after adsorption respectively 18 2 5 assessing membrane performance using raw municipal wastewater according to the synthetic wastewater results the performance and fouling behavior of the best performing pla membrane were evaluated through five consecutive filtration cycles after each cycle the membrane was physically washed with di water and cod concentration in the feed and filtrate samples was measured using hach dr3900 uv vis spectrophotometer fouling properties were also evaluated as in section 2 4 raw municipal wastewater having a cod concentration conductivity and ph of 318 mg l 8 3 ms cm and 7 2 respectively was collected from a local wwtp in abu dhabi uae and stored in the refrigerator at 4 c before use filtration experiments were performed without feed pretreatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 testing of fabricated pla membranes using synthetic wastewater 3 1 1 membrane morphology pore size hydrophilicity and porosity the sem surface images of pla membranes including pla 1 pla 2 pla 3 and pla 4 with different polymer concentrations are shown in fig 2 a b the results indicated that the pores size of the membranes decreased as the polymer concentration increased the mean pore size for the pla 1 pla 2 pla 3 and pla 4 membranes was reduced from 88 6 to 73 3 to 56 9 and to 42 9 nm respectively this is due to the change in the membrane s structure in which they became denser moreover increasing the polymer content can influence the interconnectivity of membrane pores leading to the formation of smaller pores 32 the sem cross sectional images of the fabricated pla membranes confirmed the asymmetric features of the prepared membranes with top dense layer and sublayer with finger like cavities as shown in fig 2b the formation of long finger like and macrovoid structures was expected due to the difference in solubility between organic additives and pla 33 the increase in the polymer concentration increased the viscosity of the dope solution which led to higher mass transfer resistance during the phase inversion process thus resulting in the gradual disappearance of the macrovoid structure of the membrane as shown in the pla 3 and pla 4 images they have denser structures compared to pla 1 and pla 2 34 the hydrophilicity of the membranes was investigated using water contact angle analysis the obtained values of the static contact angles and porosity of the membranes are presented in fig 3 the results revealed that there is an increase in the hydrophilicity of pla 1 pla 2 and pla 4 membranes as the static contact angle values decreased from 82 1 0 9 to 34 1 0 3 the porosity of the membranes decreased from 79 2 1 6 to 57 1 0 4 with the increase in the polymer concentration fig 3 it can be concluded that an increase in the polymer concentration decreases the size and number of pores this could be attributed to the retardation in the solvent exchange rate with the non solvent by the high viscosity polymer blended solution 35 3 1 2 membrane thermal stability and surface chemistry the thermal stability of the fabricated pla membranes was analyzed using tga fig 4 represents the exothermic peaks of the thermal decomposition of pla membranes the thermal decomposition of the pla membrane can be divided into three stages pla dehydration thermal fracture of the molecular chain and thermal scission of adjacent co bonds based on the obtained tga curves the thermal stability of pla membranes can reach up to 350 c and then rapidly degrade at 450 c 36 the results obtained showed very similar behavior for all pla membranes at different polymer concentrations 37 the surface chemistry of the prepared membranes pla 1 and pla 3 was examined using ft ir before and after bsa filtration and after membrane washing fig 5a illustrates the pla 1 and pla 3 ft ir spectra of the prepared pla membranes with different concentrations before bsa filtration therefore the characteristic absorption peaks were found at 1751 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of co and at 1260 cm 1 which is consistent with the bending vibration of the ch ch3 plane furthermore the banding vibration at 1090 cm 1 was obtained due to the presence of ester groups co of pla 38 in addition to the band at 724 cm 1 which represents the cc stretching vibration based on the obtained spectrum analyses the successful fabrication of pla membranes was confirmed which also agrees with the reported literature 9 28 furthermore the xrd patterns for the fabricated pla 1 and pla 3 membranes are shown in fig 5b pla 1 and pla 3 tend to have an intensity with peaks appearing at approximately 2θ 16 24 and 27 in the range of 10 to 30 a similar pattern trend was observed in the literature for pla which confirmed that pla has a semicrystalline phase 27 29 3 1 3 performance assessment uf tests were carried out to assess the performance of the prepared pla membrane performance using synthetic wastewater as the polymer content of the membranes increased the hydrophilicity increased and the pore size was reduced during the phase inversion process causing the water flux of the membranes to decline as shown in fig 6 it was observed that the water flux of the membranes was strongly affected by the change in polymer concentration with the highest achieved for pla 1 due to the formation of wider pores compared to the other membranes with higher polymer concentrations a similar trend was obtained by tiron et al who focused on examining the effects of changing the polymer concentration on membrane performance in wastewater treatment 35 the outcome confirmed that the change in the polymer content of the membranes positively enhanced the removal of bsa rejection the maximum percentage of bsa removal was around 91 for pla 3 and pla 4 membranes which could be attributed to their morphological structure and their small pore size values compared to other prepared membranes high bsa rejection using pla 3 and pla 4 membranes can be interpreted based on size exclusion mechanism combined with charge steric effect therefore the negative surface charge of fabricated membranes increased as the polymer concentration increased subsequently membrane repulsion forces were improved to remove negative bsa protein 6 table 2 shows the comparison between the results obtained from this research and literature 3 1 4 membrane anti fouling the dynamic fouling resistance of the fabricated pla membranes was investigated by testing their filtration performance using the bsa foulant model the membranes were cleaned after the filtering of bsa solution and pure water flux was measured table 3 shows the anti fouling properties profile of the prepared pla membranes in general the anti fouling properties of the membrane were influenced by its hydrophilicity surface charge porosity and surface pore size in fact improvement in membrane hydrophilicity decreased the tendency for membrane fouling this was due to the formation of the hydration layer which prevents the absorption of protein molecules on the top layer of the membrane surface on the other hand membranes with larger pore sizes could easily suffer from severe pore clogging or pore adsorption by bsa protein molecules compared to those with smaller surface pore sizes therefore the membrane with increased hydrophilicity and smaller pores is favorable for better anti fouling properties as illustrated in fig 7 the results revealed that the pla 1 membrane had a low frr value during the first cycle due to its large surface pore size which makes the bsa molecules easily accumulate and block its surface pores frr values for the second cycle decreased for all membranes due to the accumulation of bsa foulants on the membrane surface 28 more critical irreversible fouling was formed on the prepared membrane with a lower pla concentration due to its large surface pore size 43 furthermore the anti fouling properties of the pla membranes were tested using the static adsorption method as shown in table 4 based on the calculated q values increasing the polymer concentration decreased the equilibrium adsorption quantity the adsorption amount of membranes was shown to be highly linked with their hydrophilicity therefore increasing the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface ultimately reduces its adsorption amount 18 the equilibrium adsorption quantity measured for pla 1 in this study is close to the one obtained by jiang et al 18 in which the equilibrium adsorption quantity for the 15 wt was around 131 2 μg cm2 3 1 5 membrane post filtration characterization after bsa filtration and membrane washing sem surface images of the pla 1 and pla 3 membranes were captured fig 8 the results indicated a high potential for pore clogging and fouling tendency when having large membrane pores such as in pla 1 fig 8a ft ir spectra after bsa filtration revealed binding interactions between the bsa protein and the membrane surface which was further revealed by the band shifting of the amide group at 1633 cm 1 nh stretch fig 9a 44 the results after the washing indicated that physical membrane cleaning with di water was sufficient to overcome reversible fouling caused by the deposition of bsa molecules on the membrane surface that is no bsa peaks were detected fig 9b the xrd results show that the intensity of the membranes changes slightly due to the presence of bsa protein particles on the surface of the membranes see fig 10 a b on the other hand the intensity of the peaks in fig 10b is similar to the intensity of the peaks in fig 6 which confirms the enhancement of the anti fouling properties of the fabricated membranes including pla 1 and pla 3 3 2 evaluating the performance of the pla 3 membrane using raw municipal wastewater to investigate the performance and fouling behavior of the best performing membrane i e pla 3 influent raw wastewater was collected from a local wwtp and evaluated by five consecutive filtration cycles the membrane was physically washed with di water and cod removal was determined after each filtration cycle the cod results revealed a stable performance of the pla 3 membrane with a slight reduction observed in the 5th cycle fig 11 cod rejection was also observed to be higher when synthetic wastewater was used which can be attributed to the complex nature of the raw wastewater matrix fig 12 to deeply evaluate the anti fouling characteristics of the pla 3 membrane and its reusability the water permeability before and post raw wastewater filtration were recorded to measure the effectiveness of the cleaning process as shown in table 5 the results showed that after the first filtration cycle the pla 3 membrane had a high frr 89 revealing sufficient physical cleaning of the membrane surface with di water the obtained results are consistent with the static bsa adsorption outcome the hydrophilic nature of the pla 3 membrane confirmed by water contact angle analysis could reduce the hydrophobic interface between the organic matter and the membrane surface and consequently suppress the formation of a fouling layer significantly moreover the appearance of fouling is unavoidable after five filtration cycles the frr values of pla 3 decreased from 89 to 60 which was attributed to the accumulation of organic fouling molecules on the membrane surface over time 28 4 conclusion pla based green biodegradable membranes have shown great potential for the removal of organics from wastewater increasing the polymer concentration has a great impact on enhancing the anti fouling properties of the membranes via reducing the pore size at the surface and increasing the surface wettability of the membranes the frr values of the fabricated membranes increased from 57 to 93 with increasing polymer concentration from pla 1 to pla 4 in addition the pla 3 and pla 4 membranes exhibited superior bsa rejection of 90 and 92 respectively from synthetic wastewater however the water flux of the fabricated membranes decreased with increasing polymer concentration moreover the pla 3 membrane showed a good anti fouling tendency even when used to treat raw wastewater the frr was nearly 89 with only hydraulic washing up to cycle 3 the results of this study show great potential for the use of pla membranes in real

13223,this study develops empirical models for the prediction of the removal efficiencies of inorganic nitrogen n and phosphorus p from municipal wastewater using microalgae chlorella kessleri our work identified the effects of operational parameters of temperature t light dark cycle ld and nitrate to phosphate n p ratio on simultaneous n and p removal three competitive soft computing techniques known as response surface methodology rsm multilayer perceptron artificial neural network mlp ann and support vector regression svr were applied to construct the predictive models using real life experimental data obtained via the box behnken design bbd matrix a bayesian optimization algorithm was applied to automatically tune the hyperparameters to develop optimized mlp ann and svr

prediction capability of the developed svr models under different conditions finally the models developed by svr were hybridized with a genetic algorithm ga to maximize the nutrient n and p removal

temperature c x 2 light dark cycle h h x 3 nitrogen phosphorus ratio y1 predicted n elimination efficiency y2 predicted p elimination efficiency 1 introduction improper maintenance and operation of wastewater treatment plants can generate severe ecological and public health challenges by causing various water borne diseases the forensics of municipal wastewater show high concentrations of inorganic nitrogen n phosphorus p organics and suspended and dissolved solids n and p are the essential nutrients that support the growth of algae the excess growth of algae results in eutrophication in water bodies furthermore a high level of inorganics can cause groundwater contamination 1 it is expected that the world will face up to a 40 water shortfall by 2030 a significant challenge for sustainable development from both the societal and economic perspectives 2 thus it is imperative to obtain an effective means of municipal wastewater treatment lowering total n and p levels to an acceptable limit is essential to implementing more stringent treated sewage effluent discharge limits the aerobic activated sludge process chemical phosphorus removal nitrification denitrification process and coagulation followed by sedimentation are typical wastewater treatment technologies used to remove these nutrients 3 4 the n and p removal performances of these technologies are generally at an acceptable level however high energy consumption during aeration transferring sludge from one tank to another instability in treatment performances carbon emissions lengthy processing waste of recyclable resources and generation of excessive amounts of sludge are major drawbacks 2 5 6 recently microalgae based wastewater treatment has gained appreciable interest due to its nutrient recovery ability and advanced level of treatment performance 7 higher nutrient removal efficiencies lower cost lower energy consumption and facilitation of resource recycling are some of the significant advantages of microalgae based wastewater treatment 4 8 9 the microalgal biomass produced during wastewater treatment may also bring extra potential value since biomass is used as feedstock in biorefinery co2 fixation from flue gases and other promising applications e g biofuel agar dyes fertilizers animal and human food 10 11 thus municipal wastewater treatment by microalgae is a sustainable solution for simultaneous n and p removal and co2 obliteration ji et al 12 reported approximately 100 removal of n and p from tertiary municipal wastewater using three different strains of microalgae chlorella vulgaris scenedesmus obliquus and ourococcus multisporus besides several microalgae species such as scenedesmus dimorphus spirulina maxima dunaliella salina and others including chlorella kessleri have been used successfully for n and p removal from municipal wastewater 13 14 however in real life the performance of nutrients removal utilizing microalgae is dependent on several parameters including the microalgae strain type initial co2 concentration light intensity light dark cycle ld initial ph temperature t and feed water nutrient load especially the nitrogen phosphorus ratio n p 14 15 among these t n p ratio and ld are vital parameters in the nutrient elimination process where nutrients inorganic are transformed into organic materials 16 19 t and ld play a key role in understanding the practical applications of outdoor cultivations the n p ratio may differ with the specific type and wastewater source while microalgae could coordinate the n p ratio in biomass inside the cell based on the wastewater nutrient concentration the primary outcome is that although the variation of the n p ratio affects the growth rate microalgae is suitable for nutrient removal efficiently along with other parameters it is a noteworthy aspect that studies of the effect of each variable on maximizing n and p removal efficiencies need a significant number of experimental laboratory runs it thus requires the allocation of substantial time and resources to prevent these hurdles statistical or mathematical modeling offers an innovative and practical approach to investigating complex and multiresponse parameter systems 20 21 alternative operational strategies can be evaluated without the need for physical trials for each scenario 22 23 mathematical models developed by influential variables can be used for the performance assessment based on process variability and set new operating conditions to improve stability safeguard the effluent quality and lower operational costs 24 25 rsm ann and svr are potential soft computing modeling techniques known for their high precision for predicting process performance they have many applications in several fields 26 28 rsm modeling lowers the number of laboratory runs predicts responses with good precision and successfully optimizes independent variables 29 30 biological wastewater treatments processes often encounter difficulties since some critical operational parameters viz t ld are subject to considerable seasonal changes as such the performance of wastewater treatment utilizing microalgae as well as biomass production may fluctuate throughout the year in this regard the experimental investigation combined with advanced modeling may become a powerful platform for effectively predicting nutrient removal efficiencies ann computational models were developed to evaluate aerobic biological wastewater treatment processes they were the most widely used artificial intelligence ai technique in the journal papers published in this field between 1995 and 2019 31 they are created from hundreds of basic units or neurons associated with weights to form neural networks 32 33 svr is an extension of support vector machine svm due to regression to model intrinsically complex systems and enlighten either linear or quadratic patterns to the output using descriptors 34 the significant features of the svr comprise the utilization of an appropriate hyperplane reduction of empirical risk non convergence to a local minimum and high stability and performance 35 36 the strength of svr materializes with its low sensitivity to overfitting and dimensionality due to avoidance of local minima hence the solution of svr is the global optimum 37 the svr acquires an efficient algorithm to minimize structural risk following the introduction of a loss function hence it has more significant potential to generalize non linear input output relationships 38 39 the generalization principle of structural risk minimization was proposed to prevent overfitting with a compromise between frequency of training error and confidence interval by changing vapnik cheronenkis vc dimension 40 furthermore svr intuitively determines model complexity by governing the number of support vectors 41 numerous studies have used ai modeling in the field of wastewater treatment 42 46 applications of ann modeling were used in nanocatalysts nanohybrid composites based water purification 47 49 ansari et al 42 developed the ann technique for microalgae based wastewater treatment by considering several input factors e g temperature ph dissolved oxygen electrical conductivity no3 po4 3 svm and adaptive neuro fuzzy based models have also been developed to assess the removal efficiency of n from an aerobic biological wastewater treatment plant 50 however no published research has simultaneously predicted total n and p removal efficiencies based on input factors related to wastewater treatment up to our knowledge in the present study rsm ann and svr modeling approaches were utilized to forecast the simultaneous n and p removal efficiencies with microalgae based municipal wastewater treatment a bayesian optimization algorithm was applied to tune the hyperparameters of both mlp ann and svr for finding the optimized ai models hereof the impacts of three key process parameters t ld and n p ratios on simultaneous n and p removals were investigated the rsm mlp ann and svr models were then independently developed and their forecasting performances against experimental results were compared using several statistical metrics such as relative error re coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and fractional bias fb a multiobjective optimization approach was carried out based on trade offs to find the optimal global conditions that simultaneously maximize both n and p efficiencies removal several well known techniques are utilized for global optimization of process variables viz the genetic algorithm ga harmony searches hs particle swarm optimization pso and ant colony optimization co 51 53 however ga is very popular and widely used for global optimization 54 thus the best predictive models were hybridized with ga to optimize the nutrient removal process operational parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 growth of microalgae at the laboratory chlorella kessleri sp utex 263 strain were obtained from the university of texas usa culture collection a synthetic municipal wastewater media bold s basal medium bbm was utilized for microalgae growth the composition of bbm is analogous to the secondary discharge of domestic wastewater treatment plants rich in nitrate nitrogen and phosphate phosphorus see supplementary table s1 the initial ph was adjusted to 7 0 by adding 0 1 m naoh several molar ratios of n p 1 1 3 1 and 6 1 were made separately based on molecular weight in this regard the weight of n was fixed same as bbm and the corresponding weight of p was added into the growth media to obtain selected n p ratios selected n p ratios are generally within the average ranges of municipal wastewater 14 15 the microalgae were grown in one litter erlenmeyer flasks as bioreactors fig 1 a hemocytometer was used to count the cell numbers for following up the growth stages of microalgae an inoculum concentration of 2 2 107 cells ml 1 was maintained constant in a 500 ml working volume for all consequent laboratory runs grolux fluorescent bulbs located in a wooden frame were used to supply light energy intensity 65 μmol m 2 s 1 for microalgae growth a mixture of gas 4 co2 and 96 atmospheric air was injected steadily into the culture a particular set of experimental conditions t of 30 c ld of 12 12 h h and n p molar ratio of 3 1 was utilized to obtain a representative microalgae growth curve a control experiment was also conducted with the same experimental conditions without using microalgae a particular volume 2 ml of the microalgal solution was obtained and filtered through vacuum filtration to estimate the biomass density the biomass sample was washed with dh2o twice and dried at 55 c using an oven until a stable mass was achieved the microalgal growth parameters specific growth rate biomass productivity were estimated from laboratory results using eqs 1 and 2 as below 29 30 55 1 μ ln n 2 n 1 t 2 t 1 2 p b x t x o t x t o where μ d 1 denotes specific growth rate pb gdw l 1 d 1 indicates biomass productivity n 1 and n 2 denote the biomass density g l at the starting time t 1 and end time t 2 of the log phase respectively x t denotes the biomass density g l at the end of the growth span t x and x o is the primary biomass density g l at zero days t0 2 2 measurement of n and p elimination efficiencies n and p removal r performances were determined by computing the amount of each nutrient removed by the growth medium via eq 3 a hach dr3900tm spectrophotometer was used to quantify the n while a hash drb200 reactor was utilized to measure p content in the medium the filtrate acquired during the calculation of the dry biomass weight was revealed for both n and p via the chromotropic acid and molybdovanatedate techniques with acid persulfate digestion respectively based on the procedures recorded in 59 60 3 r c 0 c 1 c 0 100 where c0 denotes n or p concentration before treatment mg l 1 c1 indicates n or p concentration after treatment mg l 1 r represents the percentage removal of those selected nutrients 2 3 soft computing approaches 2 3 1 experimental design and modeling by rsm rsm is an integrated statistical and mathematical approach used for empirical modeling and optimization 29 30 56 it is classified mainly into two designs box behnken design bbd and central composite design ccd herein bbd was selected instead of ccd since fewer experiments are generally needed in bbd than in ccd both methods offer almost the same outputs 29 the typical relationship between input and output parameters in rsm is given in eq 4 as follows 4 y β 0 i 1 n β i x i i 1 n β ii x i 2 i j β ij x i x j ε where y denotes the response or output x i denotes the coded inputs β o denotes the intercept β i denotes the linear effect β ii denotes the squared effect β ij denotes the interplay effect and ɛ is the error the rsm with bbd gives three coded points for each variable i e 1 0 1 the level and range for each independent variable are shown in table 1 the relationship between coded and natural variables is expressed as below 5 coded value natural value mean 1 2 range the experimental design matrix is given in table 2 all laboratory runs were accomplished based on this experimental matrix and real life experimental data were assessed using multiple regression analysis via minitab software v 18 all the assessments were conducted utilizing the data obtained from the microalgae culture on the eighth day since the end of the exponential growth phase and the maximum elimination efficiencies of both n and p were observed on this day a bbd regression model was separately constructed for each response 2 3 2 ann modeling typically an ann is divided into three sublayers input hidden and output however it must be noted that an ann can contain one or more hidden layers depending on the application of the network connections among layers can be occurred by the following equation 6 z j f i 1 n xw b i where w denotes the weight b indicates the bias f is the operating function and x and z are the i th input and j th output respectively this investigation constructed a multilayer perceptron neural network mlp ann with two hidden layers model to anticipate the microalgae based n and p removal efficiencies from domestic wastewater the data were split into three subsets training 70 validation 15 and testing 15 to evaluate overfitting and the generalization ability of the network the inputs or features used in the network were t ld and n p ratio the output parameter was either the n or p removal efficiency several popular transfer activation functions viz linear logarithmic sigmoidal hyperbolic tangent sigmoid were applied in the hidden and output layers several training algorithms viz gradient descent scaled conjugate gradient trainscg gradient descent with momentum levenberg marquat trainlm and quasi newton were surveyed the ann performance depends highly on the hyperparameters e g training algorithm hidden layers the number of neurons in each layer in this respect k fold cross validation and boa were used simultaneously to tune the hyperparameters which are presented shortly as below k fold cross validation all datasets are separated equally into 5 subclasses one dataset is picked up as the testing subgroup while the other subgroups are applied as training subclasses this procedure is repeated k times and as such each subset is engaged once for testing generally the model s generalization capability w r t rmse improves with the high number of subgroups but raises the computational cost thus a trade off is necessary by an operator boa it was applied to tune the ann hyperparameters e g hidden units to find the best neural network leading to the highest performance this technique builds an objective function model and utilizes it to select the most prospective hyperparameters to assess the true objection function it can be written as follows 7 x arg min xϵx f x where f x denotes an objective score to lower the error rate on the validation set x denotes the set of hyperparameters that provides the low grade and x is any value of the space x boa was chosen in this investigation since it is more effective and powerful than others e g manual grid search random search gravity search algorithm particle swarm optimization this is an orderly technique for global optimization of black box function that does not involve derivatives 57 58 the significant attributes of this process are the usage of an acquisition function that measures the next point to assess the number of hidden layers the optimum number of neurons in each layer and the training algorithm were optimized based on the rmse value 59 the matlab version r 2019a platform was used for the mlp ann modeling a flow diagram of the established hybrid k fold cross validation and boa for hyper parameters optimization is shown in fig 2 2 3 3 svr modeling the hyperparameters in svr modeling include loss function ε gaussian width parameter γ and box constraint c low or high values for these parameters may lead to underfitting or overfitting in predictions the kernel functions viz linear polynomial gaussian play an essential role in the svr model structure thus tuning all the parameters including kernel function is necessary to certify optimum model performance when predicting unseen data in this respect the hyperparameters are optimized by conducting two tasks i cross validation and ii bayesian optimization briefly both techniques are discussed above the matlab version r 2019a platform was also applied for the svr based modeling 2 4 evaluation of model forecasting ability using simulated data the forecasting capability of the established best model was analyzed further by applying the unseen data in this respect extra 700 simulated datasets under different experimental conditions were generated randomly using the bootstrap 60 and rsm methods the bootstrap method is a popular method that requires iteratively resampling a dataset with replacement the coded ranges of all independent variables temperature light dark cycle and nitrogen phosphorus ratio were taken as 1 to 1 similar as shown in table 1 with the percentage removal of both n and p in the range of 0 to 100 2 5 optimization of the process variable a multiobjective optimization technique based on a trade off was used to find global optimal input conditions that simultaneously eliminate the maximum amount of n and p from wastewater in this respect the ga was integrated with the svr model using the matlab version r 2019a environment the details of ga have been well established 54 61 generally it involves steps such as initialization selection fitness evaluation followed by several operators reproduction crossover and mutation over subsequent generations the population evolves to an optimal solution a linear combined objective function y was made as shown below 62 8 maximize y p 1 y 1 p 2 y 2 subject to p 1 p 2 1 and 0 p i 1 i where y1 and y2 are the fitness functions for n and p removal respectively here p 1 p 2 1 denotes the totality terms of the weight while 0 p i 1 i ensures the nonnegativity state 2 6 model performance metrics the performance of each developed model was evaluated using multiple model performance metrics of re r2 mae rmse and fb and residual analysis 26 63 64 these indicators were calculated with the following equations 9 residual y exp y p 10 relative error re y exp y p y exp 100 11 coefficient of determination r 2 1 i 1 n y exp y p 2 i 1 n y exp y exp 2 12 mean absolute error mae i 1 n y exp y p n 13 root mean square error rmse i 1 n y

of data 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary study for n and p removal ability of microalgae generally microalgae are suitable for tertiary and quaternary domestic wastewater treatments due to their ability to intake inorganic n and p for reproduction and growth initially the biomass of chlorella kessleri was grown in a bioreactor holding bbm to characterize the time resolved growth performance of chlorella kessleri sp fig 3 shows the growth phenomena of chlorella kessleri for two operating conditions i e normal growth and control growth it can be observed from this figure that microalgae biomass growth was not observed until the third day of the incubation period which is termed the lag phase after three days the microalgae growth increased exponentially until the eighth day termed the exponential growth phase afterward the stationary phase was observed based on the experimental data of this species under different operating conditions maximum specific growth and biomass productivity were estimated to be 0 446 d 1 and 0 0413 g l 1d 1 respectively initially the essential components in the bbm were n 42 0 mg l 1 and p 53 0 mg l 1 the microalgae consumption rates of these nutrients were investigated by collecting daily samples during the growth period and analyzing their n and p contents fig 4 shows both n and p consumptions rates by microalgae and the percentage removals of these nutrients generally nutrient i e n and p remediation with microalgae is achieved via either interconnected biochemical pathways that transform the nutrients into the biomass or assimilate them into proteins and nucleic acids for biomass production 13 65 66 according to the molecular formula of microalgae c106h263o110n16p 0 063 g of n and 0 009 g of p are required to accumulate 1 g of biomass thus the p uptake by microalgae is constantly lower than the n uptake since the n amount of microalgae is nearly ten times higher than that of the p amount 18 67 the results indicated that the n was the limiting factor and its uptake rate was higher than that of p which agreed with this phenomenon 3 2 development of rsm models the real life experimental data obtained from laboratory runs for removal n and p were utilized to generate optimal rsm ann and svr models table 3 shows the observed and forecasted values of r for n with each model and corresponding res values in contrast table 4 presents the experimental and projected values of r for p with each model and corresponding res values all the laboratory trial data were overlapped with the forecasted data with the svr approach exhibiting better performance of the svr models for both responses the relative errors re for each of the data points related to the removal of n and p are presented in tables 3 and 4 respectively the highest re was perceived in the rsm model compared to ann and svr demonstrating the poor performance of the response models in both cases a comparable re was discerned for the n removal efficiency in the ann and svr models the rsm with bbd based models were generated using these data multiple regression analysis was applied to examine the results the forecasting models for the removal of n and p were stated using eqs 15 and 16 respectively as follows 15 y 1 96 8 40 49 x 1 16 49 x 2 1 02 x 3 29 0 x 1 2 18 3 x 2 2 17 5 x 3 2 7 1 x 1 x 2 1 0 x 1 x 3 1 1 x 2 x 3 16 y 2 44 7 19 66 x 1 9 63 x 2 0 89 x 3 4 62 x 1 2 6 40 x 2 2 1 73 x 3 3 4 35 x 1 x 2 19 98 x 1 x 3 26 90 x 2 x 3 where y1 and y2 are the n and p elimination efficiencies respectively x 1 x 2 and x 3 are the independent factors of the t ld and n p ratio respectively the ranges of each parameter are shown in table 1 the developed rsm models are applicable for any values within the range of each independent variable the main effect and interaction plots were generated to evaluate the effect of environmental parameters t ld and n p ratio on responses n and p elimination efficiencies see fig 5 typically the variation of the independent parameters inputs influences the output differently if the main effect line is parallel to the horizontal it implies the output is not influenced explicitly by the investigated input variables alternatively if the main effect line makes a sharp slope then deterministically the output is controlled by the input variables the data in fig 5 a b indicated that the maximum removal efficiencies of both n and p were observed at a low level of the x 1 t with more than intermediate levels of x 2 ld and x 3 n p ratio respectively such behavior indicates that all environmental parameters influence the response parameters n and p removal rate however the relative importance of the input factors on outputs is found as a decreasing order of t ld n p ratio see fig 5a and fig 5b the removal efficiency of n increases up to a certain point and then decreases with the increased levels of both ld and n p ratio factors see fig 5a a similar pattern is observed in the case of p removal efficiency with the levels of t and ld in contrast the way shows the opposite with the level of n p ratio as p removal efficiencies decreased with increased n p ratio up to a certain level and then started slightly increase see fig 5b the interaction plot evaluates the interplay of two independent variables on responses it is a noteworthy aspect that parallel lines suggest no interaction a higher magnitude of slope between the lines indicates a higher value of interaction the interaction effects of the input variables on both the outputs are displayed in fig 5 c d the data indicated that all input factors have interactions with all the responses three dimensional surface plots were generated for both responses using minitab v 18 software to evaluate further the relationship between dependent and independent variables as shown in fig s1 a f all input variables have some effect on the responses n and p removal efficiencies similar interaction effects within variables were also observed as discussed in fig 5 although all investigated operating factors are important in removing n and p from domestic wastewater it is imperative to understand whether these parameters and models are statistically significant or not in this respect analysis of variance anova was investigated table 5 a b present the anova results of the regression models for removal efficiencies of n and p the significance for each term of the model was evaluated by their respective p values in the anova table it is well known that the lower the p value indicates the higher significance of the corresponding term a p value 0 05 is deemed strongly significant at 5 level or 95 confidence interval while 0 05 p value 0 1 is treated as significant at 10 level or 90 confidence interval on the other hand if a p value 0 1 the term is assumed to be insignificant data suggested that both models were significant at a 10 significance level or 90 confidence interval all p values 0 1 table 5a shows that x 1 and x 1 2 are statistically significant at p values 0 1 while all other terms including quadratics and interactions are insignificant similarly table 5b indicates that x 1 x 1 x 3 x 2 x 3 are statistically significant while all remaining terms are insignificant 3 3 development of ann models an mlp ann was chosen to predict the microalgae based n and p removal efficiencies from municipal wastewater in this respect three features t n p and ld and two target variables n and p elimination efficiencies were considered the training data 70 were utilized to estimate the model parameters of w and b as mentioned in eq 5 while the validation data 15 were applied to determine the network s generalization it is important to note that training was discontinued when the generalization stopped evolving the testing data did not have an impact on training and therefore provided a bias free performance the hyperbolic tangent activation function was found appropriate for the hidden layer the linear activation function was utilized for the output layer to obtain the optimal neural network configuration initially both one and two hidden layers were tested boa was used for both cases to find the best hyperparameters after several experiments each included 30 iterations the optimized mlp ann models were developed for the n and p elimination efficiencies the neural network with two hidden layers gave a better performance low mae and rmse while high r values in both responses see table s2 the optimized ann structure is shown in fig 6 which comprised three input neurons e g t ld and n p two intermediate hidden layers and one output layer the n or p elimination efficiency for the n removal 15 neurons in the first hidden layer and 3 in the second hidden layer were observed see fig 6a in the case of p removal efficiency 13 neurons in the first hidden layer and 15 neurons in the second hidden layer were found see fig 6b a plot mse vs epoch was created for both responses to find the best ann model as shown in fig 7 generally more epochs suggest the more computational elapsed time for training training stopped concerning adaptive weight minimization at 25 epochs for n removal and 14 epochs for p removal see fig 7 the highest validation was achieved at the lowest mse with 19 and 8 epochs for n and p removal efficiencies respectively the errors for both the validation and test sets are identical characteristics suggesting no overfitting table 6 presents the tuned hyperparameters of the ann models developed for the n and p removal efficiencies to understand the impacts of the input variables on responses sensitivity analysis was conducted 68 69 fig s2 shows the relative contribution of the independent factors t ld n p on the responses elimination efficiencies of n and p based on the contributions the input factors can be ranked in order of t ld n p which agrees with the rsm result however it is not necessary that all methods provide the same rank of the input variable for a given process the relative rank of the input variables may differ concerning the ability of used methods to classify the input variables 68 69 3 4 developments of svr models similar to optimal mlp ann models the svr models were established via 15 datasets input output pairs for the n and p elimination efficiencies see tables 3 and 4 respectively it must be mentioned that the k fold cross validation was applied against overfitting all the hyperparameters e g kernel function type c ɛ γ were tuned automatically within a wide range type using boa along with 5 fold cross validation it is noteworthy that the automatic tuning option within a wide range reduces the uncertainty of the parameters since boa uses statistical learning theory besides the 5 fold cross validation was applied to prevent overfitting of the model with less computing time maximum precision was achieved using the polynomial kernel function the optimal model was then selected using the hyperparameters presented in table 7 3 5 performance evaluations and comparison of soft computing approaches data for simultaneous n and p eliminations attained from the model predictions using the three soft computing techniques e g rsm ann and svr were shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively these approaches were analyzed and compared interchangeably to find out the best predictive method that produces the optimum results with the highest level of accuracy the results of residual analyses are presented in fig 8 it is a noteworthy aspect that the model is suitable if residuals are scattered around 0 line high values of residuals are observed in rsm and thus the data points are located far from 0 line indicating poor performance alternatively all the plots mlp ann and svr suggest that the data points of residuals are observed close to 0 line resulting in the strong reliability of the established models additional to residual analysis parity plots for observed and predicted removal efficiencies for the n and p with rsm ann and svr modeling have been shown in fig 9 to evaluate the accuracy of each developed model as presented in fig 9a the r2 values for the rsm ann and svr models for n removal efficiency were estimated to be 0 8653 0 9994 and 0 9996 respectively similarly the r2 values for p removal efficiency were 0 8293 0 9122 and 0 9592 respectively see fig 9b high values of r2 0 82 were observed for all cases indicating a proper fit and thus it could be claimed that the anticipated outputs are in good agreement with the laboratory results besides a performance improvement for n removal efficiency of 13 43 was observed in the svr model compared to rsm while only a 0 02 improvement was observed concerning mlp ann model based on r2 values similarly a performance improvement for p removal efficiency with the svr approach was 13 54 compared to rsm while only a 4 89 improvement was observed compared to mlp ann hence comparable performances were identified for n removal efficiency in both mlp ann however the svr model was observed to be superior to mlp ann for phosphorus removal forecasting to further assess the models the data in table 8 were compared using some performance grading criteria namely mae rmse and fb based on mae the svr model outperforms the rsm and ann models in predicting n removal efficiency with a performance improvement of 95 59 and 35 45 respectively based on the same indicator the performance of the svr model for the forecasting of p is augmented for rsm of 80 69 and ann of 60 60 respectively similarly based on the rmse the svr model for n removal efficiency performed better than either the rsm or ann with performance augmentations of 94 61 and 34 19 respectively for p removal these values were 50 54 and 31 78 respectively the values of fb for all soft computing techniques for both n and p removal efficiencies were measured to be close to zero see table 8 typically the prediction ability of a model is satisfactory if fb 0 5 70 71 therefore in this study the results specified that all the models applied were reliable in their forecastings however the optimal svr model indicated better performance overall than the other two approaches because estimated r for both n and p were closer to the experimental data one of our recent studies dealing with comparative performance analysis of svr and mlp ann to predict municipal solid waste msw in bahrain also found the better performance of svr 72 notably the svr model can perform better even with minor data points 35 our result is aligned with this investigation 3 6 assessment of the prediction ability of svr model using extra simulated data since the experimental dataset was small the prediction ability of the svr model was validated further using extra simulated data 700 it is important to note that these additional datasets were not involved in the training applying the identical hyperparameters see table 7 the prediction performance of the proposed svr model was assessed fig 10 reveals the fitted linear plot for simulated and predicted data the values of r2 for both responses n and p removals were greater than 0 9 suggesting an acceptable fit this supported a good correlation between the simulated outside experimental datapoints and predicted values besides the mae values for n and p removal were 0 3305 and 0 1591 respectively on the other hand rmse values for n and p were calculated to be 1 8921 and 1 3596 respectively low error mae and rmse values suggested that the svr model is competent to forecast unseen data within the range of each factor 3 7 multiobjective optimization the svr models were set as the objective function and hybridized with ga it is notable that the performance of ga heavily depends on its parameters thus these parameters such as the population size of 50 crossover function of constraint dependent mutation function of constraint dependent crossover fraction of 0 8 and migration fraction of 0 2 were selected by trial and error these values were taken as the optimum simulation criteria of the hybrid svr ga algorithm fig 11 shows a convergence plot of fitness versus generation it is evident that the combined n and p removal fitness value decreased in the first generation and remained constant for the rest of the generations after 3rd generation the optimization process was terminated this suggests that no likely mutation or crossover exist within the genes that could influence the n and p removal efficiency the coded optimal conditions for the independent parameters were obtained to be x1 t of 0 0683 x2 ld cycle of 0 999 and x3 np ratio of 0 999 respectively using hybrid svr ga the corresponding natural values were calculated to be 29 3 c 6 1 of n p and 24 0 h h of ld with n and p removal of 99 97 and 93 48 respectively a higher n removal efficiency compared to p by microalgae agrees with the literature 18 67 the predicted optimal set was validated further in the laboratory trial with less than 5 error for both cases n and p removal suggesting that the optimal point found by the svr ga was robust and reliable 3 8 practical implications and comparative analysis excessive nutrients viz n p in wastewater can lead to eutrophication and disturb the ecosystem hence eliminating total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp from wastewater is crucial to reducing the receiving streams oxygen requirement saving aquatic life and preventing eutrophication in lakes and streams that protect human health recently microalgae based nutrient removal from wastewater showed great promise the most widely used microalgae cultures for nutrient removal are based on microalgae species of chlorella and scenedesmus a comparative nutrient removal performance in this study with previous literature reports is displayed in table 9 some values of nutrients tn tp removal and maximum biomass production of chlorella kessleri are higher comparable or less with some reports this disparity can be explained due to the fact that the strain type growth conditions e g growth media photoperiod photo intensity ph temperature culture time of co2 np ratio initial nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations type of reactor type of process are entirely different than this study in most studies the operating variables that removed tn and tp were not optimized statistically or advanced techniques suggesting a suboptimal solution on the other hand an intelligence based approach was employed to find the optimal point for removing tn and tp in this study this may augment the tn and tp eliminationl efficiencies from wastewater in comparison to other investigations the efficacy of microalgae based nutrient removal tn and tp from municipal wastewater is highly dependent on several critical environmental parameters however investigating the impact of all operating variables is costly time consuming and sometimes impossible the developed soft computing modeling encompasses broader aspects of key operating factors contributing to tn and tp removal efficiencies from low to high possible range finally an effective technology may develop for excellent prediction of the nutrient removal from wastewater currently soft computing modeling shows excellent promise in the analysis of engineering data hence this investigation is significant as it contains experimental investigation soft computing modeling and process optimization although elimination of tn and tp does not imply all the expectations and efficacy of wastewater treatment the current results may offer essential primary data for the scale up of the process pilot plant scale in microalgae based nutrient removal as well as municipal wastewater treatment 4 conclusions herein microalgae chlorella kessleri sp based municipal wastewater treatment for simultaneous n and p removal was investigated a preliminary experimental study showed that microalgae can remove both n and p from domestic wastewater successfully three soft computing approaches rsm ann and svr were applied to develop novel models for predicting the total n and p removal capabilities in aqueous systems using microalgae in this regard real life experimental data obtained via the design of the experiment e g bbd matrix were employed anova analyses indicated that all operational variables were significant the svr model exhibited superior performance with higher anticipation accuracy compared to mlp ann and rsm models smaller error values mae 0 5079 for n removal and 1 8936 for p removal rmse 0 7819 for n removal and 5 3534 for p removal with higher r2 values 99 96 for n removal and 95 92 for p removal were obtained by the svr model the svr model performance was validated further by the extra simulated data for finding the optimal global conditions to maximize nutrient removal efficiencies the developed svr models were coupled with ga as such a hybrid platform svr ga was developed the maximum n and p removal efficiencies were 93 with an optimal set 29 3 c 6 1 of n p and 24 0 h h of ld these soft computing approaches could be recommended for the wastewater treatment plant operators to improve the simultaneous n and p removal efficiencies this novel hybrid platform could be pretty practical and cost effective for

13223,this study develops empirical models for the prediction of the removal efficiencies of inorganic nitrogen n and phosphorus p from municipal wastewater using microalgae chlorella kessleri our work identified the effects of operational parameters of temperature t light dark cycle ld and nitrate to phosphate n p ratio on simultaneous n and p removal three competitive soft computing techniques known as response surface methodology rsm multilayer perceptron artificial neural network mlp ann and support vector regression svr were applied to construct the predictive models using real life experimental data obtained via the box behnken design bbd matrix a bayesian optimization algorithm was applied to automatically tune the hyperparameters to develop optimized mlp ann and svr models the overall results exhibited that the svr model is better than mlp ann and rsm models to assess simultaneous n and p removal efficiencies the extra simulated data further confirmed the prediction capability of the developed svr models under different conditions finally the models developed by svr were hybridized with a genetic algorithm ga to maximize the nutrient n and p removal

wastewater treatment plants can generate severe ecological and public health challenges by causing various water borne diseases the forensics of municipal wastewater show high concentrations of inorganic nitrogen n phosphorus p organics and suspended and dissolved solids n and p are the essential nutrients that support the growth of algae the excess growth of algae results in eutrophication in water bodies furthermore a high level of inorganics can cause groundwater contamination 1 it is expected that the world will face up to a 40 water shortfall by 2030 a significant challenge for sustainable development from both the societal and economic perspectives 2 thus it is imperative to obtain an effective means of municipal wastewater treatment lowering total n and p levels to an acceptable limit is essential to implementing more stringent treated sewage effluent discharge limits the aerobic activated sludge process chemical phosphorus removal nitrification denitrification process and coagulation followed by sedimentation are typical wastewater treatment technologies used to remove these nutrients 3 4 the n and p removal performances of these technologies are generally at an acceptable level however high energy consumption during aeration transferring sludge from one tank to another instability in treatment performances carbon emissions lengthy processing waste of recyclable resources and generation of excessive amounts of sludge are major drawbacks 2 5 6 recently microalgae based wastewater treatment has gained appreciable interest due to its nutrient recovery ability and advanced level of treatment performance 7 higher nutrient removal efficiencies lower cost lower energy consumption and facilitation of resource recycling are some of the significant advantages of microalgae based wastewater treatment 4 8 9 the microalgal biomass produced during wastewater treatment may also bring extra potential value since biomass is used as feedstock in biorefinery co2 fixation from flue gases and other promising applications e g biofuel agar dyes fertilizers animal and human food 10 11 thus municipal wastewater treatment by microalgae is a sustainable solution for simultaneous n and p removal and co2 obliteration ji et al 12 reported approximately 100 removal of n and p from tertiary municipal wastewater using three different strains of microalgae chlorella vulgaris scenedesmus obliquus and ourococcus multisporus besides several microalgae species such as scenedesmus dimorphus spirulina maxima dunaliella salina and others including chlorella kessleri have been used successfully for n and p removal from municipal wastewater 13 14 however in real life the performance of nutrients removal utilizing microalgae is dependent on several parameters including the microalgae strain type initial co2 concentration light intensity light dark cycle ld initial ph temperature t and feed water nutrient load especially the nitrogen phosphorus ratio n p 14 15 among these t n p ratio and ld are vital parameters in the nutrient elimination process where nutrients inorganic are transformed into organic materials 16 19 t and ld play a key role in understanding the practical applications of outdoor cultivations the n p ratio may differ with the specific type and wastewater source while microalgae could coordinate the n p ratio in biomass inside the cell based on the wastewater nutrient concentration the primary outcome is that although the variation of the n p ratio affects the growth rate microalgae is suitable for nutrient removal efficiently along with other parameters it is a noteworthy aspect that studies of the effect of each variable on maximizing n and p removal efficiencies need a significant number of experimental laboratory runs it thus requires the allocation of substantial time and resources to prevent these hurdles statistical or mathematical modeling offers an innovative and practical approach to investigating complex and multiresponse parameter systems 20 21 alternative operational strategies can be evaluated without the need for physical trials for each scenario 22 23 mathematical models developed by influential variables can be used for the performance assessment based on process variability and set new operating conditions to improve stability safeguard the effluent quality and lower operational costs 24 25 rsm ann and svr are potential soft computing modeling techniques known for their high precision for predicting process performance they have many applications in several fields 26 28 rsm modeling lowers the number of laboratory runs predicts responses with good precision and successfully optimizes independent variables 29 30 biological wastewater treatments processes often encounter difficulties since some critical operational parameters viz t ld are subject to considerable seasonal changes as such the performance of wastewater treatment utilizing microalgae as well as biomass production may fluctuate throughout the year in this regard the experimental investigation combined with advanced modeling may become a powerful platform for effectively predicting nutrient removal efficiencies ann computational models were developed to evaluate aerobic biological wastewater treatment processes they were the most widely used artificial intelligence ai technique in the journal papers published in this field between 1995 and 2019 31 they are created from hundreds of basic units or neurons associated with weights to form neural networks 32 33 svr is an extension of support vector machine svm due to regression to model intrinsically complex systems and enlighten either linear or quadratic patterns to the output using descriptors 34 the significant features of the svr comprise the utilization of an appropriate hyperplane reduction of empirical risk non convergence to a local minimum and high stability and performance 35 36 the strength of svr materializes with its low sensitivity to overfitting and dimensionality due to avoidance of local minima hence the solution of svr is the global optimum 37 the svr acquires an efficient algorithm to minimize structural risk following the introduction of a loss function hence it has more significant potential to generalize non linear input output relationships 38 39 the generalization principle of structural risk minimization was proposed to prevent overfitting with a compromise between frequency of training error and confidence interval by changing vapnik cheronenkis vc dimension 40 furthermore svr intuitively determines model complexity by governing the number of support vectors 41 numerous studies have used ai modeling in the field of wastewater treatment 42 46 applications of ann modeling were used in nanocatalysts nanohybrid composites based water purification 47 49 ansari et al 42 developed the ann technique for microalgae based wastewater treatment by considering several input factors e g temperature ph dissolved oxygen electrical conductivity no3 po4 3 svm and adaptive neuro fuzzy based models have also been developed to assess the removal efficiency of n from an aerobic biological wastewater treatment plant 50 however no published research has simultaneously predicted total n and p removal efficiencies based on input factors related to wastewater treatment up to our knowledge in the present study rsm ann and svr modeling approaches were utilized to forecast the simultaneous n and p removal efficiencies with microalgae based municipal wastewater treatment a bayesian optimization algorithm was applied to tune the hyperparameters of both mlp ann and svr for finding the optimized ai models hereof the impacts of three key process parameters t ld and n p ratios on simultaneous n and p removals were investigated the rsm mlp ann and svr models were then independently developed and their forecasting performances against experimental results were compared using several statistical metrics such as relative error re coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and fractional bias fb a multiobjective optimization approach was carried out based on trade offs to find the optimal global conditions that simultaneously maximize both n and p efficiencies removal several well known techniques are utilized for global optimization of process variables viz the genetic algorithm ga harmony searches hs particle swarm optimization pso and ant colony optimization co 51 53 however ga is very popular and widely used for global optimization 54 thus the best predictive models were hybridized with ga to optimize the nutrient removal process operational parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 growth of microalgae at the laboratory chlorella kessleri sp utex 263 strain were obtained from the university of texas usa culture collection a synthetic municipal wastewater media bold s basal medium bbm was utilized for microalgae growth the composition of bbm is analogous to the secondary discharge of domestic wastewater treatment plants rich in nitrate nitrogen and phosphate phosphorus see supplementary table s1 the initial ph was adjusted to 7 0 by adding 0 1 m naoh several molar ratios of n p 1 1 3 1 and 6 1 were made separately based on molecular weight in this regard the weight of n was fixed same as bbm and the corresponding weight of p was added into the growth media to obtain selected n p ratios selected n p ratios are generally within the average ranges of municipal wastewater 14 15 the microalgae were grown in one litter erlenmeyer flasks as bioreactors fig 1 a hemocytometer was used to count the cell numbers for following up the growth stages of microalgae an inoculum concentration of 2 2 107 cells ml 1 was maintained constant in a 500 ml working volume for all consequent laboratory runs grolux fluorescent bulbs located in a wooden frame were used to supply light energy intensity 65 μmol m 2 s 1 for microalgae growth a mixture of gas 4 co2 and 96 atmospheric air was injected steadily into the culture a particular set of experimental conditions t of 30 c ld of 12 12 h h and n p molar ratio of 3 1 was utilized to obtain a representative microalgae growth curve a control experiment was also conducted with the same experimental conditions without using microalgae a particular volume 2 ml of the microalgal solution was obtained and filtered through vacuum filtration to estimate the biomass density the biomass sample was washed with dh2o twice and dried at 55 c using an oven until a stable mass was achieved the microalgal growth parameters specific growth rate biomass productivity were estimated from laboratory results using eqs 1 and 2 as below 29 30 55 1 μ ln n 2 n 1 t 2 t 1 2 p b x t x o t x t o where μ d 1 denotes specific growth rate pb gdw l 1 d 1 indicates biomass productivity n 1 and n 2 denote the biomass density g l at the starting time t 1 and end time t 2 of the log phase respectively x t denotes the biomass density g l at the end of the growth span t x and x o is the primary biomass density g l at zero days t0 2 2 measurement of n and p elimination efficiencies n and p removal r performances were determined by computing the amount of each nutrient removed by the growth medium via eq 3 a hach dr3900tm spectrophotometer was used to quantify the n while a hash drb200 reactor was utilized to measure p content in the medium the filtrate acquired during the calculation of the dry biomass weight was revealed for both n and p via the chromotropic acid and molybdovanatedate techniques with acid persulfate digestion respectively based on the procedures recorded in 59 60 3 r c 0 c 1 c 0 100 where c0 denotes n or p concentration before treatment mg l 1 c1 indicates n or p concentration after treatment mg l 1 r represents the percentage removal of those selected nutrients 2 3 soft computing approaches 2 3 1 experimental design and modeling by rsm rsm is an integrated statistical and mathematical approach used for empirical modeling and optimization 29 30 56 it is classified mainly into two designs box behnken design bbd and central composite design ccd herein bbd was selected instead of ccd since fewer experiments are generally needed in bbd than in ccd both methods offer almost the same outputs 29 the typical relationship between input and output parameters in rsm is given in eq 4 as follows 4 y β 0 i 1 n β i x i i 1 n β ii x i 2 i j β ij x i x j ε where y denotes the response or output x i denotes the coded inputs β o denotes the intercept β i denotes the linear effect β ii denotes the squared effect β ij denotes the interplay effect and ɛ is the error the rsm with bbd gives three coded points for each variable i e 1 0 1 the level and range for each independent variable are shown in table 1 the relationship between coded and natural variables is expressed as below 5 coded value natural value mean 1 2 range the experimental design matrix is given in table 2 all laboratory runs were accomplished based on this experimental matrix and real life experimental data were assessed using multiple regression analysis via minitab software v 18 all the assessments were conducted utilizing the data obtained from the microalgae culture on the eighth day since the end of the exponential growth phase and the maximum elimination efficiencies of both n and p were observed on this day a bbd regression model was separately constructed for each response 2 3 2 ann modeling typically an ann is divided into three sublayers input hidden and output however it must be noted that an ann can contain one or more hidden layers depending on the application of the network connections among layers can be occurred by the following equation 6 z j f i 1 n xw b i where w denotes the weight b indicates the bias f is the operating function and x and z are the i th input and j th output respectively this investigation constructed a multilayer perceptron neural network mlp ann with two hidden layers model to anticipate the microalgae based n and p removal efficiencies from domestic wastewater the data were split into three subsets training 70 validation 15 and testing 15 to evaluate overfitting and the generalization ability of the network the inputs or features used in the network were t ld and n p ratio the output parameter was either the n or p removal efficiency several popular transfer activation functions viz linear logarithmic sigmoidal hyperbolic tangent sigmoid were applied in the hidden and output layers several training algorithms viz gradient descent scaled conjugate gradient trainscg gradient descent with momentum levenberg marquat trainlm and quasi newton were surveyed the ann performance depends highly on the hyperparameters e g training algorithm hidden layers the number of neurons in each layer in this respect k fold cross validation and boa were used simultaneously to tune the hyperparameters which are presented shortly as below k fold cross validation all datasets are separated equally into 5 subclasses one dataset is picked up as the testing subgroup while the other subgroups are applied as training subclasses this procedure is repeated k times and as such each subset is engaged once for testing generally the model s generalization capability w r t rmse improves with the high number of subgroups but raises the computational cost thus a trade off is necessary by an operator boa it was applied to tune the ann hyperparameters e g hidden units to find the best neural network leading to the highest performance this technique builds an objective function model and utilizes it to select the most prospective hyperparameters to assess the true objection function it can be written as follows 7 x arg min xϵx f x where f x denotes an objective score to lower the error rate on the validation set x denotes the set of hyperparameters that provides the low grade and x is any value of the space x boa was chosen in this investigation since it is more effective and powerful than others e g manual grid search random search gravity search algorithm particle swarm optimization this is an orderly technique for global optimization of black box function that does not involve derivatives 57 58 the significant attributes of this process are the usage of an acquisition function that measures the next point to assess the number of hidden layers the optimum number of neurons in each layer and the training algorithm were optimized based on the rmse value 59 the matlab version r 2019a platform was used for the mlp ann modeling a flow diagram of the established hybrid k fold cross validation and boa for hyper parameters optimization is shown in fig 2 2 3 3 svr modeling the hyperparameters in svr modeling include loss function ε gaussian width parameter γ and box constraint c low or high values for these parameters may lead to underfitting or overfitting in predictions the kernel functions viz linear polynomial gaussian play an essential role in the svr model structure thus tuning all the parameters including kernel function is necessary to certify optimum model performance when predicting unseen data in this respect the hyperparameters are optimized by conducting two tasks i cross validation and ii bayesian optimization briefly both techniques are discussed above the matlab version r 2019a platform was also applied for the svr based modeling 2 4 evaluation of model forecasting ability using simulated data the forecasting capability of the established best model was analyzed further by applying the unseen data in this respect extra 700 simulated datasets under different experimental conditions were generated randomly using the bootstrap 60 and rsm methods the bootstrap method is a popular method that requires iteratively resampling a dataset with replacement the coded ranges of all independent variables temperature light dark cycle and nitrogen phosphorus ratio were taken as 1 to 1 similar as shown in table 1 with the percentage removal of both n and p in the range of 0 to 100 2 5 optimization of the process variable a multiobjective optimization technique based on a trade off was used to find global optimal input conditions that simultaneously eliminate the maximum amount of n and p from wastewater in this respect the ga was integrated with the svr model using the matlab version r 2019a environment the details of ga have been well established 54 61 generally it involves steps such as initialization selection fitness evaluation followed by several operators reproduction crossover and mutation over subsequent generations the population evolves to an optimal solution a linear combined objective function y was made as shown below 62 8 maximize y p 1 y 1 p 2 y 2 subject to p 1 p 2 1 and 0 p i 1 i where y1 and y2 are the fitness functions for n and p removal respectively here p 1 p 2 1 denotes the totality terms of the weight while 0 p i 1 i ensures the nonnegativity state 2 6 model performance metrics the performance of each developed model was evaluated using multiple model performance metrics of re r2 mae rmse and fb and residual analysis 26 63 64 these indicators were calculated with the following equations 9 residual y exp y p 10 relative error re y exp y p y exp 100 11 coefficient of determination r 2 1 i 1 n y exp y p 2 i 1 n y exp y exp 2 12 mean absolute error mae i 1 n y exp y p n 13 root mean square error rmse i 1 n y

of data 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary study for n and p removal ability of microalgae generally microalgae are suitable for tertiary and quaternary domestic wastewater treatments due to their ability to intake inorganic n and p for reproduction and growth initially the biomass of chlorella kessleri was grown in a bioreactor holding bbm to characterize the time resolved growth performance of chlorella kessleri sp fig 3 shows the growth phenomena of chlorella kessleri for two operating conditions i e normal growth and control growth it can be observed from this figure that microalgae biomass growth was not observed until the third day of the incubation period which is termed the lag phase after three days the microalgae growth increased exponentially until the eighth day termed the exponential growth phase afterward the stationary phase was observed based on the experimental data of this species under different operating conditions maximum specific growth and biomass productivity were estimated to be 0 446 d 1 and 0 0413 g l 1d 1 respectively initially the essential components in the bbm were n 42 0 mg l 1 and p 53 0 mg l 1 the microalgae consumption rates of these nutrients were investigated by collecting daily samples during the growth period and analyzing their n and p contents fig 4 shows both n and p consumptions rates by microalgae and the percentage removals of these nutrients generally nutrient i e n and p remediation with microalgae is achieved via either interconnected biochemical pathways that transform the nutrients into the biomass or assimilate them into proteins and nucleic acids for biomass production 13 65 66 according to the molecular formula of microalgae c106h263o110n16p 0 063 g of n and 0 009 g of p are required to accumulate 1 g of biomass thus the p uptake by microalgae is constantly lower than the n uptake since the n amount of microalgae is nearly ten times higher than that of the p amount 18 67 the results indicated that the n was the limiting factor and its uptake rate was higher than that of p which agreed with this phenomenon 3 2 development of rsm models the real life experimental data obtained from laboratory runs for removal n and p were utilized to generate optimal rsm ann and svr models table 3 shows the observed and forecasted values of r for n with each model and corresponding res values in contrast table 4 presents the experimental and projected values of r for p with each model and corresponding res values all the laboratory trial data were overlapped with the forecasted data with the svr approach exhibiting better performance of the svr models for both responses the relative errors re for each of the data points related to the removal of n and p are presented in tables 3 and 4 respectively the highest re was perceived in the rsm model compared to ann and svr demonstrating the poor performance of the response models in both cases a comparable re was discerned for the n removal efficiency in the ann and svr models the rsm with bbd based models were generated using these data multiple regression analysis was applied to examine the results the forecasting models for the removal of n and p were stated using eqs 15 and 16 respectively as follows 15 y 1 96 8 40 49 x 1 16 49 x 2 1 02 x 3 29 0 x 1 2 18 3 x 2 2 17 5 x 3 2 7 1 x 1 x 2 1 0 x 1 x 3 1 1 x 2 x 3 16 y 2 44 7 19 66 x 1 9 63 x 2 0 89 x 3 4 62 x 1 2 6 40 x 2 2 1 73 x 3 3 4 35 x 1 x 2 19 98 x 1 x 3 26 90 x 2 x 3 where y1 and y2 are the n and p elimination efficiencies respectively x 1 x 2 and x 3 are the independent factors of the t ld and n p ratio respectively the ranges of each parameter are shown in table 1 the developed rsm models are applicable for any values within the range of each independent variable the main effect and interaction plots were generated to evaluate the effect of environmental parameters t ld and n p ratio on responses n and p elimination efficiencies see fig 5 typically the variation of the independent parameters inputs influences the output differently if the main effect line is parallel to the horizontal it implies the output is not influenced explicitly by the investigated input variables alternatively if the main effect line makes a sharp slope then deterministically the output is controlled by the input variables the data in fig 5 a b indicated that the maximum removal efficiencies of both n and p were observed at a low level of the x 1 t with more than intermediate levels of x 2 ld and x 3 n p ratio respectively such behavior indicates that all environmental parameters influence the response parameters n and p removal rate however the relative importance of the input factors on outputs is found as a decreasing order of t ld n p ratio see fig 5a and fig 5b the removal efficiency of n increases up to a certain point and then decreases with the increased levels of both ld and n p ratio factors see fig 5a a similar pattern is observed in the case of p removal efficiency with the levels of t and ld in contrast the way shows the opposite with the level of n p ratio as p removal efficiencies decreased with increased n p ratio up to a certain level and then started slightly increase see fig 5b the interaction plot evaluates the interplay of two independent variables on responses it is a noteworthy aspect that parallel lines suggest no interaction a higher magnitude of slope between the lines indicates a higher value of interaction the interaction effects of the input variables on both the outputs are displayed in fig 5 c d the data indicated that all input factors have interactions with all the responses three dimensional surface plots were generated for both responses using minitab v 18 software to evaluate further the relationship between dependent and independent variables as shown in fig s1 a f all input variables have some effect on the responses n and p removal efficiencies similar interaction effects within variables were also observed as discussed in fig 5 although all investigated operating factors are important in removing n and p from domestic wastewater it is imperative to understand whether these parameters and models are statistically significant or not in this respect analysis of variance anova was investigated table 5 a b present the anova results of the regression models for removal efficiencies of n and p the significance for each term of the model was evaluated by their respective p values in the anova table it is well known that the lower the p value indicates the higher significance of the corresponding term a p value 0 05 is deemed strongly significant at 5 level or 95 confidence interval while 0 05 p value 0 1 is treated as significant at 10 level or 90 confidence interval on the other hand if a p value 0 1 the term is assumed to be insignificant data suggested that both models were significant at a 10 significance level or 90 confidence interval all p values 0 1 table 5a shows that x 1 and x 1 2 are statistically significant at p values 0 1 while all other terms including quadratics and interactions are insignificant similarly table 5b indicates that x 1 x 1 x 3 x 2 x 3 are statistically significant while all remaining terms are insignificant 3 3 development of ann models an mlp ann was chosen to predict the microalgae based n and p removal efficiencies from municipal wastewater in this respect three features t n p and ld and two target variables n and p elimination efficiencies were considered the training data 70 were utilized to estimate the model parameters of w and b as mentioned in eq 5 while the validation data 15 were applied to determine the network s generalization it is important to note that training was discontinued when the generalization stopped evolving the testing data did not have an impact on training and therefore provided a bias free performance the hyperbolic tangent activation function was found appropriate for the hidden layer the linear activation function was utilized for the output layer to obtain the optimal neural network configuration initially both one and two hidden layers were tested boa was used for both cases to find the best hyperparameters after several experiments each included 30 iterations the optimized mlp ann models were developed for the n and p elimination efficiencies the neural network with two hidden layers gave a better performance low mae and rmse while high r values in both responses see table s2 the optimized ann structure is shown in fig 6 which comprised three input neurons e g t ld and n p two intermediate hidden layers and one output layer the n or p elimination efficiency for the n removal 15 neurons in the first hidden layer and 3 in the second hidden layer were observed see fig 6a in the case of p removal efficiency 13 neurons in the first hidden layer and 15 neurons in the second hidden layer were found see fig 6b a plot mse vs epoch was created for both responses to find the best ann model as shown in fig 7 generally more epochs suggest the more computational elapsed time for training training stopped concerning adaptive weight minimization at 25 epochs for n removal and 14 epochs for p removal see fig 7 the highest validation was achieved at the lowest mse with 19 and 8 epochs for n and p removal efficiencies respectively the errors for both the validation and test sets are identical characteristics suggesting no overfitting table 6 presents the tuned hyperparameters of the ann models developed for the n and p removal efficiencies to understand the impacts of the input variables on responses sensitivity analysis was conducted 68 69 fig s2 shows the relative contribution of the independent factors t ld n p on the responses elimination efficiencies of n and p based on the contributions the input factors can be ranked in order of t ld n p which agrees with the rsm result however it is not necessary that all methods provide the same rank of the input variable for a given process the relative rank of the input variables may differ concerning the ability of used methods to classify the input variables 68 69 3 4 developments of svr models similar to optimal mlp ann models the svr models were established via 15 datasets input output pairs for the n and p elimination efficiencies see tables 3 and 4 respectively it must be mentioned that the k fold cross validation was applied against overfitting all the hyperparameters e g kernel function type c ɛ γ were tuned automatically within a wide range type using boa along with 5 fold cross validation it is noteworthy that the automatic tuning option within a wide range reduces the uncertainty of the parameters since boa uses statistical learning theory besides the 5 fold cross validation was applied to prevent overfitting of the model with less computing time maximum precision was achieved using the polynomial kernel function the optimal model was then selected using the hyperparameters presented in table 7 3 5 performance evaluations and comparison of soft computing approaches data for simultaneous n and p eliminations attained from the model predictions using the three soft computing techniques e g rsm ann and svr were shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively these approaches were analyzed and compared interchangeably to find out the best predictive method that produces the optimum results with the highest level of accuracy the results of residual analyses are presented in fig 8 it is a noteworthy aspect that the model is suitable if residuals are scattered around 0 line high values of residuals are observed in rsm and thus the data points are located far from 0 line indicating poor performance alternatively all the plots mlp ann and svr suggest that the data points of residuals are observed close to 0 line resulting in the strong reliability of the established models additional to residual analysis parity plots for observed and predicted removal efficiencies for the n and p with rsm ann and svr modeling have been shown in fig 9 to evaluate the accuracy of each developed model as presented in fig 9a the r2 values for the rsm ann and svr models for n removal efficiency were estimated to be 0 8653 0 9994 and 0 9996 respectively similarly the r2 values for p removal efficiency were 0 8293 0 9122 and 0 9592 respectively see fig 9b high values of r2 0 82 were observed for all cases indicating a proper fit and thus it could be claimed that the anticipated outputs are in good agreement with the laboratory results besides a performance improvement for n removal efficiency of 13 43 was observed in the svr model compared to rsm while only a 0 02 improvement was observed concerning mlp ann model based on r2 values similarly a performance improvement for p removal efficiency with the svr approach was 13 54 compared to rsm while only a 4 89 improvement was observed compared to mlp ann hence comparable performances were identified for n removal efficiency in both mlp ann however the svr model was observed to be superior to mlp ann for phosphorus removal forecasting to further assess the models the data in table 8 were compared using some performance grading criteria namely mae rmse and fb based on mae the svr model outperforms the rsm and ann models in predicting n removal efficiency with a performance improvement of 95 59 and 35 45 respectively based on the same indicator the performance of the svr model for the forecasting of p is augmented for rsm of 80 69 and ann of 60 60 respectively similarly based on the rmse the svr model for n removal efficiency performed better than either the rsm or ann with performance augmentations of 94 61 and 34 19 respectively for p removal these values were 50 54 and 31 78 respectively the values of fb for all soft computing techniques for both n and p removal efficiencies were measured to be close to zero see table 8 typically the prediction ability of a model is satisfactory if fb 0 5 70 71 therefore in this study the results specified that all the models applied were reliable in their forecastings however the optimal svr model indicated better performance overall than the other two approaches because estimated r for both n and p were closer to the experimental data one of our recent studies dealing with comparative performance analysis of svr and mlp ann to predict municipal solid waste msw in bahrain also found the better performance of svr 72 notably the svr model can perform better even with minor data points 35 our result is aligned with this investigation 3 6 assessment of the prediction ability of svr model using extra simulated data since the experimental dataset was small the prediction ability of the svr model was validated further using extra simulated data 700 it is important to note that these additional datasets were not involved in the training applying the identical hyperparameters see table 7 the prediction performance of the proposed svr model was assessed fig 10 reveals the fitted linear plot for simulated and predicted data the values of r2 for both responses n and p removals were greater than 0 9 suggesting an acceptable fit this supported a good correlation between the simulated outside experimental datapoints and predicted values besides the mae values for n and p removal were 0 3305 and 0 1591 respectively on the other hand rmse values for n and p were calculated to be 1 8921 and 1 3596 respectively low error mae and rmse values suggested that the svr model is competent to forecast unseen data within the range of each factor 3 7 multiobjective optimization the svr models were set as the objective function and hybridized with ga it is notable that the performance of ga heavily depends on its parameters thus these parameters such as the population size of 50 crossover function of constraint dependent mutation function of constraint dependent crossover fraction of 0 8 and migration fraction of 0 2 were selected by trial and error these values were taken as the optimum simulation criteria of the hybrid svr ga algorithm fig 11 shows a convergence plot of fitness versus generation it is evident that the combined n and p removal fitness value decreased in the first generation and remained constant for the rest of the generations after 3rd generation the optimization process was terminated this suggests that no likely mutation or crossover exist within the genes that could influence the n and p removal efficiency the coded optimal conditions for the independent parameters were obtained to be x1 t of 0 0683 x2 ld cycle of 0 999 and x3 np ratio of 0 999 respectively using hybrid svr ga the corresponding natural values were calculated to be 29 3 c 6 1 of n p and 24 0 h h of ld with n and p removal of 99 97 and 93 48 respectively a higher n removal efficiency compared to p by microalgae agrees with the literature 18 67 the predicted optimal set was validated further in the laboratory trial with less than 5 error for both cases n and p removal suggesting that the optimal point found by the svr ga was robust and reliable 3 8 practical implications and comparative analysis excessive nutrients viz n p in wastewater can lead to eutrophication and disturb the ecosystem hence eliminating total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp from wastewater is crucial to reducing the receiving streams oxygen requirement saving aquatic life and preventing eutrophication in lakes and streams that protect human health recently microalgae based nutrient removal from wastewater showed great promise the most widely used microalgae cultures for nutrient removal are based on microalgae species of chlorella and scenedesmus a comparative nutrient removal performance in this study with previous literature reports is displayed in table 9 some values of nutrients tn tp removal and maximum biomass production of chlorella kessleri are higher comparable or less with some reports this disparity can be explained due to the fact that the strain type growth conditions e g growth media photoperiod photo intensity ph temperature culture time of co2 np ratio initial nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations type of reactor type of process are entirely different than this study in most studies the operating variables that removed tn and tp were not optimized statistically or advanced techniques suggesting a suboptimal solution on the other hand an intelligence based approach was employed to find the optimal point for removing tn and tp in this study this may augment the tn and tp eliminationl efficiencies from wastewater in comparison to other investigations the efficacy of microalgae based nutrient removal tn and tp from municipal wastewater is highly dependent on several critical environmental parameters however investigating the impact of all operating variables is costly time consuming and sometimes impossible the developed soft computing modeling encompasses broader aspects of key operating factors contributing to tn and tp removal efficiencies from low to high possible range finally an effective technology may develop for excellent prediction of the nutrient removal from wastewater currently soft computing modeling shows excellent promise in the analysis of engineering data hence this investigation is significant as it contains experimental investigation soft computing modeling and process optimization although elimination of tn and tp does not imply all the expectations and efficacy of wastewater treatment the current results may offer essential primary data for the scale up of the process pilot plant scale in microalgae based nutrient removal as well as municipal wastewater treatment 4 conclusions herein microalgae chlorella kessleri sp based municipal wastewater treatment for simultaneous n and p removal was investigated a preliminary experimental study showed that microalgae can remove both n and p from domestic wastewater successfully three soft computing approaches rsm ann and svr were applied to develop novel models for predicting the total n and p removal capabilities in aqueous systems using microalgae in this regard real life experimental data obtained via the design of the experiment e g bbd matrix were employed anova analyses indicated that all operational variables were significant the svr model exhibited superior performance with higher anticipation accuracy compared to mlp ann and rsm models smaller error values mae 0 5079 for n removal and 1 8936 for p removal rmse 0 7819 for n removal and 5 3534 for p removal with higher r2 values 99 96 for n removal and 95 92 for p removal were obtained by the svr model the svr model performance was validated further by the extra simulated data for finding the optimal global conditions to maximize nutrient removal efficiencies the developed svr models were coupled with ga as such a hybrid platform svr ga was developed the maximum n and p removal efficiencies were 93 with an optimal set 29 3 c 6 1 of n p and 24 0 h h of ld these soft computing approaches could be recommended for the wastewater treatment plant operators to improve the simultaneous n and p removal efficiencies this novel hybrid platform could be pretty practical and cost effective for other modeling challenges related to multivariable multiobjective bio systems credit authorship contribution statement s m zakir hossain conceptualization writing original draft n sultana formal

n content in this work complexing agents are employed to efficiently recover mn2 and nh4 n from the f emr by organic complexation firstly the nta is identified as the optimal one among different complexing agent candidates and then experimental conditions are optimized to improve the leaching performance as it turns out the nta significantly promotes the leaching of mn2 and nh4 n optimal

diffraction xrd and fourier transformed infrared ftir spectroscopy analyses demonstrate the advantage of nta in improving the leaching performance and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds analysis proves low contents of both mn2 and nh4 n in the leaching residue additionally based on density functional theory calculation and mechanism analysis it is discovered that nta and manganese ions in the f emr can form a stable mononuclear multi ring product structure promoting the leaching of mn2 and nh4 n graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrolytic manganese residue complexing agent manganese ammonia nitrogen 1 introduction manganese is a crucial metal in daily life and industrial production 1 2 with the growing global demand on manganese china is currently becoming one of major countries in the production consumption and export of electrolytic manganese metal emm 3 4 in 2020 the worldwide manganese production volume is 70 82 million metric tons and approximately half 31 67 million metric tons is manufactured in china 5 at the same time due to the decline in the grade of manganese ore increased industrial by products in wet process production influenced the manganese production 6 filter pressing electrolytic manganese residue f emr is the solid waste discharged from the filter pressing process during the production of emm 2 7 8 it contains a certain amount of ammonia nitrogen and heavy metal ions such as mn2 mg2 fe3 and al3 causing serious environmental issues 9 11 however the mn2 content in the f emr can reach 15 wt it is valuable to recovery mn2 from a large amount of f emrs for both resource utilization and environmental protection 12 13 in this context the recovery of mn2 for the improvement of emm production attracted particular attentions 14 15 different approaches such as stable immobilization electrolytic oxidation technology gas to particle conversion and biological treatment methods have been successfully utilized 1 16 19 however limitations such as high cost operational complexity and strict equipment requirements hinder their application in the large scale industrial production 20 21 complexing agents are chemicals that are capable of forming stable complexes with metal ions or other chemical entities thus recovering metals ions and preventing the re precipitation of dissolved metal ions 13 22 28 in the f emr manganese exists in variable oxidation states and it is often insoluble or unstable in aqueous media 29 therefore it can be converted into soluble metal complexes by the addition of complexing agents 30 31 commonly used complexing agents including nitrilotriacetic acid nta ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta and citric acid ca show great potentials in complexing metal ions 30 32 33 nta is a synthetic organic chelating agent that forms stable and soluble complexes with metal ions 34 edta shows strong complexation ability as it can attach to a metal ion up to six sites 35 ca is effective in complexing metals and it is readily available and relatively inexpensive in this way it is possible to recovered mn2 from the f emr by utilizing complexing agents since the complexing agent can promote the dissolution of f emr by combining with metal ions such as mn2 to form a stable complex 36 38 moreover recovery of mn2 from f mer and reducing the content of nh4 n drive emm production toward environmentally friendly technology and resource utilization toward high efficiency in order to efficiently recover mn2 from the f emr complexing agents including nta edta and ca are investigated in this work the effect of the concentration of complexing agent solid liquid ratio stirring speed and leaching time on the mn2 leaching efficiency is comprehensively studied simultaneously the removal of nh4 n from the f emr is also discussed different analytical techniques are extensively performed on the raw f emr leachate and leaching residue to evaluate the performance of complexing agent utilized for the recovery of mn2 and nh4 n in addition the interaction between the complexing agent and mn2 is explored by density functional theory calculations and the leaching mechanism of organic complexation is further analyzed 2 materials and method 2 1 manganese recovery process sulfuric acid leaching is currently the most mature method of leaching manganese ore for industrial emm production 39 the emm production consists of several key units such as milling leaching neutralization filter pressing purification and electrolysis 40 41 f emr is the residue produced from the filter pressing unit in order to recover mn2 from the f emr a secondary leaching unit is introduced to general emm production process fig 1 in the secondary leaching unit the mn2 is mixed with the introduced complexing agent and recovered by forming the stable and soluble complexes once the secondary leaching procedure completed the solution containing recovered mn2 is fed to the downstream purification unit and the remaining leaching residue is discharged to the manganese slag field with less available mn resource here our investigations are mainly focused on optimizing the secondary leaching unit targeting at process intensification 2 2 materials the raw f emr is provided by an emm company in guangxi china chemical compositions of the raw f emr are analyzed by x ray fluorescence xrf as shown in table s1 the f emr mainly consists of so3 sio2 cao fe2o3 and mno from x ray diffraction xrd patterns of f emr in fig 2 the mineralogical compositions

chemical reagents used in this work including ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta nitrilotriacetic acid nta citric acid ca sulfuric acid h2so4 and sodium hydroxide naoh are of analytical grade solutions are prepared using deionized water produced by water purification system hmc ws10 human corporation korea 2 3 experiments the experiments of leaching mn2 and nh4 n from f emr are performed using a stirring integrated leaching system as shown in fig 3 the beaker acts as the reaction vessel whereby the secondary leaching procedure is performed and accelerated by the magnetic stirrer system prior to systematically investigate effects of experimental conditions on the secondary leaching process the favorable complexing agent is determined under the initial operating condition afterwards experimental conditions including complexing agent concentration solid liquid ratio weight of solid volume of liquid stirring speed and leaching time are optimized to maximize the recovery efficiency of mn2 and nh4 n all experimental conditions for the following experimentations are tabulated in table 1 in order to quantitatively measure the performance of secondary leaching process efficiencies of mn2 and nh4 n are calculated with eqs 1 and 2 1 η mn 2 c mn 2 v l m ω mn 2 2 η nh 4 n c nh 4 n v l m ω nh 4 n where c mn 2 and c nh4 n are the concentrations of mn2 and nh4 n in the leachate respectively v l is the volume of leachate m is the weight of f emr used for secondary leaching ω mn 2 and ω nh4 n are the mass fractions of mn2 and nh4 n in the raw f emr and they are equal to 2 13 and 1 52 2 4 analysis methods the concentration of mn2 and nh4 n are respectively measured with the potassium periodate spectrophotometric method and the nessler s reagent spectrophotometry method using the uv vis visible spectrophotometer 722s general instrument co ltd china the crystal structure of samples i e raw f emr and leaching residues obtained from secondary leaching is analyzed by an x ray diffractometer xrd 6000 shimadzu corporation japan with cu kα radiation λ 0 154 nm operating at 40 kv and 40 ma all samples are scanned from 5 to 90 at a scan speed of 5 min with a step size of 0 02 the infrared spectra of the samples are obtained using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer nicolet 6700 thermo fisher scientific usa via the kbr pellet method the elemental composition of raw f emr is characterized by an x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf 1800 shimadzu corporation japan the morphology of samples is analyzed by a field emission scanning electron microscope quattro s thermo fisher scientific usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 complexing agent selection in order to identify a better complexing agent effects of three different complexing agents i e nta edta and ca are investigated on the leaching performance under the initial condition of solid liquid ratio 1 4 g ml complexing agent concentration 0 01 mol l and ph 7 concentrations of mn2 and nh4 n are measured after a leaching procedure of 15 min with the aim of comparing three different complexing agents a benchmark experiment is performed using pure deionized water instead of complexing agents presenting a mn2 concentration of 3080 81 mg l and a nh4 n concentration of 874 23 mg l as presented in fig 4 in terms of complexing agents both edta and nta show high mn2 concentration indicating their advantages in improving the recovery of mn2 from f emr similarly for complexing agent based leaching processes improvements are also observed on nh4 n concentrations i e 1028 08 mg l for nta 1001 15 mg l for edta and 974 23 mg l for ca although edta presents slightly better performance the nta is selected as it is biodegradable and environmental friendly 42 43 while achieving competitive leaching performance for both mn2 and nh4 n 3 2 optimization of leaching conditions 3 2 1 complexing agent concentration as nta has been identified as the favorable complexing agent for the secondary leaching its concentration is thereby investigated to discover the effect on mn2 and nh4 n recovery as shown in fig 5 the mn2 and nh4 n leaching efficiencies are generally improved with the increase of nta concentration it is supposed that the larger amount of nta is able to recover more mn2 and nh4 n from the raw f emr within the range of 0 015 to 0 025 mol l leaching efficiencies of mn2 and nh4 n tend to be flat and the significant improvement cannot be observed it indicated that leaching efficiencies do not increase much although the nta concentration has been almost doubled from 0 015 to 0 025 mol l therefore 0 015 mol l is a more reasonable choice for following experiments considering the trade off between nta concentration and potential recovery improvement 3 2 2 solid liquid ratio with an optimized nta concentration of 0 015 mol l leaching efficiencies of mn2 and nh4 n are studied under different solid liquid ratios as shown in fig 6 along the increased liquid fraction the leaching efficiency of mn2 increases remarkably at first and then decreased slightly with a peak observed under the solid liquid ratio of 1 4 g ml for nh4 n the leaching efficiency raises continuously when the solid liquid ratio is switching from 1 3 to 1 5 g ml and no valuable improvement can be observed when the solid liquid ratio is changing from 1 5 to 1 8 g ml based on above observations 1 4 and 1 5 g ml are two decent choices for the solid liquid ratio from the perspective of manganese production we prefer the higher mn2 leaching efficiency in the case of 1 4 g ml solid liquid ratio although nh4 n leaching efficiency presents a much higher value when the solid liquid ratio is set to 1 5 g ml therefore a solid liquid ratio of 1 4 g ml is fixed for the following optimization of experimental variables 3 2 3 stirring speed the stirring system is able to accelerate secondary leaching process and the stirring speeds are therefore studied to compare leaching efficiencies of mn2 and nh4 n when the speed of the magnetic stirrer reaches 400 rpm the leaching efficiency of manganese is 93 26 fig 7 and then it is approximately to be constant with the increase of stirring speed regarding nh4 n the leaching efficiency is generally increased along with stirring speed although the improvement is not significant as such the stirring speed is identified as 400 rpm since high manganese leaching efficiency is achieved by adopting a relative low stirring speed 3 2 4 leaching time in general maximal leaching efficiencies can be obtained by significantly extending the leaching time but a short leaching time is favorable if high leaching efficiencies can also be achieved as shown in fig 8 leaching efficiencies of mn2 and nh4 n show similar tendencies that they increase first and then keep steady with the extension of leaching time the leaching efficiency of manganese increased rapidly within the first 20 min and then the improvement is negligible when the leaching time is 20 min the leaching efficiencies of mn2 and nh4 n reach 97 06 and 28 47 respectively slight improvements can be observed on both leaching efficiencies of mn2 and nh4 n while leaching time is increased from 20 to 30 min therefore 20 min could be a better choice for the leaching time to achieve good leaching performance 3 3 analysis of leaching residue fig 9 shows the xrd patterns of the raw f emr and leaching residues from secondary leaching processes under different leaching conditions main mineralogical components of leaching residue are caso4 2h2o and sio2 after secondary leaching using nta diffraction peaks of nh4 2mn so4 2 mnso4 2h2o and nh4 2so4 in the leaching residue are weakened the results show that nta combined with mn2 and nh4 n in the secondary leaching to form a stable complex existing in the liquid phase which can further promote the leaching of nh4 2mn so4 2 mnso4 2h2o and nh4 2so4 fig 10 shows the ftir spectra of the raw f emr and leaching residues from secondary leaching processes vibrational spectra are collected on ftir spectrometer from 400 to 4000 cm 1 from fig 10 a c a broad peak is observed between 3527 cm 1 and 3393 cm 1 which could be attributed to the overlapping of various oh stretching vibrations while the absorption band at 1683 cm 1 is the h o h absorption spectrum 7 19 in addition to the bending vibration of so4 2 observed at 1108 cm 1 and 667 cm 1 peaks located at 778 and 445 cm 1 are respectively obtained by si o si bending and rocking 44 indicating that the raw f emr and leaching residues from secondary leaching mainly contain caso4 2h2o and sio2 the mno of the hydrated metal oxide mno2 absorption peaks is observed at 599 cm 1 1 the absorption spectrum at 1429 cm 1 represents the absorption spectrum of n h n and the peak is obviously widened at the nta leaching 45 the results show that the leaching of nh4 2mn so4 2 and mnso4 are enhanced by employing nta sem eds scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy images of raw f emr and leaching residues from secondary leaching processes are shown in fig 11 in terms of the raw f emr disordered morphology can be observed from fig 11 a part of cylindrical particles caso4 2h2o are randomly overlapped with irregularly shaped particles for leaching residue without using nta its structure is loose as observed in fig 11 b in addition irregular particles are significantly reduced and most of the leaching residues are presented in the columnar form under the nta case the results show that nta can modify the arrangement of leaching residue during the secondary leaching process brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analysis in table 2 presents a significantly large value for the nta case demonstrating the advantage of nta as the complexing agent to modify the structure of leaching residue particles during the secondary leaching 1 which also indicates the consistency between sem eds and bet analyses additional analytical analyses are provided in the supporting information 4 quantum chemistry based leaching mechanism due to the presence of multiple metal ions in the leaching residue it is not able to directly analyze the structure of product based on the amount of complexing agent recovered manganese and ammonia nitrogen therefore molecular dynamics analysis is performed by materials studio to explore the interaction between complexing agent and metal ions molecular structure of nta presented in fig 12 is first obtained by geometry optimization under universal force field uff as an organic polycarboxylic acid complexing agent nta can form mononuclear and polynuclear complexes during the complexation 36 as a complexing agent nta generally presents a stable cyclic structure 46 the coordinating atoms in nta are mainly derived from carboxyl groups and the negatively charged nta anion can form a multi coordination complex with metal cations represented as men as shown in table 3 in mononuclear complexes cations in the mononuclear double ligand complex are wrapped tightly and the structure is more stable the cations of the binuclear double ligand complex are more likely to exposed indicating its unstable structures the complexing agent product is geometrically optimized under uff and the optimized configuration presenting the lowest global capability is used as the initial structure the dmol3 module is used for energy calculation the stability of a complex is related to its binding energy simply the greater the binding energy the greater the stability of the chemical composition 47 49 table 4 shows the binding energy of the formed complexes among them the mononuclear double ligand complex shows the largest binding energy value reaching 21 174 99 kj mol indicating the most stable structure which is consistent with previous analyses through the above analysis of the structure of the cyclic complexing agent product it is found that the complexation reaction between nta and cations leads to complexation products with multiple ring structures among them the mononuclear double ligand multiple ring structure is the most stable one so it is speculated that nta and mn2 in f emr mainly form mononuclear polycyclic products fig 13 shows the reaction mechanism of leaching f emr enhanced by complexing agent the complexing agent is added to the reaction system forming a stable complex with mn2 released from the f emr which further improves the leaching efficiencies of mn2 and nh4 n 5 conclusion in this study three complexing agents of edta nta and ca are compared under neutral conditions for mn2 and nh4 n in terms of mn2 edta and nta present better recovery performance than ca while regarding nh4 n nta shows the best recovery performance followed by edta and ca considering both leaching performance and environmental aspect nta is adopted in this work to recover mn2 and nh4 n from f emr moreover the experimental conditions are optimized to improve leaching efficiency when the nta concentration is 0 015 mol l solid liquid ratio is 1 4 g ml stirring speed is 400 rpm and leaching time is 20 min the mn2 leaching efficiency reaches 97 06 and nh4 n leaching efficiency is 28 47 xrd and ftir analysis proves that the leaching of mn2 and nh4 n is enhanced with the utilization of nta and the sem eds results indicate the low content 1 for both mn2 and nh4 n in the leaching residue in addition with the aid of mechanism analysis it is discovered that nta and manganese ions in f emr can form a stable mononuclear multi ring product structure promoting the leaching of mn2 and nh4 n this work provides a new method for the harmless treatment of f emr by means of recovering manganese and ammonia nitrogen using the complexing agent further disposal of the leaching solution should be considered in future work the leaching solution obtained from the secondary leaching unit can be directed to the purifying unit where undesirable metals i e fe mg and al are removed by the chemical precipitation using sulfides such as sodium dimethyl dithiocarbamate sodium sulfide etc then the purified solution is clarified dosed with either selenite or sulfite and used in electrowinning to produce high quality electrolytic manganese while the recovery of ammonia nitrogen can potentially be utilized to make synthetic fertilizers for use in agriculture in addition decomplexation technologies such as photochemical oxidation electrochemical oxidation and photoelectrocatalytic oxidation can be employed to destroy metal organic complexes rendering the subsequent metal precipitation more efficient declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

nh4 n are measured after a leaching procedure of 15 min with the aim of comparing three different complexing agents a benchmark experiment is performed using pure deionized water instead of complexing agents presenting a mn2 concentration of 3080 81 mg l and a nh4 n concentration of 874 23 mg l as presented in fig 4 in terms of complexing agents both edta and nta show high mn2 concentration indicating their advantages in improving the recovery of mn2 from f emr similarly for complexing agent based leaching processes improvements are also observed on nh4 n concentrations i e 1028 08 mg l for nta 1001 15 mg l for edta and 974 23 mg l for ca although edta presents slightly better performance the nta is selected as it is biodegradable and environmental friendly 42 43 while achieving competitive leaching performance for both mn2 and nh4 n 3 2 optimization of leaching conditions 3 2 1 complexing agent concentration as nta has been identified as the favorable complexing agent for the secondary leaching its concentration is thereby investigated to discover the effect on mn2 and nh4 n recovery as shown in fig 5 the mn2 and nh4 n leaching efficiencies are generally improved with the increase of nta concentration it is supposed that the larger amount of nta is able to recover more mn2 and nh4 n from the raw f emr within the range of 0 015 to 0 025 mol l leaching efficiencies of mn2 and nh4 n tend to be flat and the significant improvement cannot be observed it indicated that leaching efficiencies do not increase much although the nta concentration has been almost doubled from 0 015 to 0 025 mol l therefore 0 015 mol l is a more reasonable choice for following experiments considering the trade off between nta concentration and potential recovery improvement 3 2 2 solid liquid ratio with an optimized nta concentration of 0 015 mol l leaching efficiencies of mn2 and nh4 n are studied under different solid liquid ratios as shown in fig 6 along the increased liquid fraction the leaching efficiency of mn2 increases remarkably at first and then decreased slightly with a peak observed under the solid liquid ratio of 1 4 g ml for nh4 n the leaching efficiency raises continuously when the solid liquid ratio is switching from 1 3 to 1 5 g ml and no valuable improvement can be observed when the solid liquid ratio is changing from 1 5 to 1 8 g ml based on above observations 1 4 and 1 5 g ml are two decent choices for the solid liquid ratio from the perspective of manganese production we prefer the higher mn2 leaching efficiency in the case of 1 4 g ml solid liquid ratio although nh4 n leaching efficiency presents a much higher value when the solid liquid ratio is set to 1 5 g ml therefore a solid liquid ratio of 1 4 g ml is fixed for the following optimization of experimental variables 3 2 3 stirring speed the stirring system is able to accelerate secondary leaching process and the stirring speeds are therefore studied to compare leaching efficiencies of mn2 and nh4 n when the speed of the magnetic stirrer reaches 400 rpm the leaching efficiency of manganese is 93 26 fig 7 and then it is approximately to be constant with the increase of stirring speed regarding nh4 n the leaching efficiency is generally increased along with stirring speed although the improvement is not significant as such the stirring speed is identified as 400 rpm since high manganese leaching efficiency is achieved by adopting a relative low stirring speed 3 2 4 leaching time in general maximal leaching efficiencies can be obtained by significantly extending the leaching time but a short leaching time is favorable if high leaching efficiencies can also be achieved as shown in fig 8 leaching efficiencies of mn2 and nh4 n show similar tendencies that they increase first and then keep steady with the extension of leaching time the leaching efficiency of manganese increased rapidly within the first 20 min and then the improvement is negligible when the leaching time is 20 min the leaching efficiencies of mn2 and nh4 n reach 97 06 and 28 47 respectively slight improvements can be observed on both leaching efficiencies of mn2 and nh4 n while leaching time is increased from 20 to 30 min therefore 20 min could be a better choice for the leaching time to achieve good leaching performance 3 3 analysis of leaching residue fig 9 shows the xrd patterns of the raw f emr and leaching residues from secondary leaching processes under different leaching conditions main mineralogical components of leaching residue are caso4 2h2o and sio2 after secondary leaching using nta diffraction peaks of nh4 2mn so4 2 mnso4 2h2o and nh4 2so4 in the leaching residue are weakened the results show that nta combined with mn2 and nh4 n in the secondary leaching to form a stable complex existing in the liquid phase which can further promote the leaching of nh4 2mn so4 2 mnso4 2h2o and nh4 2so4 fig 10 shows the ftir spectra of the raw f emr and leaching residues from secondary leaching processes vibrational spectra are collected on ftir spectrometer from 400 to 4000 cm 1 from fig 10 a c a broad peak is observed between 3527 cm 1 and 3393 cm 1 which could be attributed to the overlapping of various oh stretching vibrations while the absorption band at 1683 cm 1 is the h o h absorption spectrum 7 19 in addition to the bending vibration of so4 2 observed at 1108 cm 1 and 667 cm 1 peaks located at 778 and 445 cm 1 are respectively obtained by si o si bending and rocking 44 indicating that the raw f emr and leaching residues from secondary leaching mainly contain caso4 2h2o and sio2 the mno of the hydrated metal oxide mno2 absorption peaks is observed at 599 cm 1 1 the absorption spectrum at 1429 cm 1 represents the absorption spectrum of n h n and the peak is obviously widened at the nta leaching 45 the results show that the leaching of nh4 2mn so4 2 and mnso4 are enhanced by employing nta sem eds scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy images of raw f emr and leaching residues from secondary leaching processes are shown in fig 11 in terms of the raw f emr disordered morphology can be observed from fig 11 a part of cylindrical particles caso4 2h2o are randomly overlapped with irregularly shaped particles for leaching residue without using nta its structure is loose as observed in fig 11 b in addition irregular particles are significantly reduced and most of the leaching residues are presented in the columnar form under the nta case the results show that nta can modify the arrangement of leaching residue during the secondary leaching process brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analysis in table 2 presents a significantly large value for the nta case demonstrating the advantage of nta as the complexing agent to modify the structure of leaching residue particles during the secondary leaching 1 which also indicates the consistency between sem eds and bet analyses additional analytical analyses are provided in the supporting information 4 quantum chemistry based leaching mechanism due to the presence of multiple metal ions in the leaching residue it is not able to directly analyze the structure of product based on the amount of complexing agent recovered manganese and ammonia nitrogen therefore molecular dynamics analysis is performed by materials studio to explore the interaction between complexing agent and metal ions molecular structure of nta presented in fig 12 is first obtained by geometry optimization under universal force field uff as an organic polycarboxylic acid complexing agent nta can form mononuclear and polynuclear complexes during the complexation 36 as a complexing agent nta generally presents a stable cyclic structure 46 the coordinating atoms in nta are mainly derived from carboxyl groups and the negatively charged nta anion can form a multi coordination complex with metal cations represented as men as shown in table 3 in mononuclear complexes cations in the mononuclear double ligand complex are wrapped tightly and the structure is more stable the cations of the binuclear double ligand complex are more likely to exposed indicating its unstable structures the complexing agent product is geometrically optimized under uff and the optimized configuration presenting the lowest global capability is used as the initial structure the dmol3 module is used for energy calculation the stability of a complex is related to its binding energy simply the greater the binding energy the greater the stability of the chemical composition 47 49 table 4 shows the binding energy of the formed complexes among them the mononuclear double ligand complex shows the largest binding energy value reaching 21 174 99 kj mol indicating the most stable structure which is consistent with previous analyses through the above analysis of the structure of the cyclic complexing agent product it is found that the complexation reaction between nta and cations leads to complexation products with multiple ring structures among them the mononuclear double ligand multiple ring structure is the most stable one so it is speculated that nta and mn2 in f emr mainly form mononuclear polycyclic products fig 13 shows the reaction mechanism of leaching f emr enhanced by complexing agent the complexing agent is added to the reaction system forming a stable complex with mn2 released from the f emr which further improves the leaching efficiencies of mn2 and nh4 n 5 conclusion in this study three complexing agents of edta nta and ca are compared under neutral conditions for mn2 and nh4 n in terms of mn2 edta and nta present better recovery performance than ca while regarding nh4 n nta shows the best recovery performance followed by edta and ca considering both leaching performance and environmental aspect nta is adopted in this work to recover mn2 and nh4 n from f emr moreover the experimental conditions are optimized to improve leaching efficiency when the nta concentration is 0 015 mol l solid liquid ratio is 1 4 g ml stirring speed is 400 rpm and leaching time is 20 min the mn2 leaching efficiency reaches 97 06 and nh4 n leaching efficiency is 28 47 xrd and ftir analysis proves that the leaching of mn2 and nh4 n is enhanced with the utilization of nta and the sem eds results indicate the low content 1 for both mn2 and nh4 n in the leaching residue in addition with the aid of mechanism analysis it is discovered that nta and manganese ions in f emr can form a stable mononuclear multi ring product structure promoting the leaching of mn2 and nh4 n this work provides a new method for the harmless treatment of f emr by means of recovering manganese and ammonia nitrogen using the complexing agent further disposal of the leaching solution should be considered in future work the leaching solution obtained from the secondary leaching unit can be directed to the purifying unit where undesirable metals i e fe mg and al are removed by the chemical precipitation using sulfides such as sodium dimethyl dithiocarbamate sodium sulfide etc then the purified solution is clarified dosed with either selenite or sulfite and used in electrowinning to produce high quality electrolytic manganese while the recovery of ammonia nitrogen can potentially be utilized to make synthetic fertilizers for use in agriculture in addition decomplexation technologies such as photochemical oxidation electrochemical oxidation and photoelectrocatalytic oxidation can be employed to destroy metal organic complexes rendering the subsequent metal precipitation more efficient declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
